  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a common condition. At least 20% of the population suffer
      from IBS. The symptoms of abdominal pain, diarrhoea, constipation, bloating and difficulty
      with bowel motions are often disabling. Many of those affected are young and report a poor
      quality of life (QOL) to a degree that is similar to gut inflammatory conditions like
      ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease. Yet the impact of IBS on patients' lives is often
      underestimated. This is probably because unlike inflammatory bowel disease, in which the
      bowel is inflammed and bleeds, the bowel in IBS looks normal. Instead the problem is of
      abnormal functioning of the gut the cause of which is unknown.

      Currently therapy for IBS is limited and until recently therapy has focused on treating the
      symptoms to improve QOL primarily because the underlying mechanism of IBS is poorly
      understood. However as more processes are being implicated in IBS e.g. visceral
      hypersensitivity (excessive response to sensory stimuli within the gut), infection, immune
      activation, dysmotility and abnormal gut fermentation , the potential for new therapies looks
      promising. The evidence that gut bacteria play a role in inducing IBS symptoms is due to
      observations of an improvement of IBS symptoms with probiotic therapy (bacterial supplements)
      and antibiotic therapy.

      Patients with IBS are hypersensitive to colorectal distension compared with healthy controls.
      Studies carried out in our unit have shown that visceral pain thresholds in response to
      stress are lower in patients with IBS compared with healthy volunteers. This hypersensitivity
      is apparent in response to both a physical and chemical stimulus but the triggers to visceral
      hypersensitivity remain largely unknown. Animal models suggest roles for both host immune
      response and intestinal bacteria in the induction of visceral hypersensitivity. This proposal
      will focus on further exploration of the mechanisms underlying visceral hypersensitivity to
      direct future targeting of therapy.

      Previous independent studies showed that (a) bacteria reduce visceral hypersensitivity,
      (b)probiotic therapy can alter gut immune response and (c) gut sensation is affected by the
      type of immune cells in the gut. Our research proposal will investigate the relationship
      between gut bacteria, the immune system and the sensory gut nerves in order to understand how
      IBS symptoms are generated. This understanding will be the critical for effective future drug
      treatment.

      This research will study

      1) probiotic−induced changes in visceral hypersensitivity and immune activity The effects of
      probiotic therapy will be assessed in a randomised placebo−controlled study. Subjects will be
      recruited prospectively from outpatient clinics. A flow chart of the study is shown in
      appendix 1 of the protocol. Patient selection. IBS patients will be selected according to
      inclusion and exclusion criteria.

      Disease severity will be determined at enrolment with a validated IBS symptom questionnaire.

      Questionnaires to exclude psychiatric illness: The well−validated Hospital Anxiety Depression
      Score (HADS)questionniaire will be used to identify patients with anxiety and depression. A
      SCL−90 questionnaire will also be used to assess the psychological profile of patients as
      this may have an impact on the response to therapy.

      Probiotic therapy. Patients will be randomised to receive either VSL#3 (450 billion
      lyophilized bacteria/sachet) twice daily for 4 weeks or a placebo powder containing starch
      but no bacteria. VSL#3 was selected for use in this study because (a) it contains three
      different Bifidobacteria strains (in addition to lactobaccilli and streptococci) and the
      limited evidence available Bifidobacteria as the most effective probiotics in IBS 10; (b)it
      induces IL−10 production by intestinal DC 27 and, in pouchitis studies, stimulated IL−10
      production in vivo 38; IBS has been associated with a deficiency in IL−10 production; (c)
      studies from one group have yielded promising results with this particular probiotic
      preparation.

        1. Assessing the clinical response to therapy

             -  Physiological response to probiotic therapy: Rectal sensitivity will be assessed at
                baseline and at day 28 of therapy. Rectal sensitivity to pressure and pain will be
                assessed with Barostat device and electrical stimulation respectively. Barostat
                device has been used in many other studies as a measure of sensation to pressure.
                Electrical stimulation is currently used in clinical practice. Equipment for both
                tests is currently in use at out physiology laboratory.

             -  Symptomatic response to probiotic therapy: IBS symptom scores will be made at
                baseline and at d28 of therapy. The three symptoms of IBS will be assessed to
                determine response to therapy: abdominal pain/discomfort, bloating/ distension and
                bowel movements, each scored on an ordinal scale (Likert scale; maximum score 7)
                and on a 100mm visual analogue scale (VAS; maximum score 100). A composite score
                with the sums of the 3 cardinal symptoms will also be calculated for each patient
                (Likert scale maximum score 21) (VAS; maximum score 300).

             -  Quality of life (QOL) with probiotic therapy: The SF−36 Heath−related QOL
                questionnaire, and the IBS QOL questionnaire will be administered at baseline and
                at day 28. This will assess the impact of IBS symptoms on the QOL and any changes
                following probiotic therapy. Follow−up: Patients will be contacted at 6 months to
                reassess symptom scores and QOL and determine longer−term impact of therapy.

        2. Assessing Immunological response to probiotic therapy. Venepuncture will be performed
           for collection of blood immune cells at baseline and day 28. Colonic biopsies will be
           collected via a flexible sigmoidoscopy at entry baseline and at day 28 following the
           physiological tests. The biopsies will be use for analysis of cytokine production and to
           a limited phenotypic analysis of colonic immune cells (DC) with markers to be selected
           on the basis of data from an on−going cross−sectional study looking at DC in IBS
           compared to controls. Full analysis of blood DC will be performed at each time point.
           Changes in DC populations and cytokine production will be secondary endpoints of the
           study.
