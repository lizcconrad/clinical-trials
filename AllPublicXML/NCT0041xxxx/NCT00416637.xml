  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      RATIONALE: Monoclonal antibodies, such as bevacizumab, can block tumor growth in different
      ways. Some find tumor cells and kill them or carry tumor-killing substances to them. Others
      interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Bevacizumab may also stop the
      growth of tumor cells by blocking blood flow to the tumor .

      PURPOSE: This phase I trial is studying how well bevacizumab works in treating patients with
      advanced solid tumors.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Determine whether anti-vascular epidermal growth factor (VEGF) treatment comprising
           bevacizumab causes changes in endothelial cell function, as measured by brachial
           reactivity, and changes in nitric oxide (NOx), as measured by plasma/urinary/exhaled NOx
           levels, in patients with advanced solid tumors.

        -  Determine whether anti-VEGF-related changes in blood pressure correlate with changes in
           brachial reactivity and NOx levels.

      Secondary

        -  Evaluate anti-angiogenic effects of bevacizumab in neovascular tissue in the wound
           angiogenesis model.

        -  Correlate inhibition of wound angiogenesis with changes in VEGF-receptor 2
           phosphorylation status and changes in NOx synthase expression.

        -  Describe the mean and associated variability of other plasma and urine markers known to
           be associated with vascular reactivity, endothelial function, and/or tumor angiogenesis.

        -  Describe, preliminarily, whether these changes correlate with changes in blood pressure,
           brachial reactivity, NOx levels, or wound angiogenesis.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive bevacizumab IV over 30-90 minutes on days 1, 15, and 29. After the
      third dose of bevacizumab, patients may receive additional bevacizumab in combination with
      chemotherapy in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 35 patients will be accrued for this study.
