      The main objective of the trial is to explore the safety and biological activity of NGR-hTNF.
      The safety will be established by clinical and laboratory assessment. The biological activity
      will be evaluated by DCE-MRI with contrast media.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients &gt;18 years old with proven advanced solid tumors not amenable to any clinical
             improvement by current standard treatments. Tumors recognized to be highly
             vascularized (e.g. renal, colon thyroid and head and neck cancers), will be included.

          -  ECOG Performance status 0 - 2

          -  Patients may have had prior therapy providing the following conditions are met:

               -  Chemo, radio, hormonal or immunotherapy: wash-out period of 28 days

               -  Surgery: wash-out period of 14 days

          -  Adequate baseline bone marrow, hepatic and renal function, defined as follows:

          -  Neutrophils &gt; 1.5 x 10^9/L and platelets &gt; 100 x 10^9/L

          -  Bilirubin &lt; 1.5 x ULN

          -  AST and/or ALT &lt; 2.5 x ULN in absence of liver metastases

          -  AST and/or ALT &lt; 5 x ULN in presence of liver metastases

          -  Serum creatinine &lt; 1.5 x ULN

          -  Absence of any conditions in which hypervolemia and its consequences (e.g. increased
             stroke volume, elevated blood pressure) or haemodilution could represent a risk for
             the patient (reference appendix &quot;Technical data sheet human albumin&quot;)

          -  Normal cardiac function and absence of uncontrolled hypertension

          -  Patients must give written informed consent to participate in the study

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Concurrent anticancer therapy

          -  Patients may not receive any other investigational agents while on study

          -  Clinical signs of CNS involvement

          -  Patients with active or uncontrolled systemic disease/infections or with serious
             illness or medical conditions, which is incompatible with the protocol

          -  Known hypersensitivity/allergic reaction to human albumin preparations or to any of
             the excipients

          -  Any psychological, familial, sociological or geographical condition potentially
             hampering compliance with the study protocol

          -  Pregnancy or lactation. Patients - both males and females - with reproductive
             potential (i.e. menopausal for less than 1-year and not surgically sterilized) must
             practice effective contraceptive measures throughout the study. Women of childbearing
             potential must provide a negative pregnancy test (serum or urine) within 14 days prior
             to registration.
