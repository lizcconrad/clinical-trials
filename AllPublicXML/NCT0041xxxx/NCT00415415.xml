  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Coronary heart disease (CHD) is the leading cause of deaths that are related to
      cardiovascular disease in the United States, and Mississippi's CHD mortality rate is the
      highest in the nation. This study will examine data from the Jackson Heart Study to determine
      the effect of socioeconomic status and psychosocial factors on CHD risk in African Americans
      in Mississippi.

    <textblock>
      CHD is a disease that is characterized by narrowing of the coronary arteries that supply
      blood to the heart. As a result, insufficient amounts of oxygen and nutrients reach the
      heart, which can cause chest pain or heart attack. Studies have shown that people's
      socioeconomic status is associated with their health, and that African Americans experience
      the highest rates of heart disease in the U.S. The Jackson Heart Study (JHS) is currently
      being conducted in Jackson, Mississippi, and is studying the factors that influence the
      development of cardiovascular disease in African American men and women. This study will
      examine data from the JHS to determine the effect of socioeconomic status and psychosocial
      factors on CHD risk in African Americans in Mississippi.

      This study will recruit participants from the JHS only. Participants will report to the study
      site at least once for 4.5 hours for baseline measurements. Visits will include measurements
      of body size and blood pressure, an electrocardiogram, an echocardiogram, an ultrasound of
      the carotid artery, blood and urine collection, a lung function test, and interviews
      regarding health status and sociocultural aspects of life. Follow-up evaluations will occur 5
      and 10 years after starting the study. Outcomes will include self-report and
      electrocardiogram-defined CHD, as well as measures of various social and psychological
      factors.
