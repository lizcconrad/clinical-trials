      Primary Objectives:

        -  To collect accurate and reliable respiration-induced anatomic structure motion data
           using four-dimensional (4-D) imaging technology.

        -  To analyze these data to study respiration-induced variations and patterns in variations
           of positions, shapes and volumes of tumors and normal anatomic structures in the thorax
           and abdomen over a breathing cycle, from one breathing cycle to the next, day-to-day and
           over the course of radiotherapy.

        -  To assess dosimetric and potential clinical consequences of respiratory motion in the
           current practice of radiotherapy through preclinical treatment simulation (treatment
           planning) studies.

        -  To quantify the potential consequences of explicitly accounting for respiration-induced
           motion on dose distributions and outcome (tumor control probabilities and normal tissue
           complication probabilities) through preclinical treatment simulation studies.

      Secondary Objectives:

        -  To investigate the feasibility of using patient training to regulate patient breathing
           and improve the quality of images and to stratify patients for their eligibility for
           respiratory-correlated imaging and radiotherapy and for the implementation of various
           strategies for mitigation of respiratory-induced motion.

        -  To assess the degree of correlation of the marker (or internal anatomic structure such
           as diaphragm) being tracked as surrogate of breathing with the motion of structures and
           the intra-fraction and inter-fraction reproducibility of such correlation.

        -  To quantify the effects of radiation therapy on the patterns of respiratory-induced
           motion of structures through preclinical treatment simulation studies.

        -  To compare various strategies for either accounting for or mitigating
           respiration-induced motion in the planning and delivery of radiation therapy.

      You will be taking part in this study while you receive radiotherapy treatment for your
      tumor.

      You will be trained to breathe in a certain way that will help the study staff to perform
      motion CT scans. You may be asked to breathe normally, or hold your breath, or breathe while
      following a TV monitor. On the monitor, you will be viewing your breathing trace and using
      the trace to regulate your breathing as instructed by the health professionals.

      While you are in the right position for the scan, the study staff will perform motion CT
      scans. A total of up to 12 scanning sessions will be held over your entire course of
      radiotherapy. The first scanning session may last from 45 to 90 minutes, but later sessions
      may be shorter. These CT scans are separate from the routine CT scans you may receive as part
      of regular radiation treatment planning.

      Scans may be taken at various periods of time. The scans can be taken one right after
      another, or with a short separation between them. One scan can be taken on the first day, and
      the next scan on the next day, or up to a week later.

      By looking at the scans, researchers can better understand how your tumor and other organs
      move from breath to breath, from day to day, and from week to week.

      This is an investigational study. About 210 patients with the same tumor location as you will
      take part in this study. All will be enrolled at M. D. Anderson.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients with pathological diagnosis of cancer in the thorax or abdomen.

          2. Patients must be planned to have radiation therapy delivered over at least 4 weeks (a
             minimum standard duration of curative radiotherapy).

          3. Patients must be able to lie flat for the duration of the CT image acquisition
             sessions.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        1. Patients who are neither able to breathe nor hold breath in a regular and reproducible
        manner will be removed from the study as being ineligible. Breathing or breath-holding
        regularity determination will be based on respiration traces acquired with the RPM system.
