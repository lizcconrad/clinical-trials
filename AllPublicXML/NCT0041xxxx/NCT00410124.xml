    <measure>Progressive Free Survival (PFS) in Patients Who Receive RAD001 Plus Best Supportive Care(BSC) Versus Patients Who Receive Matching Placebo Plus BSC</measure>
    <time_frame>Time from randomization to dates of disease progression, death from any cause or last tumor assessment reported between date of first patient randomized until 28Feb2008 cut of date.</time_frame>
    <description>Progression Free survival is defined as the time from randomization to the date of first documented disease progression or death from any cause. The primary statistical analysis of PFS was based on central radiological assessments using a one-sided stratified log-rank test. Radiological assessments: every 8 weeks (+/-1 week) during the first year and every 12 weeks (+/- 1 week) during the second year and thereafter and at the end of the study. Kaplan-Meier methodology was used to estimate the median PFS for each treatment group.</description>

    <measure>Best Overall Response Rate in Patients Who Receive RAD001 Plus BSC Versus Matching Placebo Plus BSC</measure>
    <time_frame>Time from randomization to dates of disease progression, death from any cause or last tumor assessment reported, between date of first patient randomized until 28Feb2008 cutoff date</time_frame>
    <description>The Best Overall Response rate (BOR) is defined as the percentage of patients having achieved confirmed Complete Response + Partial Response. Complete Response (CR) = at least two determinations of CR at least 4 weeks apart before progression. • Partial response (PR) = at least two determinations of PR or better at least 4 weeks apart before progression. Radiological assessments: every 8 weeks (+/-1 week) during the first year and every 12 weeks (+/- 1 week) during the second year and thereafter and at the end of the study.</description>

    <measure>Analysis of Time to Definitive Deterioration of the Global Health Status/QoL Scale(QL) Scores of the EORTC QLQ-30 Questionnaire by at Least 10 Percent Using Kaplan Meier Method, by Treatment.</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and every 28 days under treatment and at discontinuation from RAD001&quot; until 28Feb2008 cutoff date</time_frame>
    <description>The European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) Quality of Life Questionnaire (QLQ) contains 30 items. These include a global health status/QoL scale, five functional scales, three symptom scales, and six single items. Global health status / QoL scale (QL), consisting of 2 questions each scored from 1 (very poor) to 7 (excellent), and with possible scores ranging from 2 to 14. Higher score indicates better functioning. Definitive deterioration by at least 10% is defined as a decrease in score by at least 10% compared to baseline, with no increase above this threshold observed during the course of the study. A single measure reporting a decrease of at least 10% is considered definitive only if it is the last one available for the patient. Time to definitive deterioration is the number of days between the date of randomization and date of assessment at which definitive deterioration is seen.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline and every 28 days under treatment and at discontinuation from RAD001&quot; until 28Feb2008 cutoff date</time_frame>
    <description>The Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy - Kidney Symptom Index, Disease Related Symptoms (FKSI-DRS) is a set of items to assess symptoms experienced by patients with advanced kidney cancer. These symptoms include fatigue, pain, weight loss, dyspnea, cough, fever and hematuria. There were 4 response categories (1=Not at all, 2= A little, 3=Quite a bit, 4=Very much), sum of item responses can range from 0 to 36. &quot;0&quot;= severely symptomatic patient and the highest score is an asymptomatic patient. Definitive deterioration of the FKSI-DRS score was defined as a decrease by at least 2 units compared to baseline, with no later increase above this threshold observed during the study. A single measure reporting a decrease of at least 2 units was considered definitive only if it is the last one available for the patient. Time to definitive deterioration is the number of days between the date of randomization and the date of the assessment at which definitive deterioration is seen.</description>

        <title>Progressive Free Survival (PFS) in Patients Who Receive RAD001 Plus Best Supportive Care(BSC) Versus Patients Who Receive Matching Placebo Plus BSC</title>
        <description>Progression Free survival is defined as the time from randomization to the date of first documented disease progression or death from any cause. The primary statistical analysis of PFS was based on central radiological assessments using a one-sided stratified log-rank test. Radiological assessments: every 8 weeks (+/-1 week) during the first year and every 12 weeks (+/- 1 week) during the second year and thereafter and at the end of the study. Kaplan-Meier methodology was used to estimate the median PFS for each treatment group.</description>

Patients were instructed to take two tablets (5 mg each) by mouth every day. Tablets were to be taken one tablet after another with a glass of water, at the same time each day in a fasting state or with a light fat-free meal. If disease progression occurred at data cutoff of 28Feb2008, patients were unblinded and if they were receiving RAD001, they would discontinue the study. Otherwise, they would be given the option to continue in the extension open label phase of 2 tablets of RAD001 5mg by mouth every day.</description>

        <title>Analysis of Time to Definitive Deterioration of the Global Health Status/QoL Scale(QL) Scores of the EORTC QLQ-30 Questionnaire by at Least 10 Percent Using Kaplan Meier Method, by Treatment.</title>
        <description>The European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) Quality of Life Questionnaire (QLQ) contains 30 items. These include a global health status/QoL scale, five functional scales, three symptom scales, and six single items. Global health status / QoL scale (QL), consisting of 2 questions each scored from 1 (very poor) to 7 (excellent), and with possible scores ranging from 2 to 14. Higher score indicates better functioning. Definitive deterioration by at least 10% is defined as a decrease in score by at least 10% compared to baseline, with no increase above this threshold observed during the course of the study. A single measure reporting a decrease of at least 10% is considered definitive only if it is the last one available for the patient. Time to definitive deterioration is the number of days between the date of randomization and date of assessment at which definitive deterioration is seen.</description>

Global health status / QoL scale (QL), consisting of 2 questions each scored from 1 (very poor) to 7 (excellent), and with possible scores ranging from 2 to 14. Higher score indicates better functioning. Definitive deterioration by at least 10% is defined as a decrease in score by at least 10% compared to baseline, with no increase above this threshold observed during the course of the study. A single measure reporting a decrease of at least 10% is considered definitive only if it is the last one available for the patient. Time to definitive deterioration is the number of days between the date of randomization and date of assessment at which definitive deterioration is seen.</description>

        <title>Time to Definitive Deterioration of the FKS-DRS Risk Score by at Least 2 Score Units Using Kaplan-Meier Method, by Treatment.</title>
        <description>The Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy – Kidney Symptom Index, Disease Related Symptoms (FKSI-DRS) is a set of items to assess symptoms experienced by patients with advanced kidney cancer. These symptoms include fatigue, pain, weight loss, dyspnea, cough, fever and hematuria. There were 4 response categories (1=Not at all, 2= A little, 3=Quite a bit, 4=Very much), sum of item responses can range from 0 to 36. &quot;0&quot;= severely symptomatic patient and the highest score is an asymptomatic patient. Definitive deterioration of the FKSI-DRS score was defined as a decrease by at least 2 units compared to baseline, with no later increase above this threshold observed during the study. A single measure reporting a decrease of at least 2 units was considered definitive only if it is the last one available for the patient. Time to definitive deterioration is the number of days between the date of randomization and the date of the assessment at which definitive deterioration is seen.</description>

Patients were instructed to take two tablets (5 mg each) by mouth every day. Tablets were to be taken one tablet after another with a glass of water, at the same time each day in a fasting state or with a light fat-free meal. If disease progression occurred at data cutoff of 28Feb2008, patients were unblinded and if they were receiving RAD001, they would discontinue the study. Otherwise, they would be given the option to continue in the extension open label phase of 2 tablets of RAD001 5mg by mouth every day.</description>
