  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Safety and dosimetry of CardioPET™ will be evaluated in normal healthy volunteers and CAD
      subjects both male and female between the ages of 50-85. Nine normal controls will undergo
      repeated whole body imaging for biodistribution and dosimetry estimation. Six other normal
      healthy subjects will undergo heart imaging only. Six CAD subjects will undergo heart imaging
      only.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      CardioPET™ is a modified fatty acid (MFA) that closely resembles naturally-occurring free
      fatty acids (FFAs) in the human body.

      Study Procedures:
