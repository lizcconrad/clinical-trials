    <textblock>
      In patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) who respond to antipsychotic treatment of psychosis
      and/or agitation/aggression, the relapse risk after discontinuation is not established. AD
      patients with psychosis and/or agitation/aggression receive 16 weeks of open risperidone
      treatment (Phase A). Responders are then randomized, double-blind, to one of three arms in
      Phase B: (1) continuation risperidone for 32 weeks, (2) risperidone for 16 weeks followed by
      placebo for 16 weeks, (3) placebo for 32 weeks. The primary outcome is time to relapse of
      psychosis/agitation.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This multicenter study (6 academic sites and 2 non-academic sites) involves treating AD
      patients (assisted living or nursing home patients, and outpatients) using an atypical
      antipsychotic, risperidone. In Phase A, 180 AD patients with psychosis and/or
      agitation/aggression receive open treatment with risperidone for 16 weeks. Responders are
      randomized, double-blind, to one of three arms in Phase B: (1) continuation risperidone for
      the next 32 weeks, (2) risperidone for the next 16 weeks followed by placebo for 16 weeks, or
      (3) placebo for the next 32 weeks. The primary hypothesis is that in the first 16 weeks of
      Phase B, relapse risk will be lower with continuation risperidone (Arms 1 + 2) compared to
      discontinuation on placebo (Arm 3). The secondary hypothesis is that in the second 16 weeks
      of Phase B, relapse risk will be lower with continuation risperidone (Arm 1) compared to
      discontinuation on placebo (Arm 2). For both randomized time periods, the proportions who
      relapse will be compared for interpretive support. This design provides useful data on the
      efficacy and side effects of longer term treatment with risperidone, and, in particular,
      critical information about the time to relapse and likelihood of relapse in patients switched
      from risperidone to placebo. This information is essential to guide the clinician toward
      optimal use of such medications in one of the most challenging types of patients: the AD
      patient with psychosis and/or agitation/aggression. The results of this study will also help
      to address Federal regulations urging early antipsychotic discontinuation in nursing homes.

    <time_frame>0-16 weeks in Phase B (16-32 weeks in study)</time_frame>
    <description>A relapse occurred in Phase B (post-randomization) if both of the following criteria were met:
Increase in the Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI) core score of 30% or more OR a 5-point increase from the baseline NPI score at the end of Phase A
A score of 6 (much worse) or 7 (very much worse) on the Clinical Global Impression-Change (CGI-C) at any visit.</description>

    <measure>Mini Mental State Exam (MMSE)</measure>
    <time_frame>Phase B, weeks 1-16 (study weeks 16-32)</time_frame>
    <description>The MMSE assesses cognition. Scores range from 0-30, with higher scores indicating better cognition. For each subject, the change in MMSE between week 16 and baseline (randomization) was calculated by subtraction, so that a positive value indicates an increase in MMSE over time.</description>

    <measure>Treatment Emergent Symptoms Scale (TESS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Phase B, weeks 1-16 (study weeks 16-32)</time_frame>
    <description>The Treatment Emergent Symptom Scale (TESS) assesses 26 somatic symptoms. Total scores range from 0-26, with a score of 0 or 1 for each item. Higher scores indicate more somatic symptoms. For each subject, the change in TESS between week 16 and baseline (randomization) was calculated by subtraction, so that a positive value indicates an increase in TESS over time.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Extrapyramidal Signs (EPS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Phase B, weeks 1-16 (study weeks 16-32)</time_frame>
    <description>Extrapyramidal signs, also known as Parkinsonian signs, refer to signs of tremor, rigidity, and bradykinesia (slowed movement) that are seen in Parkinson's disease. Assessment of extrapyramidal signs (EPS) were made with the use of the Simpson-Angus scale (which ranges from 1-40) with higher scores indicating more extrapyramidal signs. For each subject, the change in EPS between week 16 and baseline (randomization) was calculated by subtraction, so that a positive value indicates an increase in EPS over time.</description>

    <measure>AIMS</measure>
    <time_frame>Phase B, weeks 1-16 (study weeks 16-32)</time_frame>
    <description>The Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale (AIMS) assesses signs of tardive dyskinesia, a movement disorder that can occur with prolonged use of antipsychotic medication. The AIMS score ranges from 0 to 35, with higher scores indicating more severe symptoms. For each subject, the change in AIMS score between week 16 and randomization was calculated by subtraction, so that a positive value indicates an increase in AIMS over time.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Physical Self-Maintenance Scale (PSMS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Phase B, weeks 1-16 (study weeks 16-32)</time_frame>
    <description>Physical Self-Maintenance Scale, which ranges from 1 to 30, with higher scores indicating WORSE functioning. For each subject, the change in PSMS between week 16 and randomization was calculated by subtraction, so that a positive value indicates an increase in PSMS (worse functioning) over time.</description>
