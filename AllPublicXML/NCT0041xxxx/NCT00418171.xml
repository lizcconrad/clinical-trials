        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients newly treated for schizophrenia and those receiving continuing treatment will
             be eligible if the treating psychiatrist is ready to initiate a new antipsychotic
             medication, and would consider using either ziprasidone or olanzapine as an
             appropriate therapy.

          -  Male and female patients who meet all criteria listed below are eligible to be
             enrolled in this study:

          -  Diagnosed with schizophrenia

          -  Willing to provide information on at least one alternate contact person for study
             staff to contact regarding patient's whereabouts, should the patient be
             lost-to-follow-up over the course of the study

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Progressive fatal disease of a life expectancy which prohibits them from participating
             in a one year research study

          -  Previously randomized to study medication and enrolled in this study
