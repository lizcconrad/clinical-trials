      The purpose of this clinical study is to determine, in a controlled fashion, the ability of
      Topical AmphiMatrix formulation with Nitroglycerin (MQX-503) to improve the patient's health
      assessment as indicated by patient and physician assessments, decrease the frequency of
      Raynaud's events, decrease the duration of Raynaud's events, and decrease the symptoms (pain,
      tingling, numbness) in the fingers of Raynaud's patients. The study will include patients
      with moderate to severe primary Raynaud's phenomenon and with Raynaud's phenomenon secondary
      to autoimmune diseases such as scleroderma.
