      RATIONALE: Questionnaires that measure the ability of older patients to think, learn,
      remember, and make judgments and carry out daily activities may improve the ability to plan
      treatment for patients with cancer.

      PURPOSE: This clinical trial is studying ways to assess older patients with cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Determine the feasibility of administration of the geriatric assessment in elderly
           patients with cancer.

        -  Determine the percentage of patients able to complete the self-administered portion of
           the geriatric assessment without assistance.

        -  Determine the length of time necessary to complete the geriatric assessment.

        -  Determine the variance and number of missing items.

        -  Assess patient satisfaction with the questionnaire by identifying items that are
           distressing or difficult to comprehend.

        -  Assess the percentage of geriatric assessments that contain all three of the following
           items: Timed Up and Go Assessment, Blessed Orientation-Memory-Concentration Test, and
           healthcare professional-rated Karnofsky performance status.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the proportion of patients who are able to complete the self-report portion of
           the questionnaire without assistance and the length of time needed to complete the
           geriatric assessment within patients of various sociodemographic factors and educational
           status.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to age (65 to 69
      years vs 70 years and over).

      Patients undergo assessments of cognition using the Blessed Orientation-Memory-Concentration
      Test; functional status using the Timed Up and Go Assessment (measures physical mobility);
      and performance status using the healthcare professional-rated Karnofsky performance scale.
      These assessments are performed by healthcare personnel. Body mass index and the percentage
      of unintentional weight loss and the number of falls in the past 6 months are also assessed.

      Patients also complete the following self-administered questionnaires: Instrumental
      Activities of Daily Living (measures level of functioning and need for services); Activities
      of Daily Living (measures higher levels of physical functioning); Karnofsky Self-Reported
      Performance Rating Scale (related to survival and clinically significant illness); Physical
      Health Section of the Older American Resources and Services Questionnaire (measures
      comorbidity and the impact on daily activities); Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale;
      Medical Outcomes Study (MOS) Social Activity Limitations Measure (measures the impact of
      cancer on patients' social functioning); and MOS Social Support Survey Emotional/Information
      and Tangible Subscales (measures perceived availability of social support).

      Patients then begin planned treatment.

    <description>Patients undergo assessments of cognition and performance status using the healthcare professional-rated Karnofsky performance scale. These assessments are performed by healthcare personnel. Body mass index and the percentage of unintentional weight loss and the number of falls in the past 6 months are also assessed.
Patients also complete self-administered questionnaires that measure level of functioning and need for services. It also includes questionnaires that measure higher levels of physical functioning, performance related to survival and clinically significant illness and measures of comorbidity and the impact on daily activities. Lastly, questionnaires are administered to measure the impact of cancer on patients' social functioning and perceived availability of social support.
Patients then begin planned treatment.</description>
