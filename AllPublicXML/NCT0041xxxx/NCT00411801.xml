  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Prior to the use of plasma products, thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) was usually a
      fatal condition. During plasma exchange therapy, patients need transfusion plasma that is
      blood group specific. Transfusing a patient with an incorrect blood group may have fatal
      consequences. Uniplas is a universally applicable human plasma, which can be administered
      irrespective of the patient's blood group. This study will test the safety and efficacy of
      Uniplas in comparison to cryosupernatant plasma in treatment of patients with TTP.

    <time_frame>Baseline to Month 1</time_frame>
    <description>A CR was defined as a platelet count &gt; 150 x 10^9/L on 2 consecutive days, and a decrease of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) to within 1.25 times the upper limit of the normal range, and a resolution of previous neurological symptoms, and no new neurological symptoms. A PR was defined as at least a 2-fold increase in platelet count from baseline which is &gt; 50 x 10^9/L. A NR was defined as a &lt; 2-fold increase in platelet count, or a platelet count &lt; 50 x 10^9/L, or severe red blood cell (RBC) fragmentation, or the development of new neurological symptoms, or no improvement in neurological status as defined by the level of consciousness. A TR was defined as achievement of a complete or partial response which then deteriorated, defined by a 50% decrease in peak platelet count, or neurological deterioration, or a 100% increase in nadir LDH level, or severe RBC fragmentation.</description>

    <description>The percentage of participants with a CR, PR, NR, or TR, as their best clinical response during the study, is reported. A CR was defined as a platelet count &gt; 150 x 10^9/L on 2 consecutive days, and a decrease of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) to within 1.25 times the upper limit of the normal range, and a resolution of previous neurological symptoms, and no new neurological symptoms. A PR was defined as at least a 2-fold increase in platelet count from baseline which is &gt; 50 x 10^9/L. A NR was defined as a &lt; 2-fold increase in platelet count, or a platelet count &lt; 50 x 10^9/L, or severe red blood cell (RBC) fragmentation, or the development of new neurological symptoms, or no improvement in neurological status as defined by the level of consciousness.

    <description>Participants will receive Uniplas intravenously in 4 cycles of 7 to 9 days each for 1 month. The first cycle will consist of 1.5 plasma volume exchanges (= 75 mL/kg) for 3 consecutive days, followed by a minimum of 4 and a maximum of 6 daily single volume plasma exchanges (= 50 mL/kg). Subsequent treatment will depend upon the response of the participant to the first cycle, as assessed by a blinded assessor.</description>
