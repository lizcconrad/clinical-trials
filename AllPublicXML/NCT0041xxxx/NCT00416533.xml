      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as docetaxel, doxorubicin, and prednisone, work
      in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by
      stopping them from dividing. Giving more than one drug (combination chemotherapy) may kill
      more tumor cells.

      PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well giving docetaxel, doxorubicin, and
      prednisone together works in treating patients with advanced prostate cancer that has not
      responded to hormone therapy.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Assess prostate specific antigen response rate to docetaxel, doxorubicin hydrochloride,
           and prednisone in patients with hormone-refractory advanced prostate cancer.

      Secondary

        -  Assess if treatment with docetaxel, doxorubicin hydrochloride, and prednisone will
           improve health-related quality of life of these patients.

        -  Assess the toxicity of docetaxel, doxorubicin hydrochloride, and prednisone.

        -  Assess response rate in measurable disease.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive docetaxel IV over 1 hour on day 1, doxorubicin hydrochloride IV
      over 15 minutes on days 1 and 8, and oral prednisone once daily on days 1-21. Treatment
      repeats every 21 days for at least 3 courses in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      Quality of life is assessed at baseline, on day 1 of each course, after completion of 3
      courses, and at disease progression.

      After completing study treatment, patients are followed every 6 months for 1 year.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 47 patients will be accrued for this study.
