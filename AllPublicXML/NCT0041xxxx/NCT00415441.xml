    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate whether a physiotherapy program reduces pain and
      improves disability and quality-of-life in people with chronic shoulder pain.

      The main study hypotheses are that (i) A 10-week physiotherapy treatment will result in
      significantly greater reductions in pain and disability than placebo treatment in individuals
      with chronic shoulder pain (ii) Improvements in pain and disability following a 10-week
      physiotherapy treatment will be maintained at a 3-month follow-up.

      Chronic rotator cuff pathology (CRCP) is a common cause of musculoskeletal morbidity in the
      community. Physiotherapy is often the first line of management for this condition. However,
      the effectiveness of physiotherapy for CRCP has not been well studied. Thus this project
      primarily aims to investigate the effect of a multimodality physiotherapy program to treat
      CRCP where effect is measured in terms of pain, disability and health-related quality of
      life. The secondary aim is to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of physiotherapy as a treatment
      for CRCP.

      placebo physiotherapy

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  symptoms of pain in shoulder for &gt; 3 months;

          -  average movement pain &gt; 3 on a 10 cm visual analogue scale;

          -  aged â‰¥ 18 years;

          -  able to understand written and spoken English.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  severe pain at rest, defined as &gt; 7 on a visual analogue scale;

          -  global restriction of shoulder movements;

          -  systemic inflammatory joint disease;

          -  x-ray evidence of shoulder osteoarthritis or fracture;

             intervention in past 2 weeks.
