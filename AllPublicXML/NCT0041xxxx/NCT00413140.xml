      Background Chronic airway inflammation is present in cystic fibrosis. Non-invasive
      inflammometry may be useful in disease management.

      Objective We studied 1) the ability of fractional exhaled nitric oxide and inflammatory
      markers (acidity, nitrite, nitrate, hydrogen peroxide, 8-isoprostane, interferon-γ, tumor
      necrosis factor-α, interleukin-2,-4,-5,-10) in exhaled breath condensate, to discriminate
      between cystic fibrosis and control children, and, 2) the relationship of biomarkers with
      control and severity of cystic fibrosis.

      Methods In 98 children (48 cystic fibrosis / 50 controls), condensate was collected using a
      glass condenser. Exhaled nitric oxide was measured using the NIOX®.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        CF population

          -  Children known with CF were recruited from the outpatient clinics. CF disease was
             defined as a combination of typical clinical features (e.g. persistent pulmonary
             problems, meconium ileus, failure to thrive, steatorrhoe) and an abnormal sweat test
             (Chloride &gt; 60 mM). Uncontrolled CF was diagnosed by the paediatric pulmonologist
             based on a change in the presence or severity of respiratory symptoms in association
             with CF, and/or a decrease in lung function parameters compared to previous
             measurements during the last four weeks.

        Control population

          -  Control children without lung disease were recruited from the outpatient clinic of the
             University Hospital Maastricht. The reasons of consultation were constipation and
             enuresis nocturna. All children completed the ‘International Study of Asthma and
             Allergies in Childhood (ISAAC) questionnaire to exclude children with any (history of)
             airway or allergy complaints, in order to exclude asthmatic disease

        Exclusion Criteria:

        For both study populations:

          -  Diseases that may interfere with the results of the study (e.g. upper airway
             infection, heart disease, anatomic abnormalities of the airways and other chronic
             inflammatory diseases, such as Crohns disease and rheumatoid arthritis)

          -  Mental retardation

          -  Inability to perform the EBC collection procedure

          -  Active smoking

          -  Use of the following medication: papaverin, sodium nitroprusside,
             angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, oxymetazoline, L-arginine, or nitric
             oxide synthase (NOS) inhibitors.
