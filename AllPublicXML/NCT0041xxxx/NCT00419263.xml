      This is a study for patients with flu who also have a fever as well as other flu symptoms.
      Patients must have had symptoms for less than 48 hours in order to participate. Patients will
      have two out of three chances of getting an active study treatment and the other third will
      receive a placebo (dummy drug). Nobody will know who gets the active drug and who gets the
      inactive drug. All patients will get supplies to treat symptoms of flu. Patients will need to
      be seen 5 more times after they are enrolled in the study.

      Peramivir is a neuraminidase inhibitor that was previously shown to be effective in the
      treatment of human experimental influenza using an oral formulation. Parenteral formulations
      of peramivir (for intramuscular and intravenous injection) entered clinical development at
      the time of this Phase 2 study. A series of Phase 1 studies in human volunteers was completed
      that provided safety and pharmacokinetic results that supported the initiation of this Phase
      2 multinational, randomized, double-mask study that compared the antiviral efficacy and
      safety of peramivir administered intramuscularly versus placebo in adults with uncomplicated
      acute influenza. Because of the unique pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties of
      peramivir - a long terminal half life in plasma and an extended duration of binding to the
      neuraminidase enzyme - subjects were randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio to receive a single dose of
      one of three treatments: peramivir 150 mg, peramivir 300 mg, and placebo. Study drug was
      administered as one 2-mL intramuscular injection in each gluteal muscle (total of 4 mL,
      injected in divided doses). This multinational study was originally to be conducted at
      approximately 80 sites in the US and Canada. When enrollment during the North American
      influenza season of 2006-2007 did not achieve the target, the study was extended to sites in
      Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, and Hong Kong.

    <measure>Time to Alleviation of Symptoms (Kaplan-Meier Estimate)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 14 days</time_frame>
    <description>Descriptive statistics for the primary efficacy variables were tabulated by treatment group. Alleviation of symptoms was determined by data recorded in the Subject Diary. Treatment differences were assessed using a Cox Regression model with effects for current smoking behavior, treatment, and geographic region. Subjects who did not experience alleviation of symptoms were censored at the date of their last assessment. A Bonferroni adjustment for the primary comparisons of each active dose with placebo was performed.</description>

    <measure>Time to Resolution of Fever</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 14 days</time_frame>
    <description>The time to resolution of fever (defined as the number of hours from initiation of study drug until temperature is less than 37.2 degrees C [99.0 degrees F] and no antipyretic medications had been taken in the previous 12 hours) was estimated using the method of Kaplan-Meier. Differences between the treatment groups were assessed using the log rank statistic controlling for current smoking behavior. Subjects who did not have resolution of fever were censored at the time of the last assessment. No adjustment for multiple comparisons was performed.</description>

    <description>The time to resumption of a subject's self-assessed ability to perform his or her usual activities was estimated using the method of Kaplan-Meier. Differences between the treatment groups were assessed using the log rank statistic controlling for current smoking behavior. Subjects who were not able to resume performance of usual activities were censored at the time of the last assessment.</description>

    <description>The change in viral titers was defined as the time-weighted change from baseline in log_10 tissue culture infective dose_50 (TCID_50/mL) and was summarized for each treatment group. The differences between the treatment groups were evaluated using a Wilcoxon Rank Sum Test controlling for current smoking behavior. Specimens for virologic culture and determination of influenza virus TCID_50/mL were obtained on Day 2 (approximately 24 hours after treatment), on Day 3 (approximately 48 hours after treatment), on Day 5 (approximately 96 hours after treatment), and on Day 9 (approximately 192 hours after treatment).</description>

          <description>Initial Composite Symptom Score is defined as the sum of the 7 symptoms of influenza initially recorded by the subject in the diary (cough; sore throat; nasal congestion; myalgia [aches and pains]; headache; feverishness; and fatigue), each graded on a 4-point severity scale [0, absent; 1, mild; 2, moderate; 3, severe]); for the composite score, individual scores were summed, with a range from 0 to 21. Data were available for 111 participants in the placebo arm, 111 participants in the peramivir 150-mg arm, and 114 participants in the peramivir 300-mg arm.</description>

Specimens for virologic culture and determination of influenza virus TCID_50/mL were obtained on Day 2 (approximately 24 hours after treatment), on Day 3 (approximately 48 hours after treatment), on Day 5 (approximately 96 hours after treatment), and on Day 9 (approximately 192 hours after treatment).</description>
