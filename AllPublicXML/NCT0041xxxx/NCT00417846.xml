  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the sensitivity of the optical coherence tomography
      (OCT) test in detecting neovascular AMD in eyes at high risk for CNV development. In order to
      test this hypothesis, we are conducting a multi-center clinical study at four participating
      clinical centers. A total of 227 participants will be enrolled. Participants will be
      followed-up for a period of two years, or until CNV develops in the study eye for which
      treatment is recommended, to determine the occurrence of CNV. The fundamental design
      principles of the study are simplicity and parsimony.

      Primary Objective:

      The purpose of this study is to determine the sensitivity of the OCT in detecting conversion
      to neovascular AMD by two years in eyes at high risk for CNV, with FA serving as the gold
      standard.

      Secondary Objectives:

        -  To determine the specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value
           of the OCT in detecting conversion to neovascular AMD by two years in eyes at high risk
           for CNV, with FA serving as the gold standard.

        -  To compare the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative
           predictive value of the OCT to the PHP or the supervised Amsler Grid in subjects who had
           either negative PHP and/or negative supervised Amsler grid at baseline for detection of
           neovascular AMD by two years in eyes at high risk for CNV

        -  To describe features of false positives and false negatives with respect to baseline
           characteristics seen on PHP testing, supervised Amsler grid testing, and OCT imaging

        -  To describe the relationship between new visual symptoms experienced by participants
           prompting an interim evaluation where treatment for CNV was recommended and findings
           seen at the previous study visit (PHP testing, supervised Amsler grid testing, OCT
           imaging, other findings on exam, or fluorescein angiography) as well as findings from
           the baseline visit

        -  To determine the physician's detection of CNV development on return study visits
           including slit lamp biomicroscopy before viewing ancillary tests from that visit
           (supervised Amsler grid, PHP, OCT, fundus photographs, fluorescein angiogram)

      All participants will be examined upon enrollment and then followed every three months after
      enrollment for two years or until conversion to CNV is positive and treatment is recommended.
      Specifically, follow-up visits will occur at 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 21, and 24 months from the
      date of the Initial Visit.

        Participants will have neovascular AMD in the fellow eye and non-neovascular AMD in the
        candidate study eye to be eligible for this study. Additional inclusion and exclusion
        criteria are listed below.

    </study_pop>
    <sampling_method>Non-Probability Sample</sampling_method>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Ability to provide written informed consent and comply with study assessments for the
             full duration of the study

          -  Age 50 years or greater

          -  Best corrected visual acuity letter score = 65 or greater (approximate Snellen
             equivalent of 20/50 or better in the candidate study eye)

          -  Neovascular AMD in the fellow eye and no CNV in the candidate study eye (absence of
             CNV confirmed by FA which will be graded in a masked fashion by the AMD DOC Study
             Reading Center)

          -  Candidate study eye must have evidence of at least one large druse (≥ 125µm) and focal
             hyperpigmentation within 3600μm of the fovea and visible on color fundus photography,
             red-free photograph, or fluorescein angiography

          -  Participant must have media clear enough in the candidate study eye to permit fundus
             photography, fluorescein angiography, and optical coherence tomography and absence of
             any fluorescein allergies

          -  Results of the baseline PHP and supervised Amsler grid will not affect eligibility of
             the participant. Subjects can be eligible for further follow-up even if they have
             positive PHP and Amsler grid

          -  Eligible participants who have a positive PHP or supervised Amsler grid for that eye
             at the initial screening visit should have a second PHP or supervised Amsler grid
             screening visit within 2 weeks in order to repeat the PHP or Amsler test or the
             participant may repeat the PHP or Amsler grid that day before pupillary dilation.
             Participants with a 2nd positive PHP or supervised Amsler grid are still eligible for
             further follow-up

          -  All tests (supervised Amsler grid, PHP, OCT, FA) must be performed within 2 weeks of
             each other

          -  Participants with non-foveal geographic atrophy in the candidate study eye are still
             eligible for enrollment in the study

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Known allergy to fluorescein angiography or allergic reaction during screening

          -  Advanced AMD with CNV in both eyes confirmed on FA graded by the AMD DOC Study Reading
             Center

          -  Foveal geographic atrophy in the study eye

          -  Positive OCT test for the candidate study eye, as read by the AMD DOC Study Reading
             Center, for subretinal fluid, intraretinal edema, or retinal thickening that falls
             within the top 1% of the normative data base for the Stratus OCT

          -  Significant media opacity that precludes reasonable quality retinal imaging including
             color fundus photographs, fluorescein angiography, or OCT in the candidate study eye
             to assess the presence of CNV

          -  Evidence of macular disease (e.g., pattern dystrophy, diabetic macular edema,
             vitreomacular traction) other than AMD in the study eye

          -  Previous surgical or laser treatment to the macula of the study eye

          -  Diabetic retinopathy
