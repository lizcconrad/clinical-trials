      The purpose of this study is to determine the effect of menopause on obesity, energy balance,
      and insulin in postmenopausal, obese women.

      The effect of menopause on body composition and cardiovascular risk in healthy caucasian
      women has been the subject of much study. In contrast, there are few data available on
      menopause in African-American women. Since menopause is associated with potentially
      preventable health risks in women, this proposal is aimed at characterizing the
      perimenopausal period in terms of body fat, energy balance, and insulin action in both
      caucasian and African-American women.

      The study will address 4 general hypotheses:

        -  Menopause increases both total and visceral abdominal fat

        -  Changes in body composition and body weight at menopause are mediated, at least in part
           by changes in 24-hour energy expenditure and/or food intake

        -  Menopause results in decreased insulin sensitivity that may predispose certain women to
           develop diabetes later in life

        -  African-American women may respond to the shifts in reproductive hormones at menopause
           differently than caucasian women.

        Pennington Biomedical Research Center is located in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, adjacent to the
        medical services district of the Regional Medical Center. The city of Baton Rouge is the
        home of state government, the 27,000-student Louisiana State University, the 9,000-student
        Southern University and a large petrochemical industry. Lacking the traditional active
        urban &quot;downtown&quot;, the region is characterized by the suburban pattern of single family
        subdivisions and small apartment complexes. The population within a 7 parish (i.e. county)
        area is 635,202. The population of East Baton Rouge Parish is 380,105 with an ethnic
        distribution of 62% Caucasian, 35% African-American, 1% Asian, and &lt;1% Native American and
        Hispanic. There are 34,885 people over age 65 and 251,586 between ages 16-65 yr.
