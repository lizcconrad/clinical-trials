      The objective of this study is to conduct a prospective clinical trial to evaluate the safety
      and efficacy fo the VISX Excimer Laser system for the treatment of naturally occurring low to
      moderate myopia, with or without low levels of astigmatism, in U.S. Army personnel.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Informed consent.

          -  Normal, healthy active adults with access to medical care at Walter Reed Health Care
             System.

          -  Age 21 years or older.

          -  Spherical equivalent of the manifest refractive error between -1.0 to -6.0 diopters
             (D), inclusive, with no more than 3.0D of cylinder. The absolute value of the cylinder
             (expressed in minus cylinder) will be limited such that the short axis of the
             elliptical ablation will be no smaller than 4.9mm. The following specifies the maximum
             cylinder for a given spherical component of the manifest refraction:

        Spherical component / Maximum cylinder

          -  1.0D / -0.5D

          -  2.0D / -1.0D

          -  3.0D / -1.5D

          -  4.0D / -2.0D

          -  5.0D / -2.5D

          -  6.0D / -3.0D

          -  Corrected vision of at least 20/20

          -  Soft contact lens users must havE removed their lenses at least two weeks prior to
             baseline measurements.

          -  Hard contact lens users (PMMA or rigid gas permeable lenses) must have removed their
             lenses at least four weeks prior to baseline measurements. At least two weekly
             manifest refractions and keratometry measurements will be required in this interval.
             The last two measurements must not vary by more than 0.50D in any meridian.

          -  Patients undergoing orthokeratology must have their lenses removed at least 6 months
             prior to the baseline examination. At least two monthly manifest refractions and
             keratometry measurements taken after the third month out of lenses must not vary by
             more than 0.50D in any meridian.

          -  Refractive stability must be documented by previous refractions. Spherical and
             cylindrical portion of the manifest refraction must not have varied by more than 0.50D
             over the previous 12 months.

          -  Exhibits strong motivation for keeping the follow-up visits.

          -  Available for evaluation at Walter Reed during the two-year follow-up period.

          -  Service members must have their command approval to participate in the study.

          -  Access to transportation to meet follow-up requirements.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Residual, recurrent or active ocular diseases or corneal abnormalities in either eye
             such as iritis, uveitis, keratoconjunctivitis sicca, herpetic keratitis, vernal
             conjunctivitis, lagophthalmos, corneal scarring, glaucoma, previous steroid responder,
             occludable chamber angles, visually significant cataracts.

          -  Either one or both eyes suffering from chronic dryness.

          -  Taking any systemic medications that may affect wound healing such as corticosteroids
             or antimetabolites.

          -  Patient corneal neovascularization within one mm of the ablation zone.

          -  History of any previous eye surgery, including previous refractive surgery.

          -  Best corrected visual acuity of less than 20/20.

          -  Progressive myopia or keratoconus.

          -  Any systemic disease that may affect wound healing, such as connective tissue
             disorders (rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, etc.), diabetes, or
             severe atopic disease.

          -  Any physical or mental impairment that would preclude participation in any of the
             examinations.

          -  For contact lens users there must be no evidence of contact lens corneal warpage on
             computerized topography.

          -  Currently on flight status or projected to be on flight status within ten years.

          -  Pregnant or breast-feeding an infant. Women of childbearing age must take a urine
             blood pregnancy test before starting this study
