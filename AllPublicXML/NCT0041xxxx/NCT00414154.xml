  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Modification of individual life style factors and fall prevention programmes may have
      significant positive effects on fracture incidence. Also, a large number of studies have
      demonstrated that pharmacological therapy of osteoporosis is effective; however non-adherence
      to such therapy is a well recognized problem. Few studies, however, have examined the effect
      of particular patient education programmes on knowledge and adherence to therapy.

      We hypothesised that a group-based, multi-disciplinary, education programme increases the
      total quality of treatment for patients with osteoporosis, Patients' knowledge on
      osteoporosis and adherence with pharmacological therapy ect.

      A total of 300 patients, recently diagnosed with osteoporosis and started on specific
      treatment, were randomised to either the &quot;school&quot; or &quot;control&quot; group. In the school-group,
      patients attended four classes with 8-12 participants during four weeks (a total of 12
      hours). Teaching was performed by nurses, physiotherapists, dieticians, and doctors and was
      based on dialogs and situated learning. The classes covered &quot;facts on osteoporosis&quot;,
      &quot;fractures and pain&quot;, &quot;diet&quot;, &quot;preventive measures&quot;, &quot;balance and exercise&quot;, and &quot;medical
      treatment&quot;. Teaching was designed to increase empowerment. The control group were offered the
      department's standard treatment including follow-up visits.

      All 300 patients received questionnaires regarding &quot;Knowledge about Osteoporosis&quot;, &quot;Level of
      Adherence&quot;, &quot;Quality of life&quot;, &quot;Dietary calcium intake&quot;, &quot;Level of physical activity&quot;, &quot;Falls
      events&quot; registered every month by postcard, at inclusion and after 3, 12, and 24 month. BMD
      was examined by DXA-scan at inclusion and after 12 and 24 month. The last patient will answer
      the questionnaires first of May 2007.
