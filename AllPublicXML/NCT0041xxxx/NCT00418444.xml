      The purpose of this study is to test an innovative intervention geared towards issues of

      image, quality of life, psychosocial/sexuality/relational functioning.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Breast cancer is the most frequently diagnosed cancer in women with 1 in 10 Canadian women
      being diagnosed in their lifetime. There has been an increase in the number of survivors due
      to advances in treatment and early detection, and increased scientific attention has been
      focused on patients' quality of life during and after treatment. The majority of survivors do
      well after the initial adjustment within the first 2 years post-treatment. However, depending
      on when assessed after treatment completion, a wide range of cancer survivors either score at
      levels suggestive of a psychiatric diagnosis or are diagnosed with a psychological problem.
      Furthermore, a subset of survivors experience adjustment problems long after treatment
      completion. Approximately 20% to 40% of survivors develop sexual and body image problems
      following breast cancer and treatment and these difficulties tend to persist several years
      after treatment completion.

      This study aims to test an innovative intervention geared towards issues of identity, body
      image and sexuality and to examine the intervention for its impact on body image and quality
      of life, psychosocial and sexual functioning and relational functioning.

      One hundred and eighty women who have completed treatment for breast cancer will be
      randomized into either intervention: an 8 weekly psychosocial group support or control
      condition (standard care + written educational material). All subjects will be followed for 1
      year post-intervention. It is hypothesized that, compared to control subjects who receive
      standard care and educational materials, subjects participating in an 8 weekly psychosocial
      group support will have higher levels of relationship support/functioning, and that the group
      differences will be maintained over the 1-year follow up period.
