  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study assesses the tolerability, safety, efficacy and pharmacokinetics of gimatecan in
      Japanese patients. Gimatecan is administered orally for five consecutive days, every 28 days,
      to adult patients with advanced solid tumors who have progressed despite standard therapy or
      for whom standard systemic therapy does not exist.
