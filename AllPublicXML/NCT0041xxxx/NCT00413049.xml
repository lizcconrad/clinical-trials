    <measure>Change in Mean Sitting Diastolic Blood Pressure (msDBP) From Baseline to End of Study (Week 8)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to end of study (Week 8)</time_frame>
    <description>Blood pressure (BP) was measured with a calibrated aneroid or mercury sphygmomanometer. The arm in which the highest sitting diastolic BP was found at study entry was used for all subsequent readings. At each visit, after the patient was in a sitting position for five minutes, systolic/diastolic BP was measured 3 times at 1-2-minute intervals. The mean of the 3 measurements was calculated. A negative change score indicates lowered BP.</description>

    <description>A patient achieved a diastolic response if their msDBP &lt; 90 mmHg at Week 8 or they had a ≥ 10 mmHg decrease in msDBP compared to baseline at the end of the study (Week 8). Blood pressure (BP) was measured with a calibrated aneroid or mercury sphygmomanometer.

At each visit, after the patient was in a sitting position for five minutes, systolic/diastolic BP was measured 3 times at 1-2-minute intervals. The mean of the 3 measurements was calculated.</description>

    <description>A patient achieved diastolic control if their msDBP &lt; 90 mmHg at the end of the study (Week 8).

    <description>A patient achieved overall control if the msSBP/msDBP &lt; 140/90 mmHg at the end of the study (Week 8). Blood pressure (BP) was measured with a calibrated aneroid or mercury sphygmomanometer. The arm in which the highest sitting diastolic BP was found at study entry was used for all subsequent readings. At each visit, after the patient was in a sitting position for five minutes, systolic/diastolic BP was measured 3 times at 1-2-minute intervals.

    <measure>Change in 24-hour Mean Ambulatory Diastolic and Systolic BP From Baseline at the End of the Study (Week 8)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to end of study (Week 8)</time_frame>
    <description>Two 24 hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) evaluations were performed, one at baseline prior to randomization and one at Week 8 (end of study), in a subset of the intent-to-treat population of patients. For each evaluation, the ABPM device was attached to the non-dominant arm of the patient. A correlation was made between the ABPM device readings and measurements taken with a mercury sphygmomanometer and stethoscope. Following the correlation procedure, BP was measured at study specified intervals. A negative change score indicates lowered BP.</description>

        <description>Blood pressure (BP) was measured with a calibrated aneroid or mercury sphygmomanometer. The arm in which the highest sitting diastolic BP was found at study entry was used for all subsequent readings. At each visit, after the patient was in a sitting position for five minutes, systolic/diastolic BP was measured 3 times at 1-2-minute intervals. The mean of the 3 measurements was calculated. A negative change score indicates lowered BP.</description>

        <title>Percentage of Patients Achieving Diastolic Control at the End of the Study (Week 8)</title>
        <description>A patient achieved diastolic control if their msDBP &lt; 90 mmHg at the end of the study (Week 8). Blood pressure (BP) was measured with a calibrated aneroid or mercury sphygmomanometer. The arm in which the highest sitting diastolic BP was found at study entry was used for all subsequent readings. At each visit, after the patient was in a sitting position for five minutes, systolic/diastolic BP was measured 3 times at 1-2-minute intervals. The mean of the 3 measurements was calculated.</description>

        <title>Change in 24-hour Mean Ambulatory Diastolic and Systolic BP From Baseline at the End of the Study (Week 8)</title>
        <description>Two 24 hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) evaluations were performed, one at baseline prior to randomization and one at Week 8 (end of study), in a subset of the intent-to-treat population of patients. For each evaluation, the ABPM device was attached to the non-dominant arm of the patient. A correlation was made between the ABPM device readings and measurements taken with a mercury sphygmomanometer and stethoscope. Following the correlation procedure, BP was measured at study specified intervals. A negative change score indicates lowered BP.</description>
