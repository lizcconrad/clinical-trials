      The aim of the study is to develop a research-based pedagogic model to improve the
      interaction between the patient`s motivation, influence and learning.The hypothesis is:

      A neuro-rehabilitation effort in patients with severe traumatic brain injury based on a
      didactic model for improvement of motivation, involvement and re-learning of daily life
      competences will

        -  improve the patients experience of meaningful learning and influence

        -  provide staff with a tool which contributes to the experience to work in a targeted way
           concerning motivation, patient influence and re-learning daily life competencies

      The aim of the study is to develop a research-based didactic model to improve the interaction
      between the patient`s motivation, influence and learning.

    <textblock>
      Annually, about 7500 people get a traumatic brain injury (TBI) in Denmark. According to
      Danish and international experiences 250 of these get severe injuries. About 120 younger
      people often males need highly specialised neuro-rehabilitation at one of the two regional
      centres in Denmark. Due to the limited amount of research in this field it cannot be
      documented but assumed, that the patient's motivation and involvement in planning and
      implementation of rehabilitation improve subjective and objective outcome. Motivation,
      involvement and learning in patients with severe traumatic brain injury constitute a major
      challenge. The cases are individual, but often involve disturbances in language and
      perception, lack of realization, reduced initiative, tiredness and depression. The focus of
      this project is the intensive physical and psychosocial rehabilitation viewed as a process of
      relearning targeted daily life competences using the ICF levels of function, activity and
      participation.
