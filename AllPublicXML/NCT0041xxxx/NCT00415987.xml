  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The treatment assignment is based on the presence or absence of an HLA-identical sibling
      donor (Genetic Randomisation, NOT formal Randomisation). Patients with suitable HLA-identical
      sibling donors are offered a tandem transplant approach consisting of standard autografting
      nonmyeloablative radiotherapy and allografting. Patients without HLA-identical siblings are
      treated with standard double autologous transplantation as per Institutional guidelines or
      enrolled in other treatment programs approved by local IRBs.This is a multi-center study. The
      Division of Hematology of University of Torino at the S.G.B. Hospital, Torino, Italy, is the
      co-ordinating Center.
