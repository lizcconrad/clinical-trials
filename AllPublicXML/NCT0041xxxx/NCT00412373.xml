  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to measure the effectiveness and assess the safety of different
      dosages (from 3 mg/day to 12 mg/day) of the antipsychotic paliperidone extended-release (ER)
      in patients who are experiencing an acute episode of schizoaffective disorder.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder are closely related in terms of symptoms,
      coexisting conditions, and genetic risk. In previous studies in patients with schizophrenia,
      treatment with paliperidone extended-release (ER) improved psychotic symptoms, as well as
      mood symptoms evaluated by anxiety/depression and hostility/excitement Positive and Negative
      Symptoms of Schizophrenia (PANSS) factor scores. Therefore, paliperidone ER may also be
      effective in treating symptoms of schizoaffective disorder. Paliperidone's limited potential
      for drug-drug interaction is particularly important in this patient population, in which
      multiple drug therapy is relatively common. This multicenter, double-blind (neither the
      patient nor the physician knows whether drug or placebo is being taken, or at what dosage),
      randomized (patients are assigned different treatments based on chance), placebo-controlled,
      parallel-group study is designed to examine the effectiveness and safety of paliperidone ER
      in adult patients with schizoaffective disorder who are experiencing an acute episode of this
      disorder. Patients in the study will be randomly assigned to 1 of 2 groups to receive 6 weeks
      of oral treatment with flexible dosages of paliperidone ER (3-12 mg/day) or with placebo. The
      primary efficacy outcome will be the change from baseline to Week 6, or the last
      post-randomization assessment during double-blind treatment (endpoint), in the PANSS total
      score. Safety will be assessed by monitoring adverse events, clinical laboratory testing,
      pregnancy testing, vital signs measurements, physical examination, administration of a
      12-lead ECG, movement disorders side effect scales, and the InterSePT Scale for Suicidal
      Thinking. Patients may also choose to participate in a pharmacogenomic (DNA) analysis. The
      primary study hypothesis is that flexible-dose paliperidone ER is better than placebo on the
      change from baseline in the PANSS total score in acutely ill patients with schizoaffective
      disorder. Patients will receive study drug by mouth for a total of 43 days. Beginning on Day
      1, patients will take either placebo or paliperidone ER 6 mg/day. After day 4, dosages may be
      adjusted, at defined intervals, to a dosage between 3 mg/day and 12 mg/day, inclusive.

    <description>The PANSS is a 30-item scale (range 30-210) designed to assess various symptoms of schizophrenia including delusions, grandiosity, blunted affect, poor attention, and poor impulse control. The 30 symptoms are rated on a 7-point scale that ranges from 1 (absent) to 7 (extreme psychopathology). The PANSS total score consists of the sum of all 30 PANSS items.

          <description>Paliperidone (9-hydroxy-risperidone, R076477) is an atypical antipsychotic agent approved for the treatment of schizophrenia and is in development for the treatment of bipolar disorder and schizoaffective disorder. Paliperidone is a monoaminergic antagonist that exhibits the characteristic dopamine type 2 (D2) and serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine [5-HT]) type 2A (5HT2A) antagonism of the newer, or second-generation, antipsychotic drugs. Paliperidone is available in an oral formulation using extended-release (ER).</description>

        <description>The PANSS is a 30-item scale (range 30-210) designed to assess various symptoms of schizophrenia including delusions, grandiosity, blunted affect, poor attention, and poor impulse control. The 30 symptoms are rated on a 7-point scale that ranges from 1 (absent) to 7 (extreme psychopathology). The PANSS total score consists of the sum of all 30 PANSS items. Higher scores indicate worsening.</description>

Paliperidone is a monoaminergic antagonist that exhibits the characteristic dopamine type 2 (D2) and serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine [5-HT]) type 2A (5HT2A) antagonism of the newer, or second-generation, antipsychotic drugs. Paliperidone is available in an oral formulation using extended-release (ER).</description>

The items are rated on either a 5-point (0 to 4) or a 3-point (0 to 2) scale.

The responses are summed to yield the HAM-D-21 score that ranges from 0-63.</description>
