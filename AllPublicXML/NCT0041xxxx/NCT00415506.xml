    <description>For patients with scleritis, disease activity as measured by a modified grading system first described by McCluskey et al. (McCluskey and Wakefield 1987; McCluskey and Wakefield 1991). Improvement in scleritis activity will be defined as a reduction in this grading score of 2 or more, or an overall score of 4 or less by 24 weeks.
For patients with orbital inflammation, disease activity as measured by a modified grading system first devised by Werner (Werner 1977). Improvement in orbital inflammation will be defined as a reduction in this grading score of 2 or more, or an overall score of 3 or less.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with non-infectious scleritis or idiopathic orbital inflammatory disease
             requiring chronic immunosuppressive treatment for disease control.

          -  Intolerance, failure to respond to, or inability to taper below prednisone &gt; 10mg/day
             in addition to one systemic immunosuppressive (such as methotrexate, azathioprine,
             mycophenolate mofetil, cyclosporine, cyclophosphamide, or chlorambucil).

          -  Patients must be on a stable dosage of prednisone and at least one steroid-sparing
             agent in the 30 days prior to screening/enrollment.

          -  Active disease will be defined using physician judgment and supported by patient and
             physician global ocular disease assessment of &gt; 5 cm on a 10cm visual analog scale
             anchored by the words &quot;Inactive Eye Disease&quot; at 0 cm point and &quot;Extremely Active Eye
             Disease&quot; at the 10cm point. Investigator discretion may apply in some cases.

          -  Selected patients who are on biological agents such as TNF blockers etanercept,
             infliximab and adalimumab with ongoing ocular disease are acceptable. There will be an
             8 week washout period of etanercept and a 12 week washout period for infliximab and
             adalimumab before patients are dosed with rituximab.

          -  In patients with concomitant systemic autoimmune diseases including RA, SLE, Sjogrens,
             Wegener's granulomatosis the systemic disease must be sufficiently stable and not life
             threatening to allow tapering of steroids and/or immunosuppressive agents thus
             allowing assessment of ocular effect of rituximab.

          -  Adults of both genders &gt; 18 years old. There is no upper age limit as long as there
             are no other disqualifying health conditions.

          -  Have had a recent (&lt;3 months old) PPD skin test and are considered eligible according
             to the tuberculosis (TB) screening, eligibility assessment, and prevention rules
             defined in Appendix C.

          -  Screening laboratory test results should be acceptable to the Investigator prior to
             placing a patient on study drug.

          -  Must have a chest radiograph within 3 months prior to first infusion with no evidence
             of malignancy, infection or fibrosis.

          -  Adequate renal function as indicated by normal BUN and creatinine levels.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Untreated thyroid disease

          -  Organ threatening systemic disease as evidenced by rapidly progressive
             glomerulonephritis, pulmonary hemorrhage or respiratory failure, seizures or
             psychosis, progressive neuropathy or myopathy

        General Safety &amp; Laboratory Exclusion Criteria

        Patients will be excluded from the study based on the following criteria:

          -  Hemoglobin: &lt; 8.5 gm/dL

          -  Platelets: &lt; 100,000/mm

          -  AST or ALT &gt;2.5 x Upper Limit of Normal unless related to primary disease.

          -  Positive Hepatitis B or C serology (Hep B Surface antigen and Hep C antibody)

          -  History of positive HIV (HIV conducted during screening if applicable)

          -  Treatment with any investigational agent within 4 weeks of screening or 5 half-lives

          -  Previous Treatment with Rituximab (MabThera® / Rituxan®)

          -  History of severe allergic or anaphylactic reactions to humanized or murine monoclonal
             antibodies

          -  History of recurrent significant infection or history of recurrent bacterial
             infections

          -  Known active bacterial, viral, fungal, mycobacterial, or other infection (including
             tuberculosis or atypical mycobacterial disease, but excluding fungal infections of
             nail beds) or any major episode of infection requiring hospitalization or treatment
             with i.v. antibiotics within 4 weeks of screening, or oral antibiotics within 2 weeks
             prior to screening

          -  Unstable steroid dose in the past 4 weeks

          -  Lack of peripheral venous access

          -  History of drug, alcohol, or chemical abuse within 6 months prior to screening

             screening and negative urine pregnancy test prior to each infusion) or lactation

          -  Concomitant or previous malignancies, with the exception of curatively resected
             non-melanoma skin carcinomas or carcinoma in situ of the cervix

          -  History of psychiatric disorder that would interfere with normal participation in this
             protocol

          -  Significant cardiac or pulmonary disease (including obstructive pulmonary disease)

          -  Any other disease, metabolic dysfunction, physical examination finding, or clinical
             laboratory finding giving reasonable suspicion of a disease or condition that
             contraindicates the use of an investigational drug or that may affect the
             interpretation of the results or render the patient at high risk from treatment
             complications

          -  Inability to comply with study and follow-up procedures

        <title>Improved Control of Inflammation</title>
        <description>For patients with scleritis, disease activity as measured by a modified grading system first described by McCluskey et al. (McCluskey and Wakefield 1987; McCluskey and Wakefield 1991). Improvement in scleritis activity will be defined as a reduction in this grading score of 2 or more, or an overall score of 4 or less by 24 weeks.
For patients with orbital inflammation, disease activity as measured by a modified grading system first devised by Werner (Werner 1977). Improvement in orbital inflammation will be defined as a reduction in this grading score of 2 or more, or an overall score of 3 or less.</description>
