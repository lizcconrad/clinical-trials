  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Colon cleansing prior to colonoscopy is critically important to ensure effective colonoscopy
      for colon cancer screening, which is now widespread in North America. Currently available
      colon cleansing agents are limited either by potential safety concerns or significant
      limitations in the ability of patients to tolerate the preparation. Pico-salax has recently
      been introduced in Canada as an alternative agent and is being used more and more widely
      despite an almost complete lack of clinical data supporting efficacy and safety. This study
      will establish the relative efficacy and patient tolerability of this agent and its safety
      profile. This is a very important, practical issue which continues to challenge
      gastroenterologists, surgeons, internists, family doctors and thousands of their patients in
      Canada on a daily basis.

      Anecdotal evidence suggests that the efficacy of pico-salax when used as a sole agent may not
      be as efficacious as oral sodium phosphate. Hence, our hypothesis is that the combination of
      pico-salax and bisacodyl will provide the most efficacious bowel preparation in comparison
      with oral sodium phosphate and pico-salax alone, while being equally if not better tolerated.

      This is a randomized, investigator blinded clinical trial assessing the cleansing efficacy
      (using the Ottawa Bowel Preparation scale) and tolerance of three bowel cleansing regimens,
      two of which involve pico-salax.
