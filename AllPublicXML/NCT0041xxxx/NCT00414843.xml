      The purpose of the study is to establish a repository of human bile as a resource for studies
      evaluating molecular predictors of biliary cancer risk.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The specific aim of this study is to establish a repository of human bile to serve as a
      resource for studies looking at molecular predictors of biliary tract cancer. The development
      of fluid based biomarkers will enable early diagnosis in at-risk individuals with a
      recognized risk factor for cholangiocarcinoma, as well as provide surveillance mechanisms for
      screening populations where biliary tract cancer has a high incidence.
