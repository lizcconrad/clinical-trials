  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial is studying how well giving AZD2171 together with pemetrexed disodium
      works in treating patients with relapsed non-small cell lung cancer. AZD2171 and pemetrexed
      disodium may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell
      growth. AZD2171 may also stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking blood flow to the tumor.
      Giving AZD2171 together with pemetrexed disodium may kill more tumor cells.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Evaluate the response rate in patients with relapsed non-small cell lung cancer treated
      with AZD2171 and pemetrexed disodium.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Assess the progression-free and overall survival of patients treated with this regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to prior bevacizumab
      treatment (yes vs no).

      Patients receive oral AZD2171 once daily on days 1-28 in course 1 and on days 1-21 in course
      2 and all subsequent courses. Patients also receive pemetrexed disodium IV over 10 minutes on
      day 8 in course 1 and on day 1 in course 2 and all subsequent courses. Treatment repeats
      every 3 weeks* in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      [Note: * The first course is 4 weeks in duration; all subsequent courses are 3 weeks in
      duration.]

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed at 4 weeks and then periodically
      thereafter.
