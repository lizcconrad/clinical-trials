  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of a modified natural cycle in
      patients with previous poor response to infertility drugs and high basal FSH, prior to
      proceeding to oocyte donation or abandoning fertility treatment.

      Poor responders are a diverse group of IVF patients who fail to respond to IVF drugs. In
      these patients pregnancy rates remain disappointingly low and usually oocyte donation is
      their only viable option. The need for lengthy ovarian stimulation regimes can be avoided by
      performing IVF during a natural menstrual cycle. However, the main problem with a natural
      cycle is that successful IVF outcome can be compromised by a premature LH surge. This problem
      can be solved by the administration of GnRH antagonists that suppress endogenous gonadotropin
      levels, comprising a modified natural cycle (MNC). Previous studies have shown that MNC
      offers no realistic chances of pregnancy prior to oocyte donation. In this study we will
      re-assess this view by showing that MNC offers some, albeit small, chances of positive IVF
      outcome in patients with known previous poor response prior to oocyte donation.
