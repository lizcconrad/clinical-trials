  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this repeated dose study is to develop recommended dosing information for
      initiation of therapy with OROS Hydromorphone HCI (slow release) in patients with chronic
      cancer pain converting from other strong oral or transdermal opioids. It will also assist in
      the development of a recommended starting dose by which patients can be titrated to an
      appropriate maintenance dose of OROS hydromorphone HCI (slow release). The safety profile for
      OROS Hydromorphone HCI (slow release) will also be evaluated.

      This randomized (patients assigned to treatment by chance), single-blind (with respect to
      dose), open-label (patients know what study treatment, not dose, they are receiving) repeated
      dose study evaluating patients with chronic cancer pain was conducted in tandem (together)
      with a similar protocol in patients with chronic non-malignant pain. A total of 463 patients
      were enrolled and evaluated in these studies. Patients receiving chronic opioid therapy were
      converted to once daily OROS hydromorphone (slow release) using oral morphine equivalents.
      Supplementary immediate-release (IR) hydromorphone was provided for breakthrough pain. The
      dose of OROS hydromorphone (slow release) was escalated after every 2 days of therapy until
      no more than 3 doses of immediate-release (IR) hydromorphone were required in a 24-hour
      period. Once a patient could be maintained on a stable dose of OROS hydromorphone (slow
      release) for 3 consecutive days, the patient entered a 2-week maintenance phase. Patients who
      completed the study were eligible for participation in an OROS hydromorphone (slow release)
      long-term extension study, Study DO-109. The hypothesis is the 24-hour controlled-release
      form of oral hydromorphone may provide consistent pain relief, convenient dosing, and
      enhanced compliance while possibly decreasing the incidence of side effects associated with
      peak (high) and trough (low) fluctuations in plasma drug concentrations typically seen with
      immediate-release dosage formulations. Patients received OROS Hydromorphone HCI (slow
      release) at Visit 2,3, and 4 (either 8,16,32, and/or 64mg tablets) taken orally. OROS
      Hydromorphone HCI (slow release) doses were titrated after every two days of therapy as
      necessary until dose stabilization occured, followed by a two week Maintenance Therapy Phase.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients who have chronic cancer pain who are currently receiving strong oral or
             transdermal opioid analgesics or patients suitable for advancement of therapy to step
             3 on the WHO (World Health Organization) analgesic ladder

          -  patients who can reasonably be expected to have stable opioid requirements for the
             duration of the study

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients intolerant of or hypersensitive to hydromorphone (or other opioid agonists)

          -  patients who are pregnant or breast-feeding

          -  patients with severe respiratory compromise or severely depressed ventilatory function

          -  patients with any gastrointestinal disorder or acute abdominal conditions including
             pre-existing severe GI narrowing (pathologic or iatrogenic), that may affect the
             absorption or transit of orally administered drugs

          -  patients with clinically significant impaired renal or hepatic function, Addison's
             disease, hypothyroidism, prostatic hypertrophy, or urethral stricture, dysphagia or
             are unable to swallow tablets or any significant CNS disorder, including but not
             limited to head injury, intracranial lesion, increased intracranial pressure, seizure
             disorder, stroke within the past 6 months, and disorders of cognition
