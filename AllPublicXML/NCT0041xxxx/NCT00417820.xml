  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the local tolerability of a single topical
      administration of BCT194 in healthy volunteers and, potentially, to evaluate the safety,
      tolerability, and efficacy of a multiple topical administrations in patients with psoriasis.
