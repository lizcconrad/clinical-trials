  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the effect of treatment with 24 weeks nitazoxanide monotherapy on
      end of treatment virologic response, sustained virologic response, reduction of quantitative
      serum HCV RNA, changes in ALT and safety parameters.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Age â‰¥ 18 years.

          -  Chronic hepatitis C infection (at least 6 months) evidenced by a positive enzyme
             immunoassay for anti-HCV-antibodies and a positive quantitative RT-PCR amplification
             of HCV RNA.

          -  Chronic inflammation on liver biopsy compatible with a diagnosis of chronic viral
             hepatitis.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients unable to take oral medications.

          -  Use of interferon alpha within 90 days or ribavirin within 30 days prior to
             enrollment.

          -  Females of child bearing age who are either pregnant, breast-feeding or not using
             birth control and are sexually active.

          -  Any investigational drug therapy within 30 days prior to enrollment.

          -  Patients with other causes of liver disease.

          -  Patients co-infected with hepatitis A virus, hepatitis B virus or hepatitis D virus
             based on enzyme immunoassay.

          -  Patients with history of alcoholism or with an alcohol consumption of &gt;40 grams per
             day.

          -  Patients who are clinically unstable.

          -  Patients with any concomitant condition that, in the opinion of the investigator would
             preclude evaluation of response or make it unlikely that the contemplated course of
             therapy and follow-up could be completed.

          -  History of hypersensitivity or intolerance to nitazoxanide or any of the excipients
             comprising the nitazoxanide tablets.
