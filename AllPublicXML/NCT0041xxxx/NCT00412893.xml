      The purpose of this study is to compare the efficacy and safety of isavuconazole versus
      voriconazole in the treatment of patients with invasive aspergillosis.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Acute invasive fungal infections caused by aspergillus, zygomycetes and other filamentous
      fungi remain life threatening diseases. Early treatment with highly effective anti-fungals
      reduces mortality. This study investigates the efficacy and safety of isavuconazole in the
      treatment of invasive fungal diseases, caused by Aspergillus or other filamentous fungi.

    <measure>All-cause Mortality Through Day 42</measure>
    <time_frame>Through Day 42</time_frame>
    <description>All-cause mortality is represented as the percentage of participants who died after first dose of study drug through Day 42 from any cause. Participants with unknown survival status through Day 42 were included as deaths in the calculation.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of Participants With an Overall Outcome of Success Evaluated by the Data Review Committee (DRC)</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 42, Day 84 and End of Treatment. The median duration of study drug administration was 45 days.</time_frame>
    <description>The DRC was an independent, blinded committee consisting of experts in the field of infectious disease who assessed patients' outcomes. The overall response was based on the DRC-assessed clinical, mycological and radiological responses.
Success was defined as the resolution or partial resolution of all attributable clinical symptoms and physical findings, the eradication or presumed eradication of the original causative organism cultured or identified by histology/cytology at Baseline and a &gt; 50% improvement in radiological response from Baseline (or improvement of at least 25% from Baseline for the Day 42 analysis or End of Treatment if it occurred prior to Day 42).
End of treatment (EOT) is the last day of study drug administration. For the Day 42 and Day 84 analyses, any visits that the DRC assessed as Not Done were considered a failure for that visit. A death before Day 42 was also considered a failure, even if the DRC assessed the participant to be a success prior to death.</description>

    <measure>Percentage of Participants With an Overall Outcome of Success Evaluated by Investigator</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 42, Day 84 and End of Treatment. The median duration of study drug administration was 45 days.</time_frame>
    <description>Overall response based on investigators' assessments was not derived as it was not deemed necessary because participants overall response status was determined by the DRC. All investigators' assessments of clinical, mycological and radiological responses are analyzed separately (see Outcome Measures 8-10).</description>

    <measure>Percentage of Participants With a Clinical Response Assessed by the DRC</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 42, Day 84 and End of Treatment. The median duration of study drug administration was 45 days.</time_frame>
    <description>Blinded assessments of clinical symptoms and physical findings of invasive fungal disease were performed by the independent DRC.
Clinical response is defined as the resolution or partial resolution of all attributable clinical symptoms and physical findings. Failure is defined as no resolution of any attributable clinical symptoms and physical findings and/or worsening. Participants with no attributable signs and symptoms present at Baseline and no symptoms attributable to invasive fungal disease (IFD) developed post-baseline were classified as &quot;Not Applicable.&quot; End of treatment is the last day of study drug administration.</description>

    <measure>Percentage of Participants With a Mycological Response Assessed by the DRC</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 42, Day 84 and End of Treatment. The median duration of study drug administration was 45 days.</time_frame>
    <description>Blinded mycological assessments of the participant's invasive fungal disease status were performed by the independent DRC using the results from fungal culture and isolation and/or histology/cytology of biopsy or biological fluid samples from the infected site.
Mycological response is defined as eradication or presumed eradication of the original causative organism cultured or identified by histology/cytology at Baseline. Failure was defined as persistence or presumed persistence. Participants with no mycological evidence available at Baseline were classified as &quot;Not Applicable&quot;.
End of treatment is the last day of study drug administration.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of Participants With a Radiological Response Assessed by the DRC</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 42, Day 84 and End of Treatment. The median duration of study drug administration was 45 days.</time_frame>
    <description>Independent reviews of radiology assessments were completed by radiology experts which were provided to the independent, blinded DRC. Blinded radiological assessments were performed by the DRC.
Radiological response is defined as a ≥ 50% improvement from Baseline, or improvement of at least 25% from Baseline for the Day 42 analysis or if end of treatment occurred before Day 42. Participants without any radiology at Baseline were considered &quot;Not Applicable.&quot; End of Treatment is the last day of study drug administration.</description>

    <description>Assessment of clinical symptoms and physical findings of invasive fungal disease were performed by the investigator.
Clinical response is defined as the resolution or partial resolution of all attributable clinical symptoms and physical findings. Failure is defined as no resolution of any attributable clinical symptoms and physical findings and/or worsening, or if results were unavailable or the participant was unevaluable. Participants with no attributable signs and symptoms present at Baseline were classified as &quot;Not Applicable.&quot; End of treatment is the last day of study drug administration.</description>

Mycological response is defined as eradication or presumed eradication of the original causative organism cultured or identified by histology/cytology at Baseline. Failure was defined as persistence or presumed persistence. Participants with no mycological evidence available at Baseline, or no mycological follow-up results available or indeterminate results were classified as &quot;Not Applicable&quot;.

        <title>Percentage of Participants With an Overall Outcome of Success Evaluated by the Data Review Committee (DRC)</title>
        <description>The DRC was an independent, blinded committee consisting of experts in the field of infectious disease who assessed patients' outcomes. The overall response was based on the DRC-assessed clinical, mycological and radiological responses.
Success was defined as the resolution or partial resolution of all attributable clinical symptoms and physical findings, the eradication or presumed eradication of the original causative organism cultured or identified by histology/cytology at Baseline and a &gt; 50% improvement in radiological response from Baseline (or improvement of at least 25% from Baseline for the Day 42 analysis or End of Treatment if it occurred prior to Day 42).
End of treatment (EOT) is the last day of study drug administration. For the Day 42 and Day 84 analyses, any visits that the DRC assessed as Not Done were considered a failure for that visit. A death before Day 42 was also considered a failure, even if the DRC assessed the participant to be a success prior to death.</description>

Radiological response is defined as a ≥ 50% improvement from Baseline, or improvement of at least 25% from Baseline for the Day 42 analysis or if end of treatment occurred before Day 42. Participants without any radiology at Baseline were considered &quot;Not Applicable.&quot; End of Treatment is the last day of study drug administration.</description>

        <description>Mycological assessments of the participant’s invasive fungal disease status were performed by the investigator using the results from fungal culture and isolation and/or histology/cytology of biopsy or biological fluid samples from the infected site.
Mycological response is defined as eradication or presumed eradication of the original causative organism cultured or identified by histology/cytology at Baseline. Failure was defined as persistence or presumed persistence. Participants with no mycological evidence available at Baseline, or no mycological follow-up results available or indeterminate results were classified as &quot;Not Applicable&quot;.
