      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as gemcitabine, work in different ways to stop
      the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing.
      Monoclonal antibodies, such as bevacizumab, can block tumor growth in different ways. Some
      block the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Others find tumor cells and help kill
      them or carry tumor-killing substances to them. Bevacizumab may also stop the growth of
      pancreatic cancer by blocking blood flow to the tumor. Giving gemcitabine and bevacizumab
      after surgery may kill any tumor cells that remain after surgery.

      PURPOSE: This phase I/II trial is studying the side effects of gemcitabine and bevacizumab
      and to see how well they work in treating patients with pancreatic cancer that has been
      completely removed by surgery.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Determine the safety of adjuvant, fixed-dose rate gemcitabine hydrochloride and
           bevacizumab in patients with completely resected pancreatic cancer.

        -  Determine the 1-year disease-free survival rate in patients treated with this regimen.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the 1- and 2-year overall survival rates in these patients.

        -  Determine the median disease-free survival rate in these patients.

        -  Determine the median overall survival rate in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is an open-label, non-randomized study.

      Patients receive gemcitabine hydrochloride IV over 100 minutes followed by bevacizumab* IV
      over 30-90 minutes on days 1 and 15. Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 6 courses in
      the absence of disease recurrence or unacceptable toxicity.

      NOTE: *The first dose of bevacizumab is not administered until after 6 weeks have passed
      since surgery.

      After completion of study therapy, patients are followed periodically for 18 months.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 20 patients will be accrued for this study.
