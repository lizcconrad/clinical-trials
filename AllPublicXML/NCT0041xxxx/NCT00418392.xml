      The estimated recurrence rate of primary spontaneous pneumothorax is 23-50% after the first
      episode, and the optimal treatment remains unknown. In the recently published British
      Thoracic Society (BTS) guidelines, simple aspiration is recommended as first line treatment
      for all primary pneumothoraces requiring intervention. However, the 1 year recurrence rate of
      this procedure was as high as 25-30%, making it inappropriate as a standard of care.

      Intrapleural instillation of a chemical irritant (chemical pleurodesis) is an effective way
      to shorten the duration of air leaks and reduce the rates of recurrent spontaneous
      pneumothorax in surgical and non-surgical patients. Many chemical irritants (tetracycline,
      talc, and minocycline) have been used to decrease the rate of recurrence in spontaneous
      pneumothorax. Tetracycline, which was the most commonly used irritant, is no longer
      available. Talc insufflation of the pleural cavity is safe and effective for primary
      spontaneous pneumothorax. However, it should be applied either with surgical or medical
      thoracoscopy. Minocycline, a derivative of tetracycline, is as effective as tetracycline in
      inducing pleural fibrosis in rabbits. In the previous studies, we have shown that additional
      minocycline pleurodesis is a safe and convenient procedure to decrease the rates of
      ipsilateral recurrence after thoracoscopic treatment of primary spontaneous pneumothorax. In
      the present study, additional minocycline pleurodesis will be randomly administered in
      patients with first episode of primary spontaneous pneumothorax after simple aspiration to
      test if it can reduce the rate of recurrence.

      Background:

      Primary spontaneous pneumothorax most commonly occurs in young, tall, lean males (1, 2). The
      estimated recurrence rate is 23-50% after the first episode (3). Optimal treatment of
      patients presenting with a first episode of primary spontaneous pneumothorax remains unknown.
      In the recently published British Thoracic Society (BTS) guidelines (4), simple aspiration is
      recommended as first line treatment for all primary pneumothoraces requiring intervention.
      However, the 1 year recurrence rate of this procedure was as high as 26-30% (5), making it
      inappropriate as a standard of care.

      Intrapleural instillation of a chemical irritant (chemical pleurodesis) is an effective way
      to shorten the duration of air leaks and reduce the rates of recurrent spontaneous
      pneumothorax in surgical and non-surgical patients (6, 7). Light et al. has shown that
      intrapleural tetracycline is effective in reducing the rate of ipsilateral recurrence for
      patients with spontaneous pneumothorax (7). However, the recently published guidelines
      recommended that chemical pleurodesis should only be attempted if the patient is either
      unwilling or unable to undergo surgery because the rates of recurrence of pneumothoraces
      after surgical intervention either by thoracotomy or VATS, with or without surgical
      pleurodesis, is far less than after chemical pleurodesis (4, 8). As a result, chemical
      pleurodesis has rarely been used in primary spontaneous pneumothorax, and the effect of
      additional chemical pleurodesis after simple aspiration in preventing recurrence of
      pneumothoraces has never been evaluated.

      Tetracycline, which was the most commonly used irritant, is no longer available. Minocycline,
      a derivative of tetracycline, is as effective as tetracycline in inducing pleural fibrosis in
      rabbits (9). In the previous studies, we have shown that additional minocycline pleurodesis
      is a safe and convenient procedure that associates with lower rates of prolonged air leaks
      and ipsilateral recurrence after thoracoscopic treatment of primary spontaneous pneumothorax
      (10, 11).

      In the present study, additional minocycline pleurodesis will be randomly administered in
      patients with first episode of primary spontaneous pneumothorax after simple aspiration to
      test if it can reduce the rate of recurrence. This study will comply with the protocol, GCP
      and applicable requirement of the Institutional Review Boards (IRB) of the NTUH and Far
      Eastern Memorial Hospital.

      Patients and Methods:

      Study design This study is a prospective, randomized, controlled trial to evaluate if
      additional minocycline pleurodesis after simple aspiration will be effective in preventing
      recurrence of primary spontaneous pneumothorax.

             5. Active infection requiring i.v. antibiotics. Subjects who are unwilling to undergo
                randomization, treatment, or follow-up procedures will be removed from the study.
                Subjects can also withdraw from the trial at any time point by their will.

      Randomization:

      Patients will be randomized at each center with separate random number lists into one of the
      two treatment groups using a computer-generated table numerically corresponding with the
      treatment group. The trial treatment randomization codes will be maintained until the end of
      the study and will be broken by investigators who were blind to the randomization procedure.

      Manual aspiration Manual aspiration will be performed as follows: patients were seated in
      semi-supine position. After skin disinfection and field preparation, a small-caliber pig-tail
      catheter (6-10 French) will be introduced after local anesthesia with 2% lidocaine in the
      second intercostal space, at the midclavicular line. After the catheter enters the pleural
      space, the catheter will be fixed to the skin using sterile adhesive tape and connected via a
      three-way valve to a 50-ml syringe. Air will be manually aspirated, until a resistance was
      felt and air was no longer aspirated. Thereafter, a chest X-ray will be performed with the
      catheter in place.

      Minocycline pleurodesis In the minocycline group, 30 mL of 1% lidocaine hydrochloride (300mg)
      followed by a solution of 30 mL of normal saline containing 300 mg of minocycline (Mirosin®,
      Taiwan Panbiotic Laboratories, Kaohsiung, Taiwan) will be instilled into the pleural cavity
      through the pig-tail catheter or chest tube. In the observation group, nothing will be
      administered. Administration of other chemical pleurodesis agents is prohibited during the
      study period. Intramuscular meperidine hydrochloride (Demerol®, 50mg/ampule) will be
      administered every 4 to 6 hours according to the patient's request if the pain became
      intolerable, could not be relieved by oral analgesics, and visual analogue scale was greater
      than 7. Chest radiography will be performed immediate postoperatively or the next morning.
      VAS will be evaluated immediately 6 hours later after minocycline administration.

      Study Endpoints:

      The primary end point will be rate of ipsilateral recurrence after the procedure. Secondary
      end points include safety, early results, and long-term effects of minocycline pleurodesis.

      Immediate success rates: defined as complete or nearly complete and persistent lung expansion
      immediately following manual aspiration. Immediate success for chest tube drainage is defined
      as complete lung expansion, absence of air leakage, and chest drain removal within 24 hours
      after catheter placement.

      One weeks success rates are defined as complete and persistent lung expansion at one weeks
      after the first attempt of aspiration or tube insertion.

      One-year success: absence of recurrent pneumothorax during a 1-year follow-up period. .

      Safety assessments:

      Safety assessments will consist of monitoring and recording all toxicity, adverse events,
      safety laboratory examination, vital signs, physical examination. The adverse events which
      are not reported will be graded as mild, moderate, severe, and life-threatening. Adverse
      event will be tabulated and the incidence rates will be calculated.

      Sample size estimation:

      A sample size of 300 patients (150 in each group) will be needed to reach clinical
      significance (at the .05 level with a power of 0.9) if minocycline reduced the recurrence
      rate from 30% to 15% and the drop out rate is 10%. A planned interim analysis will be
      conducted after enrollment of 150 patients with at least 12 months of follow-up. Statistical
      analysis will be performed on an intent-to-treat basis rather than in an actual treatment
      basis.

      Follow-up After discharge from the hospital, patients will be followed at the outpatient
      clinics at 1 week, 1 month, 3 months, and 6 months where chest radiography will be performed.
      Follow-ups will then be conducted every 6 months by a registered nurse who is blinded to the
      group allocation by telephone conversation, according to a standard questionnaire that
      included when the patient returns to work or school, whether a recurrence occurred, when it
      happened, and how it is treated. Residual postoperative chest pain will be evaluated on a
      pain score from 0 to 5, where 0 is pain free; 1 is occasional discomfort; 2 is occasional use
      of analgesics; 3 is using nonopiate analgesics; 4 is regular pain using opiates; 5 is severe
      and intractable pain. All patients will be followed for at least 12 months. Patients can come
      back to the clinic or visit emergency department whenever they have chest pain, dyspnea, or
      any signs related to the recurrence of pneumothorax.

      Pulmonary function analysis Pulmonary function tests will be performed for patients able to
      attend a hospital outpatient appointment at least 6 months after surgery. Forced vital
      capacity (FVC) and forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1.0) will be measured using a
      spirometer of Microspiro HI-298 (Chest Corporation, Tokyo, Japan) with the patients seated. A
      minimum of three acceptable forced expiratory maneuvers will be performed and the best one
      will be selected for analysis.

      Data collection and statistical analysis The clinical data, duration of chest drainage,
      length of hospital stay, complications, requested doses of meperidine, and data of VAS will
      be collected. Continuous variables such as age or weight will be expressed as the mean +
      standard deviation and analyzed by the two sample t-test. Categorical variables such as
      gender or smoking status will be presented by frequency (%) and analyzed by the Fisher's
      exact test. Intensity of postoperative pain measured by VAS (from 0 to 10) were summarized by
      mean (95 percent confidence interval) and compared by Wilcoxon rank-sum test. Scores of
      residual chest pain will be analyzed by the Wilcoxon rank-sum test. Freedom from recurrence
      will be analyzed by the Kaplan-Meier method, and comparisons will be made by the log-rank
      test.
