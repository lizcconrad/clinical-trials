  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators hypothesize that an increase in the duration of dialysis session in thrice
      weekly center hemodialysis may provide better outcome, less morbidity, higher quality of
      life, lesser requirement of medications, and lower total cost.

      The proposed prospective and controlled clinical trial aims to compare 4-hour and 8-hour
      dialysis sessions in thrice weekly center HD regarding mortality, hospitalization rate,
      several clinical and laboratory parameters, and total cost. Four hundred and ten HD patients
      will be taken into the study. The study will last for 12 months. The patients will be placed
      in two groups:

        1. Four-hour dialysis session, blood flow rate 300-400 ml/min

        2. Eight-hours dialysis session, blood flow rate 200-250 ml/min

      Sample size is estimated with following hypotheses: twelve months duration of follow-up;
      twelve months survival of the control group 85%; a bilateral alpha risk equal to 5%; an
      expectation that 12-months survival to be 95% by 8-hours dialysis; a 85% power to detect the
      decrease in annual mortality by 8-hours dialysis comparing to 4-hours dialysis; a 10% of
      dropout rate. The required sample is total 410 patients.
