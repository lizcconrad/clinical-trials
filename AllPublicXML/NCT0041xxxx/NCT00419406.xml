  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a very common disorder that is characterized by pruritic
      inflammatory skin lesions, with patients usually having an individual or family history of
      atopic diseases in their background. Phototherapy is among the first-line approaches in the
      management of AD. In this context, a variety of studies have shown a beneficial effect of
      natural or artificial UV radiation in atopic dermatitis (AD). The past ten years have seen
      the introduction of new phototherapeutic regimens for AD, including UVA1 and NB-UVB.UVA1
      seems to be more effective than the above mentioned broadband spectra, in particular in acute
      severe AD. The aim of the present study is the comparison of UVA1 and NB-UVB phototherapy in
      the treatment of AD. Additionally, the course of several cytokines, human beta-defensins, and
      SMAD-proteins will be evaluated during the course of treatment.

      Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a very common disorder that is characterized by pruritic
      inflammatory skin lesions, with patients usually having an individual or family history of
      atopic diseases in their background (e.g., allergic asthma and rhinitis). Defective skin
      barrier, immunological dysfunctions (type I and IV allergy), genetic disorders, and
      psychological factors contribute to the pathogenesis of AD. However, among these factors,
      CD4+ Th cells are reported to play a particularly crucial role in the pathogenesis of AD.
      Phototherapy is among the first-line approaches in the management of AD. In this context, a
      variety of studies have shown a beneficial effect of natural or artificial UV radiation in
      atopic dermatitis (AD). Different broadband UV spectra (BB-UVA, BB-UVB, BB-UVA/BB-UVB) and
      combined treatment modalities such as balneophototherapy and PUVA have previously been proven
      to be effective in AD. However the past ten years have seen the introduction of new
      phototherapeutic regimens for AD, including UVA1 and NB-UVB.UVA1 seems to be more effective
      than the above mentioned broadband spectra, in particular in acute severe AD. The aim of the
      present study is the comparison of UVA1 and NB-UVB phototherapy in the treatment of AD.
      Additionally, the course of several cytokines, human beta-defensins, and SMAD-proteins will
      be evaluated during the course of treatment.
