          -  Male subjects agree to refrain from sperm donation from check-in until 30 days beyond
             the conclusion of all study events.

          -  Male subjects must agree to the use of condoms with spermicide with sexual intercourse
             from 14 days prior to check-in until 30 days beyond the last dose of study drug.

          -  Resting heart rate â‰¥ 50 beats per minute (bpm)

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  History or presence of any clinically significant events, which in the opinion of the
             investigator, would jeopardize the safety of the subject or impact the validity of the
             study results.

          -  Subjects with systolic blood pressure &lt; 90 mmHg or diastolic blood pressure &lt; 50 mmHg

             chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)

          -  Use of any prescription drug within 1 month of starting the study

          -  Positive urine screen for alcohol or drugs at screening, unless the test is shown to
             be falsely positive on confirmation testing.

          -  Hemoglobin &lt; 12g/dL

          -  Donation of blood or significant blood loss within 56 days prior to check in.

          -  Donation of plasma within 7 days prior check in.

          -  Participation in an investigational study within 30 days prior to check in.

          -  Positive screening test for HIV or Hepatitis B or C.

          -  A past history of cigarette smoking of &gt; 10 pack-years or use of nicotine or
