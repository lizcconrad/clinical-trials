  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will quantify the intraocular pressure elevation in the immediate time period
      following intravitreous injection. With more widespread use of intravitreous injections in
      patients that may require several injections per year, it is important to document the sudden
      increase in intraocular pressure, including the maximum intraocular pressure and the time
      required for the intraocular pressure to return to baseline. This data may be useful in
      stimulating additional studies to evaluate the long term ocular effects of repeated
      intravitreous injections.

      We hypothesize that the intraocular pressure increases significantly following intravitreous
      injection and then returns to baseline during the initial thirty minutes following
      ranibizumab injection.

      We will assess the trend of intraocular pressure immediately following intravitreal injection
      of ranibizumab 0.5 mg (0.05 mL) by taking serial intraocular pressure readings every five
      minutes for thirty minutes after injection. This study is a prospective descriptive data
      collection consisting of measuring intraocular pressure immediately following intraocular
      injection, and at 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, and 30 minutes following injection of ranibizumab 0.5
      mg.
