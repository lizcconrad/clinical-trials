  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Study FT3.6k-2006 is a single centre (the Mater Hospital, Sydney), blinded trial of a
      diagnostic test for breast cancer, with outcomes compared to the gold standard of screening
      mammogram followed by biopsy where required. This study aims to perform X-ray diffraction
      analysis of coded hair samples from women with a documented breast health status, to validate
      the findings of James et al (Nature 398: 33-4, 1999; Int J Cancer 114: 969-72, 2005) who
      showed that the presence of breast cancer could be detected using synchrotron-derived x-ray
      diffraction of human hair (scalp or pubic). The aim is also to characterise the sensitivity
      and specificity of the hair test in detecting breast cancer in a screening setting, and to
      determine the significance of a positive hair test and a negative mammogram.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The test has the potential to improve the diagnostic (and consequently therapeutic) paradigm
      for breast cancer.

      Women attending a radiology clinic in the Mater Hospital, Sydney, for a mammogram will be
      invited to participate in the study. A few hairs will be cut from their head or pubic region,
      put into a coded container and sent to the sponsor for analysis by synchrotron-x-ray
      diffraction. Although an imperfect standard for a variety of reasons, mammography is the
      standard screening assay, and confirmation of the pathology of the lesions found by
      mammography is carried out by biopsy. This will be the standard to which the hair test
      results will be compared. A negative mammogram will confirm a negative hair test, but a
      negative mammogram combined with a positive hair diffraction test will need a different
      approach. In the event of a positive hair test and a negative second read of the mammogram,
      the patient will be contacted by the referring practitioner. Patients in this category will
      be offered a breast MRI. A negative breast MRI under these circumstances will be classified
      as a true negative.
