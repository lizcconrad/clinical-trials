  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Diagnostic uncertainty in patients with complaints of shortness of breath presenting to the
      Emergency Department of a hospital may delay treatment and proper care. In patients with
      shortness of breath due to heart failure increased plasma levels of NT-pro-B-type natriuretic
      peptide (NT-proBNP) can be demonstrated. The use of NT-proBNP as a biomarker for heart
      failure in patients presenting to the emergency department with dyspnea might improve care
      and reduce length of hospital stay.

      To investigate the effect of NT-proBNP testing on patient care and time to discharge the
      NT-proBNP test will be randomized. In patients in the study group, the NT-proBNP plasma level
      is determined at admission and the physician in charge will immediately receive the result of
      the test. In patients in the control group blood will be sampled but the physician will
      recieve no information on the NT-proBNP plasma level.

      In our study we will investigate the effect of introduction of NT-proBNP as biomarker for
      heart failure on treatment, time to discharge and costs.
