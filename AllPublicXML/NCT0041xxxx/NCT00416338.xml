  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Peritoneal dialysis accounts for more than 70% of the dialysis modality in Hong Kong. Exit
      site infection (ESI) is one of the causes leading to peritoneal catheter removal. Appropriate
      exit-site care can prevent ESI. As the presence of a causative organism is essential in ESI,
      eliminating organism invasion may be useful in preventing ESI. In the present study, an exit
      site care method aiming at preventing organism invasion is developed to investigate its
      effectiveness in reducing ESI. It is also hoped the present study can help to develop an exit
      site care method that can reduce the frequency of exit site dressing so as to reduce the
      burden of patients and to improve their quality of life.

      Weâ€™ll recruit one hundred new chronic peritoneal dialysis patients into the study. The
      patients will be divided into two groups. One group of the patients will use film-dressing
      method (F) and the other group will use simple gauze dressing method (G). F group patients
      will have the exit site covered with a dressing film and keep it intact for 7 days after
      having the exit site cleaned with antiseptic solution. G group patients will clean the exit
      site with antiseptic solution and change the simple gauze dressing daily.

      The outcomes of the two groups will be compared. The outcome will be expressed in terms of
      exit site infection free period, peritonitis free period and exit site condition
      classification. Patient subjective quality of life will also be compared at first and twelfth
      month.

    We encounter technical problems to continue with the study. (Notably difficulty in teaching the
    patients to use the dressing set involved in the study.)
