  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The specific aim of this study is to demonstrate that inserting a breathing tube using a
      standard laryngoscope with the patient fully anesthetized is a safe and effective means of
      securing the airway in a patient with cervical spine disk herniation or stenosis. The two
      groups compared are composed of those who are intubated with direct laryngoscopy and those
      who are intubated with a fiberoptic scope.
