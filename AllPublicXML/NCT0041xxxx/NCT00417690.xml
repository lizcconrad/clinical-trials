  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this 4 week study is to determine whether PASER®, an approved delayed-release
      oral formulation of 4-aminosalicylic acid, in doses of 4 grams three times daily for 2 weeks
      followed by 4 grams twice daily for 2 weeks, will resolve an acute flare of ileocecal Crohn's
      disease.
