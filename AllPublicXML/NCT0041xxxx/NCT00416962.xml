        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Healthy male or female subjects aged 18 to 45 years, and in good health as determined
             by past medical history, physical examination, vital signs, electrocardiogram, and
             laboratory tests

          -  Vital signs within the following ranges:

               -  oral body temperature 35.0 - 37.5°C

               -  pulse rate 40 - 90 bpm

          -  Female subjects of child bearing potential must be using double-barrier local
             contraception (for example, intra-uterine device plus condom, or spermicidal gel plus
             condom) or have been surgically sterilized at least 6 months prior before study start,

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Smokers (use of tobacco products in the previous 3 months). Smokers will be defined as

          -  Female subjects who are pregnant or lactating

          -  Participation in any clinical investigation involving medical intervention within 4
             week prior to study start.

          -  Donation or loss of ≥ 400 mL of blood within 8 weeks prior to study start, or longer
             if required by local regulation.

          -  Significant illness within 2 weeks before study start.

          -  A past personal or close family medical history of clinically significant ECG
             abnormalities or of a prolonged QT-interval syndrome.

          -  History of autonomic dysfunction (for example, history of fainting).

          -  History of acute or chronic bronchospastic disease (including asthma and chronic

             urticaria, eczematous dermatitis). A known hypersensitivity to the study drug or to
             similar drugs.

          -  Any surgical or medical condition which might significantly alter the absorption,
             distribution, metabolism or excretion of drugs, or which may jeopardize the subject in
             case of participation in the study, including bowel, gastrointestinal, renal,
             pancreatic, hepatic, hematological, immunological, or neurological disorders.
