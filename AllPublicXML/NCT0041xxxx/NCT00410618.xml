      RATIONALE: Learning about the long-term effects of chemotherapy and radiation therapy on
      brain function may help doctors plan cancer treatments.

      PURPOSE: This clinical trial is looking at the neurological effects of chemotherapy and
      radiation therapy in patients with colon cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Identify the nature and long-term ramifications of CNS injury as a result of cancer
           treatment in patients with colon cancer.

      Secondary

        -  Analyze differences in cognitive measures and MRI data in these patients.

        -  Correlate MRI measures with cognitive performance in these patients.

      OUTLINE: Patients undergo cognitive performance assessment and MRI.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 42 patients will be accrued for this study.
