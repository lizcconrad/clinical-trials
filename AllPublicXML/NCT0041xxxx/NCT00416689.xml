      RATIONALE: Understanding how nausea or vomiting caused by chemotherapy effects a patient's
      treatment decisions may help doctors plan better cancer treatment and may help patients live
      more comfortably.

      PURPOSE: This clinical trial is studying nausea or vomiting in patients who are receiving
      chemotherapy for breast cancer or lung cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine the contribution of nausea or vomiting to the overall importance for a current
           state of health in patients with breast or lung cancer undergoing chemotherapy.

        -  Determine the average importance for various emetic scenarios in these patients.

        -  Compare the importance of a specific level of chemotherapy-induced nausea or vomiting,
           defined by the Standard Gamble vs Morrow Assessment of Nausea and Emesis.

        -  Determine the feasibility of using a Standard Gamble technique in patients currently
           undergoing chemotherapy.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to history of
      chemotherapy-induced nausea or vomiting (yes vs no).

      Patients undergo a structured interview over 1 hour by a trained interviewer at least 2½
      weeks after initiation of the most recent course of chemotherapy and before the new course is
      administered. Patients complete a Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-General
      questionnaire and Morrow Assessment of Nausea and Emesis questionnaire during the interview.
      The trained interviewer also administers a Standard Gamble exercise during the interview, in
      which patients are instructed to imagine various amounts of nausea or vomiting as their
      current state of nausea and vomiting, and rank their importance to them. They are being asked
      to answer the question of whether they would choose to accept their current (imagined or
      real) state of nausea or vomiting or receive a medication that would result (with various
      probabilities) in either perfect health for 2 years or immediate death.
