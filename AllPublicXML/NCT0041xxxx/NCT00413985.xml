  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether low birth weight (LBW) infants fed human
      milk (HM)supplemented with a specially designed powdered human milk fortifier until 12 weeks
      after hospital discharge will have better growth and neurodevelopment than infants fed HM
      alone.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Consensus exists in the literature that a significant proportion of low birth weight (LBW,
      &lt;1800 g) infants leave hospital with overt signs of under-nutrition (eg. growth retardation).
      Recent evidence from randomized control trials suggest that provision of nutrient-enriched
      feeding to formula-fed premature infants after hospital discharge improves their growth,
      accretion of lean body mass and bone mineral content compared to infants fed a standard term
      formula. While available data suggest an advantage of human milk feeding after hospital
      discharge, experimental evidence on which to base guidelines to enrich, or not to enrich,
      human milk (HM) are notably absent.
