    <textblock>
      This is a two part study. Part I is designed to test single doses of GSK678586A in healthy
      volunteers. Part II is designed to test repeat doses (two doses) of GSK679586A in patients
      with mild asthma. Both parts are designed to investigate the safety, tolerability and the way
      the body absorbs GSK679586A when given by intravenous infusion (through a vein in your arm).

             ex-smokers who have given up smoking for &gt;12 months with a history &lt;10 pack years
             [Pack yrs = (No of cigarettes/day x No of years smoked)/20]

          -  Available to complete all study measurements.

          -  Able to read, comprehend, and write English at a sufficient level to complete study
             related materials.

          -  Capable of giving written informed consent, which includes compliance with the

        Additional Inclusion Criteria for Subjects in Part I

        • Healthy as determined by a responsible physician, based on a medical evaluation including
        history, physical examination, laboratory tests, cardiac monitoring.

        Additional Inclusion Criteria for Subjects in Part II

          -  History of asthma for at least 6 months prior to the screening visit currently
             requiring no treatment or intermittent treatment with inhaled short-acting
             beta2-agonist only. Subject must not have received low dose inhaled corticosteroids
             within three months prior to Day 0.

          -  Pre-bronchodilator FEV1 &gt;70% but &lt;90% of predicted at screening with ≥12%
             reversibility after short-acting beta2-agonist or If the subject has a
             pre-bronchodilator FEV1 ≥90% at screening but has a history of asthma or if the
             subject meets the FEV1 criteria but does not demonstrate ≥12% reversibility after
             short-acting beta2-agonist administration, then the subject may be considered eligible
             if a Bronchial Provocation Test for asthma is positive (and after consultation with
             Medical Monitor and Principal Investigator). The bronchial provocation will be
             considered positive when the standard criteria for a positive response with the given
             challenge agent are met.

          -  Skin prick test positive for an allergen that is appropriate for nasal challenge

        Exclusion criteria:

          -  As a result of medical interview, physical examination or screening investigations,
             the responsible physician deemed the subject unsuitable for the study.

          -  History of sensitivity to any of the study medications, or components thereof or a
             history of drug or other allergy that, in the opinion of the physician responsible,

          -  The subject has participated in a clinical trial and has received a drug or a new
             chemical entity within 30 days or 5 half-lives, or twice the duration of the
             biological effect of any drug(whichever is longer) prior to the first dose of current
             study medication

          -  The subject is unable to refrain from travelling to countries with a high prevalence
             of infectious (especially parasitic) disease from when the first dose is administered
             until the expected washout period is complete (plasma levels below LLQ) or the last
             follow-up visit, which ever is later
