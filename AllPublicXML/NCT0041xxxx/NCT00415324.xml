  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This trial is studying the side effects and best dose of eribulin mesylate and cisplatin in
      treating patients with advanced solid tumors.Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as eribulin
      mesylate and cisplatin, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by
      killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Giving more than one drug (combination
      chemotherapy) may kill more tumor cells.

      Primary Objectives:

      I. To determine the maximum tolerated dose of E7389 and cisplatin in patients with advanced
      solid tumors.

      II. To determine the safety and toxicity of this regimen in these patients. III. To determine
      the pharmacokinetics of this regimen in these patients.

      Outline: This is a multicenter, dose-escalation study. Patients receive eribulin mesylate IV
      over 5 minutes on days 1, 8, and 15 and cisplatin IV over 30-60 minutes on day 1. Courses
      repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed for up to 8 weeks.
