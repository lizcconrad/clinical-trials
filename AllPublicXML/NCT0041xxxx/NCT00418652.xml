      Trans Cranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) over dorsal visual system will disturb the ability
      to identify objects with decreased level of fragmentation
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The participants performed two tasks under three different TMS conditions: no TMS, 10Hz TMS
      for over the dorsal stream (PO3 EEG site) or over the vertex.

      First they performed a perceptual closure task which asked them to identify an object in a
      series of six progressively less degraded pictures.

      Then, they also performed a control task previously shown not to be mediated by the LOC and
      not to be impaired in schizophrenia: The perception of illusory contours.

    <description>The subjects performed 2 tasks:
The primary dependent measures consisted of the level of detail needed for correct object identification, response accuracy, and response time in milliseconds for correct responses.
Illusory Contour Task: Subjects also performed a pulsed pedestal task, Participants were shown 55 drawings for 500 ms each. Some drawings contained partial contours which defined a geometric shape, while in others the contours did not define a shape. Participants were asked to indicate whether they recognized a geometric shape or not. Accuracy and response time were measured.</description>
