  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to assess the efficacy of two doses of Keppra XR
      compared with a historical control as the placebo, in the monotherapy treatment of partial
      onset seizures.

    <measure>The Cumulative Exit Rate at 112 Days After the Beginning of the Previous Antiepileptic Drug (AED) Tapering Phase</measure>
    <time_frame>112 days</time_frame>
    <description>Cumulative exit rate at day 112, based on the duration between start date of previous AED tapering to the earliest date exit criterion was met; calculated using Kaplan Meier Methods. Subjects prematurely discontinued for reasons unrelated to exit criteria were censored as of last dose of study drug. Subjects who completed without meeting exit criteria were censored at Day 112. Exit criteria include increase in seizure frequency, severity, duration, status epilepticus, or new generalized seizure. Upper 95% 2-sided confidence limit for exit rate is compared to the historical control rate: 0.678.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>The Cumulative Rate of Exit Events, Which Include Discontinuation Due to Exit Criteria, Withdrawal Due to Adverse Events (AE) and Withdrawal Due to Lack of Efficacy, at 112 Days After the Beginning of Previous Antiepileptic Drug (AED) Tapering Phase</measure>
    <time_frame>112 days</time_frame>
    <description>The cumulative exit event rate at Day 112 was calculated using Kaplan Meier methods. The exit event rate estimate was based on the duration between the start date of previous AED tapering to the earliest date an exit event occured. Subjects who prematurely discontinued for reasons unrelated to exit criteria, adverse event, or lack of efficacy were censored as of the last dose of study medication. Subjects who completed the study without having an exit event were censored as of Day 112.</description>

    <description>The cumulative exit event rate at Day 112 was calculated using Kaplan Meier methods. The exit event rate estimate was based on the duration between the start date of previous AED tapering to the earliest date an exit event occured.

    <measure>The Cumulative Exit Rate at 112 Days for the Keppra XR 1000 mg Group After the Beginning of the Previous Antiepileptic Drug (AED) Tapering Phase</measure>
    <time_frame>112 days</time_frame>
    <description>Keppra XR 1000 mg arm was not intended for inferential analysis (planned 3 to 1 randomization, Keppra XR 2000 mg: 1000 mg). The Exit Rate was based on the duration between the start date of previous AED tapering to the earliest date an exit crterion was met. Subjects who prematurely discontinued for reasons unrelated to exit criteria were censored as of the last dose of study medication. Subjects who completed the study without meeting an exit criterion were censored as of Day 112.</description>

        <description>Cumulative exit rate at day 112, based on the duration between start date of previous AED tapering to the earliest date exit criterion was met; calculated using Kaplan Meier Methods. Subjects prematurely discontinued for reasons unrelated to exit criteria were censored as of last dose of study drug. Subjects who completed without meeting exit criteria were censored at Day 112. Exit criteria include increase in seizure frequency, severity, duration, status epilepticus, or new generalized seizure.

        <title>The Cumulative Rate of Exit Events Due to Any Reasons at 112 Days After the Beginning of Previous Antiepileptic Drug (AED) Tapering Phase</title>
        <description>The cumulative exit event rate at Day 112 was calculated using Kaplan Meier methods. The exit event rate estimate was based on the duration between the start date of previous AED tapering to the earliest date an exit event occured.

        <description>Keppra XR 1000 mg arm was not intended for inferential analysis (planned 3 to 1 randomization, Keppra XR 2000 mg: 1000 mg). The Exit Rate was based on the duration between the start date of previous AED tapering to the earliest date an exit crterion was met. Subjects who prematurely discontinued for reasons unrelated to exit criteria were censored as of the last dose of study medication.
