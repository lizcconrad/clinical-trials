  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cold and dry air induce exercise induced asthma. Yoga training may improve lung function
      tests. Bikram Yoga (heat 39 degree Celsius and humidity 60%)training may improve both lung
      function tests and bronchial hyperreactivity (to exercise and adenosine 5'monophosphate).

  <detailed_description>

      15 young adults with exercise induced asthma and 10 healthy young adults will participate in
      2 months taining of Bikram Yoga in Tel Aviv. They will perform sessions of 90 minutes
      training at least 5 times a week. Lung function tests, bronchial challenges (exercise and
      AMP) and progressive exercise test will be performed before and after the 2 month training at
      Hadassah University Hospital in Jerusalem in the asthmatic patients. Healthy adults will
      perform only lung function tsts and progressive exercise before and after training.
