  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      We previously demonstrated that postconditioning by coronary angioplasty can decrease infarct
      size (as measured by cardiac enzyme release) in patients with ongoing acute myocardial
      infarction. It is currently unknown whether postconditioning actually decreases or simply
      delays myocardial cell death during reperfusion. In addition, the long term effects of
      postconditioning on recovery of myocardial contraction remains elusive. The objective of the
      present study is to determine whether infarct size reduction by angioplasty postconditioning
      is maintained at 6 months and whether functional recovery is improved at one year
      post-infarction.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Randomized, controlled, single-blinded trial comparing postconditioning to control (no
      intervention). Postconditioning consists of four episodes of one minute inflation followed by
      one minute deflation of the angioplasty balloon, starting within one minute of reflow after
      direct stenting of the occluded coronary artery.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Male and female patients, aged more than 18, with suspected first acute myocardial
             infarction, within 6 hours of the onset of chest pain, with a need for emergency
             revascularization by angioplasty. Patients must display a fully occluded (TIMI zero
             flow) culprit coronary artery, absence of visible collaterals and exhibit TIMI flow &gt;2
             after direct stenting by angioplasty.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Cardiac arrest or cardiogenic shock

          -  occlusion of the circumflex coronary artery
