    <textblock>
      PROJECT CHEER is a randomized controlled trial designed to test the effectiveness of a
      comprehensive focused approach to headache care. Three institutions are collaborating in this
      trial by establishing special Headache Programs that can provide individualized treatment and
      follow-up: Duke University Medical Center in Durham, NC; Thomas Jefferson University in
      Philadelphia, PA; and Kaiser Permanente in San Diego, CA. Support and oversight are provided
      by the U.S. Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality.

      HEADACHE sufferers age 18 and over whose headaches interfere with their ability to work,
      study or enjoy life are eligible for this trial. Half of the enrolled individuals will be
      selected at random to receive care in the Headache Program and half will continue to receive
      care as usual from their primary care providers.

      EVALUATION is an important part of this project. Every participant completes a screening
      interview and survey at the time of enrollment. The initial evaluation will provide an
      accurate diagnosis of headache type(s). The results of this evaluation will be reported to
      the primary care provider and may help to provide usual care. Subjects assigned to the
      Headache Program are further evaluated by the program manager in consultation with a headache
      specialist.

      EDUCATION in headache care is provided to participants assigned to the Headache Program.

      The classes include suggestions on diet and lifestyle as well as a review of medication use.

    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether headache management programs should be
      promoted as a preferred strategy for managing patients with chronic disabling headache.

      Chronic headache affects between 6% and 17% of the population and is associated with
      significant numbers of days lost from work and reduced quality of life, as well as
      disproportionate use of medical resources. Current treatment is sub-optimal, with patients
      often not adequately diagnosed and/or not receiving appropriate preventive and acute
      pharmacologic therapy or behavioral modification. As a result, chronic headache is associated
      with sub-optimal quality of care, high patient dissatisfaction as well as high cost to
      individuals, insurers, and society.

      The specific hypothesis of this study is that a properly designed headache management program
      (HMP) will reduce headache-related disability, improve process of care, and reduce management
      costs for patients with chronic headache. The format is a randomized controlled trial in
      which a patient population participating in a HMP will be compared with a corresponding
      patient population receiving usual care. A pilot study1 has determined the components of an
      optimal HMP and the effectiveness of a prototype of this service with a limited number of
      patients at a Kaiser Permanente facility in Santa Rosa, California.
