  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate whether creating a gastrotomy (hole in the stomach)
      during gastric surgery increases a patient's risk of intra-abdominal infection.

      We hypothesize that a gastrotomy does not contaminate the abdomen with clinically significant
      bacterial pathogens.

      We propose to investigate the bacterial load and contamination patients experience during
      laparoscopic roux-en-y gastric bypass while having their gastrotomy for gastrojejunostomy. In
      all patients who undergo laparoscopic roux-en-y gastric bypass, the stomach must be opened to
      the peritoneal cavity while placing an anvil for gastrojejunostomy.

      Samples of gastric fluid will be collected and sent for analysis in all patients. Samples of
      peritoneal fluid will be collected prior to and after the creation of the gastrotomy, using
      intraperitoneal irrigation with approximately 500 cc of normal saline. Bacterial counts and
      identification will be recorded for each sample.
