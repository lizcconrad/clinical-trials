        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Healthy female subjects age 18 to 45 years (inclusive) in good health as determined by
             past medical history, physical examination, vital signs assessments,
             electrocardiogram, and laboratory tests at screening and baseline..

          -  Female subjects of child bearing potential must be using a double-barrier local
             contraception i.e. intra-uterine device plus condom, or spermicidal gel plus condom
             for at least 3 months prior to Study start or postmenopausal females must have had no
             regular menstrual bleeding for at least 1 year prior to inclusion (Menopause will be
             confirmed by a plasma FSH level of &gt;40 IU/L) or female subjects must have been
             surgically sterilized at least 6 months prior to screening with supportive clinical
             documentation.

        and all female subjects must have negative pregnancy results at screening and each baseline
        (regardless of reported reproductive status).

          -  Body mass index (BMI) must be 18 – 30 kg/m2 (inclusive) and subjects must weigh at
             least 50 kg.

          -  Vital signs should be within the following ranges: oral body temperature between
             35.0-37.5 °C, systolic blood pressure, 90-140 mm Hg, diastolic blood pressure, 50-90
             mm Hg, pulse rate, 40 - 90 beats per minute (bpm)

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Smokers (use of tobacco products within the previous 3 months). Smokers will be
             defined who reports tobacco use or has a urine cotinine value of ≥ 300 ng/mL.

          -  Use of any prescription drugs within 4 weeks prior dosing, or over-the-counter (OTC)
             medication (vitamins, herbal supplements, dietary supplements) within 2 weeks prior to
             dosing. Acetominophen is acceptable, with supportive clinical documentation..

          -  Participation in any clinical investigation within a minimum of 4 weeks prior to
             dosing (or longer if local regulations apply).
