      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of
      nitazoxanide-peginterferon alfa-2b combination therapy compared to peginterferon monotherapy
      in patients that are treatment naive or pre-treated for 24 weeks with nitazoxanide
      monotherapy in the treatment of chronic hepatitis C.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Age â‰¥18 years.

          -  Chronic hepatitis C infection (at least 6 months) evidenced by a positive enzyme
             immunoassay for anti-HCV-antibodies and a positive quantitative RT-PCR amplification
             of HCV RNA.

          -  Chronic inflammation on liver biopsy compatible with a diagnosis of chronic viral
             hepatitis.

          -  HCV genotype 4.

          -  Patients that have not previously received peginterferon.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients unable to take oral medications.

          -  Use of ribavirin within 30 days prior to enrollment.

          -  Females who are either pregnant, breast-feeding or not using birth control and are
             sexually active.

          -  Any investigational drug therapy within 30 days prior to enrollment other than through
             Romark study number RM01-3027.

          -  Patients with other causes of liver disease.

          -  Transplant recipients receiving immune suppression therapy.

          -  Patient co-infected with human immunodeficiency virus, hepatitis A virus, hepatitis B
             virus, or hepatitis D virus based on enzyme immunoassay.

          -  Patients with decompensated cirrhosis, thrombocytopenia (platelet count &lt;80,000),
             neutropenia, history of variceal bleeding, ascites, hepatic encephalopathy or CTP
             scores &gt;6.

          -  Patients with history of alcoholism (unless abstinent for 2 years) or with an alcohol
             consumption of &gt;20 grams per day.

          -  Patients who are clinically unstable.

          -  Patients with any concomitant condition that, in the opinion of the investigator would
             preclude evaluation of response or make it unlikely that the contemplated course of
             therapy and follow-up could be completed.

          -  History of hypersensitivity or intolerance to any of the excipients comprising the
             nitazoxanide tablets or peginterferon alfa-2b solution for injection.
