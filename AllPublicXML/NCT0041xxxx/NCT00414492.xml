  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Systemic chemotherapy for metastatic colon cancer is often used in the neoadjuvant setting
      for patients undergoing liver resection. This treatment is given either to keep the tumor at
      bay or reduce its size before the time of resection. While many metastatic tumors might
      appear to respond well and even radiographically disappear following neoadjuvant therapy, it
      is unclear whether grossly or radiographically negative areas of previous disease are
      microscopically free of tumor cells. As such, when possible, resection boarders typically
      follow 1 cm margins from the tumor size prior to neoadjuvant therapy. These margins might be
      necessary to encompass all histologically present disease or they might be unnecessarily
      large, serving only to increase the mortality and morbidity of the operation. This study
      begins to address this question by a histological examination of the pattern of cell death in
      areas of metastases removed after neoadjuvant therapy. Furthermore, clinical cases in which
      neoadjuvant therapy allowed for resection of previously unresectable cancer will be examined
      to determine whether there is an increased rate of recurrence despite &quot;negative&quot; resection
      boundaries in these cases.
