      This study is for the patient with colon cancer, who is going to have colon cancer surgery.
      The purpose of this research study is to examine a specific lymph node, called the sentinel
      node. Lymph nodes are located throughout your body and cancer may spread by means of those
      lymph nodes. The sentinel node is the one located closest to your tumor. This study will find
      out if examining the sentinel node can help to predict disease progression. Since the value
      of this exam is unknown, taking part in this study will not change your clinical care.
