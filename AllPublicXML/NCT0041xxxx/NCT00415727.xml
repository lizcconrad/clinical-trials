      The hypothesis is that in sickle cell anaemia, nocturnal oxyhaemoglobin desaturation, is
      associated with low processing speed index, and this morbidity can be reduced with overnight
      auto Continuous Positive Airways Pressure and/or oxygen supplementation.

      Intervention: Overnight auto Continuous Positive Airways Pressure (CPAP) with oxygen
      supplementation if mean overnight oxyhaemoglobin saturation is not &gt;94% after 2 weeks of
      autoCPAP
