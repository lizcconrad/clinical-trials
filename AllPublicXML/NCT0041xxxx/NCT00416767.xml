      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as fluorouracil, leucovorin, and irinotecan, work
      in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by
      stopping them from dividing. Giving more than one drug (combination chemotherapy) may kill
      more tumor cells.

      PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well combination chemotherapy works as
      first-line therapy in treating patients with locally advanced or metastatic neuroendocrine
      tumors of the duodenum or pancreas that cannot be removed by surgery.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Determine the 6-month progression-free survival rate in patients with unresectable
           locally advanced or metastatic neuroendocrine tumors of the duodenum/pancreas treated
           with fluorouracil, leucovorin calcium, and irinotecan hydrochloride as first-line
           chemotherapy.

      Secondary

        -  Determine tumor and biologic response at 6, 12, 18, and 24 months in patients treated
           with this regimen.

        -  Determine the duration of response of the primary tumor in patients treated with this
           regimen.

        -  Determine the tolerability of this regimen in these patients.

        -  Determine the progression-free survival of patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Determine the overall survival of patients treated with this regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive irinotecan hydrochloride IV over 90 minutes and leucovorin calcium IV over 2
      hours on day 1 and fluorouracil IV over 46 hours on days 1 and 2. Courses repeat every 14
      days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study therapy, patients are followed every 3 months for 1 year and then
      every 6 months thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 20 patients will be accrued for this study.
