  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Tourette's disorder (TD) is a childhood-onset neuropsychiatric disorder, manifesting motor
      and vocal tics with increased likelihood of comorbid with attention-deficit/hyperactivity
      disorder (ADHD) and other psychiatric disorders. Literature documents the comorbid condition
      with ADHD predicts an increased functional deficit among individuals with ADHD. The
      information about neuropsychological functioning among individuals with TD adn/or ADHD is
      little in Asian population. This study aims to validate the diagnoses of TD, ADHD, and TD
      comorbid ADHD by symptomatology, neuropsychological measures, and social adjustment. This is
      a case-control study with a sample of 30 subjects with TD, 60 with ADHD, 30 with TD+ADHD, and
      60 controls aged from 6 to 18. All subjects will receive comprehensive assessment including
      standard psychiatric diagnostic interviews using (K-SADS-E), behavioral assessments (SNAP-IV,
      CPRS:R-S, CTRS:R-S, CBCL, YBOCS, YGTSS), social adjustment (SAICA, GCAS), parenting (PBI,
      APGAR) and neuropsychological assessment (CPT, CANTAB, WISC-III). We anticipate that this
      study will provide the primitive data to validate the TD and ADHD using neuropsychological
      and clinical measures.
