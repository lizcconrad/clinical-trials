        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Diagnosis of AS, as defined by Modified New York Criteria for Ankylosing Spondylitis.

          -  Active AS, defined by average of visual analog scale (VAS) of ≥ 30 for duration and
             intensity of morning stiffness and at least 2 of the following: VAS for patient global
             assessment ≥ 30; average of VAS for nocturnal and total pain ≥ 30; BASFI ≥ 30 (all
             scores on a scale of 0 to 100).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Complete ankylosis (fusion) of spine.

          -  Previous treatment with etanercept, antibody to Tumor Necrosis Factor α (TNFα), or
             other TNFα inhibitors or other biologic agents.

          -  Use of disease modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) other than hydroxychloroquine,
             sulphasalazine, and methotrexate within 4 weeks of baseline. Subjects treated with
             hydroxychloroquine, sulphasalazine, and methotrexate may continue these drugs during
             this study but doses must be held stable for 4 weeks before baseline examination and
             for the duration of the study.

          -  Receipt of multiple nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) at baseline.

          -  Dose of NSAID changed within 2 weeks of baseline evaluation.

          -  Dose of prednisone &gt;10 mg/day (or equivalent) or changed within 2 weeks of baseline
             evaluation.
