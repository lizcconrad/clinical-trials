      As clinical primary endpoints we assessed whether existed differences in:

        1. PSA recurrence rate stratified according to treatment modalities

        2. EGFR and HER2/neu overexpression rate stratified according to treatment modalities

        3. PSA recurrence rate stratified according to EGFR and HER2/neu overexpression levels.

      As secondary clinical endpoints we assessed whether existed differences in:

        1. prostate cancer-specific mortality according to treatment modalities

        2. prostate cancer-specific mortality stratified according to EGFR and HER2/neu
           overexpression levels.

      For this purpose a post treatment PSA-doubling time of less than 3 months found following PSA
      recurrence was considered as a surrogate endpoint for prostate cancer-specific mortality
      Pre-clinical endpoints As pre-clinical endpoint we assessed whether exist differences in
      efficacy rate of Bicalutamide and Gefitinib treatment in primary tumor cultures stratified
      for high and low EGFR and HER2/Neu expression levels. The evaluation of efficacy rate of
      these treatments was documented by comparing the differences of drugs IC50 values among the
      groups stratified for EGFR and HER2/Neu levels.
