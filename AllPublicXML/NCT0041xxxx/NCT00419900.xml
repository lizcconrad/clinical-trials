  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Using synchrotron X-ray diffraction, it has been reported that a hair from an individual with
      breast cancer exhibits a difference in its molecular structure compared to that of an
      individual without breast cancer. This difference is visible in the X-ray diffraction pattern
      as a ring superimposed on the pattern for normal hair.

      The hypothesis of this study is that synchrotron x-ray diffraction can be used to
      differentiate hairs from women with medically diagnosed breast cancer from women not known to
      have the disease.

      To test this hypothesis, hair from 2000 women attending radiology clinics for mammography
      will be collected, analysed by x-ray diffraction and then analysed using Fermiscan
      proprietary image analysis software. The mammogram status of the subjects will be blinded
      from the diffraction analysts. Results will then be compared with mammography results to
      allow a direct comparison between the Fermiscan test and mammography in terms of specificity
      and sensitivity.
