    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare the effects of bupropion + placebo to bupropion +
      naltrexone as treatments to help smokers quit. Bupropion is an FDA-approved medication for
      smoking cessation that is believed to provide relief from craving and withdrawal through
      promotion of two neurotransmitter chemicals, dopamine and noradrenaline. Naltrexone is an
      FDA-approved medication for the treatment of opiate and alcohol dependence, that appears to
      function through blocking certain opiate receptors in the brain. It is expected that
      bupropion + naltrexone will produce higher smoking quit rates than bupropion + placebo.
      Bupropion alone is effective in alleviating some nicotine withdrawal complaints and craving
      for nicotine. However, bupropion does not reduce the rewarding effects of slips to smoking.
      Naltrexone alone is not generally effective as a smoking cessation medication, but it does
      help to reduce the rewarding effects of slips to smoking. Thus, it may help to prevent full
      relapse to smoking. In addition, naltrexone can help to reduce craving for cigarettes. It is
      hypothesized that the differing complementary actions of the two drugs will help smokers more
      than bupropion alone. In addition to examining smoking quit rates, the proposed study will
      also look at psychological processes that change during smoking cessation including, nicotine
      withdrawal, nicotine craving, mood, impulsivity, and attention
