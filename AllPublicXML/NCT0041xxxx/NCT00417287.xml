  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is being conducted to evaluate the clinical efficacy, biologic activity
      (inhibition of PX-12 target thioredoxin-1) and effects of an expired metabolite of PX-12 in
      patients with advanced pancreatic cancer.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In a Phase I trial, PX-12 demonstrated anti-tumor activity and pharmacodynamic activity
      across a wide dose range. At higher doses, one side effect of the agent was a garlic-like
      odor of an expired metabolite. This study is being conducted to evaluate the clinical
      efficacy, biologic activity (inhibition of PX-12 target thioredoxin-1) and effects of the
      expired metabolite at two dose levels of PX-12. This study will determine if the efficacy and
      biologic activity achieved at either of the two dose levels is sufficient to proceed to
      further studies without pushing to the maximally tolerated dose.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Histologically- or cytologically-confirmed diagnosis of advanced carcinoma of the
             pancreas (stage IV disease only).

          -  Patients whose tumor has progressed on gemcitabine or on a gemcitabine-containing
             combination. Patients must have received no more than two prior regimens for
             metastatic disease. Use of gemcitabine as a radiation sensitizer in combination with
             radiotherapy for localized disease will not be considered a prior
             gemcitabine-containing regimen if gemcitabine was received for ≤ 1 month following
             completion of radiotherapy. In addition, the use of 5-fluorouracil as a radiation
             sensitizer for localized disease will be allowed and not counted as a prior regimen if
             the 5-FU was continued for ≤ 1month following completion of radiotherapy.

          -  Karnofsky Performance Status of ≥ 70%.

          -  Patients must have discontinued previous anti-cancer therapy or other investigational
             agent at least three weeks or within 5 half lives of the drug (whichever is shorter)
             prior to entry into the study (six weeks for mitomycin C or nitrosureas) provided that
             all toxicities from prior treatment have resolved to a Grade 1 or less.

          -  Patients must have discontinued radiation therapy at least two weeks prior to entry
             into the study and have recovered from all radiation-related toxicities.

          -  Adequate organ function including the following:

          -  ANC ≥ 1500 cells/microL; platelets &gt; 100,000/microL; hemoglobin ≥ 9 g/dL (may be
             transfused to this level).

          -  Bilirubin ≤ 2.0 mg/dL; aspartate transaminase (AST/SGOT) and alanine transaminase
             (ALT/SGPT) ≤ 3.0 times institutional upper limit of normal (ULN) OR &lt; 5 times
             institutional ULN if the subject has documented liver metastases.

          -  Creatinine ≤2.0 mg/dL.

          -  CA19-9 level &gt;2 times ULN.

          -  Disease that is measurable by CT scan per RECIST criteria (Appendix IV).

          -  PET/CT or PET scan with SUV of ≥ 5.0 in at least one lesion on an 18F FDG scan.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Active infection requiring antibiotics at study entry.

          -  Any serious concomitant systemic disorder that in the opinion of the investigator
             would place the patient at excessive or unacceptable risk of toxicity.

          -  Patients with active (requiring continuous medical therapy) pulmonary disease (COPD,
             asthma) or evidence of interstitial pneumonitis or pulmonary fibrosis on baseline
             chest X-ray or PET/CT scan.

          -  Significant central nervous system or psychiatric disorder(s) that preclude the
             ability of the patient to provide informed consent.

          -  Known or suspected brain metastases that have not received adequate therapy. Patients
             must be stable without requirement for steroids or seizure medications.

          -  Major surgery within 4 weeks of study entry.

          -  Chemotherapy/investigational drugs within 3 weeks or within 5 half lives of the drug
             (whichever is shorter) of study entry, provided that all toxicities from prior
             treatment have resolved to a Grade 1 or less.

          -  Inability to tolerate prophylactic (1 mg/day) coumadin.
