      The purpose of this study was to demonstrate the clinical equivalence of hydromorphone and
      morphine (immediate-release [IR] and sustained-release [SR] formulations) using the &quot;worst
      pain in the past 24 hours&quot; item of the Brief Pain Inventory (BPI). The secondary objective of
      this study was to compare hydromorphone and morphine in the following variables: other pain
      measures, various questionnaires, and safety and tolerability variables.

      This was a phase-3, multicenter, multinational, randomized (patients are assigned different
      treatments based on chance), active-controlled, double-blind, multiple-ascending-dose,
      parallel-group study in adult patients with cancer pain who receive and/or require strong
      oral or transdermal opioid analgesics (60-540 mg of oral morphine equivalents daily). This
      study consisted of 2 phases: an initial immediate release (IR) phase and a subsequent slow
      release (SR) phase. Eligible patients were randomized 1:1 to receive either OROS
      hydromorphone HCl or morphine sulfate (immediate release formulation in the immediate release
      phase, slow release formulation in the slow release phase). In the immediate release phase
      (2-9 days), patients were started on the appropriate initial dose of immediate release
      medication every 4 hours (q4h), (6 doses/day) using a 5:1 conversion ratio (morphine
      equivalents:hydromorphone dosage). If the patient had greater than 3 breakthrough-pain
      episodes requiring additional pain medication in 24 hours, the study medication dosage was
      increased, at most once a day. When the patient had achieved dose-stable pain control (2 days
      with 3 or less than 3 breakthrough-pain episodes per day), the patient was permitted to
      continue into the slow release phase. The patient was given an equivalent dosage of a slow
      release formulation of the same drug (OROSÂ® hydromorphone HCL each day or morphine sulfate
      slow release two times per day), administered using a double-dummy technique. Dosage
      increases were permitted every 2 days if the patient had more than 3 breakthrough-pain
      episodes in 24 hours. To complete the slow release phase, patients had to achieve dose-stable
      pain control for at least 2 days.Safety assessments of physical examination, labs and adverse
      event reporting were done. OROS hydromorphone HCL slow release 8, 16, 32, and 64mg tablets;
      Morphine sulfate immediate release10, 20, 50 mg capsules;Morphine sulfate slow release 5, 30,
      60, 90, 120, 160, and 200mg capsules;hydromorphone immediate release 2, 4, 8 mg;The immediate
      release medications orally every 4 hours;The OROS hydromorphone slow release formulation
      orally every 24 hours and morphine slow release orally twice daily.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with cancer pain who are currently receiving strong oral or transdermal
             opioid analgesics or in whom strong opioid analgesics are appropriate

          -  Patients who requires or are expected to require between 60 and 540 mg of oral
             morphine or morphine equivalents every 24 hours for the chronic management of cancer
             pain

          -  Patients who have pain suitable for treatment with a once-daily formulation

          -  Patients with concomitant chemotherapy or radiotherapy. Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patient with gastrointestinal (GI) disease of sufficient severity to interfere with
             orally administered analgesia (eg dysphagia, vomiting, constipation, bowel
             obstruction, severe gut narrowing) were not permitted to enroll

          -  Patient where the risks of treatment with morphine or hydromorphone outweighed the
             potential benefits such as raised intracranial pressure, hypotension, hypothyroidism,
             asthma, reduced respiratory reserve, prostatic hypertrophy, hepatic or renal
             impairment, convulsive disorders, and Addison's disease

          -  Debilitated patients were excluded.
