  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      We believe that there is a strong rationale for the study of IDV/r 600/100 bid as a
      boosted-PI combination that, in the presence of RMP, is able to produce a satisfactory PK
      profile associated with adequate antiretroviral potency, tolerability and efficacy.

      The fixed-dose combination of d4T+3TC+NVP (GPOvir) has been widely used in Thailand since
      June 2002. The prevalence of NNRTI resistance has increased since 2005. Efavirenz-based
      antiretroviral therapy (ART) is preferred in patients with TB/HIV receiving
      rifampin-containing TB regimens. However, efavirenz cannot be used in the context of NNRTI
      failure, intolerance or toxicity. The optimal ART in populations receiving rifampicin remains
      unknown. Rifabutin, which is recommended in combination with a boosted protease inhibitor
      (PI/r) is expensive and not available in Thailand and other developing countries.
      Ritonavir-boosted indinavir (IDV/r) is potent and the cheapest boosted PI available in
      Thailand. If IDV/r in combination with rifampin demonstrates suitable pharmacokinetics and is
      well tolerated, this regimen might prove useful and could be widely implemented. However,
      high rates of gastrointestinal and renal toxicity have been demonstrated in Thai patients
      receiving standard doses of IDV/r 800/100 BID. We believe that there is a strong rationale to
      study if IDV/r 600/100 BID in combination with rifampin is able to produce a satisfactory
      pharmacokinetic profile, with antiretroviral potency, tolerability and efficacy.
