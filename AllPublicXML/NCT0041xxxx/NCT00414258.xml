      The purpose of this study is to compare the effects of mothers' skin-to-skin holding during
      feeding via a soother trainer with the effects of pacifier sucking on preterm infant
      biobehavioural responses during and immediately after a painful procedure

      Hypothesis:

        1. When held by their mothers during blood collection, preterm infants will show less pain
           reaction than when sucking on a pacifier.

        2. Following holding during the blood collection, mothers will find no differences in their
           infants' feeding ability.

      Research Method:

      In a between subjects, randomized design, 20 stable preterm infants born between 30-35 weeks
      gestational age will be studied. Infants will be randomized to one of two interventions which
      will take place during blood collections that are required for clinical management. For the
      standard care condition, infants will remain in their isolettes and will be positioned in
      prone and given a pacifier to suck on throughout the blood collection. For the holding
      condition, infants will be held skin-to-skin by their mothers and given breast milk using a
      soother trainer during the blood collection.
