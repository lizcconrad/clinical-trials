      The goal of this clinical research study is to study the drug CNF2024 as a single agent or in
      combination with trastuzumab in patients with advanced breast cancer and to:

        -  find the highest dose of the drug CNF2024 as a single agent or in combination with
           trastuzumab that can be given safely

        -  measure levels of CNF2024 as a single agent or in combination with trastuzumab in blood

        -  determine if CNF2024 as a single agent or in combination with trastuzumab can stop
           breast cancer cells from growing

        Inclusion Criteria (Group A):

          -  Age ≥18 years at the time of informed consent.

          -  Male and female subjects with confirmed HER2 adenocarcinoma of the breast with
             advanced disease (advanced disease will be defined as metastatic disease or locally
             advanced disease that is surgically unresectable and considered unmanageable with
             standard therapies such as radiation or systemic therapies) who have had disease
             progression on at least one standard hormonal or chemotherapy regimen for advanced
             breast cancer or who have refused standard therapies.

          -  Evaluable disease either by measurable disease (RECIST) or nonmeasurable disease.

          -  ECOG ≤2.

          -  Required Laboratory Values:ANC ≥1500 cells/mm3,platelet count ≥100,000
             cells/mm3,hemoglobin ≥9 gm/L; Glucose &gt;3.3 mmol/L, sodium &gt;130 mmol/L, calcium &gt;2.0
             mmol/L.

          -  Plasma cortisol and ACTH levels that are not suggestive of adrenal insufficiency.

          -  Normal electrocardiogram (ECG) with QTc ≤450 msec for men and ≤470 msec for women.

          -  Age ≥18 years at the time of informed consent.

          -  Male and female subjects with confirmed HER2+ (IHC 3+ or IHC 2+/FISH+) adenocarcinoma
             of the breast with advanced disease that have had disease progression on at least 1
             standard hormonal or chemotherapy regimen for advanced metastatic breast cancer.
