  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to scientifically evaluate two different operative strategies
      for perforated appendicitis with abscess.

      The hypothesis is that the increased difficulty of early operation is balanced by the immense
      patient investment with delayed operation.

      This will be a single institution, prospective, randomized clinical trial involving patients
      who present to the hospital with perforated appendicitis with abscess. This will be a pilot
      study.

      Power calculations are not used for a pilot study. One group will undergo a primary
      laparoscopic appendectomy. The other group will receive intravenous antibiotics with drainage
      if possible and a laparoscopic appendectomy 10 weeks after initiation of treatment at
      presentation. All 7 general pediatric surgeons will be involved with the operations, who are
      all comfortable with these management arms. The surgeon will not induce a significant
      confounding variable into this study. The laparoscopic appendectomy is approached in the same
      manner by all members of our group. Those named on the form are qualified by the IRB to
      obtain consent and/or will be accountable for overseeing the study.

      Both groups will have the same antibiotic regiment. All data will be analyzed on
      intention-to-treat basis.
