      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the growth of the lung and how easily gas can be
      taken up by the lung in healthy infants born at full term without any breathing problems and
      infants born prematurely.

      SPECIFIC AIM # 1: Determine the relationship between parenchymal tissue and alveolar volume
      with normal lung growth early in life We hypothesize that during the first two years of life
      that parenchymal surface area and alveolar volume increase with somatic growth; however, the
      ratio of surface area to volume remains constant, while ventilation within the lung becomes
      more homogenous.

      SPECIFIC AIM # 2: Determine the pulmonary sequelae of premature birth and assess the
      effectiveness of early treatment strategies upon the pulmonary sequelae.

      We hypothesize that premature birth impedes growth and development of the lung parenchyma and
      the airways at a corrected-age of 1-year. In addition, initiating continuous positive airway
      pressure (CPAP) and a permissive ventilatory strategy in very premature infants at birth will
      improve lung growth and lung function compared to treatment with early surfactant and
      conventional ventilation.

    <description>Group 1: We have recruited 50 healthy infants born &gt;37 weeks gestation, and between 2 and 36 months of age. Infants were excluded for any of the following reasons.
Congenital cardio-respiratory disease
Hospitalization for respiratory illness
Treatment with asthma medications for more than one time
Small for gestational age at birth
More than one respiratory illness
More than one episode of wheezing</description>

    <description>Group 3: We will recruit 115 infants born prematurely, 23-35 weeks gestation. Subjects will be evaluated at the corrected age between 2 and 24 months. The subjects will have no oxygen requirements, and be clinically stable outpatients when evaluated. Infants will be excluded for any of the following reasons.
Congenital cardio-respiratory disease
Severe developmental delay</description>

    <description>Group 2: The investigators recruited 50 infants born at &gt; 37 weeks gestation and they were evaluated between 2 and 36 months of age when scheduled for high resolution computed tomography (HRCT) imaging for non-respiratory medical problems. Subjects were enrolled and HRCT of the chest were obtained. Infants were excluded for the following reasons:
Congenital cardio-respiratory disease
Hospitalization for respiratory illness
Treatment with asthma medications</description>
