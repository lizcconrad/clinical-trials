    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to:

        1. determine the safety of wavefront guided PRK

        2. evaluate the efficacy of wavefront guided PRK

        3. evaluate the differences in visual quality after treatment of wavefront guided PRK

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects will be recruited from those active duty soldiers that have requested
             refractive surgery. Subjects must be eligible for medical care at WRAMC.

          -  Male or female, of any race, and at least 21 years old at the time of the
             pre-operative examination, and have signed an informed consent. The lower age limit of
             21 years is intended to ensure documentation of refractive stability.

          -  Manifest refractive spherical equivalent (MSE) of up to -6 diopters (D) at the
             spectacle plane with refractive cylinder up to 3.00D.

          -  At least five images must be capturesd in both eyes (dilated) with a pupil size of at
             least 7mm.

          -  Manifest refraction and LADARWave™ refractions must be within 1.00 D and the
             CustomCornea® software must allow for treatment with a 6.5mm minor axis and 9mm
             ablation zone.

          -  Best spectacle corrected visual acuity of 20/20 or better in both eyes.

          -  Demonstrated refractive stability, confirmed by clinical records. Neither the
             spherical nor the cylindrical portion of the refraction may have changed more than
             0.50D during the 12-month period immediately preceding the baseline examination, sa
             confirmed by clinical records.

          -  Soft contact lens users must have removed their lenses at least 2 weeks before
             baseline measurements. Hard contact lens users (PMMA or rigid gas permeable lenses)
             must have removed their lenses at least 4 weeks prior to baseline measurements adn
             have 2 central Keratometry readings and 2 manifest refractions taken at least 1 week
             apart that do not differ by more than 0.50D in either meridian; mires should be
             regular.

          -  Located it the greater Washington DC Area for a 12-month period.

          -  Exhibits strong motivation for attending the follow-up visits.

          -  Consent of the subject's command (active duty) to participate in the study.

          -  Access to transportation to meet follow-up requirements.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Female subjects who are pregnant, breast feeding or intend to become pregnant during
             the study.

          -  Concurrent topical or systemic medications that may impair healing, including
             corticosteriods, antimetabolites, isotretinoin, amiodarone hydrochloride and/ or
             sumatripin.

          -  Medical condition(s), which, in the judgement of the investigator, may impair healing,
             including but not limited to: collagen vascular diseases and ocular herpes zoster or
             simplex.

          -  Active ophthalmic disease, neovascularization of the cornea within 1mm of the intended
             ablation zone, or clinically significant lens opacity.

          -  Evidence of glaucoma or an intraocular pressure greater than 22mm Hg at baseline.

          -  Evidence of keratoconus, corneal irregularity, or abnormal videokeratography in either
             eye.

          -  History of recurrent erosions or epithelial baewsment dystrophy.

          -  Patients with known sensitivity or inappropriate responsiveness to any of the
             medications used in the post-operative course.

          -  Any physical or mental impairment that would preclude participation in any of the
             examinations.
