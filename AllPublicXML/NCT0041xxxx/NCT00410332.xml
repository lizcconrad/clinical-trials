  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Tonsillectomy is one the most common procedures in ear, nose and throat (ENT) medicine.
      Following surgery patients suffer from severe pain and difficulty on swallowing, while
      analgesic treatment has limited efficacy and potential adverse effects such as increased
      bleeding with NSAIDs. Traumeel S is a homeopathic complex remedy used primarily in Europe for
      the treatment of pain and inflammation. It contains a number of plants and minerals at high
      dilutions (between 1x10-2 to 1x10-8), and has been shown to exhibit anti-inflammatory
      properties such as cytokine inhibition in human T cells, monocytes and gut epithelial cells.
      Clinical studies have found Traumeel S reduces post-chemotherapy stomatitis, as well as
      post-surgical inflammation and pain following orthopedic procedures.

      The purpose of this study is to examine the effect of Traumeel S on post-tonsillectomy pain
      in adult patients. The study group will consist of 20 patients age 18 years of age and older
      following elective tonsillectomy. These patients will be randomly assigned to receive
      treatment with either true Traumeel S remedies or placebo. One ampule of Traumeel S (or
      placebo) will be sprayed over the resected area immediately following surgery. Two Traumeel S
      (or placebo) tablets will be taken subsequently 4 times daily (Total: 8 tablets per day)until
      no analgesics are required for 2 consecutive days, or until Day 14 (whichever comes first).
      Patients will be allowed to take dipyrone (Optalgin) 500mg tablets on an as-needed basis, for
      up to 14 days postoperatively. At the end of this period, a thorough ENT examination will be
      done.

      The primary parameter to be evaluated in the study will be postoperative pain, as registered
      on a numerical pain rating scale (NRS), to be filled prior to surgery. In the post-anesthesia
      care unit (PACA) the NRS will be filled out again, this time for pain at rest and then again
      for pain upon swallowing - at 1, 2, 3,4 and 24 hours postoperatively. Secondary parameters to
      be evaluated are: analgesic use (dipyrone); post-operative bleeding (quantified on a scale of
      1-4); nocturnal awakenings; time to resumption of eating and return to normal activity;
      cytokine levels (CRP, IL-6) at 36 hours postoperative; and side effects of the treatment.
