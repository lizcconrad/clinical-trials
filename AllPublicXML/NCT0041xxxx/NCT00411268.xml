      The purpose of this open-label, extension study is to characterize the safety, effectiveness,
      and impact on quality of life measures of long-term repeated dosing of OROS hydromorphone
      slow release (8, 16, 32 and 64 mg tablets) in patients with chronic low back pain.

      This open label, extension study characterized the safety, effectiveness, and impact on
      quality of life of OROS hydromorphone slow release with long-term repeated dosing among
      patients with chronic low back pain, who previously completed short-term Study DO-127 with
      OROS hydromorphone slow release. Up to 150 patients were to be enrolled and evaluated.
      Patients were enrolled in this study immediately following Study DO-127. Patients continued
      their therapy with OROS hydromorphone slow release at the stable dose previously identified
      in the short-term study. The patient's initial prescribed dose of OROS hydromorphone slow
      release in Study DO-127X was the same as the last dose of OROS hydromorphone slow release in
      Study DO-127. Patients returned monthly for evaluations during this extension interval.
      Adjustments to dose were performed as needed, at the Investigator's discretion. The duration
      of this study was six months. Safety assessments included vital signs and physical
      examination at start, during and end of study. 8, 16, 32 and 64 mg tablets of OROS
      hydromorphone (dose will be at Investigators' discretion) slow release tablets were taken
      orally daily for the duration of the six month study
