      This study will determine the safety of 500mg of aspirin added to IV TPA at standard doses to
      prevent re-occlusion of cerebral vessels after successful reperfusion. In ischemic stroke
      brain arteries are occluded either by an embolus originating in the heart or large vessels
      leading to the brain or by a process of acute thrombosis of the cerebral arteries over a
      ruptured atherosclerotic plaque. Rupture of the plaque exposes thrombogenic elements within
      the plaque and leads to accumulation and activation of platelets and induction of the
      clotting cascade eventually leading to acute thrombosis and occlusion of the artery. TPA is
      currently approved by the Food and Drug Administration to treat heart and brain problems
      caused by blockage of arteries. It activates plasminogen and leads to disintegration of the
      thrombus/embolus. It is effective only if begun within 3 to 4.5 hours of onset of the stroke
      because of potential deleterious side effects including life threatening symptomatic
      intracranial hemorrhage (sICH) when the drug is administered outside of this time window.

      Reperfusion of the ischemic brain (i.e. timely opening of the occluded artery) with TPA is
      associated with improved outcome. However, in about 33% of patients that have successfully
      reperfused after TPA the artery re-occludes within the first few hours resulting in worsening
      neurological symptoms and worse functional outcome. This re-occlusion is speculated to result
      from re-thrombosis over an existing ruptured atherosclerotic plaque. This is explained by the
      relatively short half life of TPA leaving the exposed ruptured plaque intact which leads to
      re-activation of platelets and clotting factors and re-thrombosis. Thus, we hypothesize that
      the addition of an antiplatelet agent to TPA would result in lower rates of re-occlusion
      after AIS. The FDA approved TPA for patients with AIS but discouraged the concomitant use of
      anti-platelet or anti-thrombotic drugs for the first 24hours after administration of TPA
      because of concerns that such therapy may result in increased rates of intracerebral
      hemorrhage. Aspirin is a well known platelet anti-aggregant that works by inhibition of
      cycloxygenase 1 and reduction in thromboxane A levels. It has a rapid onset of action and
      additional potential beneficial anti-inflammatory effects in patients with AIS. The
      international stroke study showed that acute treatment of stroke patients with 500mg of
      aspirin is safe and feasible and results in better outcome. Furthermore, the drug was safe in
      these circumstances with an ICH rate of only .

      Therefore, the purpose of this clinical trial is to examine the safety and efficacy of the
      combination of aspirin with rt-TPA in patients with AIS.

      Background and Objectives:

      Management of acute ischemic stroke consists of thrombolytic drugs aiming at opening occluded
      vessels. Tissue plasminogen activator (TPA) is the only drug approved by the FDA (1, 2). The
      use of TPA is significantly limited by a relatively narrow therapeutic window of up to 3-4.5
      hours following stroke onset (3, 4). Use of TPA outside of this time window is associated
      with an unacceptably high risk of hemorrhage including symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage
      (sICH) (5, 6). While TPA is efficacious in reducing stroke associated disability its effects
      are limited by the phenomenon of early re-occlusion after successful reperfusion of the
      occluded artery.

      Previous reports have shown that among patients receiving IV TPA within 3 hours of stroke
      onset 61% re-perfuse at 1 hour, with about 67% of these having partial recanalization and 33%
      complete recanalization of the occluded artery (7). reperfusion rates at 2 hours tend to be
      much lower ranging around 30-40% implying early re-occlusion (8). Indeed it was found that
      25% of the patients that have successfully reperfused will re-occlude the artery within 2
      hours (7). Re-occlusion of an already reperfused artery was more common in elderly patients
      with severe ipsilateral carotid stenosis and higher NIHSS scores and was associated with poor
      outcome (7). We speculate that re-occlusion is much more common in atherothrombotic strokes
      compared with embolic stroke. In embolic stroke TPA disintegrates the occluding embolus
      frequently and there is no remaining exposed endothelium or plaque that would trigger
      thrombosis (9). In contrast, in atherothrombotic stroke TPA disintegrates the occluding
      thrombus leading to re-perfusion less frequently (9) and the exposed thrombogenic elements
      within the ruptured plaque remain in place triggering repeated platelet activation and
      re-thrombosis.

      Because primary reperfusion is less frequent in patients with atherothrombotic large vessel
      stroke and re-occlusion is more common in these patients and both these processes involve
      platelet aggregation and activation at the site of thrombosis we argue that addition of
      anti-platelet agent would be able to increase reperfusion rates and decrease re-occlusion
      rates in these patients.

      Aspirin is the most commonly used antiplatelet agent in stroke patients. It has a relatively
      long half life and a relatively rapid onset of therapeutic effect(10, 11). Furthermore, an
      additional aspirin bolus may reverse a state of aspirin resistance in patients suffering a
      stroke while on aspirin(12, 13). Aspirin is safe when given to patients with acute stroke as
      soon as the diagnosis is made (14, 15).

      Because the FDA approval of TPA use for stroke patients had a pre-requisite of not using
      concurrent anti-thrombotic drugs in the 24 hours after TPA administration the safety of
      aspirin needs to be studied in a randomized trial. However, it should be noted that pre-TPA
      aspirin use was not associated with an increased ICH risk in patients given the drug (16) and
      therefore pre-morbid aspirin use is not considered a contraindication for TPA administration
      in acute stroke.

      The study will be a randomized double blind study exploring the safety of adding 500 mg of
      aspirin given P.O. to standard doses of IV TPA.

      METHOD:

      Eligible patients (n=20/group) will be recruited after obtaining informed consent. Patients
      will be randomized to receive rt-TPA 0.9mg/kg (10% of the total dose as an IV bolus and the
      reminder IV over 60 minutes) + placebo or rt-TPA 0.9mg/kg + aspirin P.O. at a dose of 500mg
      at the time of TPA administration.. Randomization will be accomplished using an IVRS
      automated system. Randomization will be into time tiers of 0-1.5 hours from symptom onset,
      1.5-3 hours from symptom onset and 3-4.5 hours from symptom onset for each dose tier. Overall
      60 patients (30 TPA + active drug and 30 TPA only are to be recruited). Study medications
      will be supplied by the hospital and will have a total volume, color and odor that will be
      identical to placebo. At the end of recruitment the randomization codes will be opened and
      the data safety monitoring board (DSMB) will determine the safety of continuing the study in
      the next dose tier. Samples will be collected for safety data (renal, hepatic and coagulation
      studies) and sent to local laboratories in each center. Investigators will be notified
      immediately on any lab results by fax and email. ECGs will be read at a central facility and
      investigators will be notified on any abnormal result immediately via fax and email. All AE
      and SAE will be reported immediately.

      EVALUATIONS

      Safety:

      Hemodynamics: Patients will be monitored non-invasively for blood pressure, heart rate,
      oxygen saturation q2rhs in the first 24 hours post stroke and then every 6 hours for the next
      24 hours and then every 12 hours for the reminder of the hospitalization.

      Coagulation tests: PT, PTT and PLT blood counts will be evaluated daily in the first 3 days
      of hospitalization.

      Blood tests: Blood chemistry, liver function tests and cardiac enzymes will be evaluated
      daily for the first 3 days and then at discharge.

      Cardiac rhythm: ECG will be evaluated daily on a 12 lead recording on the first 3 days of
      hospitalization and then at discharge.

      CT: Brain CT will be obtained prior to drug administration and in included patients repeated
      scans will be obtained at 96-120 hours to evaluate final infarct size. In cases of suspected
      hematoma brain CT would be obtained immediately and the number of patients sustaining an ICH
      following drug administration will be recorded.

      All other adverse events (AE) and serious adverse events (SAE) will be recorded and promptly
      evaluated by the data safety monitoring board that will decide whether or not these events
      are drug related and which will have the authority to prematurely terminate the study in case
      an unexpected SAE emerges and appears to be drug related. AE and SAE will be defined
      conventionally such that AE is any adverse event and SAE as an AE necessitating prolongation
      of hospitalization or any adverse event that is potentially life threatening).

      NEUROLOGICAL Included patients will be examined before and after randomization with the
      National Institute of Health stroke scale (NIHSS) on days 1,2,3,5 and discharge and on
      outpatient visits at months 1 and 3-post stroke.

      FUNCTIONAL OUTCOME Patients will be evaluated with the Barthel index (BI) and modified Rankin
      score (MRS) administered on discharge day and during outpatient visits at month 1 and 3-post
      stroke.

             new clinical deficit. Patients whose deficits have worsened in the last 4.5 hours are
             not eligible if their first symptoms started more than 4.5 hours before. If the stroke
             started during sleep, stroke onset will be recorded as the time the patient was last
             known to be at baseline.

          2. Disabling neurological deficit attributable to acute ischemic stroke in the middle
             cerebral artery territory.

          3. NIHSS less than or equal to 18 for left hemisphere strokes, NIHSS less than or equal
             to 16 for others.

          4. Evidence of MCA occlusion (stem or branch) prior to drug administration by TCD, CTA or
             MRA.

          5. Age 18-85 years, inclusive.

          6. Able to sign informed consent.

             For MRI Arm only:

          7. Screening MRI diagnostic of focal cerebral ischemia corresponding to the clinical
             deficits. The MRI evaluation must involve echo planar diffusion weighted imaging, MRA,
             and MRI perfusion. A normal appearing MRA with an appropriate perfusion deficit is
             eligible. An apparent stenosis or occlusion on MRA with normal appearing perfusion
             distally will not be eligible. Poor quality or uninterpretable MRA will not make
             patient ineligible. Patients who have a normal appearing DWI are eligible.

          8. Evidence on PWI MRI or a perfusion defect corresponding to the acute stroke syndrome.
             The PWI will be assessed by relative mean transit time (MTT) images obtained prior to
             the start of rt-TPA therapy.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Patients will be excluded from study participation for any of the following reasons:
