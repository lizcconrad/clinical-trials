  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Tibolone has been registered for treatment of menopausal symptoms. It is, however, not known
      what the effects are of tibolone in postmenopausal women diagnosed with sexual dysfunction.
      This is important because there is currently no approved treatment of libido problems in
      postmenopausal women. Therefore, the primary aim of this study was to compare the effects of
      tibolone with an estrogen/progestogen skin patch in postmenopausal women diagnosed sexual
      dysfunction.
