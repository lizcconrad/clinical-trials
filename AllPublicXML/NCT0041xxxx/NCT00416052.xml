  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Accumulating evidence indicated that renal calcium stone formers often exhibit a low bone
      density. Therefore we want to test the hypothesis, that the mineral (calcium) metabolism is
      differently regulated in calcium stone formers with low as opposed to high bone density.

    <textblock>
      There is epidemiological evidence associating renal calcium stones and decreased bone mineral
      density (BMD). The decreased BMD in calcium stone formers is linked to hypercalciuria and
      both subtypes, fasting as well as absorptive hypercalciuria are associated with a diminished
      BMD. Higher 1,25-vitamin D plasma concentrations and lower PTH levels are encountered under
      free-choice diet conditions in patients diagnosed with absorptive and fasting hypercalciuria
      when compared to normocalciuric stone formers. Reports studying the BMD of stone formers and
      its link with mineral metabolism variables and urinary calcium excretion under different
      calcium intakes are rare.

      We hypothesize now that PTH and 1,25-vitamin D change differently when calcium stone formers
      with high, intermediate and low BMD are challenged by a low calcium diet.
