  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Nosocomial bloodstream infections are important causes of morbidity and mortality caused by
      AmpC beta-lactamase-producing Enterobacteriaceae. The information collected will optimize the
      management of patients with nosocomial bloodstream infections.

      The following information will be collected: age, sex, occupation, hospital location at the
      time of positive culture (ER, medical ward, ICU etc), prior hospitalization, receipt of
      outpatient dialysis, home care or other regular medical care (eg, outpatient chemotherapy),
      presence of invasive devices, receipt of antibiotics, including their type and whether they
      were adequate for the resistance profile of the organism, prior positive microbiologic
      cultures, time and location of positive cultures, underlying diseases and severity of
      illness, presence of urinary or intravascular devices, recent immunomodulative therapies or
      radiation therapy, physical exam findings, laboratory and radiographical data, antimicrobial
      usage within 30 days of onset of the infection, microbiological data and resistance patterns,
      choice of antibiotics once organism identified, bacteriological outcomes, laboratory results,
      demographic information, medications, clinical outcome,gender, height, weight, ethnicity, and
      past medical history. We will collect information retrospectively.

      No genetic testing will be performed on any of the samples being obtained. The biologic
      samples will be under the control of the principal investigator of this research project. To
      protect confidentiality, all personal identifiers (i.e., name, social security number, and
      birth date) will be removed (de-identified) and replaced with a specific code number. The
      information linking these code numbers to the corresponding subjects' identities will be kept
      in a separate, secure location. The investigators on this study will keep the samples
      indefinitely. If a subject withdraws and provides the request in writing, samples collected
      and not already processed will be destroyed. All samples will be kept in the investigator's
      laboratory located in Scaife Hall, Room 812, 3550 Terrace Street.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Clinical information is collected by chart review of &quot;case&quot; and &quot;control&quot; patients. A
             &quot;case&quot; patient is defined as follows:

               -  One or more blood cultures are positive for E. cloacae, E. aerogenes, C.
                  freundii, S. marcescens or M. morganii.

               -  The patient received piperacillin/tazobactam as the initial empiric therapy.

               -  The organism was susceptible to piperacillin/tazobactam.

          -  A &quot;control&quot; patient is defined as follows:

               -  One or more blood cultures are positive for E. cloacae, E. aerogenes, C.
                  freundii, S. marcescens or M. morganii.

               -  The patient received a carbapenem or fluoroquinolone antimicrobial as the initial
                  empiric therapy.

               -  The organism was susceptible to the empiric regimen.
