      To refine, implement and evaluate a motivationally-tailored exercise intervention for
      increasing physical activity and mental health during pregnancy and the postpartum.

    <textblock>
      Pregnancy appears to pose a further barrier to exercise, as women remain inactive or cease to
      exercise all together. Yet, regular physical activity during pregnancy in healthy women has
      been shown to be safe and positively associated with physical and psychological health
      benefits. To date interventions to promote physical activity have not targeted pregnant
      women. We are proposing to pilot the first study to evaluate a theory-derived intervention
      designed to promote physical activity during pregnancy. We anticipate that pregnant women
      assigned to the motivationally-tailored exercise intervention will show a significant
      increase in physical activity from baseline at the post-treatment follow-up (32 weeks
      gestation). We expect that the motivationally-tailored intervention will positively influence
      physical and mental health status during pregnancy.
