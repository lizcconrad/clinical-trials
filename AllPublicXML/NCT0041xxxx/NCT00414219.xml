  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess visual quality of patients with non-penetrating,
      non-metallic, stable corneal foreign bodies. Visual quality will be assessed by examining
      visual acuity, wavefront analysis and contrast sensitivity. Drawings, photographs, and
      confocal microscopy will be used to document clinical examination of the cornea at baseline
      and on follow-up examinations.
