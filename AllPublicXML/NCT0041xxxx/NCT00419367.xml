  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In an effort to allow patients continued access to vorinostat outside of the base study,
      patients that are actively receiving study medication will discontinue from this study and
      receive vorinostat via another method supported by the SPONSOR (e.g. Named Patient Program
      (NPP)). For those institutions that do not allow receipt of an investigational therapy
      outside of a clinical trial, patients that are actively receiving study medication and

      continue to meet eligibility will transition to an extension phase of the study and the base
      study will be closed.

      The extension phase will begin as soon as the protocol amendment is implemented.
