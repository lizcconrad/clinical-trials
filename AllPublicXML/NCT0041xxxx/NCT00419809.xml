  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      SB-681323 is a p38 MAP-kinase inhibitor that has potential uses in inflammatory conditions
      such as RA. Previous p38 MAP-kinase inhibitors have been hindered in development by liver
      toxicity. Methotrexate (common treatment for RA patients) also has potential liver toxicity.
      This study was an enabling study to determine the safety of co-administration of the two
      compounds with respect to liver function
