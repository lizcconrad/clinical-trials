  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is for the woman who will have axillary (armpit) surgery as part of their breast
      cancer treatment. The purpose of this project is to evaluate if acupuncture is helpful to
      control pain and improve range of motion (arm movement). Another goal is to find out if women
      have an improvement in their quality of life. This study is being done in collaboration with
      the Oregon College of Oriental Medicine (OCOM).
