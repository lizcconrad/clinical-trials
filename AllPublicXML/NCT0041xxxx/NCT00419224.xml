      The purpose of this study is to determine whether influenza vaccination protects patients who
      receive a certain type of bone marrow transplantation.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients who receive bone marrow transplantation are at high risk for complications from
      influenza infection. It is not whether influenza vaccination protects patients who undergo a
      type of bone marrow transplantation called &quot;nonmyeloablative&quot;, or &quot;reduced intensity&quot; bone
      marrow transplantation. This study compares the response to influenza vaccination in a group
      of these patients to that in healthy people.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients were included if they had received RIC allo HSCT 3 months or more prior to
             enrollment, and were between the age of 18 and 65 years.

          -  Controls were health care providers at our institution, between the ages of 18 and 65
             years, who were in good health, and who are routinely offered influenza vaccination.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients were excluded if they failed to engraft, or had relapse of the underlying
             disease requiring chemotherapy or immunotherapy.

          -  Patients and controls were also excluded if they had history of egg allergy, acute
             febrile illness at the time of vaccination, or influenza-like illness within 4 weeks
             prior to vaccination.
