    <textblock>
      This is a Phase I dose escalation study of PXD101 administered orally. Oral belinostat will
      be given once or twice daily at various dosing schedules to patients with solid tumors. Doses
      will be escalated until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is identified. In parallel, a cohort
      of lymphoma patients will be given oral belinostat on a discontinuous once daily dosing
      schedule.

      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria Inclusion criteria must be met at the time of screening unless otherwise
        specified.

          -  Age ≥ 18 years

          -  Solid Tumor: Histologically documented diagnosis of primary or metastatic solid tumors
             refractory to standard therapy or for which no standard therapy exists. Entry will
             include, but is not limited to patients with androgen-independent prostate cancer, and
             cancers of the breast, ovary, head and neck, non-small cell lung, bladder, colorectal
             or kidney. Lymphoma: Relapsed or refractory B-Cell, T-Cell or NK-Cell lymphoma or
             Hodgkin's Disease. At Yale Cancer Center, lymphoma patients will be limited to those
             who are not eligible for potentially curative re-induction regimens and transplant and
             without a reasonable chance of having durable remissions with standard therapies.

          -  At least one evaluable lesion. Lesions must be evaluated by CT-scan, MRI, or bone
             scan. Patients with prostate cancer, bone disease and rising PSA but no other
             evaluable disease are eligible and will be evaluated based on PSA. For lymphoma
             patients, lesions can also be measured by PET and/or evaluated in peripheral blood or
             bone marrow.

          -  Progressive disease: Progressive disease will be defined as new or progressive lesions
             on CT-scan, MRI, bone scan or by rising PSA (see Section 11.3).

          -  ≥ 4 weeks since prior RT or chemotherapy.

          -  Karnofsky Performance Status ≥ 60%

          -  Solid Tumor: Acceptable liver, renal and bone marrow function including the following:

               -  Absolute neutrophil count ≥ 1.5 x 109/L

               -  Hemoglobin ≥ 9.0 g/dl

               -  Platelets ≥ 100 x 109/L

               -  Bilirubin ≤ 1.5 times the upper limit of normal (x ULN)

               -  Aspartate transaminase (AST) and alanine transaminase (ALT) ≤ 3.0 x ULN (≤ 5.0 x
                  ULN is acceptable if liver has tumor involvement)

               -  Serum Creatinine ≤ 1.5 x ULN

               -  PT-INR/PTT ≤ 1.5 x ULN or in the therapeutic range if on anticoagulation therapy

          -  Lymphoma: Acceptable liver, renal and bone marrow function including the following:

               -  Absolute Neutrophil Count ≥ 1.0 x 109/L

               -  Platelets ≥ 50 x 109/L

               -  Bilirubin ≤ 1.5 times the upper limit of normal (x ULN), or ≤ 3 times ULN if
                  documented hepatic involvement with lymphoma, or ≤ 5 times ULN if history of
                  Gilbert's disease

               -  Aspartate transaminase (AST) and alanine transaminase (ALT) ≤ 3.0 x ULN (≤ 5.0 x
                  ULN is acceptable if liver has tumor involvement)

          -  Serum potassium within normal range

          -  Estimated life expectancy greater than 3 months

          -  Signed informed consent must be obtained prior to any study specific procedures

        Exclusion Criteria

             weeks for mitomycin or nitrosourea) Lymphoma: No anticancer therapy within 2 weeks
             except for Rituximab which patients should be off for greater than three months unless
             there is evidence of disease progression.

             transplantation.

          -  Serious concomitant systemic disorders (eg, active infection) that, in the opinion of
             the investigator, would compromise the safety of the patient or compromise the
             patient's ability to complete the study.

          -  Presence of metastatic disease that, in the opinion of the investigator, would require
             palliative treatment within 4 weeks of enrollment

          -  Symptomatic brain metastases

          -  Significant cardiovascular disease including unstable angina pectoris, uncontrolled
             hypertension, congestive heart failure (NYHA Class III or IV) related to primary
             cardiac disease, a condition requiring anti-arrhythmic therapy, ischemic or severe
             valvular heart disease, or a myocardial infarction within 6 months prior to the trial
             entry

          -  A marked baseline prolongation of QT/QTc interval, e.g., repeated demonstration of a
             QTc interval &gt;500 msec; Long QT Syndrome; the required use of concomitant medication
             on PXD101 dosing days that may cause Torsade de Pointes (See Section 11.7)

          -  Altered mental status precluding understanding of the informed consent process and/or
             completion of the necessary studies
