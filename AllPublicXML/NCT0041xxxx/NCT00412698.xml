      Primary :

      To determine the effect of Rimonabant 20 mg on changes in, HDL-Cholesterol (HDL-C),
      triglyceride levels over a period of 12 months when prescribed with a mild hypocaloric diet
      in abdominally obese patients with dyslipidemia with or without other associated
      comorbidities.

      Main Secondary :

      To determine the effect of 12 months Rimonabant treatment versus placebo on changes in waist
      circumference (WC), body weight, glycemic and lipid parameters.

      To assess the safety of 12 months Rimonabant treatment versus placebo in these patients.

      In selected sites, a sub study will be conducted to determine the effect of 12 months of
      Rimonabant on additional lipoprotein and inflammatory parameters.
