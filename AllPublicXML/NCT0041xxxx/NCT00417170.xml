  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study was to determine the effects of Aliskiren on insulin resistance
      (IR) and endothelial dysfunction (ED) in patients with high blood pressure and metabolic
      syndrome. The efficacy of Aliskiren was compared to Amlodipine.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Mean Change in Endothelial Function as Measured by Myocardial Blood Flow (MBF) From Baseline and After 12 Weeks of Treatment</measure>
    <time_frame>At baseline and after 12 weeks of treatment</time_frame>
    <description>MBF is measured by Positron Emission Tomography (PET) first at rest, then 45 minutes later, during cold pressor testing (CPT). The patient is placed in the PET scanner and injected with N-13 ammonia as a tracer. PET images are taken to assess myocardial blood flow at rest. After 40 minutes, the patient immerses one hand in ice water and PET images are taken to assess myocardial blood flow at sympathetic activation. Change from baseline data is analyzed by an analysis of variance (ANOVA) model including treatment and week as fixed factors and subject (nested in treatment) as a random factor.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Mean Change in Insulin Sensitivity as Measured by Glucose Infusion Rate (Last 30 Minutes) From Baseline and After 12 Weeks of Treatment.</measure>
    <time_frame>At baseline and after 12 weeks of treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Insulin sensitivity is measured by the hyperglycemic euglycemic clamp procedure where a supine patient has 2 IV lines inserted for sampling blood. Regular human insulin (60mU/m^2 surface area/min) is infused for 120 minutes. Dextrose (20% w/v) is infused to maintain glycemia at &lt; 100 mg/dL and is adjusted based on plasma glucose levels obtained every 5 minutes. Blood for glucose and insulin is taken at specified time intervals. Change from baseline data is analyzed by analysis of variance model including treatment and week as fixed factors, and subject (nested in treatment) as a random factor.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Mean Change in Insulin Concentration as Measured During Oral Glucose Tolerance Test (OGTT) From Baseline and After 12 Weeks of Treatment</measure>
    <time_frame>At baseline and after 12 weeks of treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Insulin Concentration is determined by the Oral Glucose Tolerance Test (OGTT) which begins after a 10 hour overnight fast. Blood samples are taken at baseline and after an oral 75 gram dose of glucose. Additional samples of blood are taken to measure glucose and insulin levels at 30, 60, 120 and 180 minutes post glucose intake. Changes from pre-glucose intake values are analyzed by an analysis of variance (ANOVA) model including treatment, visit and post-dose time points ( 30, 60, 120 and 180 minutes) as fixed factors and subject (nested in treatment) as a random factor.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Mean Change From Baseline in Inflammatory Marker ( C-peptide) as Measured During Oral Glucose Tolerance Test (OGTT) From Baseline and After 12 Weeks of Treatment [Time Frame: At Baseline and After 12 Weeks of Treatment</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and after 12 weeks of treatment</time_frame>
    <description>C-peptide level is determined by the Oral Glucose Tolerance Test (OGTT) which begins after a 10 hour overnight fast. Blood samples are taken at baseline and after an oral 75 gram dose of glucose. Additional samples of blood are taken to measure glucose and insulin levels at 30, 60, 120 and 180 minutes post glucose intake. Changes from pre-glucose intake values are analyzed by an analysis of variance (ANOVA) model including treatment, visit and post-dose time points ( 30, 60, 120 and 180 minutes) as fixed factors and subject (nested in treatment) as a random factor.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Mean Change in Arterial Compliance as Measured by Pulse Wave Analysis From Baseline and After 12 Weeks of Treatment</measure>
    <time_frame>At baseline and after 12 weeks of treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Arterial Compliance is determined by Pulse Wave Analysis measured by a detector placed at the carotid artery while taking ECG and tonometry at the same time. Procedure is repeated for the femoral artery. Pulse Wave data are calculated by dividing distance between 2 arteries by the difference between the rise delay of the distal pulse wave and the R wave of the QRS complex and the rise delay of the proximal pulse wave to the QRS complex. Data analysis used an analysis of variance (ANOVA) model including treatment and week as fixed factors and subject (nested in treatment) as a random factor.</description>

        <title>Mean Change in Endothelial Function as Measured by Myocardial Blood Flow (MBF) From Baseline and After 12 Weeks of Treatment</title>
        <description>MBF is measured by Positron Emission Tomography (PET) first at rest, then 45 minutes later, during cold pressor testing (CPT). The patient is placed in the PET scanner and injected with N-13 ammonia as a tracer. PET images are taken to assess myocardial blood flow at rest. After 40 minutes, the patient immerses one hand in ice water and PET images are taken to assess myocardial blood flow at sympathetic activation. Change from baseline data is analyzed by an analysis of variance (ANOVA) model including treatment and week as fixed factors and subject (nested in treatment) as a random factor.</description>

        <title>Mean Change in Insulin Sensitivity as Measured by Glucose Infusion Rate (Last 30 Minutes) From Baseline and After 12 Weeks of Treatment.</title>
        <description>Insulin sensitivity is measured by the hyperglycemic euglycemic clamp procedure where a supine patient has 2 IV lines inserted for sampling blood. Regular human insulin (60mU/m^2 surface area/min) is infused for 120 minutes. Dextrose (20% w/v) is infused to maintain glycemia at &lt; 100 mg/dL and is adjusted based on plasma glucose levels obtained every 5 minutes. Blood for glucose and insulin is taken at specified time intervals. Change from baseline data is analyzed by analysis of variance model including treatment and week as fixed factors, and subject (nested in treatment) as a random factor.</description>

        <description>Insulin Concentration is determined by the Oral Glucose Tolerance Test (OGTT) which begins after a 10 hour overnight fast. Blood samples are taken at baseline and after an oral 75 gram dose of glucose. Additional samples of blood are taken to measure glucose and insulin levels at 30, 60, 120 and 180 minutes post glucose intake. Changes from pre-glucose intake values are analyzed by an analysis of variance (ANOVA) model including treatment, visit and post-dose time points ( 30, 60, 120 and 180 minutes) as fixed factors and subject (nested in treatment) as a random factor.</description>

        <description>Arterial Compliance is determined by Pulse Wave Analysis measured by a detector placed at the carotid artery while taking ECG and tonometry at the same time. Procedure is repeated for the femoral artery. Pulse Wave data are calculated by dividing distance between 2 arteries by the difference between the rise delay of the distal pulse wave and the R wave of the QRS complex and the rise delay of the proximal pulse wave to the QRS complex. Data analysis used an analysis of variance (ANOVA) model including treatment and week as fixed factors and subject (nested in treatment) as a random factor.</description>
