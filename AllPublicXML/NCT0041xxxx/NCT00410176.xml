      The proposed study will evaluate whether the use of non-pharmaceutical methods, such as
      surgical masks, isolation of patients and personal hygiene, are acceptable and effective in
      preventing the spread of influenza within the family.This will be achieved by conducting a
      randomized, controlled, unblinded, clinical trial. Family members of an index case with
      influenza like illness, will be randomly allocated to two groups. In the intervention group,
      family members will receive comprehensive guidance about sanitation and hygiene, as well as
      surgical masks to wear whenever in close contact (3 feet / 1 meter) with the index case. In
      addition, they will be asked to isolate the index case as much as possible. In the control
      group, family members will receive only standard guidance about sanitation and hygiene
      relevant for reducing the transmission of influenza. The primary end-point of the study will
      be secondary infection of influenza of at least one of the family members in order to asses
      the efficacy of the interventions. In addition, the compliance to those interventions will be
      evaluated.

      The study hypothesis is that use of non-pharmaceutical methods will be acceptable and will
      reduce the secondary infection rate among them by 50%.
