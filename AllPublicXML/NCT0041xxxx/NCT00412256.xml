  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary hypothesis constitutes that the fish-oil preparation (Omegaven) is superior to
      the preparation based on Soja-oil (Lipovenös)to reduce signs and symptoms in patients with
      active rheumatoid arthritis.

      The study can be considered a phase III trial (comparison of two licensed preparations in a
      non-approved indication). This controlled double blind trial aims to compare the effect of
      parenterally applied fat emulsions on the disease activity of RA patients, as expressed by
      changes of the DAS28.

      To test for the hypothesis patients are randomized and treated with 2ml/kg bodyweight of both
      preparations for seven consecutive days. These treatment cycles are repeated four times at
      monthly intervals. For not improving patients (DAS28 decrease &lt;0.6) escapes before the third
      and the fourth treatment cycle are foreseen. In case of escape patients are treated with
      Omegaven in an open manner.

      Efficacy parameters comprise the DAS28, the ACR-criteria, the M-HAQ, the SF-36, and the
      co-medication consumption. To assess safety laboratory parameters, comprising, LFT, KFT, CBC,
      fasting glucose, cholesterol, HDL, LDL, neutral fat, and urinary analysis are performed.
      Moreover, blood pressure control and clinically examinations are performed on a regular
      basis.

      Study recruitment started in fall 2004 and was completed in November 2006.
