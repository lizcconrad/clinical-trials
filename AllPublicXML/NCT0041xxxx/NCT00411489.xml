  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Roux-En-Y gastric bypass procedure is the most commonly performed bariatric procedure in
      the United States. Despite initial weight loss, some patients experience weight regain that
      may be related to an increase in the size of the gastric pouch and/or stoma. A second
      surgical procedure to reduce the size of the pouch and/or stoma is typically associated with
      a higher risk of death or complications than the original gastric bypass procedure. This
      study will evaluate a less invasive, endolumenal alternative to pouch and stoma revision as a
      means of producing weight loss in patients who have regained weight following gastric bypass.
