  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Relacatib is being developed for the treatment of osteoporosis, osteoarthritis and possibly
      other bone disorders. Recent results suggest that relacatib interacts with the way our bodies
      metabolise drugs and so some drugs which are commonly prescribed to the intended target
      patient population could be affected by giving relacatib at the same time. The purpose of
      this study is to evaluate the effect of repeat dose administration of relacatib on the way
      subjects bodies metabolise three commonly prescribed medications in the osteoarthritis
      population: ibuprofen, acetaminophen, and atorvastatin.
