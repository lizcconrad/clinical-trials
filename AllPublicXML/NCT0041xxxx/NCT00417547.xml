  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this research is to examine the social, psychological and Islamic veil practicing
      (IVP), non-complete IVP and Inconsiderate to IVP correlates of body mass index (BMI) status
      in a women population. It is hypothesized that women who are IVP would differ on depression,
      and social variables compared with their non-practicing peers.

      In this cross-sectional study, a population-based sample of 1774 female responded anonymously
      to an aerobic health club administered questionnaire. Body mass index was calculated from
      height and weight and categorized into four classes of underweight, normal, overweight, and
      obese. The questionnaire also included questions about social experiences, body
      dissatisfaction as Body Shape Questionnaire (BSQ), future goals and Islamic Veil Practicing
      (IVP). Persian version of Beck Depression Inventory (BDI-II Persian) and Rosenberg Self
      Esteem Scale was also distributed among six groups of women having IVP/regular exercise (RE),
      IVP/non-RE, Non-complete IVP/RE, Non-complete IVP/non-RE, Inconsiderate to IVP/RE, and
      Inconsiderate to IVP/non-RE. Correlations of BMI with social, psychological, future goals and
      IVP were explored
