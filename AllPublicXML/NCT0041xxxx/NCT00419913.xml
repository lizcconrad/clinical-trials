      Our long term goal is to elucidate the role of DHEA on follicular dynamics in the human ovary
      and to better understand the interaction of DHEA supplementation with other treatments for
      ovulation induction, especially among older reproductive age women.

      The specific hypothesis behind the proposed research is that DHEA is a regulator of
      follicular dynamics acting in the early pre-gonadotropin dependent stage of initial
      primordial follicle recruitment and growth.

      Specific Aims:

      The ability of women to respond to ovulation inducing medications also called ovarian
      reserve, declines with age. (Navot, Bergh et al. 1991; Scott, Leonardi et al. 1993; Toner and
      Flood 1993 ; Scott and Hofmann 1995; Scott 1996; ASRM 2002) When attempting in-vitro
      fertilization (IVF), older women produce few oocytes (Chuang, Chen et al. 2003; Orvieto,
      Bar-Hava et al. 2004) and yield few normal embryos, even when exposed to maximal gonadotropin
      stimulation.(Orvieto, Bar-Hava et al. 2004) As a result reproductive success for women over
      40 years old is significantly reduced compared to younger women. Older ovaries have few
      antral follicles, high rates of follicular degeneration (atresia)(Faddy 2000) and increased
      &quot;resistance&quot; to ovulation induction.(Filicori 1999; Chuang, Chen et al. 2003; Kupesic, Kurjak
      et al. 2003) A delay in onset of atresia could salvage follicles for later ovulation.

      Our long term goal is to elucidate the role of DHEA on follicular dynamics in the human ovary
      and to better understand the interaction of DHEA supplementation with other treatments for
      ovulation induction, especially among older reproductive age women.

      The specific hypothesis behind the proposed research is that DHEA is a regulator of
      follicular dynamics acting in the early pre-gonadotropin dependent stage of initial
      primordial follicle recruitment and growth. That hypothesis is based on the following
      observations. First, at physiological doses DHEA increases serum levels of the insulin-like
      growth factor (IGF-l).(Casson, Santoro et al. 1998) DHEA is produced by the ovarian
      theca,(Burger 2002) increased concentration of follicular DHEA is associated with increased
      aromatase activity,(Franks, Mason et al. 2000) and DHEA is a prohormone that is converted in
      peripheral tissues to estrogens.(Haning, Hackett et al. 1993) Second, DHEA exposed rats
      simulate polycystic ovary syndrome (PCO)(Roy, Mahesh et al. 1962) and have a higher
      percentage of meiotically active oocytes and less evidence of atresia.(Anderson, Lee et al.
      1997) Women chronically exposed to androgens can develop PCO-like ovaries.(Amirikia,
      Savoy-Moore et al. 1986) Women with anovulatory PCO have less evidence of follicle
      atresia.(Franks, Mason et al. 2000) Third, Casson et al (Casson, Lindsay et al. 2000) found a
      small increase in follicle number and E2 response to ovulation induction after two months of
      DHEA (80 mg/day) administration to five women, with proven ovarian resistance to stimulation.

      Preliminary data Barad and Gleicher reported a patient with a history of severely decreased
      ovarian reserve who dramatically increased her oocyte production over nine cycles of
      treatment while taking DHEA and ovulation induction.(Barad and Gleicher 2005) The dramatic
      increase in oocyte production seen in this patient did not occur until after four months of
      DHEA treatment (75 mg/day). This treatment duration is in keeping with the interval required
      for normal follicular initiation of recruitment and growth(Gougeon 1986) and raises that
      possibility that the Casson et al. did not treat their subjects long enough to achieve
      maximum effect. Our case report was followed by a case control study that showed increased
      oocyte production and improved embryo quality among 25 DHEA treated patients, whose
      pre-treatment cycle acted as control.(Barad and Gleicher 2005)

      More recently we showed that DHEA treated patients with significant decreased ovarian reserve
      have higher pregnancy rates compared to controls.(Barad, Brill et al. 2006)

      Based on these observations the experimental focus of this project is on the interaction of
      DHEA adjuvant treatment with gonadotropin treatment during ovulation induction. The specific
      aims are designed to provide a comprehensive assessment of this effect.

        1. DHEA treatment will increase pregnancy rates among women 40 to 45 years old.

        2. DHEA treatment will increase antral follicle counts.

        3. DHEA will lead to increased anti-mullerian (AMH) hormone levels.

        4. DHEA treatment will increase mean and peak follicular phase estradiol.

        5. DHEA treatment will increase the number of oocytes retrieved in IVF cycles compared to
           placebo.

      Research Plan:

      Placebo controlled randomized trial of 2 months of DHEA pretreatment prior to ovulation
      induction for IVF-ET.

      Hypothesis 1:

      Two months of DHEA pretreatment will improve the chance of pregnancy and lead to greater
      oocyte and embryo yields relative to placebo treated control patients.

      Hypothesis 2:

      Embryos produced following 2 months of pretreatment with either DHEA alone OR with DHEA plus
      supplemental FSH 150 units per day will result in embryos with better morphology

      Hypothesis 3a-c:

      Two months of DHEA pretreatment will result in: a) increased antral follicle counts,
      increased AMH, b) increased mean and peak estradiol and c) increased oocyte production

      Recruitment plan:

        -  New patients presenting for treatment.

        -  Possible print, magazine or Radio advertisement
