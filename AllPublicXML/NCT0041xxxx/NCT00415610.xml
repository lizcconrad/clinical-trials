      The purpose of this trial is to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of lowering blood
      pressure using nicardipine in persons with acute hypertension associated with intracerebral
      hemorrhage.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      An estimated 37,000 to 52,400 people in the United States have intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH)
      every year. ICH——a form of stroke that has poor outcome and is difficult to treat——is
      associated with the highest mortality rate of all strokes. Hematoma expansion has been
      identified as the most common cause of neurological deterioration in persons with ICH. Early
      evidence suggests that acute hypertension (HTN)—or elevated blood pressure—may make some
      individuals more susceptible to hematoma expansion. Treating HTN acutely may prevent hematoma
      expansion, however, the effect of aggressive HTN treatment has not been determined.

      The purpose of this trial is to evaluate the treatment feasibility and safety of lowering
      blood pressure using nicardipine——an antihypertensive medication——in persons who have acute
      HTN associated with ICH.

      This pilot study will enroll 60 individuals who qualify with a presenting systolic blood
      pressure of at least 170 mmHg, have an ICH, and can be evaluated and treatment initiated
      within 6 hours of onset of stroke symptoms. In a stepwise fashion, the scientists will
      investigate the potential consequences of controlling blood pressure with intravenous
      nicardipine at 3 sequential levels: 170 to 200 mmHg, 140 to 170 mmHg, and 110 to 140 mmHg.
      Twenty participants will be enrolled per level.

      Treatment will last 18 to 24 hours. Participants will stay in the hospital for about 7 days
      (including 24 hours in the intensive care unit for close monitoring) and will return for
      1-hour follow-up visits at 30 days and at 90 days after discharge from the hospital. During
      these visits participants will receive neurological assessments to determine their functional
      outcome. For participants, the study will be completed after the 90-day follow-up visit.

    <measure>Particpants Who Achieve and Maintain the Systolic Blood Pressure Goals for Each Treatment Tier.</measure>
    <time_frame>Within 3 hours of symptom onset and sustained through 18-24 hours.</time_frame>
    <description>Feasibility of treatment was assessed by whether SBP reduction and maintenance within the respective target range was achieved (treatment success) or not (treatment failure), and secondarily by whether a significant difference between treatment arms was achieved. Treatment failure was defined based on the observed hourly hourly minimum SBP remaining greater than the upper limit of the target range for 2 consecutive hours after initiation of nicardipine infusion. Spontaneous decline of SBP below the lower limit of the specific tier was not considered treatment failure as all such declines were asymptomatic.The lower number in the more intensive treatment groups reflects in part the greater challenge of rapidly lowering systolic blood pressure to a more intensive (lower) range, as a higher number of treatment failures as pre-defined by meeting the SBP range goal within 3 hours of symptom onset in this group predictably occurred.</description>

    <time_frame>within the first 72 hours of treatment initiation</time_frame>
    <description>Neurological status was monitored quantitatively and independently of other adverse events using two scales. The Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score measures level of consciousness in eye, motor, and verbal components. At least one point is given in each category. The scale ranges from 3 to 15, with 3 indicating deep unconsciousness and 15 indicating consciousness is not impaired. The National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) quantifies neurologic deficits in 11 categories. Level of consciousness, horizontal eye movements, visual fields, facial palsy, movement in each limb, sensation, language and speech, and extinction or inattention on one side of the body are tested. Scores range from 0 to 42; 0 indicates normal function and higher scores indicate greater deficit severity.</description>

    <description>Serious adverse events were ascertained by site investigators using FDA-defined guidelines, defined as any untoward clinical events having been fatal, life-threatening, resulting in new or prolonged hospitalization, resulting in disability or congenital anomaly, or requiring intervention to prevent permanent impairment or damage. Subjects were followed closely from randomization through 90 days. The initial 72-hour period was chosen as the most meaningful time period for which to examine SAEs likely to be related to the acute safety of the study treatment.</description>

    <description>The tolerability of the study treatment was further ascertained by examination of in-hospital, 1-month, or 3-month mortality in each treatment group.
This pilot study was not powered (did not plan to enroll an adequate number of patients) to draw meaningful conclusions about individual adverse event categories, outcome measures, or to make comparisons between the treatment arms beyond the overall feasibility and tolerability of rapidly and significantly lowering SBP following intracerebral hemorrhage.
The timing and magnitude of SBP reduction was also compared to the timing of individual safety events to further evaluate possible relationships between the study treatment, adverse events, and any recognizable safety concerns.

      <recruitment_details>Patients 18 years and older presenting to site hospital ED and ICU areas within 6 hours of symptom onset for ≤ 60 cc volume intracerebral hemorrhage, with GCS ≥ 8, systolic blood pressure ≥ 170 mmHg and meeting all inclusion/exclusion criteria were enrolled following consent by themselves or a family member/legally authorized representative.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>A progressive, three-tiered approach to lowering systolic blood pressure with DSMB review after enrollment in each successive SBP range was completed. Safety was determined at each level before progressing to the next.

          <title>Baseline Measures of stroke symptom severity</title>
          <description>As measured on ED arrival. The Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) is most applicable in those critically ill and measures eye opening, verbal, and motor responses. Scores on the 3-component GCS may range from 3-15 and a lower score indicates a more severe condition. The National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) is more sensitive for discerning subtle symptoms. Scores on the 11-component NIHSS may total between 0-42, with a higher score indicating a more severe stroke. ICH is an evolving condition and may worsen. NIHSS and GCS scores are used to measure changes in neurological status over time.</description>

        <title>Particpants Who Achieve and Maintain the Systolic Blood Pressure Goals for Each Treatment Tier.</title>
        <description>Feasibility of treatment was assessed by whether SBP reduction and maintenance within the respective target range was achieved (treatment success) or not (treatment failure), and secondarily by whether a significant difference between treatment arms was achieved. Treatment failure was defined based on the observed hourly hourly minimum SBP remaining greater than the upper limit of the target range for 2 consecutive hours after initiation of nicardipine infusion. Spontaneous decline of SBP below the lower limit of the specific tier was not considered treatment failure as all such declines were asymptomatic.The lower number in the more intensive treatment groups reflects in part the greater challenge of rapidly lowering systolic blood pressure to a more intensive (lower) range, as a higher number of treatment failures as pre-defined by meeting the SBP range goal within 3 hours of symptom onset in this group predictably occurred.</description>

Level of consciousness, horizontal eye movements, visual fields, facial palsy, movement in each limb, sensation, language and speech, and extinction or inattention on one side of the body are tested. Scores range from 0 to 42; 0 indicates normal function and higher scores indicate greater deficit severity.</description>

          <description>Serious adverse events were ascertained by site investigators using FDA-defined guidelines, defined as any untoward clinical events having been fatal, life-threatening, resulting in new or prolonged hospitalization, resulting in disability or congenital anomaly, or requiring intervention to prevent permanent impairment or damage. Subjects were followed closely from randomization through 90 days. The initial 72-hour period was chosen as the most meaningful time period for which to examine SAEs likely to be related to the acute safety of the study treatment.</description>

Not all subjects entered in the trial survived or remained in the trial to assess final outcomes at 1 or 3 months. When safety stopping rules could not have triggered after 18 initial subjects recruitment was adjusted to weight the subsequent tiers.</population>

      <time_frame>SAEs were collected from randomization through 90 +/- 14 days, but are reported through 72 hours (meaningful time in relation to treatment). Other AEs were collected through seven days from randomization or until hospital discharge, whichever came first.</time_frame>
      <desc>Safety stopping rules were established in the protocol based on the upper limit (by 95% confidence interval) for individual and cumulative rates of neurologic deterioration and serious adverse events (SAE) from previous studies in a manner similar to other phase I trials in acute stroke patents. Safety data was monitored by the NIH-appointed DSMB.</desc>

          <title>Tier 1</title>
          <description>Dose escalation: Initial range
The scientists will investigate the potential consequences of controlling blood pressure with intravenous nicardipine at 170 to 200 mmHg
Nicardipine: Intravenous (IV) nicardipine infusion. It is expected that the treatment duration will vary between 18 and 24 hours.
Started at 5mg/h
Titrated by 2.5mg/hour every 15 minutes to bring systolic blood pressure in target range for the applicable Tier. Max dose 15mg/hour *Once target systolic blood pressure reached, dose decreased by 2.5mg/hour every 15 minutes until systolic blood pressure maintained in the target range or the medication is discontinued.
The DSMB will review safety, tolerability, and feasibility before escalation to the next level.</description>
