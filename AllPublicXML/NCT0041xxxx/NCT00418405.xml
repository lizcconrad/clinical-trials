  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Rheumatoid arthritis is a relatively common autoimmune disease that affects about 1% of the
      population. Its impact on health-related quality of life of the affected patients and the
      national medical cost are enormous. However, a systemic prospective cohort study of
      rheumatoid arthritis has not yet been established in Korea, so data on characteristics and
      prognosis of Korean rheumatoid arthritis and their response to therapy and adverse events are
      limited. Therefore establishment of large prospective cohort of Korean rheumatoid arthritis
      is imperative.

      With inauguration of a steadfast prospective cohort of Korean rheumatoid arthritis patients
      in The Hospital for Rheumatic Diseases at Hanyang University, where patients gather from all
      over Korea forming the largest and most diverse patient pool in Korea, we will be able to
      define the characteristics and prognosis of Korean rheumatoid arthritis patients and gather
      information on treatment response and adverse events. This will eventually lead to
      improvement of health-related quality of life in Korean rheumatoid arthritis patients and
      provide opportunity for reliable comparison study with research institutes from other
      countries. The data gathered through the cohort will provide valuable foundational
      information for the genetic studies, pharmacological economic analyses, and standard
      treatment guidelines of Korean rheumatoid arthritis patients.

      This study is a longitudinal prospective cohort of Korean rheumatoid arthritis patients
      comprising of all Korean adult rheumatoid arthritis patients satisfying the 1987 revised
      American College of Rheumatology (ACR) criteria and voluntarily agreeing to participate in
      the study with following objectives;

      Primary Objectives:

        1. Gather information on treatment response and adverse events of various pharmacological
           therapies for treatment of Korean rheumatoid arthritis patients

        2. Identify the incidence and mortality rates of concurrent diseases including the
           cardiovascular &amp; gastrointestinal diseases and assess the contributing factors involved

      Secondary Objectives:

      Enrich understanding of disease characteristics, treatment response and adverse events in
      Korean rheumatoid arthritis to promote health and increase the health-related quality of life
      in Korean rheumatoid arthritis patients
