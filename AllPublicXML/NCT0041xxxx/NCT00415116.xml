      RATIONALE: Lenalidomide may stop the growth of solid tumors by blocking blood flow to the
      tumor. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as docetaxel and carboplatin, work in different ways
      to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from
      dividing. Giving lenalidomide together with docetaxel and carboplatin may kill more tumor
      cells.

      PURPOSE: This phase I trial is studying the side effects and best dose of lenalidomide when
      given together with docetaxel and carboplatin in treating patients with advanced solid
      tumors.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Determine the maximum tolerated dose of lenalidomide when administered with docetaxel
           and carboplatin in patients with advanced solid tumors.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the safety and toxic effects of this regimen in these patients.

        -  Determine, preliminarily, the clinical activity of this regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is an open-label, dose-escalation study of lenalidomide.

      Patients receive docetaxel IV over 1 hour followed by carboplatin IV on day 1. Patients also
      receive oral lenalidomide once daily on days 1-14. Treatment repeats every 21 days for up to
      6 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients with
      stable or responding disease after completion of 6 courses of treatment may continue
      lenalidomide alone once daily on days 1-14. Patients whose disease is stable or responding
      after completing 2 or 4 courses and who are unable to tolerate further chemotherapy may
      continue lenalidomide alone once daily on days 1-14, at the investigator's discretion.
      Treatment with lenalidomide repeats every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of lenalidomide until the maximum tolerated
      dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 3 or 2
      of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. An additional 6-8 patients are treated at
      the MTD.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 3 months.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 42 patients will be accrued for this study.
