      Based on the results from a previous formulation/dosage ranging trial, this phase II
      multicenter, open trial was designed to determine the safety and immunogenicity of two
      vaccine formulation/dosages with and without adjuvant 21 days after each vaccination in
      adults (18 to 60 years and in the elderly (&gt; 60 years) as required by the European Medicines
      Agency (EMEA) guideline. The antibody persistence until the booster vaccination at 6 or 12
      months will also be evaluated.
