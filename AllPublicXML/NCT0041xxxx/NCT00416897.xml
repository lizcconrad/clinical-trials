      RATIONALE: Dexamethasone is used to treat multiple myeloma. Drugs used in chemotherapy may
      stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from
      dividing. Plasma exchange is a process in which certain cells are separated from the plasma
      in the blood by a machine and then only the cells are returned to the patient. Dexamethasone
      and plasma exchange may be an effective treatment for acute kidney failure caused by multiple
      myeloma. It is not yet known whether giving dexamethasone and chemotherapy together with
      plasma exchange is more effective than giving dexamethasone and chemotherapy alone in
      treating patients with multiple myeloma and acute kidney failure.

      PURPOSE: This randomized phase III trial is studying dexamethasone, chemotherapy, and plasma
      exchange to see how well they work compared with dexamethasone and chemotherapy alone in
      treating patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma and acute kidney failure.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Compare the effect of dexamethasone and cytotoxic chemotherapy with vs without plasma
           exchange on the likelihood of renal recovery (i.e., dialysis-independent at 100 days) in
           patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma and acute renal failure.

      Secondary

        -  Compare the overall survival of patients treated with these regimens.

        -  Compare the quality of life of patients treated with these regimens.

        -  Determine the value of renal histology in predicting recovery of renal function in these
           patients.

        -  Determine the value of serum free light chain assay in determining disease response and
           renal function recovery in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, controlled, open-label, multicenter study. Patients are
      stratified according to planned chemotherapy (vincristine and doxorubicin hydrochloride (VA)
      or VA-like chemotherapy vs thalidomide-containing chemotherapy vs alkylating agent vs other),
      frequency of chemotherapy courses (1-3 weekly vs 4 weekly), need for dialysis at
      randomization (yes vs no), and age (&lt; 65 years vs ≥ 65 years). Patients are randomized to 1
      of 2 treatment arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients receive oral dexamethasone, at least twice daily, on days 1-4 and 9-12.
           Patients undergo plasma exchange by cytocentrifugation or plasmafiltration over 2-3
           hours in weeks 1 and 2 (7 treatments total; 4 of them in week 1). Patients then receive
           planned chemotherapy per local clinician on days 17-100. Chemotherapy may continue after
           100 days at the discretion of the local clinician.

        -  Arm II: Patients receive dexamethasone and planned chemotherapy as in arm I. Quality of
           life is assessed at baseline, day 100, and 6 and 12 months.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed at 6 and 12 months and then
      annually thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 280 patients will be accrued for this study.
