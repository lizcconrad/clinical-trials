    <measure>Annualized Rate of Clinically Documented Serious Bacterial Infections (SBIs) (MITT Population)</measure>
    <time_frame>Efficacy period: up to 12 months (week 13 to the completion visit)</time_frame>
    <description>The annualized rate was based on the total number of SBIs and the total number of subject study days during the efficacy period for all subjects in the specified analysis population and adjusted to 365 days.
Potential SBIs included pneumonia, bacteremia/septicemia, osteomyelitis/septic arthritis, bacterial meningitis, and visceral abscess. If an adverse event (AE) was identified as a potential SBI, the AE was adjudicated by a review committee to determine if the event fulfilled the predefined criteria for SBIs.</description>
