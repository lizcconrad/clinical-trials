      This study seeks to compare patients with vasomotor rhinitis (&quot;perennial nonallergic
      rhinitis,&quot; &quot;idiopathic rhinitis&quot;) with normal controls with respect to their nasal
      physiologic reactivity to cold air challenge. Ten vasomotor rhinitis (VMR) patients with
      nasal symptoms triggered predominantly by cold air, four VMR patients with symptoms triggered
      predominantly by chemicals, and ten nonallergic, non-rhinitic control subjects will be
      studied.

      After initial screening and verification that subjects can cooperate with active posterior
      rhinomanometry, subjects will be scheduled for two 15-minute exposure sessions with either:
      cold-dry air, or warm-moist air. Subjects will rate symptoms (and have their nasal airway
      resistance measured in triplicate) prior to exposure and at 15-min. intervals post-exposure
      until an hour has passed.

    <measure>Net Proportional Change in Nasal Airway Resistance</measure>
    <time_frame>One hour</time_frame>
    <description>Net proportional change in nasal airway resistance, pre- to post-exposure, cold air minus warm air day, calculated as a time-weighted average over the 1.0 h post-exposure. At each time point (pre-exposure, immediately post-exposure, and at 15-, 30-, 45- and 60 minutes post-exposure), nasal airway resistance (in Pa/L/sec) was measured in triplicate. The average of each of these measures was taken for each time point. The time-weighted average of these averages was then calculated for the post-exposure time points and compared with the baseline average for that individual on that testing day. The proportional change from baseline on that day was then calculated (unit-less measure). The difference between the pre-to-post change on the cold air day minus the pre-to-post change on the warm air day was then calculated (unit-less measure). The net proportional change corrects for both inter- and intra-individual variability, which in the case of nasal airway resistance is considerable.</description>

        <title>Net Proportional Change in Nasal Airway Resistance</title>
        <description>Net proportional change in nasal airway resistance, pre- to post-exposure, cold air minus warm air day, calculated as a time-weighted average over the 1.0 h post-exposure. At each time point (pre-exposure, immediately post-exposure, and at 15-, 30-, 45- and 60 minutes post-exposure), nasal airway resistance (in Pa/L/sec) was measured in triplicate. The average of each of these measures was taken for each time point. The time-weighted average of these averages was then calculated for the post-exposure time points and compared with the baseline average for that individual on that testing day. The proportional change from baseline on that day was then calculated (unit-less measure). The difference between the pre-to-post change on the cold air day minus the pre-to-post change on the warm air day was then calculated (unit-less measure). The net proportional change corrects for both inter- and intra-individual variability, which in the case of nasal airway resistance is considerable.</description>

          <title>Net Proportional Change in Nasal Airway Resistance</title>
          <description>Net proportional change in nasal airway resistance, pre- to post-exposure, cold air minus warm air day, calculated as a time-weighted average over the 1.0 h post-exposure. At each time point (pre-exposure, immediately post-exposure, and at 15-, 30-, 45- and 60 minutes post-exposure), nasal airway resistance (in Pa/L/sec) was measured in triplicate. The average of each of these measures was taken for each time point. The time-weighted average of these averages was then calculated for the post-exposure time points and compared with the baseline average for that individual on that testing day. The proportional change from baseline on that day was then calculated (unit-less measure). The difference between the pre-to-post change on the cold air day minus the pre-to-post change on the warm air day was then calculated (unit-less measure). The net proportional change corrects for both inter- and intra-individual variability, which in the case of nasal airway resistance is considerable.</description>
