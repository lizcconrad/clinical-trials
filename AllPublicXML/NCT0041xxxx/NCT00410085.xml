  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Nitrogen-oxide (NO) plays an important role for blood pressure regulation, renal
      hemodynamics, and the renal excretion of sodium. NO is synthesized from L-arginine in the
      vascular endothelium and have a very short half-life in plasma and is therefore very
      difficult to measure directly.

      L-mono-methyl-L-arginine (L-NMMA) is an analogue to L-arginine and a competitive inhibitor of
      NO, and therefore can be used to study the effect of NO on the circulation. In normal
      subjects, infusion of L-NMMA will cause an increase in blood pressure, decreased renal
      plasma-flow, decreased glomerular filtration rate, and a decreased excretion of sodium.

      Hypothesis: Patients with obstructive sleep apnea has a decreased activity in the NO-system.
      This is contributing to the hypertension often seen in these patients. Decreased activity in
      the NO-system can be revealed by diminished fall in renal hemodynamic and sodium excretion
      after infusion of L-NMMA.
