  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research is to evaluate the presence, location and intensity of FDG
      uptake in the large arteries using the new technology of fused PET/CT imaging and to compare
      FDG uptake with the presence of arterial calcifications as seen on the simultaneously
      acquired CT, in order to determine if FDG was increases incalcified plaque or in a different
      location in the arterial wall. we will also evaluate the relationship between FDG
      localization and future cardiovascular events in out patient population
