  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Increasing evidence from clinical studies in Intensive Care Unit (ICU) settings indicates
      that insulin infusion can improve outcome measures for patients with hyperglycemia (high
      blood sugar) independent of a previous diagnosis of diabetes mellitus. This improvement in
      health could also apply to patients that have high blood sugars in various other non-critical
      care areas of the hospital as well. However, the data that shows improvement in health
      outcomes has been collected from wards that have a lower patient to provider and patient to
      nurse ratio, resulting in the ability for a much tighter control of the insulin infusion. We
      hypothesize that tight blood glucose control will provide the same benefits for patients in
      non-intensive care units settings but that these protocols may lead to a higher incidence of
      hypoglycemia (low blood sugar) and potentially to adverse outcomes in patients.

      This study aims to determine the clinical outcome of patients treated with insulin infusion
      as well as the rate of hypoglycemic episodes in non-intensive areas. We will conduct a chart
      review of patients treated with insulin infusions in non-critical wards at Emory University
      Hospital during the period of 7/1/04 to 6/30/05. Medical records of all patients treated with
      intravenous insulin infusion protocols will be analyzed. Data on demographics, laboratory
      values, mortality rate, rate of hypoglycemic events, length of stay, as well as disposition
      at discharge will be analyzed.
