      The purpose of the study was to test a telephone counseling intervention for patients after
      leaving the hospital for a heart attack to use medication, exercise, healthy eating and
      smoking cessation to prevent further heart attacks.

      BACKGROUND: Efficacy of brief individual telephone coaching for secondary prevention behavior
      has been shown. However, the independent contribution of personal counseling to system-level
      intervention is untested. We tested a multiple-risk factor brief counseling intervention in
      acute coronary syndrome (ACS) following hospitalâ€“based quality improvement (QI) program.

      METHODS: Patient-level randomized trial of hospital quality improvement (QI-only) versus
      quality improvement plus brief telephone coaching in the first three months
      post-hospitalization (QI-plus) for patients hospitalized for ACS. Data collection: medical
      record review, state vital records, and post-hospital surveys (baseline, 3 and 8 months post
      hospitalization). Main outcomes: secondary prevention behaviors, physical functioning, and
      quality of life.

      RESULTS: QI-plus patients reported statistically significant independent improvements in
      physical activity (OR = 1.62; p = .01) during the intervention, and were more likely to
      participate in formal cardiac rehabilitation (OR = 2.51; p = .02). Smoking cessation was not
      statistically different (OR = 1.31; p = .68); functional status and quality of life were not
      different at 8 months. Medication use was high in QI and QI-plus groups, and improved over
      prior cohorts in the same hospitals.

      CONCLUSION: QI improved physician and patient adherence to guidelines and improved medical
      therapy in-hospital continued in the outpatient setting. Brief telephone coaching was
      modestly effective in accomplishing short-term, but not long-term life-style behavior change.
      Patient life-style behavior change appears to require sustained intervention. QI-based
      improvement in medication use improves survival and appears to be the most efficient route to
      improved outcomes for all patients.
