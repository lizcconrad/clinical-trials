  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study's purpose is to evaluate the long-term safety of open-label tolvaptan regimens to
      determine the maximally-tolerated dose and acquire pilot efficacy data in patients with
      autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Autosomal Dominant Polycystic Kidney Disease is a genetic disease classified by the formation
      of fluid-filled cysts in the kidneys. The accumulation of these cysts causes the kidneys to
      enlarge several times the normal size and leads to the eventual loss of renal function and
      ultimately results in renal failure in end-stage patients. This is a disease with
      life-threatening implications to those who have it, and their family members who may also be
      affected. Aside from early anti-hypertensive control and dietary protein restriction, which
      are presumed to offer a modest degree of protection, most surviving patients require renal
      replacement therapy (dialysis and transplant) and suffer from high morbidity and mortality.

      A rationale for use of tolvaptan in these genetic disorders has been proven, in principle,
      through use of a variety of animal models. In these models, tolvaptan is effective in halting
      or reversing the progression of this renal disease.

      The current study is being undertaken in order to evaluate whether tolvaptan, an oral
      vasopressin V2 receptor inhibitor, will maintain an adequate safety profile and show a
      potential clinical benefit by reducing total renal volume in the hopes of making an impact
      upon disease progression.

    <measure>Safety Assessments Based on Vital Signs, Electrocardiogram (ECG's), Clinical Laboratory Tests, Physical Examinations Are Reported as Adverse Events (AEs) Upon Study Physician Discretion.</measure>
    <time_frame>AEs were recorded from screening (ICF was signed) until 7-Day follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>An AE was defined as any new medical problem, or exacerbation of an existing problem, experienced by a participant while enrolled in a study , whether or not it was considered drug-related by the study physician. A treatment-emergent AE (TEAE) was defined as an AE that started after start of study drug treatment; or if the event was continuous from Baseline and was serious, study drug related, or resulted in death, discontinuation.</description>

    <measure>Mean Change From Baseline in Trough Urine Osmolality at Steady State Prior to First Daily Dose.</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to Month 36</time_frame>
    <description>Spot urine osmolality at trough was determined for urine samples collected immediately prior to morning dosing for Day 1 (Baseline), Months 2, 6, 12, 24, 36 for all participants. Sample was taken after the first morning's void and was provided as a mid-stream, clean catch sample. During the titration period (Weeks 1, 2, 3 and 4) and at Month 6, additional samples were collected for the preceding day immediately preceding the 2nd daily dose and at bed-time. These samples allowed derivation of an average nadir of spot urine osmolality concentrations at each dose level and while at steady state during extended tolvaptan administration. At the Month 36 visit, participants were given a urine container and brought back the specimen at Extension Day 1. All participants were fasting.</description>

        <title>Mean Change From Baseline in Trough Urine Osmolality at Steady State Prior to First Daily Dose.</title>
        <description>Spot urine osmolality at trough was determined for urine samples collected immediately prior to morning dosing for Day 1 (Baseline), Months 2, 6, 12, 24, 36 for all participants. Sample was taken after the first morning’s void and was provided as a mid-stream, clean catch sample. During the titration period (Weeks 1, 2, 3 and 4) and at Month 6, additional samples were collected for the preceding day immediately preceding the 2nd daily dose and at bed-time. These samples allowed derivation of an average nadir of spot urine osmolality concentrations at each dose level and while at steady state during extended tolvaptan administration. At the Month 36 visit, participants were given a urine container and brought back the specimen at Extension Day 1. All participants were fasting.</description>

        <description>Urine osmolality at steady state (after at least 4 days of dosing) including “absolute trough” prior to the second daily dose.
Samples for this assessment were taken as closely coincident to PK blood sample as practical. During Weeks 1, 2, 3 and 4 of the Titration Period and at Month 6, additional samples were collected for the preceding day immediately preceding the second daily dose. These samples allowed derivation of an average nadir of spot urine osmolality concentrations at each dose level and while at steady state during extended tolvaptan administration.</description>

        <description>GFR was estimated using reciprocal serum creatinine formula. The formula does not adjust for body weight or height, but this may be done to normalize to body surface area. The formula for reciprocal Serum creatinine is: 1/Pcr. (Pcr = serum creatinine concentration [mg/dL]). Clinic weight scales were calibrated at least yearly.</description>

        <title>Mean Change From Baseline in Trough Urine Osmolality at Steady State Prior to First Daily Dose- Extension.</title>
        <description>Spot urine osmolality at trough was determined for urine samples collected immediately prior to morning dosing for Day 1 (Baseline), Months 2, 6, 12, 24, 36, Extension Day 1, and Extension Month 12 for all participants. Sample was taken after the first morning’s void and was provided as a mid-stream, clean catch sample. During the titration period (Weeks 1, 2, 3 and 4) and at Month 6, additional samples were collected for the preceding day immediately preceding the 2nd daily dose and at bed-time. These samples allowed derivation of an average nadir of spot urine osmolality concentrations at each dose level and while at steady state during extended tolvaptan administration. At the Month 36 visit, participants were given a urine container and brought back the specimen at Extension Day 1. All participants were fasting.</description>

Samples for this assessment were taken as closely coincident to PK blood sample as practical.

        <description>Urine osmolality at steady state (after at least 4 days of dosing) including “average of troughs” (the mean urine osmolality prior to bedtime).
Samples for this assessment were to be taken as closely coincident to PK blood sample as practical. During Weeks 1, 2, 3 and 4 of the Titration Period and at Month 6, additional samples were collected for the preceding day at bedtime. These samples allowed derivation of an average nadir of spot urine osmolality concentrations at each dose level and while at steady state during extended tolvaptan administration.</description>

        <description>Participants were asked the question to assess the relative level of pain attributed to their kidneys. This question was, “On a scale of 0 to 10, with zero represented no pain at all and 10 represented the worst pain ever experienced, what was the worst kidney pain experienced in the last 4 months?” If the latest assessment was less than 4 months prior, the question was substituted “since your last visit” for “in the last 4 months”. The same interrogator designated to this task was used throughout the study for each participant.</description>
