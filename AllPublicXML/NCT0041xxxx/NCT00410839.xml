  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      An alpha-linolenic acid (ALA) rich diet in the Lyon Heart Study reduced sudden cardiac deaths
      possibly by reducing cardiac arrhythmias and ventricular fibrillation (Lancet 1994). Since
      then, there has been a growing interest in ALA as a cardioprotective nutrient. Much of the
      interest has focused on the potential antiarrhythmic effect of ω-3 fatty acids, especially
      the longer chain ω-3 fatty acids, DHA and EPA, derived from fish. We therefore concluded it
      important to test whether the shorter chain ω-3 vegetable oil ALA also had antiarrhythmic
      effects, since this might also explain the beneficial effects seen on cardiovascular
      mortality in the Lyon Heart Study.

      Objective: We determined the effect of an ALA rich diet in reducing recurrence of atrial
      fibrillation as a further example of a cardiac arrhythmia.

      Design: Randomized parallel design efficacy study. Setting: Three university hospital centers
      in the Bordeaux region, France. Patients: 98 successive patients successfully underwent
      electro cardioversion of whom 75 completed the study without major deviations according to
      the protocol.

      Intervention: A canola margarine and oil together with a Mediterranean diet (ALA ω-3, 1.4
      g/d) versus a conventional diet (control), with a one year follow-up.

      Main outcome measure: Length of time to first recurrence of atrial fibrillation.

      Significance: If ALA is antiarrhythmic this action may explain its cardioprotective effect in
      clinical trials and cohort studies.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  patients hospitalized in one of the three centers in the Bordeaux region, and who
             subsequently underwent successful electrocardioversion for atrial fibrillation.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  included patients who were unable to receive electrocardioversion or those who were
             already enrolled in another trial

          -  patients who were unable or unwilling to comply with the diet recommendations
             (experimental or control) or follow-up requirements

          -  patients with clinically significant cardiac disease, advanced heart failure, cardiac
             cachexia, thyroid disease, treated or untreated, clinically significant hepatic or
             renal disease or a history of malignant disease or alcohol abuse were not included

          -  Taking ALA rich foods or recording intakes of ALA &gt;2g/d on the control diet or
             reporting using &lt;1g/d on the ALA diet was considered a major deviation from the
             protocol.
