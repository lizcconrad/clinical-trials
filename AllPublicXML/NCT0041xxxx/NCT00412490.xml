      Primary Objectives:

        1. To characterize smoking behaviors and body image in patients with oral cavity cancer
           prior to and following surgical procedures.

        2. To examine the relationship between smoking status and body image in this sample of head
           and neck cancer patients.

        3. To examine the influence of smoking status and body image on quality of life outcomes.

      If you agree to take part in this study, researchers will first perform a test to check the
      level of carbon monoxide (CO) in your blood. To do this test, you will be asked to blow into
      a cardboard tube attached to a machine. You will then be asked to fill out some
      questionnaires and complete a one-on-one interview. All of these things combined will take
      about an hour to complete. You will be asked basic questions such as your age, education
      level, and smoking history. You will also be asked questions about your mood, quality of
      life, and how you feel about your appearance.

      If you do not have surgery, your participation in this study will end after this visit. If
      you have surgery, you will be asked to come back for 2 more study visits, 1 month and 6
      months after your surgery. During these evaluations, you will be asked once again to blow
      into the cardboard tube, fill out questionnaires, and a complete a one-on-one interview. Each
      visit will last about an hour. You will again be asked questions about your smoking
      behaviors, mood, quality of life, and how you feel about your appearance. Your participation
      in this study will be finished after the 6-month evaluation.

      This is an investigational study. About 75 people will take part in this research study. All
      will be enrolled at M. D. Anderson.
