  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will try to determine whether or not certain genes are responsible for the huge
      variation in toxicity and effect observed between patients treated with paclitaxel
      (chemotherapeutic drug). Specifically we will study this retrospectively in patients who
      participated in clinical trials that are now closed. All patients had ovarian cancer and
      received paclitaxel/carboplatin chemotherapy after primary surgery.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Paclitaxel is an antineoplastic drug used in the treatment of ovarian cancer. The effect and
      toxicity is unpredictable in the individual patient. Paclitaxel is removed (eliminated) from
      the organism by oxidation. CYP2C8 is the enzyme mainly responsible. P-glycoprotein (Pgp) is
      an efflux transport protein natural to the human organism. Pgp is responsible for excretion
      of drugs via the bile and the kidneys and is thought to play a role in chemotherapy
      resistance. Paclitaxel is substrate for Pgp. Single nucleotide polymorphisms are possible
      causes for variation in both CYP2C8 and Pgp expression/function. We will study a possible
      role of these genetic variations as predictors of paclitaxel toxicity and effect and the
      possible implications for individual dosing in the future.

      We will use tissue from patients who participated in one of two clinical trials that are both
      closed for inclusion. Genotypic data from this tissue will be correlated with toxicity and
      survival data drawn from a research database. We expect to be able to find &gt;300 available
      cases to study.
