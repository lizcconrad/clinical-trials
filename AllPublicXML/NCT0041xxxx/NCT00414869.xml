  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic liver diseases are often characterized by portal hypertension, a major complication
      involving haemodynamic changes due to increased intrahepatic vascular resistance. It has
      become well established that nitric oxide (NO) plays a crucial role in the haemodynamic
      abnormalities that develop in chronic portal hypertension.

      NCX-1000 is a NO-releasing derivative of ursodeoxycholic acid that would compensate for the
      defective liver NO production in cirrhosis.

      This study intends to demonstrate the desired therapeutic activity (reduction in portal
      pressure) in a small number of target patients, to assess the safety and tolerability after
      repeated oral administrations of NCX-1000, and to get preliminary pharmacokinetic data in
      this population.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>The Hepatic Venous Pressure Gradient (HVPG) will be evaluated at entry (Day 1) and after the Maximal Tolerated Dose (MTD) on Day 16, in fasting and post-prandial (after a standardized liquid breakfast) states.</measure>
    <time_frame>Day1 and Day 16</time_frame>
    <description>The portal pressure, as determined by HVPG, was obtained by subtracting the free hepatic venous pressure from the wedged hepatic venous pressure and rounded to the nearest 0.5 or integer value.The pressures were recorded 3 times for each evaluation and the HVPG value was the mean of the 3 Recordings</description>
