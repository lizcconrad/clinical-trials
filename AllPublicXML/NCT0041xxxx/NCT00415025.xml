      RATIONALE: Tests that measure how much saliva is made, hearing, swallowing, voice function,
      and quality of life may improve the ability to plan treatment for patients with advanced head
      and neck cancer and may help doctors find better ways to treat the cancer.

      PURPOSE: This clinical trial is studying the side effects of high-dose intensity-modulated
      radiation therapy in treating patients with advanced head and neck cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Assess salivary function in patients with advanced head and neck cancer treated with
           intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) by measuring stimulated saliva production at 6
           and 12 months after completion of therapy.

        -  Compare salivary function in these patients to salivary function in historical controls.

      Secondary

        -  Assess auditory, swallow, and voice function and quality of life of these patients
           before and after IMRT or chemoradiotherapy.

        -  Advance experience with IMRT/tomotherapy and improve field design for irradiating head
           and neck cancer in an effort to reduce radiation dose and minimize effects on
           surrounding normal tissue.

      OUTLINE: This is a prospective study.

      Patients undergo standard of care high-dose intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) to the
      head and neck.

      Patients undergo baseline and post-treatment testing of auditory, salivary, swallow, and
      voice function as well as quality of life evaluation.

      Patients are evaluated for radiation-induced toxicities at 1, 6, and 12 months after
      completion of IMRT.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 20 patients will be accrued for this study.
