  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to determine the utility of GRK2 to differentiate
      between normal patients and patient groups that differ by the presence/absence of HF
      symptoms, systolic or diastolic left ventricular dysfunction, and risk factors; and to
      evaluate if a new assay provides similar values as traditional methods for measuring GRK2
      levels.

      This study seeks to define a beta-adrenergic receptor kinase molecule in the blood and its
      role as an improved biomarker to be used for the diagnosis, assessment and management of
      patients with heart failure. We will test blood cell samples for the levels of this molecule,
      called &quot;G protein-coupled receptor kinase-2&quot; (GRK2) using both the existing method of GRK2
      quantification in the Koch laboratory and using a prototype enzyme immunoassay (EIA) method
      being developed by Johnson &amp; Johnson, Ortho-Clinical Diagnostics (OCD).
