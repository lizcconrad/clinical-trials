      Purpose of this study is to examine the effectiveness of an experimental psychotherapy (talk
      therapy) for the treatment of bipolar II depression. The name of this psychotherapy is
      Interpersonal and Social Rhythm Therapy for Bipolar II Depression (IPSRT-BPII). Subjects will
      be randomly assigned to receive either IPSRT-BPII or the medication Seroquel (quetiapine) to
      manage their symptoms of bipolar II depression. Subjects will receive the assigned therapy
      for up to 20 weeks.

      The proposed pilot study is an experimental design intended to investigate the preliminary
      efficacy of Interpersonal Social Rhythm Therapy for Bipolar II Depression (IPSRT-BPII). A
      total of 56 eligible subjects with a diagnosis of bipolar II disorder will be randomly
      assigned to one of two treatment groups : Seroquel (n=28) or IPSRT-BPII (n=28). Following
      baseline assessment, all participants will undergo up to 20 weeks of their assigned
      treatment. Patients assigned to IPSRT-BPII who fail to respond (at least 50% reduction in
      HRSD-25 scores and YMRS ≤ 10) by week 12 will have Seroquel added to IPSRT-BPII. Subjects who
      achieve remission (defined as 3 consecutive weeks where both HRSD-25 and YMRS scores average
      ≤ 7) and have participated in the trial for a minimum of 12 weeks will be moved into a
      continuation phase where they will receive maintenance treatment (bi-monthly therapy sessions
      and/or pharmacotherapy) until week 20. Patients who do not achieve remission by Week 20 will
      be discontinued from treatment and referred for follow-up care. All subjects (remitters and
      non-remitters) will be assessed at 20 weeks.

    <measure>Number of Participants With Greater Than or Equal to 50% Reduction in Depression Scores, With a Mania Score Less Than or Equal to 10</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>Overall response rates (defined as greater than or equal to 50% reduction in depression scores without an increase in mania scores) were 29% (n=4) in the IPSRT group and 27% (n=3) in the quetiapine group. HRSD-25 scores are based on first 17 responses. Eight items are scored on a 5-pt scale, from 0 (not present) to 4 (severe.) Other nine items on the assessment are scored from 0-2. The higher the score on the HRSD-25, the worse the outcome is considered to be. A score of 0-7 is considered to be normal; 8-13 indicates mild depression, 14-18 indicates moderate depression, 19-22 indicates severe depression, and any score greater than or equal to 23 indicates very severe depression. The YMRS is an 11 point assessment. There are 4 items assessed on a scale ranging from 0 to 8 and the other 7 items are graded on a 0 to 4 scale. As with the HRSD, the higher the score on the YMRS indicates the presence of more or more severe manic symptoms and is associated with a worse outcome.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>The total score is derived by summing item scores 1 to 14. Higher scores are indicative of greater enjoyment or satisfaction in each domain. The Q-LES-Q-SF % maximum total score is calculated as 100% × (Q-LES-Q-SF total score - 14) / 56, and can range from 0% to 100%.</description>

             psychotic at time of evaluation);

          2. Unwilling or unable to comply with study requirements;

          3. Meets DSM-IV criteria for borderline personality disorder or antisocial personality
             disorder;

          4. Active substance abuse within the past 6 months(episodic abuse related to mood
             episodes will not exclude a subject);

             participation.

        <title>Number of Participants With Greater Than or Equal to 50% Reduction in Depression Scores, With a Mania Score Less Than or Equal to 10</title>
        <description>Overall response rates (defined as greater than or equal to 50% reduction in depression scores without an increase in mania scores) were 29% (n=4) in the IPSRT group and 27% (n=3) in the quetiapine group. HRSD-25 scores are based on first 17 responses. Eight items are scored on a 5-pt scale, from 0 (not present) to 4 (severe.) Other nine items on the assessment are scored from 0-2. The higher the score on the HRSD-25, the worse the outcome is considered to be. A score of 0-7 is considered to be normal; 8-13 indicates mild depression, 14-18 indicates moderate depression, 19-22 indicates severe depression, and any score greater than or equal to 23 indicates very severe depression. The YMRS is an 11 point assessment. There are 4 items assessed on a scale ranging from 0 to 8 and the other 7 items are graded on a 0 to 4 scale. As with the HRSD, the higher the score on the YMRS indicates the presence of more or more severe manic symptoms and is associated with a worse outcome.</description>

Interpersonal and Social Rhythm Therapy (IPSRT-BPII): IPSRT is comprised of three components: psychoeducation, social rhythm therapy, and standard IPT as developed for unipolar depression.
Psychoeducation focuses on a) the illness and its consequences, b) treatment options and associated side effects, and c) prodromal symptoms/detection of early warning symptoms.</description>

Seroquel: Subjects will be started at 100 mg/day titrated to a maximum of 800 mg /day
Day 1-BID doses totaling 100 mg/day, increased to 400 mg/day on Day 4 in increments of up to 100 mg/day in BID divided doses, by Day 6 begin titration up to a maximum dose of 800 mg/day in increments no greater than 200 mg/day.
This titration schedule may be adjusted based on the subject's response and ability to tolerate Seroquel.
Subjects who are unable to tolerate the study medications, or for whom the study medications are an inappropriate clinical choice, will be treated openly by a clinic physician according to the standard of care guidelines designated by the American Psychiatric Association (2002) for the treatment of bipolar disorder. Subjects receiving standard of care treatment will continue to be seen and assessed per the protocol schedule.</description>
