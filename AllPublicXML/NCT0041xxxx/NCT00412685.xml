  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with congenital heart disease in whom the right ventricle is exposed to pressure or
      volume overload show progressive systolic dysfunction of the right ventricle, the fact of
      which conveys substantial morbidity and mortality. The aim of this study is to investigate
      the myocardial perfusion in these patients by myocardial contrast echocardiography (MCE) in
      order to determine whether disturbed blood flow plays a role in the development of right
      ventricular systolic dysfunction.

        The study population is divided in three groups, which are all age- and gender-matched. The
        TGA group consists of 15 patients treated withMustard or Senning procedures for surgical
        repaired of D-TGA atrial switch operation. The TOF group consists of 15 patients with
        surgically corrected TOF. The control group C consists of 15 control subjects (AH) with
        normal Doppler Echocardiographic echocardiographic examinations.
