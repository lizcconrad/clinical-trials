  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to see how well Zevalin works in the treatment of low grade
      indolent B-cell lymphoma when given to patients who have not had any previous treatment for
      their lymphoma and who otherwise would be followed on a &quot;watch &amp; wait&quot; policy.
