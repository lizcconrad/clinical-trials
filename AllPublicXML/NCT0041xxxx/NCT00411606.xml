  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      An objective of this study is to standardize temperature values derived from thermograms of
      the facial region. It is anticipated that the mean temperature of a defined region of
      interest, such as the eyes, nose, or sinuses, might be useful for future applications.

      The investigators will attempt to determine normal temperature ranges based on participants'
      age and gender.

      Medical thermography is a noninvasive technique that allows an examiner to visualize and
      estimate the temperature of the skin surface. An infrared scanning device is used to convert
      infrared radiation emitted from the skin surface into electrical impulses that can be
      captured as an image called a thermogram. During the past 20 years medical thermography has
      been used to study the pathology in the vascular, muscular, neural and skeletal systems.

      An objective of this study is to standardize temperature values derived from thermograms of
      the facial region. It is anticipated that the mean temperature of a defined region of
      interest, such as the eyes, nose, or sinuses, might be useful for future applications. This
      protocol addresses the definition of overall health, symptomology, and anthropometrical
      features (age, weight, height, body mass index and gender), and what effect, if any, each has
      on mean temperature. Environmental conditions, mapping procedures, and image evaluations will
      also be standardized. We will attempt to determine normal temperature ranges based on
      participants' age and gender. Future use of standardized values will be to assess the
      severity of rhinoconjunctivitis symptoms being experienced by a subject.

      Subjects will make one visit to our clinic. They will be asked to acclimate to room
      temperature for at least 30 minutes. Subjects are requested not to consume hot drinks or food
      for at least an hour before imaging and not to use any skin preparations such as creams or
      talcum powder. A picture of the participant's face will be taken using the thermal camera
      which will demonstrate the temperature of each facial area of interest.

      Please note that participants in this study will take part on a completely voluntary basis.
      No payment will be provided.
