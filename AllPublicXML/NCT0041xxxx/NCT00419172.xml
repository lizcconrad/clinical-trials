  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study will consist of two open-label periods, a Treatment Period I (deferasirox) and a
      Treatment Period II (rifampicin+deferasirox). At least 18 subjects are expected to complete
      both treatment periods as per protocol. For all subjects, in addition to the two treatment
      periods, there will be a 21 day screening period, one baseline evaluation (the day preceding
      deferasirox administration in Treatment Period I), and an end-of-study evaluation (EOS).
      Study subjects will be required to remain in the unit from Day -1 until Day 17. EOS
      evaluation (final safety assessment) will be performed 7-10 days after the last dose of
      rifampicin.
