  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will determine whether treatment with an extended-release opioid or topical
      lidocaine is effective in relieving distal symmetric lower extremity burning pain associated
      with multiple sclerosis (MS). If treatment with topical lidocaine is efficacious, it will
      have important implications for understanding this chronic pain syndrome, which is widely
      assumed to be caused by central nervous system pathology.

      This study is a single-center, double-blind, 15-week, 3-period crossover clinical trial.
      Subjects will complete each of the following 5-week long periods (unless they withdraw from
      the trial): 1) placebo pills and topical lidocaine patches, 2)extended-release oxycodone
      pills and placebo(vehicle) patches, and 3)placebo pills and placebo patches. Sixty subjects
      will be randomized to one of 6 treatment sequences. It is expected that this trial will take
      approximately 2 years to complete.
