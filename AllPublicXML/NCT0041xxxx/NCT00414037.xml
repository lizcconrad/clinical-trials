      If you are age 20-55 years old and have trouble falling or staying asleep, then please
      contact a UCSD research team to find out how a study drug affects these symptoms and how your
      brain works. This is a one-week experimental pain research study using a study drug compared
      to placebo. Your participation will include questionnaires, a physical exam and functional
      Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) brain imaging techniques. We will test pain perception by
      applying brief mild to moderate heat pain to the forearm, and also have you perform simple
      computer tasks while we image and record brain activity using fMRI.

      It is well known that chronic pain syndromes are associated with alterations in sleep
      continuity and sleep architecture. Similarly, recent evidence indicates that sleep
      deprivation interferes with normal pain perception producing hyperalgesic changes, and with
      the regular analgesic effects of certain pain drugs (reviewed in Kundermann B et al., 2004).
      However, the role of the nonbenzodiazepine hypnotic agents in pain perception is not well
      understood. Lunesta (eszopiclone), unlike other nonbenzodiazepine sleep medications, is
      approved for long-term use (no significant addictive effects of the drug are observed
      following the treatment of up to 6mo). Its antinociceptive properties have not been examined
      and, if found, could potentiate the use of this drug for pain control, especially in patients
      with comorbid chronic pain and insomnia.

      The objective of this proposal is to use Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) with an
      experimental pain paradigm in a group of chronic insomnia patients. The study will consist of
      three sessions, the first of which will include questionnaires, and a mental and physical
      health evaluation including an EKG and blood draw. Following the initial screening session
      subjects will be randomly assigned to either the study drug or placebo groups, and complete 2
      additional identical study sessions using fMRI. The first fMRI session will be before taking
      the drug/placebo, and the second session will be after taking the study drug/placebo nightly
      for 1 week. During these fMRI sessions, subjects will undergo psychophysical testing of their
      sensitivity to warmth and heat and will rate various temperatures for pain intensity and pain
      unpleasantness. Subjects will also complete additional tasks including motor inhibition and
      face matching during scanning.
