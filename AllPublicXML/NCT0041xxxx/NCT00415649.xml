  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of and immune response
      to an HIV DNA vaccine followed by an adenoviral vector HIV vaccine in healthy African adults
      at risk for HIV infection.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Due to the availability of antiretroviral therapy, AIDS-related deaths have lessened in the
      United States. However, these therapies are widely inaccessible to the developing world. The
      need for a safe and affordable vaccine that will prevent HIV infection is of utmost
      importance. To generate a broadly protective vaccine, it is necessary to develop a
      multivalent vaccine containing a defined combination of immunogens from the most globally
      prevalent HIV subtypes. This study will evaluate the safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity
      of a multiclade HIV-1 DNA plasmid vaccine,VRC-HIVDNA016-00-VP, followed by a multiclade
      recombinant HIV-1 adenoviral vector vaccine, HIVADV014-00-VP.

      This study will last about 27 months. Participants will be randomly assigned to one of two
      groups. Group A will receive the DNA vaccine at baseline, Month 1, and Month 2, and the
      adenoviral vector vaccine at Month 6; Group B will receive placebo. There will be 20 study
      visits over 2 years. Physical exams, vital signs measurements, adverse event evaluation, and
      medical and medication history will occur at each visit. HIV testing and counseling and blood
      and urine collection will occur at selected visits.
