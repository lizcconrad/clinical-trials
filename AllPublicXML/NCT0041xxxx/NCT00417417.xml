      This study will determine whether an experimental drug called Rilonacept can improve artery
      function in patients with atherosclerosis, a disease in which fatty deposits in arteries
      cause the vessels to stiffen, impeding blood flow. Atherosclerosis is believed to be caused
      in part by inflammation. Rilonacept blocks production of a protein called CRP, which, in high
      levels in the blood is associated with increased inflammation. Patients with coronary artery
      disease who have elevated blood levels of CRP are at increased risk of heart attack, heart
      failure and sudden death compared with people who have lower levels of the protein.

      Patients 18 years of age and older with atherosclerotic coronary artery disease with a CRP
      level between 2 and 10 mg/L may be eligible for this study.

      Patients are randomly assigned to receive four doses of either Rilonacept or placebo, given
      at 2-week intervals as injections under the skin. In addition to treatment, patients undergo
      the following procedures during eight visits to the NIH Clinical Center:

        -  Visit 1 (screening visit): Medical history, measurement of vital signs (temperature,
           blood pressure, heart rate and breathing rate), electrocardiogram (EKG) and blood tests.

        -  Visit 2: Blood tests, chest X-ray, treadmill exercise testing, tuberculin skin test,
           brachial artery flow-mediated dilation. Brachial artery flow-mediated dilation is used
           to measure how well the brachial artery (artery inside the elbow) dilates. An ultrasound
           device placed just above the elbow measures the size of the brachial artery and the flow
           of blood through it before and after a pressure cuff is inflated around the forearm.

        -  Visit 3: Injection of study drug.

        -  Visits 4, 5, and 6: Review of any changes in health or medical treatment, measurement of
           vital signs, blood tests, EKG, injection of study drug.

        -  Visit 7: Review of any changes in health or medical treatment, measurement of vital
           signs, blood tests, EKG, treadmill exercise testing, brachial artery flow-mediated
           dilation.

        -  Visit 8: Review of any changes in health or medical treatment, measurement of vital
           signs, blood tests, EKG, treadmill exercise testing, brachial artery flow-mediated
           dilation.

    <textblock>
      Rilonacept (Interleukin-1 Trap) has been developed as an antagonist of the cytokine IL-1 in
      the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis and other inflammatory diseases. IL-1 causes leukocyte
      accumulation by inducing adhesion receptors on vascular endothelium and stimulating chemokine
      production. It also stimulates the synthesis of other cytokines, including IL-6, which in
      turn stimulates synthesis of C-reactive protein (CRP) in the liver. Based on numerous
      clinical studies, CRP has emerged as a risk marker for the development and clinical
      expression of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, leading to published recommendations
      for measurement of CRP in screening population subsets for cardiovascular risk. Endothelial
      function, as evidenced by stimulated nitric oxide release, has also been recognized as a
      marker of cardiovascular disease risk. Thus, patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) or
      its risk factors have impaired nitric oxide release from the endothelium compared with
      healthy subjects. Recent studies have shown that CRP levels were significantly higher in CAD
      patients compared with healthy subjects, with an inverse correlation between forearm blood
      flow responses to acetylcholine as a measure of endothelial function and CRP. Endothelial
      progenitor cells (EPCs) are primitive bone marrow-derived cells that have a capacity to home
      to sites of vascular injury and differentiate into vascular cell types, and are reduced in
      number and differentiation capacity in CAD patients relative to healthy subjects. Studies
      suggest that CRP inhibits viability and endothelial differentiation capacity of EPCs and may
      account for reduced numbers of EPCs and endothelial dysfunction in CAD patients. The
      objective of the present study is to demonstrate the potential of an investigational
      biological agent, rilonacept, as adjunctive treatment for CAD by examining effects of this
      agent on CRP levels, endothelial progenitor cell mobilization and endothelial function in a
      randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase I/II clinical trial.
