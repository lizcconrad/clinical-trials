  <brief_summary>

      The specific aim of this study is to compare the rate of negative work role events in
      individuals with rheumatoid arthritis compared to healthy controls.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Rheumatoid arthritis can cause multiple socio-medical disabilities, with work disability
      among the most marked. While a major focus has been documenting the rates of job loss and
      returning patients to the workforce, there is little information about how to foster job
      retention in those still employed. The goals of this study are to document negative workplace
      events over 1 year in 122 employed patients with rheumatoid arthritis, and to compare these
      to 122 healthy controls, who are included to account for the effects of socioeconomic status
      on employment. Events will be recorded with the work domain of the Psychiatric Epidemiology
      Research Life Events Scale. Additional goals are to compared fatigue, physical activity,
      functional status and sleep disturbances as covariates.
