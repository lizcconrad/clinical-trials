      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of Epi-Lasik in U.S. Army
      personnel who have naturally occurring myopia with or without astigmatism. The data from this
      control group will be collected in such a way as to be comparable to data sets from study
      groups undergoing wavefront guided PRK, conventional PRK, and related laser refractive
      surgery procedures.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Active duty US Army Soldiers eligible for care at WRAMC

          2. Male or female, of any race, and at least 21 years old at the time of the
             pre-operative examination, and have signed an informed consent. The lower age limit of
             21 years is intended to ensure documentation of refractive stability.

          3. Manifest refractive spherical equivalent (MSE) of up to 6.00 diopters (D) at the
             spectacle plane with refractive cylinder up to 3.00 D.

          4. Manifest refraction and LADARWaveâ„¢ refractions must be within 1.00 D.

          5. Best spectacle corrected visual acuity of 20/20 or better in both eyes.

          6. Demonstrated refractive stability, confirmed by clinical records. Neither the
             spherical nor the cylindrical portion of the refraction may have changed more than
             0.50D during the 12-month period immediately preceding the baseline examination, as
             confirmed by clinical records.

          7. Soft contact lens users must have removed their lenses at least 2 weeks before
             baseline measurements. Hard contact lens users (PMMA or rigid gas permeable lenses)
             must have removed their lenses at least 4 weeks prior to baseline measurements and
             have 2 central keratometry readings and 2 manifest refractions taken at least 1 week
             apart that do not differ by more than 0.50 D in either meridian; mires should be
             regular.

          8. Subject must expect to be located in the greater Washington DC area for a 12 month
             period post-operatively.

          9. Consent of the subject's command (active duty) to participate in the study.

         10. Access to transportation to meet follow-up requirements

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Female subjects who are pregnant, breast-feeding or intend to become pregnant during
             the study. Female subjects will be given a urine pregnancy test prior to participating
             in the study to rule out pregnancy. [Pregnancy and breastfeeding are contraindications
             to refractive surgery in general, including epi-lasik, whether participating in this
             study or not]

          2. Concurrent topical or systemic medications that may impair healing, including
             corticosteroids, antimetabolites, isotretinoin (Accutane), amiodarone hydrochloride
             (Cordarone) and/or sumatripin (Imitrex).

          3. Medical condition(s), which, in the judgment of the investigator, may impair healing,
             including but not limited to: collagen vascular disease, autoimmune disease,
             immunodeficiency diseases, and ocular herpes zoster or simplex.

          4. Active ophthalmic disease, neovascularization of the cornea within 1mm of the intended
             ablation zone, or clinically significant lens opacity.

          5. Evidence of glaucoma or an intraocular pressure greater than 22 mm Hg at baseline.

          6. Evidence of keratoconus, corneal irregularity, or abnormal videokeratography in either
             eye.

          7. History of recurrent erosions or epithelial basement dystrophy.

          8. Patients with known sensitivity or inappropriate responsiveness to any of the
             medications used in the post-operative course.

          9. Any physical or mental impairment that would preclude participation in any of the
             examinations.
