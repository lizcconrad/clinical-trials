    <measure>Incidence of Lymphoproliferative Disorders (LPD)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to Month 24</time_frame>
    <description>Incidence rate was calculated separately for active treatment period and follow-up period in previous studies as number of participants with LPD by number of days while on active treatment or during follow-up period per 100 person-years. Standardization of incidence rates was based upon the age and sex distribution of the entire study population.</description>

    <measure>Health Assessment Questionnaire-Disability Index (HAQ-DI) Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Month 6, 12, 18, 24</time_frame>
    <description>HAQ-DI: participant-reported assessment of ability to perform tasks in 8 categories of daily living activities: dress/groom; arise; eat; walk; reach; grip; hygiene; and common activities over past week. Each item scored on 4-point scale from 0 to 3: 0=no difficulty; 1=some difficulty; 2=much difficulty; 3=unable to do. Overall score was computed as the sum of domain scores and divided by the number of domains answered. Total possible score range 0-3 where 0 = least difficulty and 3 = extreme difficulty.</description>
