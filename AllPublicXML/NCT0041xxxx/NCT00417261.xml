        Open-label safety cohort, Phases A and B: Healthy male and female subjects between the ages
        18 to 68 years (inclusive), in good health as determined by past medical history, physical
        examination, vital signs assessments, electrocardiograms, routine laboratory testing
        (hematology, biochemistry, urinalysis) and the opinion of the investigator at screening and
        baseline. Female subjects must be of non-childbearing potential who are either surgically
        sterilized or are post-menopausal (see inclusion criterion #2 below)

        Phase C: Healthy post-menopausal females of up to and including 68 years of age, in good
        health as determined by past medical history, physical examination, vital signs
        assessments, electrocardiograms, routine laboratory testing (hematology, biochemistry,
        urinalysis) and the opinion of the investigator at screening and baseline.

        All Phases:

                  permissible only if it can be demonstrated that recruitment is being hindered by
                  having an upper limit of 28 kg/m2).

               -  Phase C: Subjects must have a body mass index (BMI) strictly within the range of
                  18 to 28 kg/m2 (inclusive).
