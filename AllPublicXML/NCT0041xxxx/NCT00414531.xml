  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of the study is to investigate the ratios of p-hydroxyatorvastatin to
      atorvastatin in patients receiving atorvastatin treatment, who experience muscle adverse
      events, to elucidate whether differences in this ratio might have a positive or negative
      predictive value in diagnosing atorvastatin muscle toxicity.

      The primary objective of the study is to investigate the ratios of p-hydroxyatorvastatin to
      atorvastatin in patients receiving atorvastatin treatment, who experience muscle adverse
      events, to elucidate whether differences in this ratio might have a positive or negative
      predictive value in diagnosing atorvastatin muscle toxicity. If this is shown, measurements
      of atorvastatin metabolites from patients experiencing muscle adverse events might be a
      valuable diagnostic tool to diagnose myopathy associated with statin treatment. The primary
      endpoint cut off level for present myotoxicity has been set to a ratio of
      p-hydroxyatorvastatin /atorvastatin of 0.15 from the previously performed pilot study
      (Unpublished data, Herman M et al). Values at or above this ratio will be considered as
      clinical significant indicia of statin related myopathy.

      Secondary objectives include descriptively investigation of drug to metabolite cut off ratio
      for atorvastatin lactone/atorvastatin. Whether other cut off values, both for
      p-hydroxyatorvastatin as well as for atorvastatin lactone, give more precise identification
      of patients that are experiencing statin related myopathy compared to controls will also be
      investigated.

      Explorative objectives of the study are to investigate possible in vitro phenotypic
      differences in isolated muscle cells from patients experiencing muscle toxicity compared to
      patients not experiencing muscle toxicity. If there are genetic differences between patients
      experiencing myotoxicity and those not, this difference is likely to show as phenotypic
      differences in in vitro studies of isolated muscle cells. If such phenotypic differences are
      present in vitro possible mechanistic causes will be further investigated.
