    <textblock>
      PACE Project researchers at UCSD are conducting a 2-year study to test the Men in Motion
      program. The study aims to learn more about how to help men lose weight, become more
      physically active, and improve their dietary habits. The study is sponsored by the National
      Institutes of Health.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized controlled trial that will evaluate the effects of a Web-based
      intervention to improve physical activity and dietary behaviors in overweight and moderately
      obese men age 25 through 55 years. The study will complement our currently funded NCI project
      evaluating a similar intervention among overweight female primary care patients. Overweight
      is related to multiple cancers, CVD, and NIDDM, and the prevalence of overweight is
      increasing rapidly (NIH 1998). Patient-centered Assessment and Counseling for Exercise plus
      Nutrition - Internet (PACEi) targets weight-related behaviors and gives patients a tool for
      addressing these behaviors with their primary care practitioners should they choose to do so.
      PACEi includes a web-based assessment and progress planning tool, and 12 months of tailored
      Internet and telephone contact. The components are integrated through a common theoretical
      framework. Subjects will be randomized to PACEi or to a low intensity intervention.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects will be 360 men age 25 through 55 years with BMIs of 25 to 39.9 (those
             characterized as &quot;overweight&quot; or &quot;obese I&quot; in the recent NIH report on Obesity).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  More severely obese participants will be excluded because they may need more intense
             behavioral, pharmacological or surgical intervention.
