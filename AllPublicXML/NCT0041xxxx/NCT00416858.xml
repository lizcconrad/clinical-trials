      RATIONALE: Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to kill tumor cells. Drugs used in
      chemotherapy, such as fluorouracil and cisplatin, work in different ways to stop the growth
      of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Giving
      radiation therapy together with combination chemotherapy before surgery may make the tumor
      smaller and reduce the amount of normal tissue that needs to be removed. Giving these
      treatments after surgery may kill any tumor cells that remain.

      PURPOSE: This randomized phase III trial is studying radiation therapy together with
      combination chemotherapy to see how well they work with or without surgery in treating
      patients with locally advanced esophageal cancer that can be removed by surgery.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Compare the survival of patients with locally advanced esophageal cancer treated with
           neoadjuvant radiotherapy and chemotherapy comprising fluorouracil and cisplatin followed
           by surgery or radiotherapy and chemotherapy.

        -  Compare the quality of life of patients treated with these regimens.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to
      gender, histology (epidermoid vs glandular), response to induction therapy (complete vs
      partial), and tumor differentiation (little differentiated vs undifferentiated/good vs
      moderately differentiated).

        -  Induction therapy: All patients receive induction therapy comprising fluorouracil IV
           continuously over 24 hours on days 1-5 and cisplatin IV over 1 hour on days 1-5 or on
           day 2. Treatment repeats every 21 days for 2 courses in the absence of disease
           progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients also undergo radiotherapy twice daily on
           days 1-5 and 22-26 or once daily 5 days a week for 4½ weeks. Patients achieving complete
           or partial response are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients undergo surgery. Patients may receive 1 course of adjuvant chemotherapy
           (as in induction therapy) and undergo additional radiotherapy.

        -  Arm II: Patients receive additional fluoroucacil and cisplatin as in induction therapy.
           Treatment repeats every 21 days for 3 courses in the absence of disease progression or
           unacceptable toxicity. Patients also undergo additional radiotherapy once daily 5 days a
           week for 2 weeks.

      Quality of life is assessed at baseline, after treatment on arms I or II, and then every 2
      months (arm I) or every 6 months (arm II) thereafter.

      After completion of study therapy, patients are followed periodically.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 40 patients will be accrued for this study.
