  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) are often prescribed as a treatment for asthma. However, many
      individuals who take these medications do not adhere to their prescribed treatment regimen.
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of a telephone-based program at
      improving medication adherence among individuals with asthma.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Asthma is a serious, chronic disease that affects lung function and impairs an individual's
      ability to breathe normally. ICS reduce airway inflammation and are often prescribed to treat
      these conditions. However, poor medication adherence is a common problem that can lead to
      treatment failure, hospitalization, or death. A telephone-based system that uses interactive
      voice recognition technology to remind individuals to follow their medication regimen may
      prove beneficial in promoting adherence. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the
      effectiveness of such a telephone-based intervention at improving adherence to inhaled
      corticosteroid regimens among individuals with asthma. If this study proves successful,
      telephone-based interventions may be developed to promote treatment adherence for other
      chronic medical conditions.

      This 19-month study will enroll approximately 14,000 members of the Kaiser Permanente
      Northwest or Hawaii health system. Participants will be randomly assigned to either take part
      in the telephone intervention or receive usual medical care. Over the 19-month period,
      participants in the intervention group will receive between one and eight phone calls that
      will remind them to refill their prescriptions and offer education about ICS. If needed, the
      call may also offer a transfer to a pharmacy refill line or to speak with a pharmacist.
      Approximately 2,000 participants will complete questionnaires at study entry and at the end
      of the 19-month intervention period. The questionnaires will assess quality of life,
      respiratory health, asthma control, depression, inhaler use beliefs, and satisfaction with
      the intervention. Electronic medical record data and questionnaires will be used to determine
      adherence rates.

    <measure>Modified Medication Possession Ratio</measure>
    <time_frame>Measured over 19 months</time_frame>
    <description>We used a modification of the Medication Possession Ratio (MPR) as our primary outcome measure. The MPR is computed as the number of days' supply of medication dispensed during a given time window divided by the time between the first dispensing in the window and the end of the window. Our modified MPR (mMPR) also accounted for medication that was on hand at the start of the window and ignored any days' supply that would extend beyond the end of the window. The MPR, and by extension the mMPR, assumes that medications were used as directed and that a new inhaled corticosteroid canister was not started until any medication on hand was exhausted.</description>

        <title>Modified Medication Possession Ratio</title>
        <description>We used a modification of the Medication Possession Ratio (MPR) as our primary outcome measure. The MPR is computed as the number of days’ supply of medication dispensed during a given time window divided by the time between the first dispensing in the window and the end of the window. Our modified MPR (mMPR) also accounted for medication that was on hand at the start of the window and ignored any days’ supply that would extend beyond the end of the window. The MPR, and by extension the mMPR, assumes that medications were used as directed and that a new inhaled corticosteroid canister was not started until any medication on hand was exhausted.</description>

        <population>Study participants who were existing users of ICS at the outset of the study, qualified (or for UC would have qualified) for an intervention call at some point during the study, had at least 3 months of follow-up, and were not subsequently determined to be daily oral steroid users.</population>

            <description>Intervention Arm: Participants randomly assigned to this study arm may receive up to 8 automated phone calls from the BREATH EASY Medication Reminder Program over the course of the 19 month intervention period.
Automated Phone-Based Refill Reminders : The BREATHE EASY Medication Reminder Program uses interactive voice recognition phone technology to offer timely reminders to patients to refill their ICS medication, educational messages about ICS, and may offer to transfer them to a refill line or to speak with a pharmacist if they have questions.</description>
