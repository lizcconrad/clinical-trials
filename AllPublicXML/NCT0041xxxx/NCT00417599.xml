    <textblock>
      The prevalence of overweight in the United States Air Force (USAF) is about 22%. The
      objective of this study is to compare the effectiveness of a minimal contact behavioral
      therapy plus usual care group(MCBT+UC) using a controlled experimental comparison of usual
      care(UC). Subjects are USAF personnel who are 5lbs below their Maximum Allowable Weight (MAW)
      and heavier. The primary hypothesis is that: MCBT+UC will have significant weight loss as
      compared to UC.

      The objective of this study is to compare the relative effectiveness of two approaches to
      weight management, using a controlled comparison experiment. The two approaches are: Minimal
      Contact Behavior Therapy Plus Usual Care (MCBT+UC) which includes an orientation meeting,
      provision of a self-help book, use of an interactive weight management web site for 6 months,
      and 2 brief motivational interviewing telephone follow-ups, plus usual care;and Usual Care
      (UC) which includes and orientation meeting and usual care (consisting of required USAF
      annual physical and fitness exam, participation in any mandatory weight loss or fitness
      programs, and the requirement to stay below a Maximum Allowable Weight [MAW], with penalties
      or separation as potential contingencies for failure to remain below MAW). The primary
      outcome is weight loss.Additional outcomes include body mass index, percent body fat, and
      waist circumference.
