    <textblock>
      Kangaroo holding is a skin-to-skin method of holding a baby. Many research studies have
      investigated the maternal and infant benefits associated with kangaroo holding. The purpose
      of this study is to determine if kangaroo holding a baby changes the amount and composition
      of breast milk pumped before and after the kangaroo holding session.

      Hypotheses:

        1. There is a significant difference in volume of maternal breast milk pumped after
           kangaroo holding premature infants as compared to maternal breast milk pumped after
           non-holding conditions

        2. There is a significant difference in the composition of maternal breast milk pumped
           after kangaroo holding premature infants as compared to maternal breast milk pumped
           after non-holding condition.

      This study will address two of the overwhelming challenges in the physiologic care of
      premature infants in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) environment. The first challenge
      is promoting neonatal growth through providing a careful balance of nutrition to caloric
      expenditure for premature infants. The second challenge is supporting parents in the
      intensive, technology driven environment of the NICU to merge physiologic care with
      parental-infant interaction through touch, communication, and maternal intervention. The vast
      majority of mothers with premature infants express breast milk for early feedings, however
      milk production tends to diminish three to four weeks after delivery. The practice of
      skin-to-skin holding is thought to promote the mother's ability to produce breast milk, but
      had not been empirically tested. This study will examine the relationship of kangaroo holding
      on mother's breast milk production and composition.
