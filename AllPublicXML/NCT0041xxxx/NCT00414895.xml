  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to detect AR and CR in the transplanted heart by quantitative
      assessment of myocardial blood flow and its constituents by myocardial contrast
      echocardiography (MCE). Further we investigate the collateral circulation in these patients.

      Heart transplantation has become an accepted therapy for end-stage heart failure. Acute
      allograft rejection (AR) remains a major cause of mortality in heart transplant recipients.
      Chronic rejection (CR) determines the long-term prognosis after cardiac transplantation and
      is responsible for more than one third of late deaths. Different non-invasive methods have
      been evaluated for the detection of AR, but the gold standard remains endomyocardial biopsy
      (EMB).

      Very little is known about the impact of CR on the collateral circulation in transplant
      patients. Since the collateral circulation of the heart is mainly part of the
      microcirculation, it can be hypothesized that it is less developed than in &quot;normal&quot; coronary
      atherosclerosis without microvascular lesions.

      The quantification of CR with non-invasive techniques has remained difficult. In this
      context, there is a need for a reliable non-invasive test to avoid regularly invasive
      evaluation.

      Based on the above considerations we propose that both AR and CR can be accurately detected
      and differentiated using non-invasive quantitative myocardial contrast echocardiography
      (MCE).

        Prospective study with consecutive inclusion of transplanted patients undergoing follow-up
        exams. Examinations comprise endomyocardial biopsy (EMB) and, partly, coronary angiography
        on the subsequent day. Group A patients (i.e. those without coronary angiography) undergo
        MCE and pharmacologic stress with adenosine, the results of which are compared with the EMB
        done at the same day. If they have an acute rejection, they are reexamined during a
        histologically proven rejection free period, and the results are compared with those
        obtained during acute rejection. Group B patients (i.e. with EMB and coronary angiography)
        undergo the same procedure as in group A. Additionally, coronary collateral flow index
        (CFI) is obtained and an IVUS exam is performed during coronary angiography.
