    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, open-label, randomized, Phase 1B study evaluating liver transplant
      recipients receiving rhMBL (2 cohorts) or without rhMBL (1 cohort).

      Patients will have received an orthotopic liver transplant (OLT) or a living related donor
      (LRD) liver transplant. Patients in all cohorts are to receive immunosuppressant therapy and
      anti-infectious prophylactic supportive therapy according to institutional standards.

      The donor's mannose-binding lectin (MBL) genotype will be evaluated to determine the liver
      transplant recipient's study eligibility. For recipients receiving an OLT, a sample of liver
      tissue or lymph nodes will be collected from the donor liver at the time of organ harvest for
      MBL genotyping. For recipients receiving a LRD transplant, the MBL genotype of the LRD will
      be determined in a companion protocol, &quot;Screening Protocol to Evaluate Mannose-Binding Lectin
      (MBL) Genotype in Living Related Donors for Liver Transplant Recipients.&quot; A recipient whose
      donor has an A/O or O/O MBL genotype will be eligible to participate in this study.

      Patients will be randomized in a 2:2:1 ratio to receive up to 8 intravenous (i.v.) infusions
      of rhMBL at a dose of 0.5 or 1.0 mg/kg, or to receive no rhMBL, respectively. Approximately
      20 patients will be treated in each of the 2 rhMBL arms, and approximately 10 patients will
      be treated with standard immunosuppressive agents and anti-infectious prophylaxis but not
      with rhMBL.

      Cohort 1

        -  Number of Patients 20

        -  rhMBL (mg/kg) 0.5

      Cohort 2

        -  Number of Patients 20

        -  rhMBL (mg/kg) 1.0

      Cohort 3

        -  Number of Patients 10

        -  rhMBL (mg/kg) None
