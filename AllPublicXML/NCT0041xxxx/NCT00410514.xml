    <measure>Change From Baseline to End of Treatment in Bladder Contractile Index (BCI)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>The Bladder Contractile Index (BCI) is a value used to measure the degree of contractility. BCI was calculated using the following formula:
BCI = pdetQmax + 5Qmax.
Strong contractility is a BCI &gt; 150, normal contractility is a BCI of 100-150 and weak contractility is a BCI of &lt; 100.
Least squares means were derived from an ANCOVA model with the pooled study center and treatment as factors and the baseline value as a covariate.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline to End of Treatment in Bladder Voiding Efficiency (BVE)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>Bladder Voiding Efficiency (BVE) is a product of bladder contractility against the urethral resistance and is measured according to the degree of bladder emptying. BVE is expressed as a percentage and is calculated using the formula:
Bladder Voiding efficiency = (Voided volume x 100)/maximum cystometric capacity.
A higher number indicates a higher voiding efficiency. Least squares means were derived from an ANCOVA model with the pooled study center and treatment as factors and the baseline value as a covariate.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline to Weeks 1, 4, 8, 12 and End of Treatment in Postvoid Residual Volume (PVR)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Weeks 1, 4, 8 and 12</time_frame>
    <description>Healthy micturitions (urinations) result in complete emptying of the bladder. Post Void Residual (PVR) is the volume of urine retained after voiding and was assessed using abdominal ultrasound. An increasing PVR over time is an indicator of abnormal bladder function or detrusor decompensation.
Least squares means were derived from an ANCOVA model with the pooled study center and treatment as factors and the baseline value as a covariate.</description>

    <measure>Safety Assessed by Adverse Events (AEs), Electrocardiogram (ECG), Vital Signs, Physical Exam and Laboratory Tests</measure>
    <time_frame>From first dose to within 30 days after last dose of double blind study medication (up to 16 weeks).</time_frame>
    <description>Abnormal laboratory parameters, vital signs or ECG data were defined as AEs if the abnormality induced clinical signs or symptoms, needed active intervention, interruption or discontinuation of study medication or was clinically significant. A serious AE was an event resulting in death, persistent or significant disability/incapacity or congenital anomaly or birth defect, was life-threatening, required or prolonged hospitalization or was considered medically important. AEs were assessed by the Investigator for intensity as mild, moderate or severe and for causal relationship to study drug.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline to Weeks 1, 4, 8, 12 and End of Treatment in International Prostate Symptoms Score (IPSS) Total Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Weeks 1, 4, 8 and 12</time_frame>
    <description>The IPSS is a validated global questionnaire used to assess the degree of &quot;bother&quot; from benign prostatic hyperplasia symptoms and is based on the answers to 7 questions concerning urinary symptoms. Each question is assigned points from 0 to 5 indicating increasing severity of the particular symptom. The total score can therefore range from 0 to 35 (asymptomatic to very symptomatic).

        <description>Healthy micturitions (urinations) result in complete emptying of the bladder. Post Void Residual (PVR) is the volume of urine retained after voiding and was assessed using abdominal ultrasound. An increasing PVR over time is an indicator of abnormal bladder function or detrusor decompensation.
Least squares means were derived from an ANCOVA model with the pooled study center and treatment as factors and the baseline value as a covariate.</description>

          <description>Healthy micturitions (urinations) result in complete emptying of the bladder. Post Void Residual (PVR) is the volume of urine retained after voiding and was assessed using abdominal ultrasound. An increasing PVR over time is an indicator of abnormal bladder function or detrusor decompensation.
Least squares means were derived from an ANCOVA model with the pooled study center and treatment as factors and the baseline value as a covariate.</description>
          <population>The Safety Analysis set included all participants who received at least one dose of study drug. End of treatment (EOT) analysis includes the last assessment for patients who did not complete the Week 12 visit; N indicates the number of patients included at each time point.</population>

        <description>The IPSS is a validated global questionnaire used to assess the degree of “bother” from benign prostatic hyperplasia symptoms and is based on the answers to 7 questions concerning urinary symptoms. Each question is assigned points from 0 to 5 indicating increasing severity of the particular symptom. The total score can therefore range from 0 to 35 (asymptomatic to very symptomatic).
Least squares means were derived from an ANCOVA model with the pooled study center and treatment as factors and the baseline value as a covariate.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline to Weeks 1, 4, 8, 12 and End of Treatment in International Prostate Symptoms Score (IPSS) Voiding Score</title>
        <description>The IPSS is a validated global questionnaire used to assess the degree of “bother” from benign prostatic hyperplasia symptoms based on the answers to 7 questions concerning urinary symptoms. Each question is assigned points from 0 to 5 indicating increasing severity of the particular symptom. The voiding score is the sum of the responses to 4 questions relating to urination (incomplete emptying, intermittency, weak stream and straining) and ranges from 0 to 20 (asymptomatic to very symptomatic).
Least squares means were derived from an ANCOVA model with the pooled study center and treatment as factors and the baseline value as a covariate.</description>

          <population>Full Analysis Set included all patients who received at least 1 dose of double-blind study drug &amp; had both Qmax &amp; PdetQmax measurements at Baseline &amp; 1 or both at any postbaseline on-treatment visit. The analysis only includes patients with &gt;0 incontinence episodes at baseline. End of treatment (EOT) includes patients who didn't complete Week 12.</population>
