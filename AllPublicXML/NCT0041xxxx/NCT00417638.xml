  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Rapid MI-ICE-Pilot is designed to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of the Celsius Control™
      System (CCS) endovascular catheter to reduce the infarct size resulting from acute anterior
      myocardial infarction when used in combination with cold saline as an adjunct to immediate
      percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) in patients with an occluded infarct-related artery.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The CCS is an endovascular thermal control system that circulates cooled saline through an
      indwelling central venous catheter in a closed-loop manner. The system has received 510(k)
      approval from the FDA for use in temperature management in neuro-surgical and cardiac
      patients during surgery and in recovery/intensive care. It has also received European CE mark
      and Australian TGA approval. Animal data in a model of acute myocardial infraction support
      the hypothesis that rapid cooling, prior to acute PCI, may reduce infarct size. Meta-analysis
      of the previous acute MI trials ICE-IT (N = 228; 1:1 randomization, hypothermia : control,
      Innercool Therapies, Inc.) and COOL MI-I (Radiant Medical, Inc) suggests there is a reduction
      in infarct size as measured by 30-day SPECT in the population of patients with anterior MIs
      who were cooled below 35 C prior to PCI.

      This study is designed to investigate the safety, feasibility and efficacy of rapid
      endovascular cooling in the setting of acute PCI in patients with anterior infarctions.

      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

        Each eligible patient must meet the following inclusion criteria :

          1. Have ECG evidence of ongoing acute anterior myocardial infarction, involving a large
             area of myocardium, as defined by the following ECG criteria: a. Anterior infarct:
             ST-segment elevation &gt;0.2mV measured 0.08 sec after the J point in 2 or more
             anatomically contiguous precordial leads, V1 through V4; and/or &gt;0.2mV in lead V5 V6

          2. Present to the RAPID MI-ICE site within six (6) hours of the onset of acute cardiac
             ischemic signs or symptoms (such as chest pain or pressure, arm or jaw pain, dyspnea,
             nausea/vomiting, or syncope)

          3. Be a candidate for PCI and have PCI planned as the immediate intervention.

          4. Be willing and able to comply with study procedures, including returning for the MRI
             scan at 4 ±2 days and return for the clinical examination on Day 30

          5. Provide written informed consent prior to the initiation of study-specific procedures

          6. Be in Killips Class I

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Patients are not eligible for the study if they meet one or more of the following criteria:

          1. Age less than eighteen (&lt;18) years of age

          2. Age greater than seventy-five (&gt;75) years of age

          3. Are pregnant

          7. Acute administration of a thrombolytic agent for the qualifying MI

          8. If (during the screening process) the determination is made by site-study personnel
             that initiation of cooling prior to diagnostic coronary angiography is technically not
             feasible for any reason (should the patient be randomized to the Hypothermia Arm), the
             prospective subject should not be enrolled

          9. Require an immediate surgical or procedural intervention other than PCI (e.g. CABG)

         10. Present in cardiogenic shock or with end-stage cardiomyopathy

         11. Have undergone at least ten (10) minutes of cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) prior
             to presentation to the PCI facility

         12. History of previous MI with known, pre-existing, anterior pathologic Q-waves

         13. History of surgical coronary artery revascularization (e.g., CABG, MIDCAB, or OPCAB)

         14. Recent stroke (within 3 months)

         15. Active bleeding, coagulopathy, or other contraindication to the placement of a
             heparin-coated 14F central venous catheter via a 14F femoral venous introducer sheath
             (e.g., known history of heparin induced thrombocytopenia, or IVC filter)

         16. Contraindications to hypothermia, such as patients with known hematologic dyscrasias
             which affect thrombosis (e.g., cryoglobulinemia, sickle cell disease, serum cold
             agglutinins) or vasospastic disorders (such as Raynaud's or thromboangitis obliterans)

         17. Personal or familial history of malignant hyperthermia

         18. Known end-stage renal disease (ESRD; e.g., on dialysis, or status-post renal
             transplant), known hepatic failure (e.g., cirrhosis, or acute hepatitis), or any other
             contraindication to receiving meperidine (such as use of MAO inhibitors within
             previous 14 days, history of seizures, history of hypersensitivity to meperidine,
             etc.) [Note: Patients with a contraindication to buspirone administration may be
             enrolled but should not be given buspirone as part of the anti-shivering regimen.]

         19. Any other acute or chronic condition which the Investigator believes will unacceptably
             increase the risk of study participation or interfere with study procedures and
             assessments

         20. Deemed unsuitable by the investigators to participate in the study.

         21. Signs of cardiogenic shock or other signs of significant heart failure such as rales
             over the lungs

         22. Active or recent (within 1 month prior to study enrollment) participation in another
             investigational clinical research study
