  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Type 2 diabetes mellitus, T2D is a disease characterized by an immense growing prevalence
      world wide with an increased risk of myocardial infarction and stroke. GLP-1 has convincing
      effects on the high glucose levels in type 2 diabetic patients and is well tolerated. New
      animal studies indicate a protective effect of GLP-1 in the brain and the heart. The
      mechanism behind this is yet not known.

      The study hypothesis is that during hypoglycaemia GLP-1 will stimulate glucose-uptake in the
      brain and heart independent of insulin and thereby exert protective effects in the brain.

      Type 2 diabetes mellitus, T2D is a disease characterized by an immense growing prevalence
      world wide. T2D is associated with a three-fold increase in cardiovascular complications
      (myocardial infarction and stroke) leading to significantly higher morbidity and mortality in
      this group of patients. The prospective British Diabetes Study (UKPDS) showed that neither
      diet alone nor the pharmaceutical treatment utilized (Sulphonylurea, Metformin, Insulin) were
      able to reduce these macrovascular complications. GLP-1 (glucagon-like-peptide-1)is an
      incretin with convincing effects on glycaemia in type 2 diabetic patients with little or no
      risk of hypoglycaemia. New research in animal models has shown a potential protective effect
      in the brain and heart in association with ischaemic damage. The mechanism behind this
      protective effect is not known. During hypoglycaemia the brain lacks glucose which is the
      main fuel for sufficient brain function. The brain will compensate by increasing glucose
      uptake across the blood brain barrier and similarly in the heart.

      The effect of native GLP-1 on glucose uptake in the brain and heart will by visualized by
      fluoro-deoxy-glucose FDG-PET-scan during hypoglycaemia in healthy men. At the same time a
      pancreatic/pituitary clamp will be performed. The hypothesis is that GLP-1 directly will
      stimulate glucose uptake independent of the pancreatic hormones and through this mechanism
      exert neuro- and cardioprotective actions.

      Comparisons: FDG-uptake in the brain and heart with GLP-1 infusion compared to placebo.
