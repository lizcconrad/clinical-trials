  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study assessed the effect of pancrelipase delayed release capsules on fat and nitrogen
      absorption in subjects with PEI due to Chronic Pancreatitis and Pancreatectomy. There was a
      run-in with a 5-day of single-blind placebo treatment, followed by a 7-day Double-blind
      period and a 6-month Open-Label Follow-up.

      <recruitment_details>Subjects were recruited in centers in Bulgaria, Poland, Russia, Serbia, Ukraine and US between April 2007 and August 2008. This report presents the double-blind (DB) period of the study as well as the Open Label (OL) results.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>There was a run-in with a 5-day of single-blind placebo treatment. One hundred and eighty subjects were consented and 179 entered the run-in. A total of 54 subjects were randomly allocated to treatment. Only two subjects did not complete the DB period of the treatment because of protocol violation. Fifty one patients entered the OL period.</pre_assignment_details>
