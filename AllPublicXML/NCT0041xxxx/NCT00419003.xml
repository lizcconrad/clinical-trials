  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is examining the safety and effectiveness of two medications, ketamine and
      riluzole, in treating patients with treatment resistant major depressive disorder. This study
      will also examine the effectiveness of an FDA approved drug called lamotrigine in decreasing
      the potential side effects associated with ketamine.

      This research proposal will investigate a glutamate-modulating agent, riluzole, in
      treatment-resistant patients who exhibit an acute, sustained response to a single dose of
      intravenous (IV) racemic ketamine. Fifty ketamine-responders will be randomized to riluzole
      or placebo in a 4-week, randomized, double-blind, continuation-phase study.

    <description>Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale, each of the ten items can be scored from 0 (absence of symptoms to 6 most severe) and has a total score range of 0-60. A lower score on a MADRS indicates a less severe depression. The primary outcome for the initial phase of the trial was the 24-h MADRS score, which included all 10 MADRS items.</description>

The randomization list was created by a biostatistician with no patient contact. 300 mg of lamotrigine 2 hrs prior to ketamine infusion. Responders were randomized to one of two continuation pharmacotherapy groups, receiving either two capsules of riluzole 50 mg each (100 mg/d) or matching pill placebo under double-blind conditions.</description>

        <description>Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale, each of the ten items can be scored from 0 (absence of symptoms to 6 most severe) and has a total score range of 0-60. A lower score on a MADRS indicates a less severe depression. The primary outcome for the initial phase of the trial was the 24-h MADRS score, which included all 10 MADRS items.</description>

    </certain_agreements>
    <limitations_and_caveats>The open-label administration of ketamine limits interpretation of phase 1 results. The sample size was too small to detect moderators and mediators of response. Third,lack of placebo-controlled efficacy data supporting riluzole's use in depression.</limitations_and_caveats>
