      The purpose of this research study is to compare subject comfort during and after injection
      with NADGL and Captique速 Injectable Gel, in the nasolabial folds. Captique速 is an
      FDA-approved product without lidocaine and is manufactured by Genzyme Biosurgery (Ridgefield,
      NJ). NADGL is a new product (not FDA approved) with lidocaine and is also manufactured by
      Genzyme Biosurgery. We do not know which of these treatments results in less pain during and
      after injection. The safety of NADGL is also being studied.
