      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as cytarabine, work in different ways to stop the
      growth of abnormal cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing.
      Giving low-doses of cytarabine may be an effective treatment for Down syndrome and transient
      myeloproliferative disorder. Sometimes the disease may not need treatment until it
      progresses. In this case, observation may be sufficient.

      PURPOSE: This phase III trial is studying low-dose cytarabine to see how well it works in
      treating infants with Down syndrome and transient myeloproliferative disorder.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Determine whether very low-dose cytarabine can improve event-free survival (EFS) rates
           in infants with high-risk transient myeloproliferative disorder (TMD), using high-risk
           TMD patients from clinical trial COG-A2971 for historic comparison, and in infants with
           intermediate-risk TMD, using intermediate-risk TMD patients from clinical trial
           COG-A2971 for historic comparison.

        -  Maintain the current high overall EFS rate in low-risk TMD patients.

      Secondary

        -  Assess the toxicity of this regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a nonrandomized, multicenter, crossover study. Patients are stratified
      according to disease risk (high or intermediate vs low).

        -  Group I (patients with high- or intermediate-risk transient myeloproliferative disorder
           [TMD]): Patients receive very low-dose cytarabine subcutaneously twice daily on days
           1-7. Treatment repeats every 14 days for up to 4 courses in the absence of disease
           progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients achieving stable disease or complete or
           hepatic clinical remission undergo observation.

        -  Group II (patients with low-risk TMD): Patients are observed. If symptoms of
           intermediate- or high-risk disease develop, patients may crossover to group I.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically for 10 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 180 patients will be accrued for this study.
