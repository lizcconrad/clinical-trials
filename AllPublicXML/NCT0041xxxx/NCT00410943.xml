    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study was to characterize a safe and effective means of conversion and
      titration to an appropriate dose of hydromorphone HCI, to demonstrate comparable efficacy of
      OROS hydromorphone HCI SR (slow release) and hydromorphone HCI IR (immediate release)
      following administration of approximately equivalent total daily doses and demonstrate a
      significant dose-response relationship between OROS hydromorphone HCI SR (slow release) for
      breakthrough pain medication use or alternatively, diary-based analgesic scores

      This was a randomized (patients are assigned different treatments based on chance),
      double-blind (neither the patient nor the physician knows whether drug or placebo is being
      taken, or at what dosage), repeated-dose, three-arm parallel group study conducted in three
      phases. Following a Prior Opioid Stabilization Phase, wherein patients were required to be on
      a stable dose of chronic opioid therapy, patients were converted, titrated and stabilized on
      hydromorphone HCI IR (immediate release) to achieve acceptable levels of analgesia in the
      Open-Label Hydromorphone HCI IR (immediate release) Conversion, Titration, and Stabilization
      Phase. Supplementary hydromorphone HCI IR (immediate release) was provided for breakthrough
      pain, and patients were considered stabilized on hydromorphone HCI IR (immediate release)
      when the total daily dose of hydromorphone HCI IR (immediate release) remained unchanged with
      no more than three hydromorphone HCI IR (immediate release) breakthrough pain medication
      doses per day for 2 consecutive days. Patients who were able to achieve a stable total daily
      dose of at least 20 mg but not more than 60 mg of hydromorphone HCI IR (immediate release)
      (exclusive of breakthrough pain medication) within the 14 day Open-Label hydromorphone HCI IR
      (immediate release) Conversion, Titration, and Stabilization Phase of the study entered the
      Double-Blind, Randomized, Repeat Dosing Phase of the study. Patients were randomized to
      receive 7 days of either OROS hydromorphone HCI SR (slow release) at a daily dose
      approximately equal to their stabilized total daily dose of hydromorphone HCI IR (immediate
      release), OROS hydromorphone HCI SR (slow release) at a daily dose approximately equal to
      one-half their stabilized total daily dose of hydromorphone HCI IR (immediate release) (1/2
      OROS hydromorphone slow release), or hydromorphone HCI IR (immediate release) at the same
      daily dose on which they were stabilized (hydromorphone immediate release). Patients who
      completed the study were eligible for participation in an open-label OROS hydromorphone SR
      (slow release) long-term extension study (Protocol DO-109). OROS hydromorphone slow release
      8, 16 and 32 mg tablets, hydromorphone immediate release 2 and 4 mg tablets, placebo
      immediate release 2 and 4 mg tablets and placebo slow release 8, 16, and 32 mg tablets taken
      orally for 7 days

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients who have chronic non-malignant or cancer pain currently receiving strong or
             transdermal opioid analgesics on a daily basis or patients suitable for advancement of
             therapy to step 3 on the WHO (World Health Organization) analgesic ladder

          -  Patients who, at Visit 2, require the equivalent of at least 80 mg but no more than
             300 mg of oral morphine sulfate (exclusive of breakthrough pain medication) every 24
             hours or at least 25 micrograms an hour but no more than 75 micrograms an hour of
             Fentanyl

          -  Patients must be on a stable dose of a strong opioid medication at Visit 2. Patients
             will be considered stabilized when the total daily dose of their prestudy opioid
             medication remains unchanged, with no more than three opioid breakthrough pain
             doses/day administered for breakthrough pain, for two consecutive days

          -  Patients who can be expected to have reasonably stable opioid requirements for the
             duration of the study

          -  Patients who are pregnant or breast-feeding. Female patients of child-bearing
             potential must be following a medically recognized contraceptive program prior to and
             during the study. A negative pregnancy test is required prior to administration of
             study drug

          -  Patients with any gastrointestinal disorder, including pre-existing severe
             gastrointestinal narrowing that may affect the absorption or transit of orally

          -  Patients with any intracranial lesion, increased intracranial pressure, seizure
             disorder, stroke within the past 6 months, and disorders of cognition
