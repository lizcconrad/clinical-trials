        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Healthy male and female subjects, 18-50 years of age, in good health as determined by
             past medical history, physical examination, vital signs, electrocardiogram, and
             laboratory tests at screening.

          -  Vital signs within the following parameters:

        oral body temperature between 35.0-37.5 Â°C systolic blood pressure, 85-140 mm Hg diastolic
        blood pressure, 50-90 mm Hg pulse rate, 40 - 100 beats per minute (bpm)

          -  Female subjects must have been surgically sterilized at least 6 months prior to
             screening, with supportive clinical documentation OR Postmenopausal women must have no
             regular menstrual bleeding for at least 1 year prior to inclusion.

          -  Body mass index (BMI) must be within the range of 18 to 30 kg/m2. Subjects must weigh
             at least 50 kg to participate in this study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Smokers (use of tobacco products in the previous 3 months). Smokers will be defined as
             any subject who reports tobacco use or has a urine cotinine greater than 300 ng/ml

          -  Participation in any clinical investigation involving medical intervention within 4
             weeks before study start

          -  Donation or loss of 400 ml or more of blood within 8 weeks prior to before study start

          -  Significant illness within 2 weeks before study start

          -  A past personal or close family medical history of clinically significant ECG
             abnormalities or of a prolonged QT-interval syndrome.

          -  History of autonomic dysfunction (e.g. history of fainting, orthostatic hypotension).

          -  History of acute or chronic bronchospastic disease (including asthma and chronic
             obstructive pulmonary disease, treated or not treated),

          -  History of clinically significant drug allergy or history of atopic allergy (asthma,
             urticaria, eczematous dermatitis). A known hypersensitivity to the study drug or drugs
             similar to the study drug particularly benzodiazepines.

          -  Any surgical or medical condition which might significantly alter the absorption,
             distribution, metabolism or excretion of drugs or which may jeopardize the subject in
             case of participation in the study, including bowel, gastrointestinal, renal,
             pancreatic, hepatic, hematological, immunological, or neurological disorders.
