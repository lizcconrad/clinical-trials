    <textblock>
      This phase I trial is studying the side effects and best dose of eribulin mesylate and
      gemcitabine hydrochloride in treating patients with metastatic or unresectable solid tumors.
      Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as eribulin mesylate and gemcitabine hydrochloride, work in
      different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping
      them from dividing. Giving more than one drug (combination chemotherapy) may kill more tumor
      cells.

      OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the recommended phase II dose (RPTD) of E7389 (eribulin mesylate) when given in
      combination with gemcitabine (gemcitabine hydrochloride) in patients with advanced cancer.

      II. Determine the safety, tolerability, and toxicity profile of E7389 and gemcitabine given
      in combination.

      III. Assess the antitumor activity of E7389 in combination with gemcitabine in patients with
      measurable disease.

      IV. Determine the pharmacokinetic profile of E7389 and gemcitabine to assess for any possible
      interactions between the two agents.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter, dose-escalation study. Patients receive eribulin mesylate
      intravenously (IV) and gemcitabine hydrochloride IV over 30 minutes on days 1, 8, and 15 OR
      on days 1 and 8.

      Courses repeat every 28 or 21 days* in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity. Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of eribulin mesylate and
      gemcitabine hydrochloride until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is
      defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 3 or 2 of 6 patients experience
      dose-limiting toxicity (DLT). NOTE: *If DLT is observed at the first dose level of the 28-day
      schedule, subsequent patients are treated on days 1 and 8 of the 21-day schedule; patients
      enrolled in the expansion cohort (patients with ovarian or endometrial cancer or
      chemotherapy-naive or minimally pre-treated cancer) receive treatment according to the 21-day
      schedule.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed at 4 weeks and then every 3 months
      thereafter.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients must have histologically confirmed malignancy that is metastatic or
             unresectable and for which standard curative antineoplastic drug treatments do not
             exist or are no longer effective:

               -  Ovarian/Endometrial Expansion Cohort: Patients must have histologically or
                  cytologically confirmed ovarian or endometrial malignancy that is metastatic or
                  unresectable and for which standard curative antineoplastic drug treatments do
                  not exist or are no longer effective

          -  CHEMOTHERAPY: Patients may have had up to two prior chemotherapy regimens for advanced
             or metastatic incurable solid tumors; prior (neo) adjuvant chemotherapy is allowed and
             not considered among the maximum of two prior regimens; patients must have completed
             any prior chemotherapy at least 4 weeks prior to registration; prior treatment with
             gemcitabine is not allowed

               -  Chemo Naïve/Minimally Pre-Treated Cohort: Patients may not have received any
                  prior chemotherapy for metastatic disease; prior adjuvant chemotherapy is
                  allowed; patients must have completed any prior chemotherapy at least 4 weeks
                  prior to registration; prior treatment with gemcitabine is not allowed

               -  RADIATION: patients may have received prior radiation, however this must have
                  been completed at least 4 weeks prior to registration; patients must not have had
                  more than 40% of their bone marrow irradiated and must have either measurable
                  disease outside the field or progression post radiation therapy

               -  SURGERY: patients may have had prior surgery; patients must be at least 4 weeks
                  from any major surgery prior to registration on the study

          -  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status (PS) =&lt; 2 (Karnofsky &gt;=
             60%)

          -  Life expectancy &gt; 3 months

          -  Leukocytes &gt;= 3 x 10^9/L

          -  Absolute neutrophil count &gt;= 1.5 x 10^9/L

          -  Platelets &gt;= 100 x 10^9/L

          -  Total bilirubin within normal institutional limits

          -  Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) (serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase
             [SGOT])/alanine aminotransferase (ALT) (serum glutamic pyruvate transaminase [SGPT])
             =&lt; 2.5 x institutional upper limit of normal

          -  Creatinine clearance &gt;= 60 mL/min/1.73 m^2 for patients with creatinine levels above
             institutional normal

          -  Since cytochrome P450 (CYP)3A4 appears to be the major enzyme responsible for the
             human hepatic metabolism of E7389 in vitro, the concurrent use of inhibitors and
             inducers of CYP3A4 are prohibited during the study treatment period; concurrent use of
             CYP3A4 substrates are allowed, however, use caution and monitor the patient for
             potential drug interactions

          -  The effects of E7389 on the developing human fetus are unknown; for this reason and
             because antitubulin agents as well as other therapeutic agents used in this trial are
             known to be teratogenic, women of child-bearing potential and men must agree to use
             adequate contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior
             to study entry and for the duration of study participation; should a woman become
             pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while participating in this study, she should
             inform her treating physician immediately

          -  Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients who have had chemotherapy, biologic therapy, hormonal therapy or radiotherapy
             within 4 weeks (6 weeks for nitrosoureas or mitomycin C) prior to entering the study
             or those who have not recovered to &lt; Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events
             (CTCAE) grade 2 from adverse events due to agents administered more than 4 weeks
             earlier are not eligible to participate in this study; grade 1 persisting toxicities
             or those deemed irreversible will not be exclusionary; patients who have received
             prior gemcitabine are also excluded

          -  Patients may not be receiving any other investigational agents concurrently; patients
             should not be receiving any other anticancer therapy while on study, such as hormonal,
             biologic, or targeted therapies

          -  Patients with known brain metastases should be excluded from this clinical trial
             because of their poor prognosis and because they often develop progressive neurologic
             dysfunction that would confound the evaluation of neurologic and other adverse events

          -  History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic
             composition to E7389 or gemcitabine used in study

          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac
             arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with
             study requirements

          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study because E7389 is an antitubulin agent with
             the potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects; because there is an unknown
             but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the
             mother with E7389, breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is treated with
             E7389; these potential risks may also apply to other agents used in this study

          -  Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-positive patients on combination antiretroviral
             therapy are ineligible because of the potential for pharmacokinetic interactions with
             E7389; in addition, these patients are at increased risk of lethal infections when
             treated with marrow-suppressive therapy; appropriate studies will be undertaken in
             patients receiving combination antiretroviral therapy when indicated
