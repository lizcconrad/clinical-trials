    <textblock>
      The objective of this pilot study are (i) to compare response to chemotherapy, time to
      disease progression and overall survival in patients with pancreatic cancer who will be
      treated with gemcitabine who demonstrate 18F-FLT uptake to those patients who do not
      demonstrate 18F-FLT uptake; (ii) to correlate 18F-FLT uptake with hENT1 expression with
      biopsy samples where available; (iii)to determine the presence or absence of uptake, the
      relative uptake score (RUS) and tumor to background ratios of 18F-FLT in patients with known
      carcinoma of the pancreas and assess this uptake in relation to time to disease progression;
      and (iv) to demonstrate the safety of 18F-FLT manufactured at the Edmonton PET Centre.
