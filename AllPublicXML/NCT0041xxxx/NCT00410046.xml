    <measure>Change in Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Functional Index (BASFI) Score From Baseline to Week 38</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 38 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>BASFI is a validated self assessment tool that determines the degree of functional limitation in Ankylosing Spodylitis (AS) patients. Utilizing a VAS of 0-10 (0=easy, 10=impossible), patients answered 10 questions assessing their ability in completing normal daily activities or physically demanding activities. The BASFI score is a mean score of the 10 questions, with a maximum score of 100 mm. The 0881A3-402 (NCT00247962) baseline score was used as the baseline for this analysis. Change = baseline - week 38.</description>

Healthcare resource utilization was evaluated using a questionnaire asking patients whether or not they had used the healthcare resource during the 48 weeks preceding enrollment in study 0881A3-402 (NCT00247962) and during the 48 weeks of treatment in this extension study (0881A3-405).</description>
          <population>All patients who took ETN and completed study 0881A3-402 (NCT00247962), continued into this study, received at least 1 dose of study drug and had at least 1 post-baseline assessment.</population>

        <description>BASMI is an objective measure of spinal mobility. The BASMI score is composed of 5 measures: cervical rotation, intermalleolar distance, modified Schober's test, lateral flexion and tragus to wall distance. Each measure was scored 0-2 (0=normal mobility, 2=severe reduction) to give a final score ranging 0 to 10. The 0881A3-402 (NCT00247962) baseline score was used as the baseline for this analysis. Change = baseline - week 38.</description>

        <title>Change in Baseline Ankylosing Spondylitis Quality of Life (ASQoL) Score From Baseline to Week 38</title>
        <description>ASQoL is a questionnaire that assesses disease-specific quality of life (QoL). It consists of 18 statements that are relevant to the physical and mental conditions for a patient with Ankylosing Spondylitis (AS): mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression. Each statement is answered by the patient as a ‘Yes’ (scored as 1) or ‘No’ (scored as 0). All item scores are summed to give a total score. Total score can range from 0 (good QoL) to 18 (poor QoL). The 0881A3-402 baseline score was used as the baseline for this analysis. Change = baseline - week 38.</description>

          <title>Change in Baseline Ankylosing Spondylitis Quality of Life (ASQoL) Score From Baseline to Week 38</title>
          <description>ASQoL is a questionnaire that assesses disease-specific quality of life (QoL). It consists of 18 statements that are relevant to the physical and mental conditions for a patient with Ankylosing Spondylitis (AS): mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression. Each statement is answered by the patient as a ‘Yes’ (scored as 1) or ‘No’ (scored as 0). All item scores are summed to give a total score. Total score can range from 0 (good QoL) to 18 (poor QoL). The 0881A3-402 baseline score was used as the baseline for this analysis. Change = baseline - week 38.</description>
          <population>All patients who completed study 0881A3-402 (NCT00247962), continued into this study, received at least 1 dose of study drug, had at least 1 post-baseline assessment, and completed 38 weeks.</population>
