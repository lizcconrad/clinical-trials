      The purpose of this study is to determine the extend and the nature of anemia in school
      children and the correlation between anemia and schistosomiasis infections, malaria
      infections and/or malnutrition (iron deficiency).

    <textblock>
      The study will be carried out in an area around Lake Victoria in Kenya where the prevalence
      of schistosomiasis and malaria are highest in the areas nearest to the Lake. Depending on the
      prevalence of schistosomiasis a sample of between 876 to 2.524 children will be enrolled in
      the study. The children who will be in the age between 9 to 12 year, will have their stool
      and urine examined for schistosomiasis and intestinal worms and a blood sample will be
      examined for malaria parasites and the hemoglobin level. Children will also be weight,
      measured and examined by a doctor and register their food intake over one week, to determine
      their nutritional status. Children who are found to be infected with schistosomiasis,
      intestinal worms or malaria will be offered treatment. Children who are found to have anemia
      will be offered a course of iron supplementation, children with severe anemia will be
      referred to the nearest health facility for treatment. 12 months after the initial
      examinations and treatment all children will have a re-examination of their stool, urine and
      blood.
