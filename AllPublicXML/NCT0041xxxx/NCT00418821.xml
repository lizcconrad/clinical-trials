      The purpose of this study is to determine if laronidase is present in the breast milk of
      post-partum women receiving Aldurazyme® (laronidase) and the effects of Aldurazyme
      (laronidase) on the growth, development, and immunologic response of their breastfed infants.

        Inclusion Criteria (Mothers):

          -  The patient must have a documented laronidase deficiency with a fibroblast, plasma,
             serum, leukocyte, or dried blood spot laronidase enzyme activity assay.

          -  Be pregnant, planning to breastfeed post-partum, and receiving Aldurazyme (laronidase)
             therapy while breastfeeding.

          -  Provide signed, written informed consent prior to any protocol-related procedures.
             Consent of a legally authorized guardian(s) is (are) required for mothers younger than

             guardian(s).

          -  Provide signed, written informed consent for their infants to participate as study
             patients. If a mother is younger than 18 years of age, consent for mother and infant
             will be obtained from the legal guardian.

        Exclusion Criteria (Mothers and Infants):

          -  Have a medical condition, serious intercurrent illness, or other extenuating
             circumstance that may interfere with study compliance, including all prescribed
             evaluations and follow-up activities.

          -  Have received an investigational drug within 30 days prior to study enrollment.
