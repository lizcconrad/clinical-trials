    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the safety and efficacy of Tegaserod in opioid-induced constipation
      in patients with non-cancer pain.

      Patients who enter this study PRIOR to the core study (CHTF919N2201) interim analysis receive
      the treatment as follows:

      Patients will be randomly assigned to receive open label tegaserod 6 mg b.i.d. or tegaserod
      12 mg o.d. using an allocation ratio of 1:1.

      Patients who enter this study AFTER the core study interim analysis receive the treatment as
      follows:

      Patients will be assigned to receive the selected tegaserod dose regimen (as determined by
      the core study interim analysis) in an open label fashion.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Male and female outpatients 18 years of age or older.

          -  Patients with chronic non-cancer pain that necessitates the use of non- injectable
             opioid analgesics.

          -  Chronic pain which has been present for a minimum of 3 months which needs the chronic
             use of opioids for pain relief.

          -  Constipation, according to the investigator's clinical judgment, that is resulting
             from opioid use for non-cancer chronic pain. Opioid-induced Constipation (OIC) is
             defined as follows:

        less than 3 spontaneous bowel movements per week and at least one of the following on at
        least 25% of occasions:

          1. Hard or very hard stools

          2. sensation of incomplete evacuation

          3. straining while having a bowel movement

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  1. Who are receiving opioids for abdominal pain or connective tissue disorders.

          -  Planned discontinuation of opioids during the study

          -  Who underwent major surgery within 3 months prior to screening.

          -  With a history of prior chronic constipation (CC) that was present for more than three
             months and that was not related to opioid use.

          -  With a current diagnosis of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) constipation predominant or
             alternators.

          -  With a previous use of tegaserod within 3 months prior to baseline.

        Other protocol-defined inclusion/exclusion criteria may apply
