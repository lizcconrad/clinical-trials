      The primary purpose of this phase I study is to determine the safety of combining
      replication-competent adenovirus-mediated suicide gene therapy with chemoradiotherapy in
      patients with non-metastatic pancreatic cancer.

      The objectives of this study are:

      To determine the toxicity and maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of the Ad5-yCD/mutTKSR39rep-ADP
      adenovirus in combination with 5-fluorocytosine (5-FC) and valganciclovir (vGCV) prodrug
      therapy and standard chemoradiation. Fifteen to 30 subjects (5 cohorts of 3 - 6 subjects
      each) with non-metastatic, unresectable pancreatic cancer will receive a single intratumoral
      injection of the Ad5-yCD/mutTKSR39rep-ADP adenovirus at one of five dose levels (1 x 10e10
      vp, 3 x 10e10 vp, 1 x 10e11 vp, 3 x 10e11 vp, 1 x 10e12 vp) under endoscopic ultrasound
      (EUS)-guidance. Beginning three days later, subjects will receive 3 weeks (15 days) of 5-FC
      and vGCV prodrug therapy concomitant with a 6 week (30 day) course of capecitabine
      chemotherapy and 54 Gy conformal radiotherapy.

      The primary endpoint is toxicity at 12 weeks. Secondary endpoints are: 1) tumor
      (radiological) response, 2) time to disease progression, 3) survival, 4) persistence of
      Ad5-yCD/mutTKSR39rep-ADP adenoviral DNA in blood, 5) infectious Ad5-yCD/mutTKSR39rep-ADP
      adenovirus in blood, and 6) HSV-1 TK gene expression in the pancreas.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Age &gt; = 18 and &lt; = 80.

          -  Non-metastatic, unresectable tumors

          -  No evidence of peritoneal and/or hematogenous metastasis.

          -  Histologically proven (biopsy or cytology) adenocarcinoma.

          -  No evidence of peritoneal and/or hematogenous metastasis.

          -  No prior chemotherapy, radiotherapy or biological therapy.

          -  ECOG performance status 0 - 2.

          -  Subjects must have adequate baseline organ function, as assessed by the following
             laboratory values, within 30 days before initiating the study therapy:

          -  Adequate renal function with serum creatinine &lt;=1.5 mg/dL or creatinine clearance &gt;=50
             mL/min/m2.

          -  Absolute WBC &gt; 4,000/μL.

          -  Hemoglobin &gt; 9.0 g/dL.

          -  Platelet count &gt; 100,000/μL.

          -  Bilirubin &lt; 1.5 mg/dL; SGOT and SGPT &lt; 2.5 times upper limit of normal (ULN).

          -  No history of malignancy within 5 years except for non-melanomatous skin cancer or
             carcinoma in situ of the cervix.

          -  Men and women with conceptive potential must agree to follow a medically acceptable
             method of birth control.

          -  Patients on oral warfarin anticoagulation therapy may be included in this study, but
             must have close monitoring of their coagulation parameters as altered parameters
             and/or bleeding have been reported in patients taking Xeloda® and such agents
             concomitantly.

          -  The subject must possess the ability to give informed consent and express a
             willingness to meet all of the expected requirements of the protocol for the duration
             of the study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Serious non-malignant disease (e.g., congestive heart failure or uncontrolled
             infections), which, in the opinion of the investigator would compromise study
             objectives.

          -  Major surgery within four weeks other than diagnostic procedures such as laparoscopy,
             endoscopic ultrasound and stenting or PEG/PEJ placement.

             infection that has required specific therapy within 72 hours of initiation of the
             study therapy (defined as Day 1).

          -  Active HIV disease.

          -  Previous history of liver disease including hepatitis.

          -  Positive serologic test for Hepatitis B or C at baseline.

          -  Immunosuppressive therapy including systemic corticosteroids. Use of inhaled and
             topical corticosteroids is permitted.

          -  Serious medical or psychiatric illness or concomitant medication, which, in the
             judgment of the investigator, might interfere with the subject's ability to respond to
             or tolerate the treatment or complete the trial.

          -  Impaired immunity or susceptibility to serious viral infections.

          -  Allergy to any product used on the protocol including ciprofloxacin.

          -  Clinical or laboratory evidence of pancreatitis
