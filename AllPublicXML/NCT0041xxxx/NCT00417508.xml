    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate whether nutritional supplementation will improve
      functional outcome parameters and nutritional status in elderly patients.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Malnutrition is still a problem in elderly patients and this may be associated with reduced
      muscle strength and ADL function (activities of daily living). Malnourished Medical
      Inpatients/Outpatients and District Nurse patients with a Body Mass Index &lt; 20 kg/m2 are
      asked to participate.

      Comparison(s): The patients are randomized to either ordinary dietary advice with a
      recommendation of four meals per day or similar dietary advice and two daily sip feeding
      supplements. The study supplementation is Fresubin Protein Energy Drink and this will give
      additional 600 kcal and 40 gram protein a day. The study period is 12 weeks with a visit at
      inclusion, week 6 and week 12.

      Primary and secondary outcome parameters are measured at inclusion and week 12
