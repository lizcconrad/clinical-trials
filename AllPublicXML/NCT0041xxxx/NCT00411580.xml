  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the safety and tolerability and Aß-specific antibody response of
      CAD106 in patients with mild to moderate Alzheimer's Disease.

      Patients also had a 2 year follow-up to assess disease progression where no drug was
      administered.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  males and/or females patients between 50 to 80 years of age (both inclusive).

          -  female patients must be without childbearing potential (post-menopausal or surgically
             sterilized).

          -  diagnosis of dementia of the Alzheimer's type according to the DSM-IV criteria
             (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th edition).

          -  mild to moderate AD as confirmed by Mini-Mental State Exam score of 16 to 26 (both
             inclusive) at screening.

          -  able to provide written informed consent and having a responsible caregiver that can
             provide written assent prior to study participation. For patients who have been
             declared mentally incompetent, a legal representative will need to provide informed
             consent on their behalf.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  previously participated in an AD vaccine study and received active treatment

          -  history or presence of an active autoimmune and/or cerebrovascular disease

          -  history or presence of seizures, with an acute or chronic inflammation

          -  clinically relevant atopic condition, who suffer from an other neurodegenerative
             disease and/or psychiatric disorders (with the exception of successfully treated
             depression)

          -  immunosuppressive treatment including systemic steroids

          -  obtained a vaccination (e.g. against influenza) within 4 weeks before the first study
             drug injection

          -  advanced, severe, progressive or unstable disease that might interfere with the safety
             of the patient

          -  started treatment with psychotropic medication within 3 months (4 weeks for SSRIs and
             other newer antidepressants without anticholinergic properties) prior to randomization
             with the exception of mild hypnotic drugs (e.g. zolpidem, zopiclone, oxazepam) and low
             doses of neuroleptic drugs (e.g. up to 2 mg risperidone).

        Patients, who are on stable treatment with cholinesterase-inhibitors (ChEIs) and/or
        memantine for at least 3 months, and/or with SSRIs and/or other newer antidepressants
        (without anticholinergic properties) for at least 4 weeks before randomization, can be
        included into the study.
