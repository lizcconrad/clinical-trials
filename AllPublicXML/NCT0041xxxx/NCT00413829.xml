  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is an evaluation of the short term effects on CNV perfusion of a same-day
      administration of photodynamic therapy (PDT) with Visudyne® and an intravitreal injection of
      Lucentis® (ranibizumab, 0.3 mg). An evaluation of the short term effects on CNV perfusion of
      this combined treatment is needed for better understanding of treatment effects.

      The primary objective is to quantify the short term effects on CNV perfusion of the same-day
      administration of photodynamic therapy with Visudyne® and an intravitreal injection of
      ranibizumab. These short term effects will be assessed with visual acuity measurements and
      ophthalmic examinations including indocyanine green (ICG) and fluorescein angiography (FA) as
      well as Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) measurements. The primary variable for this
      assessment is the incidence of CNV closure one week after combined therapy as assessed with
      high speed ICG angiography. Fluorescein and ICG angiography will be performed using a
      scanning laser ophthalmoscope (HRA). All angiographic studies and OCT examinations will be
      evaluated by the Bern Photographic Reading Center in a masked fashion. Visual acuity
      assessments will be performed with Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS)-like
      visual acuity testing charts.

      A secondary objective is to explore the effect of the same-day administration of photodynamic
      therapy with Visudyne® and an intravitreal injection of ranibizumab:

        -  on retinal thickness as measured by OCT over time

        -  in change of total lesion area, area of CNV assessed by FA

        -  in mean change of VA from baseline over time

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients 50 years of age or greater

          -  Patients with subfoveal choroidal neovascularization lesions secondary to AMD, either
             predominantly classic, occult, or minimally classic.

          -  CNV lesion in the study eye is ≤5400 microns in greatest linear dimension

          -  Patients who have a best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) score between 73 and 24
             letters, inclusively, in the study eye using ETDRS-like grading charts (approximately
             20/40 to 20/320) measured at 4 meters

          -  Willing to return for follow up scheduled visits for a 6 months period

          -  Only one eye will be assessed in the study. If both eyes are eligible, the one with
             the worse visual acuity will be selected for treatment and study unless, based on
             medical reasons, the investigator deems the other eye the more appropriate candidate
             for treatment and study

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients who have a BCVA of &lt; 33 letters (approximately 20/200) in both eyes

          -  Prior treatment in the study eye with verteporfin, external-beam radiation therapy,
             vitrectomy, submacular surgery, other surgical intervention for AMD, or transpupillary
             thermotherapy

          -  Previous or current intravitreal drug delivery (e.g., intravitreal corticosteroid
             injection or device implantation) in the study eye

          -  Concomitant use of chronic NSAIDs or steroids (by any route) for the duration of study
             participation (chronic use is defined as multiple doses taken daily for three or more
             consecutive days at any time during the study). Note that ASA (aspirin) taken as &quot;low
             dose&quot; up to 100 mg daily (qd) for prophylaxis of myocardial infarction (MI) and/or
             stroke is permitted during study

          -  Previous violation of the posterior capsule in the study eye is also excluded unless

             posterior chamber intraocular lens implantation

          -  Spherical equivalent of the refractive error in the study eye demonstrating more than
             -8 diopters of myopia

          -  Presence of a retinal pigment epithelial tear involving the macula in the study eye

          -  Angioid streaks or precursors of CNV in either eye due to other causes, such as ocular
             histoplasmosis, trauma, or pathologic myopia

          -  Active intraocular inflammation (grade trace or above) in the study eye

          -  Any active infection involving an eyeball adnexa
