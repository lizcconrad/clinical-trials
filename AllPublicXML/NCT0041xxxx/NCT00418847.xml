      The purpose of the study is to investigate the pharmacokinetics of Zavesca (miglustat,
      OGT918) when given as single and multiple doses in juvenile patients with GM2 gangliosidosis.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The GM2 gangliosidoses are a group of neuro-degenerative lysosomal storage diseases resulting
      from accumulation of GM2 and related glycolipids in the central nervous system (CNS).
      Tay-Sachs and Sandhoff disease are two variants which are indistinguishable in clinical
      grounds. According to the onset and rate of disease progression, the condition can be
      categorized in infantile, juvenile and adult forms. This open-label, single-arm study is
      designed to assess the pharmacokinetics, safety and tolerability of miglustat in juvenile
      patients. Miglustat will be administered at a maximum dose of 600 mg/day, divided into three
      doses per day. The dose used for patients in this pediatric age range will be related to the
      patient's body surface area. The pharmacokinetics assessments for the study will be performed
      in-hospital during a 24 hour period, and will take place at the day one and at the month 3
      visits. The clinical (which includes safety and tolerability) assessments will be performed
      throughout the 24-month study period.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Diagnosis of GM2 gangliosidosis confirmed by demonstration of profound deficiency of

             and for 3 months after cessation of miglustat treatment.

          -  Patients who cannot tolerate the study procedures, cannot be compliant to therapy or
             who are unable to travel to the study center as required by this protocol.

          -  Patients receiving other investigational agents within 3 months of study initiation.

          -  Patients with disease that may affect absorption or elimination of drugs.
