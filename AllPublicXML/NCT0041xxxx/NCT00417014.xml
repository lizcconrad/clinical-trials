      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as chlorambucil, vinblastine, procarbazine, and
      prednisolone, work in different ways to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing
      the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to
      kill cancer cells. Giving more than one drug (combination chemotherapy) together with
      radiation therapy may kill more cancer cells.

      PURPOSE: This clinical trial is studying how well giving combination chemotherapy and/or
      radiation therapy works in treating young patients with Hodgkin's lymphoma.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Establish a uniform practice for the management of children with Hodgkin's lymphoma.

        -  Document the long-term side effects of such management.

        -  Establish whether or not children can be safely managed without staging laparotomy and
           splenectomy.

        -  Establish whether or not chlorambucil, vinblastine, procarbazine hydrochloride, and
           prednisolone (CLVPP) is an effective alternative to mechlorethamine, vincristine,
           procarbazine hydrochloride, and prednisone (MOPP) chemotherapy.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are assigned to 1 of 3 treatment regimens
      according to disease stage and presence of bulky mediastinal disease.

        -  Involved-field radiotherapy (for patients with stage IA [nodal] disease): Patients
           undergo involved-field radiotherapy 5 days a week for 4 weeks.

        -  CLVPP chemotherapy (for patients with all other stages of disease AND no bulky
           mediastinal disease): Patients receive CLVPP chemotherapy comprising oral chlorambucil,
           oral procarbazine hydrochloride, and oral prednisolone on days 1-14 and vinblastine IV
           on days 1 and 8. Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 8 courses in the absence of
           disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

        -  CLVPP chemotherapy and radiotherapy (for patients with all other stages of disease AND
           bulky mediastinal disease): Patients receive CLVPP chemotherapy as above. Patients then
           undergo radiotherapy to the mediastinum beginning 2 weeks after completing the last
           course of CLVPP chemotherapy.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 358 patients were accrued for this study.
