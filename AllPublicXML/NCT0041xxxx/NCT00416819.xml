    <textblock>
      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy work in different ways to stop the growth of cancer
      cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Monoclonal antibodies,
      such as rituximab, can block cancer growth in different ways. Some block the ability of
      cancer cells to grow and spread. Others find cancer cells and help kill them or carry
      cancer-killing substances to them. Giving rituximab together with combination chemotherapy
      may kill more cancer cells.

      PURPOSE: This clinical trial is studying the side effects and best ways to give combination
      chemotherapy together with rituximab in treating patients with newly diagnosed primary CNS
      lymphoma.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Determine the rate of toxicity, in terms of percentage of patients with grade 4
           neurotoxicity, in patients with untreated primary CNS lymphoma treated with induction
           therapy comprising high-dose methotrexate, leucovorin calcium, rituximab, and
           temozolomide followed by consolidation therapy comprising cytarabine and etoposide
           phosphate.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the efficacy of this regimen, in terms of the 4-month and 12-month complete
           and best response rate, in these patients.

        -  Determine the progression-free and overall survival of patients treated with this
           regimen.

        -  Determine the percentage of patients experiencing toxicity or neurotoxicity due to this
           regimen.

        -  Determine the treatment-related mortality rate in patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Document the neurocognitive changes in these patients using the Mini-Mental Status
           Examination during the first year of treatment with this regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is a pilot, multicenter study.

        -  Induction therapy: Patients receive high-dose methotrexate IV over 4 hours on days 1,15,
           29, 43, 57, 71, and 99; leucovorin calcium IV every 6 hours on days 2-4, 16-18, 30-32,
           44-46, 58-60, 72-74, and 100-102; oral temozolomide on days 7-11, 35-39, 63-67, 91-95,
           and 119-123; and rituximab IV on days 3, 17, 31, 45, 59, and 74. Treatment continues in
           the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients who achieve
           complete response proceed to consolidation therapy.

        -  Consolidation therapy I: Beginning 3-4 weeks after completing induction therapy,
           patients receive high-dose methotrexate IV over 4 hours on day 1, leucovorin calcium IV
           every 6 hours on days 2-4, and oral temozolomide on days 7-11.

        -  Consolidation therapy II: Beginning 3-5 weeks after completing consolidation therapy I,
           patients receive cytarabine IV over 2 hours twice daily and etoposide phosphate IV
           continuously on days 1-4 and filgrastim (G-CSF) subcutaneously beginning on day 14 and
           continuing until blood counts recover.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically for 2 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 10 patients will be accrued to this study.
