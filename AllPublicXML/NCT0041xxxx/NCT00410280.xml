    <measure>Maximum Percent Drop From Pre-allergen Baseline in Forced Expiratory Volume in 1 Second (FEV1) for Late-Phase Asthma Response (LAR) at Screening</measure>
    <time_frame>Pre-allergen baseline, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 hours post-allergen inhalation at Screening (Day -14)</time_frame>
    <description>Allergen inhalation test was performed at Screening, Day 14 and 35 to elicit airway responses similar to those that follow natural allergen exposure. FEV1 was the maximal volume of air exhaled in 1 second of a forced expiration from a position of full inspiration. LAR was characterized by a fall in FEV1 of more than or equal to (&gt;=) 15 percent (%) at 3 to 7 hours post-allergen inhalation. Maximum drop in FEV1 relative to the pre-allergen baseline FEV1 between 3 to 7 hours at Screening was reported. Pre-allergen baseline FEV1 was performed in triplicate using spirometry and the best of the 3 values was selected.</description>

    <measure>Change From Pre-allergen Challenge in Provocative Concentration of Methacholine Causing a 20% Fall in FEV1 (PC20) to Post-allergen Challenge For Screening, Day 14 and 35 Challenge</measure>
    <time_frame>Day -15, -13 for Screening (Day -14) challenge; Day 13, 15 for Day 14 challenge; Day 34, 36 for Day 35 challenge</time_frame>
    <description>Methacholine inhalation test was performed to determine airway hyper-reactivity using provocative concentration 20 (PC20). PC20 was the lowest concentration of methacholine at which participant had 20% decrease from baseline in FEV1. Pre-allergen challenge methacholine inhalation test was performed 1 day prior to the allergen challenge and post-allergen challenge methacholine inhalation test was performed 1 day after to the allergen challenge (that is, pre- and post-allergen methacholine inhalation test was conducted on Day -15 and -13 for Screening allergen challenge, Day 13 and 15 for Day 14 allergen challenge and Day 34 and 36 for Day 35 allergen challenge, respectively). For each methacholine inhalation test, baseline FEV1 was defined as the lowest value among the triplicate readings taken after administration of the diluent (saline administration). Difference between post-allergen challenge and pre-allergen challenge was expressed as log2 (post-allergen PC20 - pre-allergen PC20).</description>

        <title>Maximum Percent Drop From Pre-allergen Baseline in Forced Expiratory Volume in 1 Second (FEV1) for Late-Phase Asthma Response (LAR) at Screening</title>
        <description>Allergen inhalation test was performed at Screening, Day 14 and 35 to elicit airway responses similar to those that follow natural allergen exposure. FEV1 was the maximal volume of air exhaled in 1 second of a forced expiration from a position of full inspiration. LAR was characterized by a fall in FEV1 of more than or equal to (&gt;=) 15 percent (%) at 3 to 7 hours post-allergen inhalation. Maximum drop in FEV1 relative to the pre-allergen baseline FEV1 between 3 to 7 hours at Screening was reported. Pre-allergen baseline FEV1 was performed in triplicate using spirometry and the best of the 3 values was selected.</description>

        <title>Maximum Percent Drop From Pre-allergen Baseline in Forced Expiratory Volume in 1 Second (FEV1) for Early-Phase Asthma Response (EAR) at Screening, Day 14 and 35</title>
        <description>Allergen inhalation test was performed at Screening, Day 14 and 35 to elicit airway responses similar to those that follow natural allergen exposure. FEV1 was the maximal volume of air exhaled in 1 second of a forced expiration from a position of full inspiration. EAR was characterized by a fall in FEV1 &gt;=20% at 0 to 3 hours post-allergen inhalation. Maximum drop in FEV1 relative to the pre-allergen baseline FEV1 between 0 to 3 hours was reported. Pre-allergen baseline FEV1 was performed in triplicate using spirometry and the best of the 3 values was selected.</description>

        <description>Methacholine inhalation test was performed to determine airway hyper-reactivity using provocative concentration 20 (PC20). PC20 was the lowest concentration of methacholine at which participant had 20% decrease from baseline in FEV1. Pre-allergen challenge methacholine inhalation test was performed 1 day prior to the allergen challenge and post-allergen challenge methacholine inhalation test was performed 1 day after to the allergen challenge (that is, pre- and post-allergen methacholine inhalation test was conducted on Day -15 and -13 for Screening allergen challenge, Day 13 and 15 for Day 14 allergen challenge and Day 34 and 36 for Day 35 allergen challenge, respectively). For each methacholine inhalation test, baseline FEV1 was defined as the lowest value among the triplicate readings taken after administration of the diluent (saline administration). Difference between post-allergen challenge and pre-allergen challenge was expressed as log2 (post-allergen PC20 – pre-allergen PC20).</description>
