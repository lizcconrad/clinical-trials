      The purpose of this study is assess the safety and bioequivalence of a single oral dose of
      carbidopa+levodopa+entacapone combination versus a single oral dose of carbidopa+levodopa
      combination plus a single oral dose of entacapone under fasting conditions in healthy
      volunteers.

             psychiatric disease

          -  History of malignancy of any organ system, treated or untreated, within the past 5
             years whether or not there is evidence of local recurrence or metastases, with the

             similar to the study drug.

          -  Significant illness within two weeks prior to dosing

          -  Subjects who, through completion of the study, would have donated in excess of: 500 mL
             of blood in 14 days; 1500 mL of blood in 180 days; 2500 mL of blood in 1 year.

          -  History of immunodeficiency diseases, including a positive HIV (ELISA and Western
             blot) test result.

          -  History of drug or alcohol abuse within the 12 months prior to dosing or evidence of
             such abuse as indicated by the laboratory assays conducted during the screening or
             baseline evaluations.
