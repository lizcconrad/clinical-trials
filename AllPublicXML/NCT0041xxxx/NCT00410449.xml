  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Complications of hemodialysis access are the most frequent single reason for hospitalization
      among patients with End Stage Renal Disease (ESRD). Uremia, and particularly uremia in
      patients with diabetes, is a state of increased oxidative stress. The central hypothesis to
      be tested by this project is that oxidative stress is a major (and modifiable) trigger for
      vascular access complications. We hope to slow or reduce rates of stenosis, thrombosis and
      access complications by giving Vitamin E supplementation to patients being treated by
      hemodialysis.

    <textblock>
      Patients continued their usual treatment on hemodialysis three times per week. This was a
      double-blinded placebo controlled trial. Patients took either Vitamin E 400 IU bid or
      placebo. An initial evaluation of access patency was performed and baseline blood drawn
      before starting Vitamin E. Every 3 months there was a followup evaluation with blood drawn
      for oxidative stress markers, and with a test of vascular access patency. The study was
      closed to new participants, vitamin E or placebo stopped, and data analysis performed in
      2003.
