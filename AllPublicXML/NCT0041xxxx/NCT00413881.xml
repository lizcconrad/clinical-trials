  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to conduct a prospective clinical trial to compare conventional
      and WFG LASIK for enhancements on post-LASIK patients. Differences in safety, efficacy,
      visual quality, and refractive stability will also be compared during this study.

    <criteria>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Male or female, of any race, and at least 21 years old at the time of the preoperative
             exam, and have signed an informed consent. The lower age limit of 21 years is intended
             to ensure documentation of refractive stability.

          -  At least 6 months from original LASIK surgery.

          -  Stable refraction with more than 0.75D of spherical equivalent from the desired
             correction and have less than 1.50D of cylinder in the manifest refraction.

          -  Both eyes must be within 1.00D spherical equivalent of each other on the manifest
             refraction test.

          -  The eye to be treated with wavefront-guided enhancement must have at least a 9.5mm
             flap.

          -  Manifest refraction and LADARWaveâ„¢ refractions must be within 1.00D.

          -  At least 3 lines potential improvement in UCVA.

          -  BSCVA of 20/20 or better.

          -  Good corneal flap and interface.

          -  Adequate corneal thickness for surgery (residual stromal bed &gt; 280 microns).

          -  Able and willing to give informed consent.

          -  Located in the greater Washington DC area for a 12-month period.

          -  Access to transportation to meet follow-up requirements.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Female subjects who are pregnant, breast-feeding or intend to become pregnant during
             the study. Pregnancy will be ruled out with a urine pregnancy test.

          -  Concurrent topical or systemic medications that may impair healing, including
             corticosteroids, antimetabolites, isotretinoin, amiodarone hydrochloride and/ or
             sumatripin, as determined by history.

          -  Medical condition(s), which, in the judgement of the investigator, may impair healing,
             including but not limited to: collagen vascular disease, autoimmune disease,
             immunodeficiency diseases, and ocular herpes zoster or simplex (As determined by
             history).

          -  Active ophthalmic disease, neovascularization of the cornea within 1mm of the intended
             ablation zone, or clinically significant lens opacity.

          -  Evidence of glaucoma or an intraocular pressure greater than 22mm Hg at baseline.

          -  Evidence of keratoconus, corneal irregularity, or abnormal videokeratography in either
             eye.

          -  Flap irregularity(striae, interface debris, scarring, or epithelium).

          -  Calculated residual stroma bed less than 280.

          -  Stable refraction with less than 0.75D of spherical equivalent from the desired
             correction and more than 1.5D of cylinder in the manifest refraction.
