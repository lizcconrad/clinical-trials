        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Male and female patients with GERD (18-60 years) with a history of moderate to severe
             reflux symptoms (heartburn or acid regurgitation more than 2 days/week, and/or
             night-time reflux, and/or after meal reflux) for ≥ 3 months with:

               -  uncomplicated reflux-esophagitis of any degree as evidenced by
                  esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) within the last 12 months, OR (and) a
                  pathological ambulatory 24-hours pH measurement within the last 12 months with pH
                  &lt; 4 for ≥ 9% of the time.

          -  Females must be of no child bearing potential (postmenopausal women with no regular
             menstrual bleeding for at least 1 year or women who have been surgically sterilized at

             this study.

          -  Patients must be able to communicate well with the investigator, to understand and
             comply with the requirements of the study and to understand and sign the written
             informed consent.
