    <textblock>
      This 2-arm study is designed to determine the maximum tolerated dose of LBH589 as a single
      agent and in combination with docetaxel and prednisone 5 mg twice daily (second arm) and to
      characterize the safety, tolerability, biologic activity and pharmacokinetic profile.
