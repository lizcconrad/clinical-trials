          -  Non-smoker for at least 2 years.

          -  If medications in addition to insulin are taken at screening, the patient must be on a
             stable regimen as defined by continued use of the same dose of each medication for a
             period of at least three months.

          -  Forced vital capacity (FVC), forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1), forced
             mid-expiratory flow rate 25 %-75 % (FEF25-75), slow vital capacity (SVC) as measured
             by spirometry, and single-breath carbon monoxide diffusing capacity corrected for
             hemoglobin and carboxyhemoglobin (DLco), all greater than or equal to 80 % of expected
             normal.

          -  Ability to perform PFT, without coughing within the first 5 seconds of test.

          -  Written informed consent.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Current treatment (within the last 30 days) with oral antidiabetic agents.

          -  Regular pre-prandial doses of regular insulin of more than 30 IU.

          -  Intake of any drug or herbal preparation which, in the evaluation of the investigator,
             may interfere with the interpretation of trial results or that is known to cause
             clinically relevant interference with insulin action, glucose utilization or recovery
             from hypoglycemia (e.g. systemic steroids).

          -  History of hypersensitivity to the study drug or to drugs with similar chemical
             structures.

          -  Treatment with any other investigational drug within three months prior to enrollment
             in study.

          -  Progressive fatal disease.

          -  History of malignancy within five years of study entry (other than basal cell
             epithelioma).

          -  History of drug or alcohol abuse.

             evidence by creatinine &gt; 1.5 for females or &gt; 1.8 for males, retinopathy, or severe
             peripheral vascular disease).

          -  Positive hepatitis B (hepatitis B surface antigen) and/or hepatitis C (hepatitis C
             antibody) serology and/or positive HIV serology.

          -  History or presence of clinically significant cardiovascular, hepatic (as evidenced by
             ALT or AST &gt; 3 times the normal reference range), gastrointestinal, neurological or
             infectious disorders capable of altering the absorption, metabolism or elimination of
             drugs, or constituting a risk factor when taking the study medication.

          -  Anemia (hemoglobin levels less than 11 g/dL for females or 12 g/dL for males).

             with study drug administration) or other reasons, which in the opinion of the
             Investigator preclude the participation of the subject in the study.
