    <textblock>
      The Food Acceptability Questionnaire (FAQ) is a self-report measure of palatability, ease of
      preparation, satisfaction, and perceived benefits and adverse effects related to a prescribed
      or self-selected diet. This study intends to develop a reliable and valid food acceptability
      questionnaire for use in clinical studies in which dietary interventions are administered.

    <textblock>
      Two hundred adult participants who follow a therapeutic diet will be recruited from the
      Washington DC area. Participants will be asked to rate their impression on the foods that
      they were eating in the past two weeks. Fifty participants will be chosen at random and asked
      to complete the questionnaire a second time, three weeks later, to assess reliability.
      Ratings will be used to assess the validity and reliability of the Food Acceptability
      Questionnaire (FAQ).
