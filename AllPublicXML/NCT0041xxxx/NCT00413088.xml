    <textblock>
      Open pharmacokinetic study with 5 parallel groups and two treatment phases (bemiparin 3,500
      IU multiple dose and bemiparin 115 IU/kg single dose). The bemiparin pharmacokinetic profile
      will be assessed by measuring its effects on the coagulation cascade. Plasma anti-Xa activity
      (measured using chromogenic amidolytic assay) in IU per milliliter will be the primary
      endpoint to assess the pharmacokinetic profile of bemiparin.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        Non-elderly healthy volunteers (Group I):

          -  Male or female subjects aged between 18 and 65 years

          -  body weight, clinical history, physical examination, vital signs (systolic and
             diastolic blood pressure, heart beat rate and body temperature), ECG and laboratory
             tests (hemogram and biochemistry) within normal range

          -  without evidence of significant organic or psychiatric illness

          -  who have accepted to participate in the study and have signed the written informed
             consent.

        Patients with renal insufficiency (Groups II, III and IV):

          -  Male or female subjects aged between 18 and 65 years, who will be assigned to one of
             the following groups according to renal function:

               -  Group II: mild renal insufficiency (creatinine clearance &gt; 50 to 80 ml/min);

               -  Group III: Moderate renal insufficiency (creatinine clearance: 30 to 50 ml/min);

               -  Group IV: Severe renal insufficiency (creatinine clearance &lt; 30 ml/min). The
                  degree of renal insufficiency will be calculated on the basis of determination of
                  creatinine clearance measuring total urinary output over a 24-h period and serum
                  creatinine levels. Urine samples will be collected no more than 2 weeks before
                  the first experimental period.

          -  Patients with renal insufficiency must have a stable renal function during the 3
             months before their inclusion in the study.

          -  They must have a body weight between 45 and 110 Kg.

          -  They have to accept to participate in the study and have signed the written informed
             consent.

        Elderly healthy volunteers (Group V):

          -  Male or female subjects aged &gt; 65 years old who fulfill with the remaining inclusion
             criteria specified for non-elderly healthy volunteers.
