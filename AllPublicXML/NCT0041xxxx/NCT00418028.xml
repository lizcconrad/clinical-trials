      Capecitabine is active in metastatic breast cancer but the conventional schedule (1250
      mg/m2/12 hr 2 weeks on, one week off) produces grade 2 or greater hand and foot syndrome in
      up to 50% of patients leading to those reductions. There are theoretical reasons to
      administer S-phase specific agents in continuous, protracted rather than intermittent
      schedules. The investigators study compares the standard schedule (1250 mg/m2/12 hr 2 weeks
      on, one week off) with a continuous administration schedule (800 mg/m2/12hr). The latter
      administer approximately the same cumulative dose of capecitabine as the standard schedule.
      The study hypothesis is that grade 2 or greater hand and foot syndrome will be reduced from
      50% (standard arm) to 20% (experimental arm). The investigators assume similar antitumor
      activity in both arms.

      Capecitabine is active in metastatic breast cancer but the conventional schedule (1250
      mg/m2/12 hr 2 weeks on, one week off) produces grade 2 or greater hand and foot syndrome in
      up to 50% of patients leading to those reductions. Some authors have tested continuous
      administration schedules of capecitabine, showing better tolerance and apparently similar
      antitumor activity. Capecitabine is a pro-drug of 5-FU and mimics an i.v. continuous infusion
      administration of this antimetabolite. On the other hand, there are theoretical reasons to
      administer S-phase specific agents in continuous, protracted rather than intermittent
      schedules. Our study compares the standard schedule(1250 mg/m2/12 hr 2 weeks on, one week
      off)with a continuous administration schule (800 mg/m2/12hr). The latter schedule administer
      approximately the same cumulative dose of capecitabine as the standard one. The study
      hypothesis is that grade 2 or greater hand and foot syndrome will be reduced from 50%
      (standard arm) to 20% (experimental arm). The investigators assume similar antitumor activity
      in both arms.
