    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is determination of the event-free survival with and without
      Bortezomib consolidation therapy from the day of the first chemotherapeutic, myeloma-specific
      therapy measure, up to the occurrence of progression/recurrence or up to the occurrence of
      death.

      This is a two-arm (group), open-label (all people know the identity of the intervention),
      prospective (a study in which the patients are identified and then followed forward in time
      for the outcome of the study) randomized (the study medication is assigned by chance),
      multi-center study. Approximately 385 patients will be enrolled in this study. Patients will
      be randomly assigned to treatment or observation group in a ratio of 1:1. The study duration
      from screening up to the study end is up to 27 weeks. Then the patients will be observed
      until the last included patient has completed a 30 month post observational phase. The
      patients in the treatment arm will receive 4 cycles of a therapy. Each cycle lasts for a 35
      days. Safety evaluations will include assessment of adverse events, vital signs, physical
      examination, electrocardiograms, and clinical laboratory tests.

    <time_frame>Baseline (Day 1), Enpoint (30-60 months)</time_frame>
    <description>EORTC QLQ-C30 is a questionnaire to assess quality of life of cancer patients. It is composed of 30 items, multi-item measure (28 items) and 2 single-item measures. For the multiple item measure, 4-point scale is used and the score for each item range from &quot;1 = not at all&quot; to &quot;4 = very much&quot;. Higher scores indicate worsening. The 2 single-item measure involves question about the overall health and overall quality of life which will be rated on a 7-point scale ranging from &quot;1 = very poor&quot; to &quot;7 = excellent&quot;. Lower scores indicate worsening.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline (Day 1) and end point (30-60 months)</time_frame>
    <description>Change from Baseline to end point (30-60 months) in Euro Quality of life (Qol)-5 Dimension Questionnaire (EQ-5D). A higher score indicates an improvement in health in the Health Status Index. The EuroQol-5 is a five dimensional health state classification. Each dimension is assessed on a 3-point ordinal scale (1=no problems, 2=some problems, 3=extreme problems). The responses to the five EQ-5D dimensions were scored using a utility-weighted algorithm to derive an EQ-5D health status index score between 0 to 1, with 1.00 indicating &quot;full health&quot; and 0 representing dead.</description>
