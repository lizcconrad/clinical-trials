  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Antenatal corticosteroids result in substantial decrease in neonatal morbidity and mortality
      by specifically reducing the risk of respiratory distress syndrome, intraventricular
      hemorrhage and neonatal death among premature infants. No human randomized study has formally
      compared betamethasone and dexamethasone, the preferred corticosteroids for antenatal
      therapy, with regards to their effectiveness in reducing neonatal morbidities and mortality.
      Our objective was to compare betamethasone with dexamethasone in terms of effectiveness in
      reducing perinatal morbidities and mortality among preterm infants.

      We conducted a double blind placebo-controlled randomized trial of antenatal betamethasone
      compared to dexamethasone among women at risk of preterm deliveries at Stony Brook University
      Hospital from August 1, 2002 through July 31, 2004. We excluded women with clinical
      chorioamnionitis, major fetal structural anomalies, fetal chromosomal abnormalities, prior
      antenatal steroid exposure, and use of betamethasone or dexamethasone for other medical
      indications, quadruplets and higher order multiple gestation and those who declined
      enrollment. Consenting women were randomly allocated to one of two groups by the Pharmacy
      using computer generated random numbers. The statistical analysis was performed in accordance
      of the intention-to-treat principle. Student t test, Chi square and Fisher exact test were
      used for analysis. A P value of &lt; .05 was considered statistically significant.
