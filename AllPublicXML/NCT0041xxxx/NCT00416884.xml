      RATIONALE: Giving low doses of chemotherapy, such as fludarabine, and total-body irradiation
      (TBI) before a donor stem cell transplant helps stop the growth of cancer cells. It also
      stops the patient's immune system from rejecting the donor's stem cells. The donated stem
      cells may replace the patient's immune system and help destroy any remaining cancer cells
      (graft-versus-tumor effect). Giving an infusion of the donor's T cells (donor lymphocyte
      infusion) that have been treated in the laboratory after the transplant may help increase
      this effect. Sometimes the transplanted cells from a donor can also make an immune response
      against the body's normal cells. Giving cyclosporine and alemtuzumab, and removing the T
      lymphocyte cells(T cells) from the donor cells before transplant, may stop this from
      happening.

      PURPOSE: This clinical trial is studying how well giving fludarabine, alemtuzumab, and
      total-body irradiation together with donor stem cell transplant and donor white blood cell
      (WBC) infusion works in treating patients with chronic phase chronic myelogenous leukemia
      (CML) that did not respond to previous imatinib mesylate.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine the treatment-related mortality in patients with imatinib mesylate-resistant
           chronic phase chronic myelogenous leukemia treated with nonmyeloablative conditioning
           comprising fludarabine, alemtuzumab, and total-body irradiation followed by
           T-cell-depleted allogeneic stem cell transplantation and post-transplantation allogeneic
           T-cell infusion.

        -  Determine if donor engraftment can be safely established using partial T-cell depletion
           with additional T-cell infusions in these patients.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive alemtuzumab IV over 5-6 hours on day -8 and fludarabine IV on days
      -4 to -2. Patients undergo total-body irradiation followed by T-cell-depleted (CD34+
      selected) allogeneic stem cell transplantation on day 0. Patients receive allogeneic T-cell
      infusion on days 30 and 60. Patients also receive cyclosporine twice daily beginning on day
      -3 and continuing until day 100 followed by a taper until day 177.

    <description>Treatment related mortality is a consequence of both complications of the preparative regimen and systemic immunological rejection which is manifested as graft versus host disease(GVHD). The preparative regimens which include whole body radiation and/or high dose chemotherapy are complicated by single or multi-organ failure and by prolonged myelosuppression that can lead to infections and bleeding</description>

        <description>Treatment related mortality is a consequence of both complications of the preparative regimen and systemic immunological rejection which is manifested as graft versus host disease(GVHD). The preparative regimens which include whole body radiation and/or high dose chemotherapy are complicated by single or multi-organ failure and by prolonged myelosuppression that can lead to infections and bleeding</description>
