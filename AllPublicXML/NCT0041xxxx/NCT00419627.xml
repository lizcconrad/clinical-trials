  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the presence of proteins in solid tumors which may
      lead to an immune response

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The main objective of the study is to evaluate which proteins are presented by the HLA
      complex of solid tumors. Secondary objectives include to evaluate whether an immune response
      specific to these proteins has actually been provoked and whether there is a similar immune
      response following recurrence. Real specimens will be evaluated using PCR and mass
      spectrometry.
