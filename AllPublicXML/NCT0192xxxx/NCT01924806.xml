      A Pilot Study of the WoundWand™ Debridement Device on Infection Prevention
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary aim of this pilot study is to investigate differences in bacterial content of the
      study wound that may impact upon infection rates following debridement with the WoundWand
      Debridement Device or Standard of Care (SoC) surgical (sharp) debridement. Additionally, the
      clinical investigation will evaluate reduction in wound size post-debridement and gather
      Health Economic data relating to wound bed debridement with the WoundWand Debridement Device
      or SoC.
