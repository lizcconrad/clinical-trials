  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This project is based on a three-year program that aims to improve the knowledge of the
      socioeconomic consequences of dementia in Norway. By including patients with and without
      dementia in four different cohorts (from nursing homes, from memory clinics, home-dwelling
      persons with dementia and elderly persons without dementia), the project's aim is to describe
      tha course of dementia, the economical cost of dementia and to look into possible risk
      factors for dementia.

    <measure>Cost of dementia</measure>
    <time_frame>3 years</time_frame>
    <description>The cost of dementia is assessed with the Resource Utilization in Dementia (RUD) (Wimo et al. 2009), for a period of three years for all the four cohorts. The nursing home cohort is assessed at baseline and every 6 month for three years, the other three cohorts are assessed three times over a three-year follow up period.</description>

    <measure>The course of neuropsychiatric symptoms</measure>
    <time_frame>3 years</time_frame>
    <description>The course of neuropsychiatric symptoms (depression, anxiety, psychosis, aggression, apathy, and cognition, are assessed with standardized assessment Tools. The nursing home cohort is assessed at baseline and every 6 month for three years, the other three cohorts are assessed three times over a three-year follow up period.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Quality of Life</measure>
    <time_frame>3 years</time_frame>
    <description>Quality of Life is assessed with standardized assessment Tools. The nursing home cohort is assessed at baseline and every 6 month for three years, the other three cohorts are assessed three times over a three-year follow up period.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Prescription of medication</measure>
    <time_frame>3 years</time_frame>
    <description>Prescription of medication is recorded at baseline, and the amount of medication used is recorded throughout the study period. The nursing home cohort is assessed at baseline and every 6 month for three years, the other three cohorts are assessed three times over a three-year follow up period.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>DNA polymorphism</measure>
    <time_frame>At baseline</time_frame>
    <description>DNA samples are collected for the nursing home cohort, and they are assessed for genetic polymorphism previous associated with dementia. The results are used as covariates in the analyses of the course of the symptoms and to look for risk factors for dementia.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Organizational factors of the nursing homes</measure>
    <time_frame>At baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Organizational factors of the nursing homes and variables associated with the staff of the nursing homes will be collected at baseline, and the data will be used to explore associations between nursing home characteristics and the course of the symptoms in the patients.</description>
