  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study will evaluate the immunogenicity of the Diphtheria, Tetanus, Pertussis and
      Inactivated Poliovirus Vaccine (DTP-IPV) with concomitant administration of RotaTeq™ (V260)
      in healthy Japanese infants. The hypothesis to be tested is that the antibody response rates
      to DTP-IPV with concomitant administration of RotaTeq™ are non-inferior to those with
      staggered administration of RotaTeq™.
