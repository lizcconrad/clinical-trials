  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Consuming a guaraná and vitamin and mineral complex can improve mental fatigue and cognitive
      function at rest; guaraná also contains caffeine, which can reduce perceived exertion and
      increase fat burning during exercise. The purpose of this study is to test whether consuming
      a guaraná and vitamin and mineral product before exercise influences affect (mood), physical
      exertion and fat burning during exercise and mental fatigue, cognitive performance and affect
      post-exercise.
