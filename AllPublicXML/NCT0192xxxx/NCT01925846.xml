  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Microbial infection of the cornea, also known as microbial keratitis, causes severe corneal
      inflammation that could result in permanent visual loss. Contact lens wear is the strongest
      risk factor related to microbial keratitis in developed countries. The most commonly isolated
      pathogen of contact lens associated microbial keratitis (CLMK) is Pseudomonas aeruginosa,
      which accounts for over one third of the cases. Among the various virulence factors involved
      in the pathogenesis of pseudomonal keratitis, a secretion system known as type three
      secretion system (T3SS) secretes toxins that damage the host cells. ExoS is a bifunctional
      exotoxin with GTPase-activating protein (GAP) activity and ADP ribosyl transferase (ADPRT)
      activity. It results in an invasive phenotype of P. aeruginosa causing a relatively slower
      host cell death with intracellular invasion and possibly proliferation of bacterium. In
      contrast, ExoU expressing strains carries a cytotoxic phenotype that causes rapid host cell
      lysis due to its phospholipase activity. Previously, cytotoxic strains were reported to be
      more commonly found in patients with pseudomonal keratitis and were highly correlated with
      multidrug resistance.

      In order to understand the pathogenesis of CLMK, especially pseudomonal related CLMK, we
      proposed to recruit 180 volunteers who will wear different contact lens materials. We then
      collect the used contact lens and analyze 1) the microbiota on the used contact lens; 2) the
      bacterial-contact lens adhesion of wild strains, pscC mutant strains (T3SS needle-comples
      mutant), cytotoxic strain, and invasive strain P. aeruginosa; 3) the effect of shearing
      forces on bacterial-contact lens adhesion; 4) the bacteriocidal effect of multipurpose
      solution on different strains of P. aeruginosa.

      Subject recruitment

      The inclusion criteria includes:

        1. age 20-35 years old

        2. myopia less than -6.00D and astigmatism less than -1.50D

        3. previous soft contact lens wear discontinued for at least 2 weeks.

      Exclusion criteria includes:

        1. subjects with previous RGP wear

        2. any ocular inflammation or infection, proved dry eye syndrome, glaucoma, ocular trauma
           or surgery, and topical medication instillation

        3. diabetic mellitus

        4. pregnancy

        5. status post corneal refractive surgery

      The aim and purpose of this study will be thoroughly explained to the potential participants.
      Informed consent will be obtained from all enrolled subjects. This study will be approved by
      our Institutional Review Board and adheres to the tenets of the Declaration of the Helsinki.
      A minimal of 12 subjects per group is required to show a difference in the microbiota for one
      classification level or more at a significance level of 0.05 and a power of 90%. Thus, the
      goal is to recruit 15 volunteers to wear each type of contact lens and 180 subjects totally
      for this study.

      The recruitment will be divided into three stages. At the first stage, we will test 4 types
      of silicone hydrogel contact lenses, followed by testing 5 types of color-tinted hydrogel
      lenses at the second stage and 3 types of hydrogel lenses at the third stage. (T = types of
      lenses, which equals 4,5 and 3 at stage one, two and three).

      At each stage, we will recruit subjects to certain amount (M) each time (M＝N×T , N equals
      1,2,3…to 15). M subjects will then be randomized, equally distributed to wear T types of
      lenses by the random number method. Until the required case numberis achieved at the first
      stage, we will proceed to the second and the third stage with the same stratified
      randomization methods.( required case number, ΣM, equals 60, 75 and 45 at stage one, two and
      three).

      Subjects are fitted with the soft contact lenses and are expected to wear the lenses for at
      least 6-8 hour per day. Standardized hand hygiene and lens care regimen are thoroughly
      explained to each subject to insert the contact lens. Each subject enrolled will be provided
      with the soft contact lenses without charge. After wear each day, the contact lenses must be
      returned and collected for material analysis.
