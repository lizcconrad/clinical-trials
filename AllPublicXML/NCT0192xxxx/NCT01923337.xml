      This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of alisertib when given together
      with irinotecan hydrochloride in treating patients with advanced solid tumors or colorectal
      cancer. Irinotecan hydrochloride and alisertib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking
      some of the enzymes needed for cell growth.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To investigate the feasibility and safety of MLN8237 (alisertib) when given in combination
      with irinotecan (irinotecan hydrochloride) to patients with advanced solid tumors.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of MLN8237 when given in combination with
      irinotecan to patients with advanced solid tumors and to recommend a phase II dose for the
      combination.

      II. To obtain preliminary evidence of efficacy for this combination. III. To compare the
      pharmacokinetics of SN-38 (the active metabolite of irinotecan) with and without concurrent
      administration of MLN8237 in an expanded cohort of patients with advanced colorectal cancer.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of alisertib.

      Patients receive irinotecan hydrochloride intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on days 1 and 8
      and alisertib orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on days 1-3 and 8-10. Courses repeat every 21
      days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 30 days.

             feeding tubes, intractable nausea or vomiting, or a malabsorption syndrome are not
             eligible

          -  Any clinically significant medical or psychiatric condition that would interfere with
             protocol treatment

             investigator as not medically relevant

          -  Female subject is pregnant or breast-feeding; confirmation that the subject is not
             pregnant must be established by a negative serum beta-human chorionic gonadotropin

          -  Patient has received other investigational drugs with 14 days before enrollment

          -  Other severe acute or chronic medical or psychiatric condition, including uncontrolled
             diabetes, malabsorption, resection of the pancreas or upper small bowel, requirement
             for pancreatic enzymes, any condition that would modify small bowel absorption of oral
             medications, or laboratory abnormality that may increase the risk associated with
             study participation or investigational product administration or may interfere with
             the interpretation of study results and, in the judgment of the investigator, would
             make the patient inappropriate for enrollment in this study
