    <textblock>
      This randomized clinical trial studies palliative care in improving quality of life and
      symptoms in patients with stage III-IV pancreatic or ovarian cancer. Palliative therapy may
      help patients with advanced pancreatic or ovarian cancer live more comfortably.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Test the effects of a concurrent palliative care planning intervention (PCPI) on overall
      quality of life (QOL) and symptom burden.

      II. Test the effects of a concurrent PCPI on anxiety and depression. III. Test the effects of
      a concurrent PCPI on overall survival. IV. Test the effects of a concurrent PCPI on health
      care resource use.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.

      ARM I: Patients undergo a comprehensive physical, psychological, social, and spiritual
      palliative care assessment. Patients also receive a workbook that covers physical and
      psychological well-being and social and spiritual well-being, delivered over 2 educational
      sessions.

      ARM II: Patients receive standard care plus attention comprising two telephone contacts.

      After completion of study, patients are followed up at 1, 3, and 6 months.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Diagnosis of pancreatic or ovarian cancer

          -  Confirmed stage III or IV disease

          -  Patients who are within one year from initial diagnosis

          -  Able to read or understand English-this is included because most of the
             patient-reported outcome measures are not validated in linguistically diverse
             populations; the intent is to adapt and test the intervention in a future study with
             linguistically diverse populations

          -  Ability to read and/or understand the study protocol requirements, and provide written
             informed consent
