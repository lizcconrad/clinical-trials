  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Grass pollen allergens are recognised as a major cause of allergic diseases in humans and
      animals. Worldwide, at least 40% of allergic patients are sensitised to grass pollen
      allergens and between 50-90% of hayfever or seasonal allergy sufferers are allergic to grass
      pollen. ToleroMune Grass is a novel, synthetic, allergen-derived peptide desensitising
      vaccine, currently being developed for the treatment of grass allergy.

      The purpose of this optional observational follow-on study is to further evaluate
      rhinoconjunctivitis symptoms on exposure to Grass in the EEU among subjects who completed all
      dosing visits in study TG002 approximately one year after the start of treatment.

      Subjects who completed all dosing visits and the post treatment challenge (PTC) in study
      TG002 will be invited to attend the Screening Visit for TG002a. Subjects will attend for 4
      visits to the EEU on successive days. Following the last EEC visit a follow-up visit will be
      performed 3-10 days later.
