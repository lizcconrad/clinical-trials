  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, randomized, controlled, parallel group Phase 1/2 assessment of the
      safety of GINTUIT versus Bio-Gide in subjects who have a posterior tooth requiring
      extraction. The incidence and severity of adverse events will be summarized by group (GINTUIT
      and Bio-Gide).

    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the safety of GINTUIT as compared with Bio-Gide in subjects who have
      a posterior tooth requiring extraction. The use of GINTUIT in this investigational clinical
      indication may eliminate/reduce the need for aggressive flap advancement with its concomitant
      morbidity, while, at the same time, obtaining stable closure over a grafted socket. It is
      anticipated that GINTUIT will facilitate tissue granulation, followed by tissue coverage with
      site appropriate tissue (ie, keratinized tissue) that is needed for long term stability of
      the final restoration.

    <description>Subjects with a posterior tooth (molar or premolar) socket created by atraumatic extraction will be grafted with freeze-dried bone allograft (ie, MinerOss™). The primary wound bed will consist of exposed alveolar bone and bone graft imbedded in coagulum of blood from the socket for both treatments. The test treatment GINTUIT will be inlayed within the defect over the socket graft material, and stabilized with resorbable tacking sutures. An additional single layer of GINTUIT will cover the entire surface of the extraction socket at approx. 2-3 mm beyond the margins of the wound and fixed with non-resorbable sutures. The lower layer of this additional layer should be in contact with the previously applied GINTUIT.</description>

    <description>Subjects with a posterior tooth (molar or premolar) socket created by atraumatic extraction will be grafted with freeze-dried bone allograft (ie, MinerOss™). The primary wound bed will consist of exposed alveolar bone and bone graft imbedded in coagulum of blood from the socket for both treatments. The control treatment will be a collagen membrane (ie, Bio-Gide, applied per the Package Insert) inlayed within the defect over the socket graft material, and stabilized with resorbable tacking sutures. Crossed suspensory type sutures should also be placed over Bio-Gide, depending on the degree of stabilization needed. In all subjects, care should be taken in suturing to avoid advancement of the buccal gingival flap.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subject is at least 18 years of age but no more than 75 years of age.

          -  Subject has a posterior (molar or premolar) socket created by atraumatic extraction
             with a post extraction socket of a minimum of 5 mm in both the mesial-distal (M-D) and

          -  Subject has sufficient buccal bone plate at the site of the planned tooth extraction
             (ie, the residual socket should be of a form that would retain bone graft material),
             as judged by the Principal Investigator.

          -  Females of childbearing potential must have a documented negative urine pregnancy
             test. All subjects must agree to use acceptable methods of contraception for the
             duration of the study.

          -  Subjects must have read, understood, and signed an institutional review board
             (IRB)-approved Informed Consent Form (ICF).

          -  Subjects must be able and willing to comply with protocol requirements.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subject with any systemic conditions that could compromise wound healing and preclude
             periodontal surgery (ie, bleeding disorder, cancer, except localized basal cell or
             squamous cell cancer of the skin with no metastasis; human immunodeficiency virus; or
             bone metabolic diseases [ie, osteoporosis or Paget's disease]).

          -  Subject who is currently receiving, anticipates receiving or has received within 30
             days prior to Day 0: inhaled or systemic corticosteroids (ie, oral, IV),
             immunosuppressive agents or radiation therapy, and/or chemotherapy, which could
             compromise wound healing and preclude periodontal surgery.

          -  Subject who has had oral/periodontal surgery within 30 days prior to Day 0 or
             anticipates having oral/periodontal surgery within 30 days after Day 0.

          -  Subject with acute mucosal infection, including suppuration or induration in the area
             of intended surgery.

          -  Subject, who in the opinion of the Principal Investigator, will require a sinus lift
             procedure to place dental implants in the surgical area.

          -  Subject without at least 1 tooth adjacent to the area to be treated.

          -  Subject has a history of alcohol or substance abuse within the previous 12 months of
             Screening that could interfere with study compliance or protocol requirements.

          -  Subject who has received an investigational drug, device, or biological/bioactive
             treatment within 30 days prior to Day 0 (medical or dental).

          -  Subject who was previously treated with Gintuit, or any other cell therapy at the
             target treatment site or immediately adjacent teeth.

          -  Female subject that is lactating.

          -  Subject, who in the opinion of the Principal Investigator, for any reason other than
             those listed above, will not be able to complete the study per protocol.
