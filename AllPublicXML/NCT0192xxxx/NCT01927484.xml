    <textblock>
      Osteoarthritis (OA) is a common disabling condition, for which no effective therapy currently
      exists. Synovitis is commonly demonstrated in knee OA imaging. Synovial inflammation due to
      the release of cytokines is an important cause of pain. Methotrexate (MTX) helps to decrease
      synovitis in many inflammatory joint diseases, particularly rheumatoid arthritis.

      The aim of the present study is to assess the efficacy of MTX in decreasing pain and
      inflammation in symptomatic knee OA.

      Methods: One hundred and forty-four patients with American College of Rheumatology (ACR)
      clinical and radiographic criteria of primary knee OA with knee pain, [&gt;4 on the 24-hour
      average pain severity scale (0-10) using mean of daily ratings from week preceding
      randomization] for &gt; 14 days/month during 3 consecutive months preceding enrollment will be
      included in this randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trial. Patients meeting the
      eligibility criteria were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive either 25mg/week oral MTX
      (n=72) or placebo (n=72) together with their usual therapy provided the dosages were kept
      constant for 28 weeks. Pain will be assessed using the Visual Analogue pain Scale, (VAS,
      0-100 mm). Functional assessment will be performed using the Western Ontario and McMaster
      Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) and Activities of daily living (ADL) scores.
      Alterations in dosage of analgesic/NSAID drugs used will be recorded. Safety and tolerability
      will also be assessed. Synovitis will be detected by ultrasound imaging.

    <description>The primary outcome will be pain reduction at 28 weeks compared to baseline using a Visual Analogue Pain Scale (VAS) 0-100 mm. Data will be collected at baseline and monthly up to 28 weeks to determine any change in results from those obtained at baseline.</description>

    <measure>physical function improvement</measure>
    <time_frame>28 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Improvements in physical functioning will be assessed using the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) subscores for pain, stiffness and function , the patient global assessment of the severity of knee OA measured on a 0-100 mm VAS. The physician-reported disease activity VAS was also recorded. Data will be collected at baseline and monthly up to 28 weeks to determine any change in results from those obtained at baseline.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>safety and tolerability</measure>
    <time_frame>28 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Safety and tolerability to treatment will be assessed at each visit. Safety will be assessed by identifying adverse events using open-ended questions and a checklist including common oral methotrexate side effects, physical examination and by laboratory assessment including complete blood picture and liver enzymes. Adverse events will be collected at each visit and up to 28 weeks.</description>
