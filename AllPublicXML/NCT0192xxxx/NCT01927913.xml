        Inclusion Criteria:

        These criteria are to be met at the Screening Visit (Visit 1), the Washout Visit (Visit 2),
        and the Baseline Visit (Visit 3), if reassessed.

          -  An understanding, ability, and willingness to fully comply with study procedures and
             restrictions.

          -  Ability to voluntarily provide written, signed, and dated (personally or via a legally
             authorized representative) informed consent as applicable to participate in the study
             before completing any study-related procedures.

          -  Subjects 18 years of age or older at the time of signing consent.

          -  Female subjects should be one of the following:

               1. Post-menopausal (12 consecutive months of spontaneous amenorrhea)

               2. Surgically sterile, or

               3. Females of child-bearing potential must have a negative serum Beta-HCG pregnancy
                  test at the Screening Visit (Visit 1) and a negative urine pregnancy test at the
                  Baseline Visit (Visit 3). Females of child-bearing potential must agree to
                  abstain from sexual activity that could result in pregnancy or agree to use
                  acceptable methods of contraception.

          -  Subjects with beta-thalassemia who have received at least 100mL/kg of packed red blood
             cells (or &gt;20 transfusion units) and who have iron overload (transfusional
             hemosiderosis) requiring chronic treatment with an iron chelator.

          -  Serum ferritin &gt;500µg/L at the Screening Visit (Visit 1).

          -  Baseline LIC (last MRI assessment prior to Day 1) greater than or equal to 2.0mg and
             less than 30.0mg iron per g (equivalent dry weight, liver) determined by FerriScan® R2
             MRI.

             8. Mean of the previous 3 pre-transfusion hemoglobin concentrations greater than or
             equal to 7.5g/dL assessed at the Screening Visit (Visit 1) (1 value from clinical
             laboratory tests taken at the Screening Visit [Visit 1] and the previous 2 historical
             values available).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Severe iron overload including: (a) cardiac T2* MRI less than 10.0ms; or (b) LIC by
             FerriScan® R2 MRI greater than or equal to 30.0mg/g liver (dw) as assessed at the
             Screening Visit (Visit 1).

          -  Iron overload from causes other than transfusional siderosis.

             &gt;1.5x ULN at the Screening Visit (Visit 1).

          -  Clinically significant laboratory assessments at the Screening Visit (Visit 1).

          -  Significant proteinuria: urinary protein/creatinine ratio &gt;1.0 in a non-first void
             urine sample at the Screening Visit (Visit 1).

          -  Current or recurrent disease that could affect the action, absorption, or disposition
             of the investigational product, or clinical or laboratory assessments.

          -  Current or relevant history of physical or psychiatric illness, any medical disorder
             that may require treatment or make the subject unlikely to fully complete the study,
             or any condition, including pregnancy, that presents undue risk from the
             investigational product or procedures.

          -  Current use of any medication contraindicated in the deferasirox prescribing
             information/SmPC.

          -  Within 30 days prior to the Baseline Visit (Visit 3):

               1. Have used an investigational product

               2. Have been enrolled in a clinical study (including vaccine studies) that, in the
                  investigator's opinion, may impact this study.

          -  History of malignancy within the past 5 years, with the exception of basal cell or
             squamous cell skin carcinoma or cervical carcinoma in situ or completely resected
             colon carcinoma in situ.

          -  Insufficient venous access that precludes prescribed blood draws for safety laboratory
             assessments.

          -  Pregnant or lactating females.
