  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Exogenous bolus surfactant administration may affect hemodynamic parameters and peripheral
      perfusion. Surfactant therapy is commonly used for respiratory distress syndrome in premature
      infants, which is also associated with inflammation. There are different types and doses of
      surfactant preparations available. With the help of new generation monitors, changes in
      peripheral perfusion and transcutaneous CO, a marker of inflammation, may be demonstrated.

      Preterm infants with severe Respiratory Distress Syndrome (study group) were compared to
      preterm infants without Respiratory Distress Syndrome(control group). Infants in the study
      group were randomized to receive either poractantalfa or beractant.

      Perfusion index (PI) and transcutaneous CO (TCO) values were measured before (Tp) and 0 (T0),
      5 (T5), 30 (T30), 60 (T60), 360 (T360) minutes after surfactant administration in the first
      six hours of life.

    <description>Preparations of poractantalfa (Curosurf, 200 mg/kg) (n = 15) or beractant (Survanta, 100 mg/kg) (n = 15) were administered in a consecutive randomized manner within the first 6 h of life. During the procedure, the tube was disconnected from the ventilator. The patient's head was held in a neutral position and surfactant preparations were given in two bolus fractions. Manual ventilation was given for 2 min after each dose. After the second dose, the endotracheal tube was reconnected and the physician (D.T.) observed the infant for 30-60 s until the oxygen saturation reached &gt; 90% on pulse oximetry. Thereafter, the peak inspiratory pressure of the 6 ventilator was reduced by 1-2 mmH2O.</description>
