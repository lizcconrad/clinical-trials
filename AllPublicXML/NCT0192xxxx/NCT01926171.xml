  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of icotinib in combination
      with whole brain radiotherapy for NSCLC patients with brain metastases. The primary endpoint
      is objective response rate of intracranial lesions.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is one of the malignant tumors with the highest incidence
      of brain metastases. Patients with multiple brain metastasis showed poor prognosis and
      displayed an untreated median survival of only 3-6 months, and most patients died due to the
      progression of brain metastases. This study is designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy
      of icotinib combined with whole brain radiotherapy for NSCLC patients with brain metastases.
      The primary endpoint is intracranial objective response rate .
