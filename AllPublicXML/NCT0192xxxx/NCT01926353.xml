  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Endoscopic correction of VUR has gained its popularity due to its less invasiveness,
      associated low morbidity and short hospital stay. Although short term follow-up had justified
      their efficacy; however, long term recurrence and complications following endoscopic
      correction were also being reported in the literatures (6). Currently, there are insufficient
      evidences on the efficacy and safety of biocompatible tissue augmenting materials used for
      endoscopic correction of VUR; particularly on the new tissue bulking agents. (6) Polyacrylate
      polyalcohol copolymer (PPC)-Vantris ® (Promedon, Cordoba, Argentina) is the newest tissue
      augmenting biocompatible Acrylics used for endoscopic correction of VUR.
