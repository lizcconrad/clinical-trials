      The purpose of this study is to compare treatment methods and outcomes of patients diagnosed
      with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS).

    <textblock>
      This is a prospective multicenter observational study in a Consortium of collaborating
      institutions investigating how often older and medically infirm patients who are diagnosed
      with Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) or high-risk myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) and treated
      with induction chemotherapy undergo allogeneic HCT. Investigators will look at the rate of
      undergoing allogeneic HCT among older and medically infirm AML and high-risk MDS patients
      compared to younger and relatively healthier patients. Investigators will also compare the
      characteristics and outcomes of patients who did versus did not proceed to allogeneic HCT. A
      number of outcomes will be assessed including mortality, morbidity, and quality of life
      (QOL). Baseline information will be collected on different domains of QOL, geriatric
      assessment, health status measures, AML features, and socioeconomic status. Information will
      help physicians and patients to decide on best treatment choices for AML and high-risk MDS in
      older and medically infirm patients.

        The study population will include non-M3 AML and high-risk MDS patients considered for
        induction chemotherapy at FHCRC and the Seattle Cancer Care Alliance Network and other Core
        institutions (Stanford School of Medicine, Cleveland Clinic, Northwestern University,
        Massachusetts General Hospital, and University of Utah) in addition to an unidentified
        number of affiliate sites. We anticipate enrollment of a total sample of 1000 patients.

        bone marrow) who:

          -  Present for an AML-like treatment that could plausibly produce a complete remission
             (CR); for example intensive induction chemotherapy, low dose single agent
             chemotherapy, hypomethylation agent, or a similar therapy

          -  Explicitly intend to establish follow-up care at one of the collaborating
             institutions.

          -  Patients with primary refractory or first relapse presenting for salvage chemotherapy
             will be allowed

          -  Able to speak and read English.

        Exclusion Criteria

          -  Patients of â‰¤17 years of age or who are &gt; 18 and receive treatment under the pediatric
             AML service.

          -  Patients older than 80 years

          -  Patients with &lt;6 months projected survival due to active second malignancy or other
