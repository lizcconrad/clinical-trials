  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of this study is to compare the objective response rate, as determined by
      investigators, of Nivolumab combined with Ipilimumab versus Ipilimumab monotherapy in
      patients with untreated, unresectable, or metastatic melanoma

    <measure>Percentage of Participants With Investigator-assessed Objective Response in the Randomized, BRAF Wild-type Population</measure>
    <time_frame>Randomization to a minimum of 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Objective Response Rate is defined as the number of participants with a best overall response of complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) divided by the number of randomized BRAF wild-type patients. CR=all target and nontarget lesions have disappeared. Lymph nodes selected must have returned to normal size (&lt;10 mm). PR=at least a 30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter (LD) of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum LD.</description>

    <measure>Investigator-assessed Progression-free Survival (PFS) in All Populations</measure>
    <time_frame>Date of randomization to disease progression or death, whichever occurs first, to approximately 10 months</time_frame>
    <description>PFS is defined as the time between the date of randomization and the first date of documented progression, as assessed by the investigator, or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first. WT=wild type</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of BRAF Mutation-positive Participants With Investigator-assessed Objective Response</measure>
    <time_frame>Randomization to a minimum of 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Objective Response is is defined as the number of participants with a best overall response of complete response (CR) or partial response (PR); percentage is determined by that total divided by the number of randomized patients. CR=all target and nontarget lesions have disappeared. Lymph nodes selected must have returned to normal size (&lt;10 mm). PR=at least a 30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter (LD) of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum LD.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) Overall Quality of Life (QOL) Score</measure>
    <time_frame>From Baseline to Week 25</time_frame>
    <description>Health-related QOL was measured by mean changes from baseline in the EORTC-QLQ-C30 global health status/quality of life composite scale and by mean changes from baseline in the remaining EORTC QLQ-C30 questionnaire, Version 3. The EORTC QLQ-C30 is a questionnaire developed to assess the QOL of cancer patients. The questionnaire is a 30-item tool covering multiple items, including 5 functional scales (physical, role, emotional, social, and cognitive); 3 symptom scales (fatigue, nausea and vomiting, and pain); a global health status/QOL scale; and 6 single items (dyspnea, insomnia, appetite loss, constipation, diarrhea, and financial difficulties). Scores for each item range from 0 to 100. A high score for a functional scale represents a high (healthy) level of functioning, and a high score for the global health status represents a high QOL. However, a high score for a symptom scale represents more severe symptoms.</description>

  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Participants Who Died and With Serious Adverse Events (SAEs), Adverse Events (AEs) Leading to Discontinuation, and Select AEs</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1 of treatment to within 30 days past last dose</time_frame>
    <description>AE=any new unfavorable symptom, sign, or disease or worsening of a preexisting condition that may not have a causal relationship with treatment. SAE=a medical event that at any dose results in death, persistent or significant disability/incapacity, or drug dependency/abuse; is life-threatening, an important medical event, or a congenital anomaly/birth defect; or requires or prolongs hospitalization. Related=having certain, probable, possible, or unknown relationship to study drug.</description>

             metastases are eligible if there is no evidence of progression on magnetic resonance
             imaging scan for at least 8 weeks after completion of treatment and within 28 days
             prior to first dose of study drug administration. There must also be no requirement
             for high doses of systemic corticosteroids that could result in immunosuppression (&gt;10
             mg/day prednisone equivalents) for at least 2 weeks prior to study drug administration

          -  Ocular melanoma

          -  Patients with active, known, or suspected autoimmune disease. Those with vitiligo,
             type I diabetes mellitus, residual hypothyroidism due to autoimmune condition only

        <description>Health-related QOL was measured by mean changes from baseline in the EORTC-QLQ-C30 global health status/quality of life composite scale and by mean changes from baseline in the remaining EORTC QLQ-C30 questionnaire, Version 3. The EORTC QLQ-C30 is a questionnaire developed to assess the QOL of cancer patients. The questionnaire is a 30-item tool covering multiple items, including 5 functional scales (physical, role, emotional, social, and cognitive); 3 symptom scales (fatigue, nausea and vomiting, and pain); a global health status/QOL scale; and 6 single items (dyspnea, insomnia, appetite loss, constipation, diarrhea, and financial difficulties). Scores for each item range from 0 to 100. A high score for a functional scale represents a high (healthy) level of functioning, and a high score for the global health status represents a high QOL. However, a high score for a symptom scale represents more severe symptoms.</description>
