  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 3b, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group
      study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of apremilast monotherapy in subjects with active
      psoriatic arthritis.

      Approximately 214 subjects will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to either apremilast 30 mg BID
      (twice a day) or identically-appearing placebo, with approximately 107 subjects per treatment
      group.

      This is a 113-week study. The subjects will spend 24 weeks in the double-blind,
      placebo-controlled treatment phase, followed by 28 weeks of active treatment phase (ie, up to
      Week 52 visit). The original treatment assignments (apremilast 30 mg BID (twice a day) or
      placebo) will remain blinded until all subjects have completed their Week 52 visit (or have
      discontinued). After the Week 52 visit, all subjects in the extension phase will continue to
      receive treatment with apremilast 30 mg BID (twice a day) until the end of the study (ie, up
      to Week 104 visit) or until early discontinuation from the trial.

      The study will consist of 5 phases:

        1. Screening Phase - up to 5 weeks

        2. Randomized, Placebo-controlled, Double Blind Treatment Phase - Weeks 0 to 24

        3. Active Treatment Phase - Week 24 to Week 52

        4. Open-label Extension Phase - Week 52 to Week 104

        5. Post-treatment Observational Follow-up Phase

    <description>HAQ-DI is a patient-reported questionnaire consisting of 20 questions referring to eight domains: dressing/grooming, arising, eating, walking, hygiene, reach, grip, and usual activities. Participants assessed their ability to do each task over the past week using the following response categories: without any difficulty (0); with some difficulty (1); with much difficulty (2); and unable to do (3). Scores on each task are summed and averaged to provide an overall score ranging from 0 to 3, where zero represents no disability and three very severe, high-dependency disability. A higher score indicates worse physical functioning, and a negative change from baseline indicates improvement.</description>

    <description>A TEAE is an AE with a start date on or after the date of the first dose of Investigational Product (IP). An AE is any noxious, unintended, or untoward medical occurrence, that may appear or worsen in a participant during the course of study. It may be a new intercurrent illness, a worsening concomitant illness, an injury, or any concomitant impairment of the participant's health, including laboratory test values regardless of etiology. Any worsening (ie, any clinically significant adverse change in the frequency or intensity of a preexisting condition) was considered an AE. A serious AE (SAE) is any untoward adverse event that is fatal, life-threatening, results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity, requires or prolongs existing in-patient hospitalization, is a congenital anomaly or birth defect, or a condition that may jeopardize the patient or may require intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above.</description>

             At the time of study entry, and at any time during the study when a female subject of
             childbearing potential's contraceptive measures or ability to become pregnant changes,
             the investigator will educate the subject regarding contraception options and the
             correct and consistent use of effective contraceptive methods in order to successfully
             prevent pregnancy.

             Females of childbearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test at Screening and
             Baseline. All FCBP subjects who engage in activity in which conception is possible
             must use one of the approved contraceptive options described below:

             Option 1: Any one of the following highly effective methods: hormonal contraception
             (oral, injection, implant, transdermal patch, vaginal ring); intrauterine device
             (IUD); tubal ligation; or partner's vasectomy; OR Option 2: Male or female condom
             (latex condom or non latex condom NOT made out of natural [animal] membrane [for
             example, polyurethane]; PLUS one additional barrier method: (a) diaphragm with
             spermicide; (b) cervical cap with spermicide; or (c) contraceptive sponge with
             spermicide.

         17. Male subjects (including those who have had a vasectomy) who engage in activity in
             which conception is possible must use barrier contraception (male latex condom or
             nonlatex condom NOT made out of natural [animal] membrane [for example, polyurethane])
             while on investigational product and for at least 28 days after the last dose of
             investigational product.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. History of clinically significant (as determined by the investigator) cardiac,
             endocrine, pulmonary, neurologic, psychiatric, hepatic, renal, hematologic,
             immunologic disease, or other major uncontrolled disease.

          2. Any condition, including the presence of laboratory abnormalities, which places the
             subject at unacceptable risk if he/she were to participate in the study or confounds

        <description>HAQ-DI is a patient-reported questionnaire consisting of 20 questions referring to eight domains: dressing/grooming, arising, eating, walking, hygiene, reach, grip, and usual activities. Participants assessed their ability to do each task over the past week using the following response categories: without any difficulty (0); with some difficulty (1); with much difficulty (2); and unable to do (3). Scores on each task are summed and averaged to provide an overall score ranging from 0 to 3, where zero represents no disability and three very severe, high-dependency disability. A higher score indicates worse physical functioning, and a negative change from baseline indicates improvement.</description>

28 tender joint count
28 swollen joint count, which do not include the DIP joints, the hip joint, or the joints below the knee;
C-reactive protein (CRP)
Patient's global assessment of disease activity. DAS28 (CRP) scores range from 0 to 9.4. A DAS28 score higher than 5.1 indicates high disease activity, a DAS28 score less than 3.2 indicates low disease activity, and a DAS28 score less than 2.6 indicates clinical remission. A negative change from baseline indicates improvement</description>

Norm-based scores were used in analyses, calibrated so that 50 is the average score and the standard deviation equals 10. Higher scores indicate a higher level of functioning. The physical functioning domain assesses limitations in physical activities because of health problems. A positive change from Baseline score indicates an improvement.</description>

Patient's global assessment of disease activity. DAS28 (CRP) scores range from 0 to 9.4. A DAS28 score higher than 5.1 indicates high disease activity, a DAS28 score less than 3.2 indicates low disease activity, and a DAS28 score less than 2.6 indicates clinical remission. A negative change from baseline indicates improvement</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in 36-item SF-36 (V2.0) Physical Functioning Component Scores and Summary Score at Weeks 52 and 104</title>
        <description>The SF-36 (v 2.0) is a self-administered instrument that measures the impact of disease on overall quality of life and consists of 36 questions in eight domains (physical function, pain, general and mental health, vitality, social function, physical and emotional health). Norm-based scores were used in analyses, calibrated so that 50 is the average score and the standard deviation equals 10. Higher scores indicate a higher level of functioning. The physical functioning domain assesses limitations in physical activities because of health problems. A positive change from Baseline score indicates an improvement.</description>

        <description>Morning stiffness severity was the participant’s assessment of how severe their morning stiffness was after first waking up in the morning, on average, during the previous week. The severity was recorded as none, mild, moderate, moderately severe, or very severe. Improvement is defined as the change from baseline of a more severe assessment to less severe assessment.</description>

        <title>Number of Participants With Treatment Emergent Adverse Events (TEAE) During the 24 Week Placebo Controlled Phase</title>
        <description>A TEAE is an AE with a start date on or after the date of the first dose of Investigational Product (IP). An AE is any noxious, unintended, or untoward medical occurrence, that may appear or worsen in a participant during the course of study. It may be a new intercurrent illness, a worsening concomitant illness, an injury, or any concomitant impairment of the participant's health, including laboratory test values regardless of etiology. Any worsening (ie, any clinically significant adverse change in the frequency or intensity of a preexisting condition) was considered an AE. A serious AE (SAE) is any untoward adverse event that is fatal, life-threatening, results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity, requires or prolongs existing in-patient hospitalization, is a congenital anomaly or birth defect, or a condition that may jeopardize the patient or may require intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above.</description>
