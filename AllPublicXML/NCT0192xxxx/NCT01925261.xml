    <textblock>
      This one-year study is designed to investigate the safety and efficacy of TPX-100, a 23-amino
      acid chondrogenic peptide, delivered by intra-articular injection, in regeneration of knee
      cartilage in subjects with bilateral osteoarthritis of the knee.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Age ≥ 25 and ≤ 75

          2. Patello-femoral osteoarthritis of both knees of mild to moderate severity with intact
             meniscus and ligamentous stability (cruciate and collateral ligaments)

               -  Clinically, as determined by screening questionnaire and judgment of the
                  Principal Investigator (may be supported by imaging studies of knees); confirmed
                  by centrally read screening MRI of both knees indicating ICRS Grade 1-3, or ICRS
                  Grade 4 with only focal defects, no greater than 1 cm.

               -  Meniscus intact (MRI degenerative signal up to and including grade II acceptable)

               -  Cruciate and collateral ligament stability as defined by clinical examination

          3. Able to read, understand, sign and date the subject informed consent

          4. Willingness to use only acetaminophen as the primary analgesic (pain-relieving) study
             medication. The maximum dose of acetaminophen must not exceed 4 grams/day (4000 mg per
             day).

          5. Willingness to use only hydrocodone/acetaminophen for breakthrough pain during the
             injection period (through study day 30).

          6. Willingness not to use non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDS) such as aspirin,
             ibuprofen, naproxen for the first 30 days of the study.

          7. Female subjects of child bearing potential who are sexually active (non-abstinent)
             must agree to and comply with using 2 highly effective methods of birth control (oral
             contraceptive, implant, injectable or indwelling intrauterine device, condom with
             spermicide, or sexual abstinence) while participating in the study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Contraindication to MRI, including: metallic fragments, clips or devices in the brain,
             eye, or spinal canal; implanted devices that are magnetically programmed; weight &gt; 300
             lbs.; moderate or severe claustrophobia; previous intolerance of MRI procedure

          2. ICRS grade greater than Grade 3, or Grade 4 focal defects greater than 1 cm, as
             confirmed by centrally-read screening MRI

          3. MRI evidence of inflammatory or hypertrophic synovitis

          4. Prior surgery in the knees, excluding procedures for debridement only (no
             microfracture)

          5. Joint replacement or any other knee surgery planned in the next 12 months

          6. History of rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, or any other autoimmune or
             infectious cause for arthritis

          7. Knee effusion &gt;2+ on the following clinical scale:

               -  Zero = No wave produced on downstroke

               -  Trace = Small wave on medial side with downstroke

               -  1+ = Larger bulge on medial side with downstroke

               -  2+ = Effusion spontaneously returns to medial side after upstroke (no downstroke
                  necessary)

               -  3+ = So much fluid that it is not possible to move the effusion out of the medial
                  aspect of the knee

          8. Last viscosupplementation (e.g. Synvisc® or similar hyaluronic acid product) injected

         19. Active systemic infection

         20. Current treatment or treatment within the previous 2 years prior to the Screening
             Visit for any malignancy except basal cell or squamous cell carcinoma of the skin,

             screening

         23. Currently taking Paclitaxel (mitotic inhibitor), and or Natalizumab (anti-integrin
             monoclonal antibody).

         24. History of significant liver disease or consumption of more than 3 alcoholic drinks a
             day. (Definition of one alcoholic drink: 12-ounces of beer, 8-ounces of malt liquor,
             5-ounces of wine, 1.5-ounces or a &quot;shot&quot; of 80-proof distilled spirits or liquor such
