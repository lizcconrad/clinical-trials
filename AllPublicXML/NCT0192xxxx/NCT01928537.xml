    <textblock>
      This study will examine the effect intravenously administered rigosertib has on the
      relationship between bone marrow blasts response and overall survival in myelodysplastic
      syndromes (MDS) patients who have 5-30% bone marrow blasts and who progressed on or after
      treatment with azacitidine or decitabine.

    <time_frame>Up to 2 years.</time_frame>
    <description>Bone marrow blast response is defined as bone marrow (BM) complete response, ≥ 50% BM blast decrease from pretreatment value, or stable BM response (no progression) according to the International Working Group (IWG) 2006 criteria. Overall survival is defined as the time from first study treatment to death from any cause. All patients will be followed until death and/or progression, even if they have discontinued treatment for whatever cause. Survival time of patients lost to follow-up will be censored at the time they were last known to be alive.</description>
