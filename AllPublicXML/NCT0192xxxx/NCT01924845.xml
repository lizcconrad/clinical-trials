    <textblock>
      Study 701-301 is a single-arm, open-label, switchover study in patients with late-onset Pompe
      disease who have been receiving treatment with recombinant human acid alpha-glucosidase
      (rhGAA) for 48 weeks or longer. Ambulatory patients who have mild to moderate respiratory
      impairment will switch directly to receive BMN 701 20 mg/kg by IV infusion every other week.
      All participants will receive active drug. No dose of existing therapy will be missed -
      experimental drug is started immediately.

          -  Diagnosed with late-onset Pompe disease based on 2 currently or previously documented
             GAA gene mutations, and endogenous GAA activity &lt;75% of the lower limit of the normal

             whole blood assay.

          -  Has received prior treatment with commercial rhGAA as defined by ALL of the following:

               1. has received treatment with commercial rhGAA for ≥ 48 weeks (but no more than 20%

               2. has received &gt; 80% of all scheduled treatments in the prior 48 weeks and ≥ 4 out

                  event resulting in dose interruption.

               4. has received last treatment of commercial rhGAA ≥ 10 and ≤ 31 days prior to
                  anticipated initiation of treatment with BMN 701.

          -  ≥ 18 years of age at the time of enrollment in the study.

             Baseline visits and be willing to have additional pregnancy tests during the study.
             Females considered not of childbearing potential include those who have been in
             menopause at least 2 years, or had tubal ligation at least 1 year prior to Screening,
             or who have had total hysterectomy.

          -  Has ≥ 30% predicted upright FVC and &lt; 80% predicted upright FVC.

          -  Has ≤60% predicted MIP.

          -  Is able to ambulate ≥75 meters and ≤500 meters on the 6MWT conducted during the
             Screening visit (use of assistive devices such as walker, cane, or crutches, is

          -  Requires noninvasive ventilatory support while awake and in the upright position.

             study.
