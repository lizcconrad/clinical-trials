    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of single and multiple ascending
      dosage levels of AZD6423 in healthy volunteers. The study includes an up to 28-day screening
      period, an in-house period during which AZD6423 or placebo will be administered IV, and a 4-
      to 10-day follow-up period after discharge.

      In Part 1 of the study (single ascending dose portion), approximately 40 subjects will be
      randomly assigned. Eight (8) subjects will be randomized in each of 5 dosage-level cohorts
      (AZD6423 or placebo). Within each cohort, 6 subjects will be randomized to receive AZD6423
      and 2 subjects will be randomized to receive placebo. Each subject will receive only one dose
      of either AZD6423 or placebo on Day 1. In Part 2 of the study (multiple ascending dose
      portion), approximately 24 subjects will be randomly assigned. Eight (8) subjects will be
      randomized in each of 3 dosage-level cohorts. Within each cohort, 6 subjects will be
      randomized to receive AZD6423 and 2 subjects will be randomized to receive placebo. Each
      subject will receive three doses of either AZD6423 or placebo.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Subjects must understand the nature of the study and must provide signed and dated

             commit to the use of a reliable method of birth control for the duration of the study
             and for 15 days after dose administration. A male subject is considered biologically
             capable of having children even if his sexual partner is sterile or using
             contraceptives.

          3. Subjects must have a body mass index (BMI) between 19 and 30, inclusive and weigh
             between 50kg and 100kg inclusive.

          4. Subjects must be fluent in English.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. A history or presence of a clinically significant hepatic, renal, gastrointestinal,
             cardiovascular, endocrine, respiratory, immunologic, hematologic, dermatologic, or
             neurologic abnormality.

          2. A clinically significant abnormality on physical examination, neurological
             examination, EEG, ECG, vital signs or laboratory evaluations at screen or between
             screen and dose administration.

          3. A history of seizure.

          4. A history of head trauma, including closed head injury with loss of consciousness.

          5. Any history of suicide attempt or suicidal behavior, or, in the opinion of the
             investigator, clinically significant risk of suicide or violent behavior.

          6. Urine drug screen positive for a drug of abuse

          7. A family history of schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, or psychosis in first
