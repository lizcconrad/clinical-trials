    <textblock>
      Demineralization during orthodontic (brace) treatment is a common clinical problem leading to
      unsightly white or brown marks on the teeth. A recent systematic review has shown little
      evidence that current methods of delivering fluoride are effective at reducing this problem.

      Design: A multi-centre randomised single blinded controlled clinical trial will be conducted
      with two parallel groups.

      Setting: The trial patients will be treated by eight named operators on the Specialist List
      for Orthodontics held by the General Dental Council and who work either within the hospital
      service or specialist orthodontic practice. The sample size calculation suggests that each
      operator will need to treat 40 patients in the trial (approx 1 session per week) plus up to
      10 familiarisation patients before.

      Planned trial interventions: Brackets will be bonded to all teeth in front of the first
      permanent molars with either a resin-modified glass ionomer cement (Fuji Ortho LC) or a light
      cured composite control (Transbond). The material to be bonded will be allocated randomly.

      Outcome measures: The two main outcome measures will be the difference in demineralization of
      the anterior teeth before and after treatment assessed from photographs and the number of
      debonded brackets during treatment.

      Demineralization (dental decay) around fixed appliance components has been reported to occur
      in up to 95% of cases where brackets are bonded with composite resins. Although early lesions
      appear clinically as opaque white or brown areas, if mineral loss continues cavitation will
      occur. Following appliance removal, the lesions may regress or disappear but may still
      present an aesthetic problem more than 5 years after appliance removal. Fluoride is known to
      inhibit lesion development and to enhance remineralization following treatment.
      Resin-modified glass ionomer cements, which release and absorb fluoride, may be used for
      bracket bonding thereby offering the possibility of less demineralization around bonded
      attachments. In addition, these cements appear to behave as reliably as composite in terms of
      bracket failure rate recorded but these data are from case series rather than optimally
      designed randomised clinical trials. A bonding agent that can behave as reliably as composite
      and minimize unwanted enamel demineralization would be optimal; saving on restorative costs
      that may be required should cavitation occur. From the patients perspective, subjective
      assessment of treatment outcome is likely to be enhanced as ugly demineralised enamel white
      lesions will be eliminated.
