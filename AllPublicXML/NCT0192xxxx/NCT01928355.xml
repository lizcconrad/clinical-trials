      There is some evidence to suggest that obesity is a risk factor for the development of
      cognitive dysfunction, although this is not a universal finding. This discordance might be
      ascribed to the existence of a 'healthy obese phenotype'- that is, obesity in the absence of
      metabolic risk factors. We examined whether the association of obesity with cognitive
      dysfunction is dependent on the individual's metabolic health.

      60 obese patients' undergoping liver fibroscan and blood tests will be enrolled. Obesity was
      defined as body mass index ≥ 30 kg/m2. Based on blood pressure, HDL-cholesterol,
      triglycerides, glycated haemoglobin, and C-reactive protein, participants were classified as
      'metabolically healthy' (0 or 1 metabolic abnormality) or 'unhealthy' (≥ 2 metabolic
      abnormalities). Cognitive dysfunction will be assessed by moca and minimental score. Results:
      Cognitive dysfunction prevalence is expected in 30% , but 50% of this group was categorized
      as metabolically healthy. Relative to non-obese healthy participants, after adjustment for
      baseline covariates, the metabolically unhealthy obese participants had elevated risk of
      cognitive dysfunction although the metabolically healthy obese did not. The association
      between obesity and risk of cognitive dysfunction appears to be partly dependent on metabolic
      health, although further work is required to confirm these findings.

      In obesity there is an increase in oxidative stress due to metabolic syndrome . Thus obese
      patients suffer from higher incidences of cardiovascular complications such as
      atherosclerosis as compare to non- obese population. Haptoglobin (Hp) is a plasma protein
      which binds free hemoglobin and prevents it from heme- iron mediated oxidation. There are
      three different types of Hp which differ in their antioxidant ability. Several clinical
      studies have shown that Hp 2-2 genotype is associated with higher incidence of cardiovascular
      diseases.
