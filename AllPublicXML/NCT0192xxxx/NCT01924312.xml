    <textblock>
      Vascular risk factors may account for up to 80% of the memory and thinking problems
      experienced by our aging population today, by far in excess of that caused by Alzheimer's
      disease. By doing this study, we hope to learn how vascular risk factors cause memory and
      thinking changes in the elderly, and whether we can prevent memory and thinking changes by
      reducing these risk factors. Successful completion of project aims will allow an integrated
      understanding of mild cognitive impairment caused by vascular risks (MCI-CVD) with the
      potential for tremendous impact on one of the major healthcare crises facing the nation
      today.

      The study will enroll 80 participants with memory and thinking problems (mild cognitive
      impairment; MCI) and are at risk for stroke and further difficulties with memory and thinking
      that may eventually lead to disability and a diagnosis of dementia. Each participant will be
      randomized into one of two groups (40 in each group) and followed over 36 months. One group
      will be followed to allow us to understand the natural history of memory and thinking
      impairment, while the other group will receive intensive education and assistance with
      vascular risk factor (CVD) control.

    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, controlled study of intensive medical management and educational
      programming (Heart Health Intervention) for controlling stroke and vascular risks that may
      impact your thinking and memory (MCI-CVD). This means that if you choose to enroll, it will
      be determined by chance ( pulling a number from a hat) whether you will receive the study
      intervention or standard-of-care treatment. One-half of all subjects will be enrolled in the
      intervention, while the other one half will not. You will have a 50:50 chance of receiving
      the intervention, like the flip of a coin. You will be in the study for 36 months if you
      enroll.

      Even if you do are not in the study group receiving medical management and educational
      programs, we will be monitoring your risks for stroke and vascular risks every 6 months and
      this information will be provided to your primary doctors, potentially resulting in an
      increased level of care as a result of your participation in this study.

      You must have an individual (spouse, friend, or relative), called a &quot;study partner&quot;, who is
      willing to accompany you to all of the study visits or be available by telephone to
      communicate changes in your health status over the period of this study.

      The study visits include checking vital signs (blood pressure, heart rate weight), regular
      blood testing at 6 month intervals to monitor your vascular risks (blood sugar, cholesterol
      levels)as well as ensure your safety throughout the study, yearly brain imaging with MRI
      scans, and optional spinal fluid collection at enrollment and end of study to help us
      understand brain changes that cannot be measured in blood.
