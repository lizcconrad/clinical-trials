    <textblock>
      Pepper sprays and pepper gas grenades are used by riot police at various places in the world
      for crowd control. Data about the acute effects based on human studies is extremely scarce.
      Kashmir valley in the northern Indian state of Jammu &amp; Kashmir has witnessed political
      turmoil for the past 22 years and incidents of stone pelting are common wherein groups of
      youth indulge in stone pelting at the security personnel. While there have been previous
      episodes of fatalities associated with incidents of firing by the security personnel; non
      lethal methods are adopted routinely now. These include lathis, water cannons, tear gas and
      more recently the pepper gas grenades. The pepper grenades explode in the area and the
      adverse effects are perceived by the population in the area too who are even sitting in their
      homes. The study proposes to observe the health effects of the pepper gas exposure in
      non-combatant civilians.
