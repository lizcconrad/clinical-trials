  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed to compare the blood pressure lowering efficacy of aliskiren, a
      combination of aliskiren plus amlodipine, and ramipril in elderly patients with mild to
      moderate hypertension. It will also compare the long-term safety of an aliskiren-based
      regimen to a ramipril-based regimen
