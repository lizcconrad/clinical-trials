      The main objective of the study is to examine the extent of agreement between patient and
      health care provider assessments of work of breathing and the association of agreement with
      demographic- and disease-related factors.

    <textblock>
      Mechanical ventilation is among the most common interventions in the intensive care unit
      (ICU). Over the last two decades, numerous studies have investigated methods to improve
      outcomes of patients receiving mechanical ventilation. Despite this proliferation of data, a
      large, multi-national cohort study found clinical outcomes such as duration of ventilation
      and ICU stay have not improved significantly between1998 to 2004.

      It is recommended that weaning should be considered as early as possible in the patient
      trajectory and spontaneous breathing trials (SBT) attempted, as SBT are the best diagnostic
      criteria to determine extubation readiness. The decision of ready to extubate is considered
      complex because both delayed and failed extubations are associated with increased ventilator
      time and increased mortality. It is shown that dyspnea occurs among nearly half of ventilator
      patients and is strongly associated with anxiety and delayed extubation. Between 30-75% of
      ICU patients report anxiety where dyspnea, impaired communication skills, and sleep
      disturbances may be predisposing factors. The assessments of work of breathing and clinical
      deterioration are important sub-categories in clinical judgment for determining weaning
      tolerance.

      There is little evidence whether the patients experiences of work of breathing is correlating
      with physicians and nurses. Hence, we suggest the need to evaluate the interobserver
      agreement for clinical assessment in weaning.

      The main objective of the study is to examine the extent of agreement between patient and
      health care provider assessments of work of breathing and the association of agreement with
      demographic- and disease-related factors.
