      The purpose of this trial is to evaluate if Straight Wire Excision of the Transformation Zone
      (SWETZ) is superior to (Large Loop Excision of the Transformation Zone) LLETZ cone in
      reducing the incomplete excision of disease.

    <textblock>
      Cone biopsy is a surgical procedure which objectives the excision of endocervical
      pre-invasive disease located at transformation zone or glandular epithelium. Although cone
      biopsy is considered adequate for the treatment of endocervical dysplastic epithelium , using
      electrosurgery as opposed to the cold knife technique of cone biopsy has been criticized
      because of the perceived potential for incomplete excision of disease, thermal damage and
      surgical specimen fragmentation, which might increase the risk of missing early invasive
      cancer. Also, incomplete excision margin of disease exposes women to an increased risk of
      residual post-treatment disease.

      The standard procedure, Large Loop Excision of the Transformation Zone (LLETZ-cone), is
      performed with a large loop electrode of 20-25 mm depth.

      The experimental intervention is Straight Wire Excision of the Transformation Zone (SWETZ), a
      method of excision using a 1cm straight disposal of 0.20 wire to remove the endocervical
      transformation zone or glandular disease.

      Both procedures were previously studied in another clinical trial(NCT00995020), but the
      histological analysis were inconclusive for many outcomes. SWETZ were superior to LLETZ cone
      to acquire complete excision of disease, with no statistical significance, probably due to
      the small sample size.

      This study objectives a better histological analyses of the surgical specimens related to
      incomplete excision, thermal damage and fragmentation.
