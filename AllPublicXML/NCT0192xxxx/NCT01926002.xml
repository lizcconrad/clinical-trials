  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary hypothesis of the study is single doses of MK-8351 will reduce the baseline early
      asthmatic response (EAR) as assessed by area under the curve from 0-3 hours (AUC0-3hr) of
      forced expiratory volume (FEV1) when compared to placebo.

      This is a randomized, placebo-controlled, 4-period study. Eligible patients will undergo a
      single-blind phase in Period 1, followed by 3 periods during which they will receive low-dose
      MK-8351, high-dose MK-8351, or matching placebo as a single dose in a random sequence
      crossover study design.
