    <textblock>
      This will be a randomized, single-blind, placebo controlled, parallel group study.
      Approximately 260 subjects will be enrolled in five groups. This study is designed to compare
      the effects of tafenoquine, administered as single dose as well as administered over three
      consecutive days, on the changes in QT duration to those observed in subjects dosed with
      either moxifloxacin or placebo.

      SB-252263 (tafenoquine, TQ) is a new 8-aminoquinoline antimalarial drug being developed by
      GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) and the Medicines for Malaria Venture with the assistance and
      historical support of the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research. Tafenoquine has been shown
      to be effective in the treatment of plasmodial infections in vitro, in pre-clinical models in
      vivo, and during early phase clinical studies for radical cure and eradication of liver
      hypnozoites in patients infected with Plasmodium vivax. This study is designed to compare the
      effects of tafenoquine mono-therapy, administered as a single dose or administered on 3
      consecutive days, on the changes in QT duration to those observed in subjects dosed with
      either Avelox (moxifloxacin hydrochloride) or placebo. This will be a randomized,
      single-blind, placebo controlled, parallel group study. Parallel group design is chosen
      because tafenoquine has a long half-life, about 14 to 19 days, and therefore a cross-over
      design is not a practical alternative. Moxifloxacin will be used as a positive control in
      order to validate the sensitivity of the study in detecting QTc change. Moxifloxacin has been
      shown to prolong the QT interval in a dose-dependent manner in patients and healthy
      volunteers, and the QTc prolongation has been well quantified.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  AST, ALT, alkaline phosphatase and bilirubin ≤ 1.5xULN (isolated bilirubin &gt;1.5xULN is
             acceptable if bilirubin is fractionated and direct bilirubin &lt;35%).

          -  Healthy as determined by a responsible and experienced physician, based on a medical
             evaluation including medical history, physical examination, laboratory tests and
             baseline ECG cardiac monitoring. A subject with a clinical abnormality or laboratory
             parameters outside the reference range for the population being studied may be
             included only if the Investigator and the GSK Medical Monitor agree that the finding
             is unlikely to introduce additional risk factors and will not interfere with the study
             procedures.

          -  Male or female between 18 and 65 years of age inclusive, at the time of signing the
             informed consent.

          -  A female subject is eligible to participate if she is of:

          -  Non-childbearing potential defined as pre-menopausal females with a documented tubal
             ligation or hysterectomy; or postmenopausal defined as 12 months of spontaneous
             amenorrhea [in questionable cases a blood sample with simultaneous follicle
             stimulating hormone (FSH) &gt; 40 MlU/ml and estradiol &lt; 40 pg/ml (&lt;147 pmol/L) is
             confirmatory]. Females on hormone replacement therapy (HRT) and whose menopausal
             status is in doubt will be required to use one of the contraception methods in the
             protocol if they wish to continue their HRT during the study. Otherwise, they must
             discontinue HRT to allow confirmation of post-menopausal status prior to study
             enrollment. For most forms of HRT, at least 2-4 weeks will elapse between the
             cessation of therapy and the blood draw; this interval depends on the type and dosage
             of HRT. Following confirmation of their post-menopausal status, they can resume use of
             HRT during the study without use of a contraceptive method.

          -  Child-bearing potential and agrees to use one of the contraception methods listed in
             Section 8.1 for an appropriate period of time (as determined by the product label or
             investigator) prior to the start of dosing to sufficiently minimize the risk of
             pregnancy at that point. Female subjects must agree to use contraception until 90 days
             post-last dose.

          -  Body weight ≥50 kg for men and ≥45 kg for women and BMI within the range 18.5 to 31.0
             kg/m2 (inclusive).

             blood pressure is outside the range of 45-90mmHg or heart rate is outside the range of
             50-100bpm for female subjects or 45-100 bpm for male subjects.

          -  Exclusion criteria for screening ECG (a single repeat is allowed for eligibility

             prior to dosing.

          -  Lactating females.
