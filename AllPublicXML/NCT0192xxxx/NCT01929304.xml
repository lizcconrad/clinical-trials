      Aim: Patient Perception: This aim broadly intends to use traditional script versus a brief
      video education vignette to determine understanding and preferences among general emergency
      department patients of rescue access techniques. A challenge of emergency care is providing
      patient education surrounding procedures in a standardized and patient-oriented manner. This
      data would provide insight on a patient's understanding of the risks and benefits of rescue
      access, assess patient preference, and potentially influence what rescue technique is
      employed in the future. This information may also give us insight onto why DIVA patients
      might refuse randomization.
