    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the direct effects of the ten-valent pneumococcal
      conjugate vaccine administered to infants on nasopharyngeal carriage at 3 to 5 years of age.

      These children have been vaccinated in infancy in the cluster-randomized Finnish Invasive
      pneumococcal Disease (FinIP) Trial (a separate protocol reported at ClinicalTrials.gov
      Identifier:NCT00861380) during 2009 to 2011.

      Also the indirect effect on nasopharyngeal carriage will be assessed on vaccinees' elder
      non-vaccinated siblings aged 5 to 9 years.
