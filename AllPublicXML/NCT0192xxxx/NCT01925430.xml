    <textblock>
      A new device is being developed to screen for sleep-breathing disorders. Within this device
      is a new software algorithm which will determine sleep/wake states. The aim of this study is
      to evaluate the performance of this new algorithm. This prototype will be compared against a
      commercially available device which monitors sleep/wake patterns. Volunteers will be asked to
      wear the prototype and comparative devices for 1-2 nights. The data from both devices will be
      downloaded after the completion of the study and analysis wil be performed to compare the two
      recordings.
