  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      With approximately 12 million cancer survivors today in the United States alone, increased
      attention is being given to quality of life after cancer treatment. Cancer-related fatigue
      (CRF) is one of the most prevalent and debilitating symptoms experienced by people with
      cancer. It can persist for months or years after cancer therapy is completed and has a
      negative impact on all areas of function. Meaningful evidence-based treatment options for CRF
      are extremely limited and finding safe, inexpensive, and effective interventions for managing
      this distressing symptom are urgently needed. Basic research has shown that activation of the
      immune system can cause potent changes in behavior including reduced activity, fatigue, and
      decreased social behavior. Furthermore, research over the last decade has found a
      relationship between levels of CRF with increased inflammation. Thus, study of therapies that
      may decrease immune system activation in the setting of CRF represents a possible target for
      intervention. Massage therapy is one of the fastest growing alternative therapies and has a
      high rate of acceptance for symptom management among cancer patients. Massage has been shown
      in smaller studies with cancer patients to modulate the immune system. Moreover, massage has
      been demonstrated to significantly decrease markers of immune system activation in normal
      subjects. There are no published randomized controlled trials examining either the role of
      massage as an intervention primarily for CRF or investigating whether massage related
      decreases in immune system activation are responsible for improvement in CRF. This proposal
      investigates the effects of massage therapy on CRF among breast cancer survivors. The
      investigators' primary hypothesis is that Swedish Massage Therapy (SMT) will decrease CRF
      compared to a light touch condition and wait list control. The investigators' secondary
      hypothesis is that SMT will decrease CRF by reducing immune system activation. The
      investigators' main exploratory hypothesis is that a decrease in CRF will increase quality of
      life among cancer survivors.

    <description>The primary aim of this study is to determine whether a 6-week Swedish massage therapy (SMT) intervention can decrease cancer-related fatigue, as measured by the Multidimensional Fatigue Inventory (MFI), among breast cancer survivors who have received both radiation and chemotherapy and have CRF. We hypothesize that SMT will decrease fatigue more than light touch (LT) or a wait list control (WLC) condition as assessed by the MFI.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Women

          -  ages 18 to 65 (women above the age of 65 may be included at PI discretion)

          -  • with Stage 0-III breast cancer, status-post surgery treated with standard
             chemotherapy/chemoprevention and/or radiation.

          -  • Patients will be between 3 months and 4-years post treatment. Ongoing
             chemoprevention therapy is permissible. Based on ICD-10 proposed criteria, a diagnosis
             of CRF will require evidence from the history, physical exam, and laboratory findings
             that the fatigue is a consequence of cancer or cancer therapy and not primarily a
             consequence of comorbid psychiatric disorders (schizophrenia, depression, generalized
             anxiety disorder, bipolar disorder, dementia, delirium or OCD).

          -  Brief Fatigue Inventory (BFI) score of &gt;25.

          -  Satisfactory results of screening safety labs, urine pregnancy test and drug test.

          -  Ability to understand study procedures and to comply with them for the entire length
             of the study.

          -  Women of reproductive capability will be enrolled, but each woman needs to discuss
             with the study team the method of birth control used and if the method is a reliable
             and effective method for her. If a woman becomes pregnant during the course of active
             study participation, she must agree prior to enrolling in the study that she will
             report the pregnancy to the study team. With a confirmed pregnancy, the subject will
             no longer receive the assigned treatment, but will continue to be followed per
             protocol.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Inability to lay supine for one hour at a time, given the nature of the massage
             intervention.

          -  Subjects who are actively suicidal or homicidal.

          -  Medical conditions felt to be clinically contributing to fatigue based on the
             investigator's history, physical examination, and assessment: anemia (hemoglobin less
             than 10 g/dl), hypothyroidism (thyroid stimulating hormone greater than 4.6 MCU/mL),
             uncontrolled pain, medical problems associated with fatigue: chronic obstructive
             pulmonary disease, congestive heart failure, renal disease, hepatic dysfunction,
             autoimmune disease, neurological disorders such as multiple sclerosis or Parkinson's
             disease, and sleep apnea.

          -  Medications felt to be clinically contributing to fatigue based on the investigator's
             history, physical examination, and assessment including: opioids, sedating
             anti-histamines, antidepressants, anxiolytics or neuroleptics.

          -  Body-mass index less than 18.5 (kg/m2).

          -  • Treatment with high dose systemic corticosteroids or continuous use of other
             immunosuppressants within the past 30 days.

          -  Unable to comply with the protocol for any reason.

          -  Use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and aspirin is allowed but must be
             tracked.

          -  Other exclusion criteria include: illicit drug use, shift work, current dieting,
             excessive regular use of alcohol (more than two 5 ounce glasses of wine or
             equivalents/day) or a history of binge drinking (more than 7 drinks/24 hour period)
             within the last 6 months.

          -  Subjects who have used massage as a therapeutic modality (medical or psychological) at
             any point in their lives for the treatment of medical conditions.

          -  Subjects who have massages on a regular basis. Regular massage usage will be
             operationally defined as receiving 4 or more massages/year for the last 5 years.

          -  Subjects currently employing any other CAM manual therapy and/or holistic therapies to
             treat a perceived health problem. However, since past experience with CAM therapies
             should not confound any of the analyses of the experiments proposed in this study, we
             will not exclude individuals who have engaged in a CAM manual therapy in the past, nor
             will we exclude individuals who practice yoga or meditation for well-being, take
             vitamins or use nicotine.

          -  Adults over the age of 65 will generally be excluded from the study. This population
             tends to undergo changes in the physiological parameters we are evaluating. Therefore,
             inclusion of this population would skew various biological measures and this pilot
             investigation does not have a large enough sample size to control for such variability
             it. Older subjects could be included at the discretion of the PI.

          -  People unable to read and understand the informed consent document because of language
             difficulties.

          -  Women who are pregnant or lactating.

          -  Women who become pregnant while enrolled will be discontinued from the study and will
             be instructed to exercise, which is the standard recommendation for cancer-related
             fatigue. Inability or unwillingness of individual to give written informed consent.
