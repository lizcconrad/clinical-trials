    <textblock>
      This study is a Phase III, multicentre, randomized, initial double-blind study with
      subsequent open label phases. The study will havea screening phase (4 weeks), a dose increase
      effect verification phase (12 weeks), a down titration 1 phase (1 week), a long-term phase
      (39 weeks), down titration 2 phase (1 to 2 weeks) and a follow up phase. Subjects will be
      assigned to Ropinirole CR high-dose group or Ropinirole CR maintenance group at a ratio of
      3:1. This study is being conducted to evaluate the efficacy (effect of increasing Ropinirole
      dose from 16 mg/day to 18-24 mg/day) of the Ropinirole CR tablets in early and advanced PD
      patients who have not achieved an optimal therapeutic response with marketed Ropinirole
      Immediate release (IR) (15 mg/day) or marketed Ropinirole CR (16 mg/day) formulations.

    <description>The Japanese Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) assesses the status of Parkinson's Disease (PD) participants objectively. Part III assessed motor examination on 27 items. Participants received a score of 0-4 points per item. The maximum total score is 108 points. A higher score indicates more severe PD symptoms. Baseline is defined as the value evaluated at Week 0. Mean change from Baseline was calculated as the total score at Week 12 minus the total score at Baseline. The analyses for the Dose Increase Effect Verification Phase was performed using the last observation carried forward (LOCF) data. In the LOCF data, the last available data was used for the imputation for missing data at a planned visit. The imputation was conducted using the data within only the Dose Increase Effect Verification Phase; therefore, the value observed in the Dose Increase Effect Verification Phase was not used to impute a missing data in the Long-term Phase.</description>

Change from Baseline was calculated by subtracting the Baseline value (actual hours of awake time spent &quot;off&quot;) from the week 17, 21, 25, 37, 49 and 52 value (proportion of awake time spent &quot;off&quot;). Baseline is defined as the value at Week 13. If the value evaluated at week 13 was missing then first observed value post week 13 was used as a Baseline.The analyses for long term phase was performed using the OC data. In the OC data, no imputation was carried for any missing data</description>

    <participant_flow>
      <recruitment_details>A total of 81 participants (par.) were randomized, of which 71 participants completed the Dose Increase Effect Verification (DIEV) Phase and 62 participants entered the Long-term Phase and 39 participants completing the Long-term Phase.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>This study was comprised of a Screening Phase (4 weeks), DIEV Phase (12 weeks), Down Titration 1 Phase (1 week), Long-term Phase (39 weeks), Down Titration 2 Phase (1 to 2 weeks) and the Follow-up Phase. The first 60 par. who completed the DIEV phase entered into the Long-term phase after a completion of the Down Titration 1 phase.</pre_assignment_details>

        <description>The Japanese Unified Parkinson’s Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) assesses the status of Parkinson's Disease (PD) participants objectively. Part III assessed motor examination on 27 items. Participants received a score of 0-4 points per item. The maximum total score is 108 points. A higher score indicates more severe PD symptoms. Baseline is defined as the value evaluated at Week 0. Mean change from Baseline was calculated as the total score at Week 12 minus the total score at Baseline. The analyses for the Dose Increase Effect Verification Phase was performed using the last observation carried forward (LOCF) data. In the LOCF data, the last available data was used for the imputation for missing data at a planned visit. The imputation was conducted using the data within only the Dose Increase Effect Verification Phase; therefore, the value observed in the Dose Increase Effect Verification Phase was not used to impute a missing data in the Long-term Phase.</description>

        <title>Mean Change From Baseline (Week 0) in UPDRS Part III Total Score at the Indicated Visits</title>
        <description>The Japanese Unified Parkinson’s Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) assesses the status of Parkinson's Disease (PD) participants objectively. Part III assessed motor examination on 27 items. Participants received a score of 0-4 points per item. The maximum total score is 108 points. A higher score indicates more severe PD symptoms. Baseline is defined as the value evaluated at Week 0. Mean change from Baseline was calculated as the total score at Week 12 minus the total score at Baseline. The analyses for the Dose Increase Effect Verification Phase was performed using the last observation carried forward (LOCF) data. In the LOCF data, the last available data was used for the imputation for missing data at a planned visit. The imputation was conducted using the data within only the Dose Increase Effect Verification Phase; therefore, the value observed in the Dose Increase Effect Verification Phase was not used to impute a missing data in the Long-term Phase.</description>

            <description>Participants received ropinirole CR 16 mg administered orally OD for 4 weeks in the Screening Phase. After randomization the participant entered Dose Increase Effect Verification Phase, where Ropinirole CR dose was titrated (2 mg/day/week) from 18 mg/day up to a maximum 24mg/day at intervals of 1 week or longer for 8 weeks, until participants reached a dose level above which further symptomatic improvement was not expected; the participants were maintained on that dose for 4 weeks. This was followed by a down titration phase for one week and Long-term Phase for 39 weeks in which the participants received incremental doses (2 mg/day/week) of ropinirole CR from 18 mg/day to a maximum of 24 mg/day until participants reached a dose level above which further symptomatic improvement was not expected; the participants were maintained on that dose. Participants completed the Long-term Phase underwent a down titration phase 2 for 1 to 2 weeks.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in the Japanese UPDRS Part 1 Total Score at the Indicated Visits in the Dose Increase Effect Verification Phase</title>
        <description>The Japanese UPDRS assesses the status of PD participants objectively. Part I evaluated mentation, behavior, and mood on 4 items, response for each item were scored numerically from 0-4. The total score for the 4 items ranged from 0 to 16. A higher score indicates more severe PD symptoms. Change from Baseline was calculated by subtracting the Baseline value from the post Baseline value. Baseline is defined as the value evaluated at Week 0. The analyses for the Dose Increase Effect Verification Phase was performed using the LOCF data. In the LOCF data, the last available data was used for the imputation for missing data at the planned visit.</description>

After randomization the participant entered Dose Increase Effect Verification Phase, where Ropinirole CR dose was titrated (2 mg/day/week) from 18 mg/day up to a maximum 24mg/day at intervals of 1 week or longer for 8 weeks, until participants reached a dose level above which further symptomatic improvement was not expected; the participants were maintained on that dose for 4 weeks. This was followed by a down titration phase for one week and Long-term Phase for 39 weeks in which the participants received incremental doses (2 mg/day/week) of ropinirole CR from 18 mg/day to a maximum of 24 mg/day until participants reached a dose level above which further symptomatic improvement was not expected; the participants were maintained on that dose.

        <title>Change From Baseline in the Japanese UPDRS Part 2 Total Score at the Indicated Visits by the on/Off Status in the Dose Increase Effect Verification Phase</title>
        <description>The Japanese UPDRS assesses the status of PD participants objectively. Part 2 evaluated activities of daily living on 13 items, response for each item were scored numerically from 0-4. The total score for the 4 items ranged from 0 to 52. A higher score indicates more severe PD symptoms. Change from Baseline was calculated by subtracting the Baseline value from the post Baseline value. Baseline is defined as the value evaluated at Week 0. The analyses for the Dose Increase Effect Verification Phase was performed using the LOCF data. In the LOCF data, the last available data was used for the imputation for missing data at a planned visit. &quot;Off&quot; state is defined as the state at which PD symptoms are not adequately controlled by the drug. &quot;On&quot; state is defined as the state at which PD symptoms are well controlled by the drug. The score of UPDRS part 2 in off status is rated as '0' (Normal/None), if L-dopa adjunct participants do not have diurnal fluctuations.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in the Japanese UPDRS Part 4 Total Score at the Indicated Visits in the Dose Increase Effect Verification Phase</title>
        <description>The Japanese UPDRS assessed the status of PD participants objectively. Part 4 evaluated complications on 11 items, response for 4 items were scored numerically from 0-4 and response for other 7 items were Yes/No questions and responses are numerically scored as 0 for “No” and 1 for “Yes”. The total score for the 11 items ranged from 0 to 23. A higher score indicates more severe PD symptoms. Change from Baseline was calculated by subtracting the Baseline value from the post Baseline value. Baseline is defined as the value evaluated at Week 0. The analyses for the Dose Increase Effect Verification Phase was performed using the LOCF data. In the LOCF data, the last available data was used for the imputation for missing data at a planned visit.</description>

            <description>Participants received ropinirole CR 16 mg administered orally OD for 4 weeks in the Screening Phase. After randomization the participant entered Dose Increase Effect Verification Phase, where Ropinirole CR dose was titrated (2 mg/day/week) from 18 mg/day up to a maximum 24mg/day at intervals of 1 week or longer for 8 weeks, until participants reached a dose level above which further symptomatic improvement was not expected; the participants were maintained on that dose for 4 weeks. This was followed by a down titration phase for one week and Long-term Phase for 39 weeks in which the participants received incremental doses (2 mg/day/week) of ropinirole CR from 18 mg/day to a maximum of 24 mg/day until participants reached a dose level above which further symptomatic improvement was not expected; the participants were maintained on that dose. Participants completed the Long-term Phase underwent a down titration phase 2 for 1 to 2 weeks.</description>

        <title>Percent Change From Baseline in the Japanese UPDRS Part 1 Total Score at the Indicated Visits in the Dose Increase Effect Verification Phase</title>
        <description>The Japanese UPDRS assessed the status of PD participants objectively. Part I evaluated mentation, behavior, and mood on 4 items, response for each item were scored numerically from 0-4. The total score for the 4 items ranged from 0 to 16. A higher score indicates more severe PD symptoms. Percent change from Baseline was calculated as Post baseline value minus Baseline value, divided by Baseline value and multiplied by 100. Baseline is defined as the value evaluated at Week 0. The analyses for Dose Increase Effect Verification Phase was performed using the LOCF data. In the LOCF data, the last available data was used for the imputation for missing data at a planned visit.</description>

After randomization the participant entered Dose Increase Effect Verification Phase, where Ropinirole CR dose was titrated (2 mg/day/week) from 18 mg/day up to a maximum 24mg/day at intervals of 1 week or longer for 8 weeks, until participants reached a dose level above which further symptomatic improvement was not expected; the participants were maintained on that dose for 4 weeks. This was followed by a down titration phase for one week and Long-term Phase for 39 weeks in which the participants received incremental doses (2 mg/day/week) of ropinirole CR from 18 mg/day to a maximum of 24 mg/day until participants reached a dose level above which further symptomatic improvement was not expected; the participants were maintained on that dose. Participants completed the Long-term Phase underwent a down titration phase 2 for 1 to 2 weeks.</description>

        <title>Percent Change From Baseline in the Japanese UPDRS Part 2 Total Score at the Indicated Visits by the on/Off Status in the Dose Increase Effect Verification Phase</title>
        <description>The Japanese UPDRS assesses the status of PD participants objectively. Part 2 evaluates activities of daily living on 13 items, response for each item were scored numerically from 0-4. The total score for the 4 items ranged from 0 to 52. A higher score indicates more severe PD symptoms. Percent change from Baseline was calculated as Post baseline value minus Baseline value, divided by Baseline value and multiplied by 100. Baseline is defined as the value at Week 0. The analyses for Dose Increase Effect Verification Phase was performed using the LOCF data. In the LOCF data, the last available data was used for the imputation for missing data at a planned visit. &quot;Off&quot; state is defined as the state at which PD symptoms are not adequately controlled by the drug. &quot;On&quot; state is defined as the state at which PD symptoms are well controlled by the drug. The score of UPDRS part 2 in off status is rated as '0' (Normal/None), if L-dopa adjunct participants do not have diurnal fluctuations.</description>

        <title>Percent Change From Baseline in the Japanese UPDRS Part 3 Total Score at the Indicated Visits in the Dose Increase Effect Verification Phase</title>
        <description>The Japanese UPDRS assessed the status of PD participants objectively. Part 3 evaluated motor examination on 27 items, response for each items were scored numerically from 0-4. The total score for the 27 items ranged from 0 to 108. A higher score indicates more severe PD symptoms. Percent change from Baseline was calculated as Post baseline value minus Baseline value, divided by Baseline value and multiplied by 100. Baseline is defined as the value evaluated at Week 0. The analyses for Dose Increase Effect Verification Phase was performed using the LOCF data. In the LOCF data, the last available data was used for the imputation for missing data at a planned visit.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in the Japanese UPDRS Part 1 Total Score at the Indicated Visits in the Long-term Phase</title>
        <description>The Japanese UPDRS assessed the status of PD participants objectively. Part I evaluated mentation, behavior, and mood on 4 items, response for each item were scored numerically from 0-4. The total score for the 4 items ranged from 0 to 16. A higher score indicates more severe PD symptoms.Change from Baseline was calculated by subtracting the Baseline value from the post Baseline value. Baseline is defined as the value evaluated at Week 13. If the value evaluated at Week 13 was missing, then first observed value post Week 13 was used as Baseline. The analyses performed using the OC data. In the OC data, no imputation was carried for any missing data. Full Analysis Set 2 (FAS2) Population comprised of all participants in the FAS1 and shifted to Long-term Phase, excluding those participants who received no dose of study medication and participants without UPDRS part III total score data after supply of the investigational product.</description>

        <population>FAS2 Population. Only those participants available at the specified time points were analyzed (represented by n=X,X in the category titles). Different participants may have been analyzed at different time points, so the overall number of participants analyzed reflects everyone in the FAS2 population.</population>

            <description>Participants received ropinirole CR 16 mg administered orally OD for 4 weeks in the Screening Phase. After randomization the participant entered Dose Increase Effect Verification Phase, where Ropinirole CR dose was titrated (2 mg/day/week) from 18 mg/day up to a maximum 24mg/day at intervals of 1 week or longer for 8 weeks, until participants reached a dose level above which further symptomatic improvement was not expected; the participants were maintained on that dose for 4 weeks. This was followed by a down titration phase for one week and Long-term Phase for 39 weeks in which the participants received incremental doses (2 mg/day/week) of ropinirole CR from 18 mg/day to a maximum of 24 mg/day until participants reached a dose level above which further symptomatic improvement was not expected; the participants were maintained on that dose. Participants completed the Long-term Phase underwent a down titration phase 2 for 1 to 2 weeks.</description>

          <title>Change From Baseline in the Japanese UPDRS Part 1 Total Score at the Indicated Visits in the Long-term Phase</title>
          <description>The Japanese UPDRS assessed the status of PD participants objectively. Part I evaluated mentation, behavior, and mood on 4 items, response for each item were scored numerically from 0-4. The total score for the 4 items ranged from 0 to 16. A higher score indicates more severe PD symptoms.Change from Baseline was calculated by subtracting the Baseline value from the post Baseline value. Baseline is defined as the value evaluated at Week 13. If the value evaluated at Week 13 was missing, then first observed value post Week 13 was used as Baseline. The analyses performed using the OC data. In the OC data, no imputation was carried for any missing data. Full Analysis Set 2 (FAS2) Population comprised of all participants in the FAS1 and shifted to Long-term Phase, excluding those participants who received no dose of study medication and participants without UPDRS part III total score data after supply of the investigational product.</description>
          <population>FAS2 Population. Only those participants available at the specified time points were analyzed (represented by n=X,X in the category titles). Different participants may have been analyzed at different time points, so the overall number of participants analyzed reflects everyone in the FAS2 population.</population>

        <title>Change From Baseline in the Japanese UPDRS Part 2 Total Score at the Indicated Visits by the on/Off Status in the Long Term Phase</title>
        <description>The Japanese UPDRS assesses the status of PD participants objectively. Part 2 evaluates activities of daily living on 13 items, response for each item were scored numerically from 0-4. The total score for the 4 items ranged from 0 to 52. A higher score indicates more severe PD symptoms.Change from Baseline was calculated by subtracting the Baseline value from the post Baseline value. Baseline is defined as the value at Week 13. If the value at Week 13 was missing, then first observed value post Week 13 was used as Baseline. The analyses performed using the OC data. In the OC data, no imputation was carried for any missing data.&quot;Off&quot; state is defined as the state at which PD symptoms are not adequately controlled by the drug. &quot;On&quot; state is defined as the state at which PD symptoms are well controlled by the drug. The score of UPDRS part 2 in off status is rated as '0' (Normal/None), if L-dopa adjunct participants do not have diurnal fluctuations.</description>

        <title>Mean Change From Baseline in UPDRS Part 3 Total Score at the Indicated Visits for Long Term Phase</title>
        <description>The Japanese UPDRS assesses the status of PD participants objectively. Part 3 evaluates motor examination on 27 items, response for each items were scored numerically from 0-4. The total score for the 27 items ranged from 0 to 108. A higher score indicates more severe PD symptoms. Change from Baseline was calculated by subtracting the Baseline value from the post Baseline value. Baseline is defined as the value evaluated at Week 13. If the value evaluated at Week 13 was missing, then first observed value post Week 13 was used as Baseline. The analyses performed using the OC data. In the OC data, no imputation was carried for any missing data.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in the Japanese UPDRS Part 4 Total Score at the Indicated Visits in the Long Term Phase</title>
        <description>The Japanese UPDRS assessed the status of PD participants objectively. Part 4 evaluated complications on 11 items, response for 4 items were scored numerically from 0-4 and response for other 7 items were Yes/No questions and responses are numerically scored as 0 for “No” and 1 for “Yes”. The total score for the 11 items ranged from 0 to 23. A higher score indicates more severe PD symptoms.Change from Baseline was calculated by subtracting the Baseline value from the post Baseline value. Baseline is defined as the value evaluated at Week 13. If the value evaluated at Week 13 was missing, then first observed value post Week 13 was used as Baseline. The analyses performed using the OC data. In the OC data, no imputation was carried for any missing data.</description>

Part I evaluated mentation, behavior, and mood on 4 items, response for each item were scored numerically from 0-4. The total score for the 4 items ranged from 0 to 16. A higher score indicates more severe PD symptoms. Percent change from Baseline was calculated as Post baseline value minus Baseline value, divided by Baseline value and multiplied by 100. Baseline is defined as the value evaluated at Week 13. If the value evaluated at Week 13 was missing, then first observed value post Week 13 was used as Baseline.

        <title>Percent Change From Baseline in the Japanese UPDRS Part 2 Total Score at the Indicated Visits by the on/Off Status in the Long-term Phase</title>
        <description>The Japanese UPDRS assesses the status of PD participants objectively. Part 2 evaluates activities of daily living on 13 items, response for each item were scored numerically from 0-4. The total score for the 4 items ranged from 0 to 52. A higher score indicates more severe PD symptoms. Percent change from Baseline was calculated as Post baseline value minus Baseline value, divided by Baseline value and multiplied by 100. Baseline is defined as the value at Week 13. If the value at Week 13 was missing, then first observed value post Week 13 was used as Baseline. The analyses performed using the OC data. In the OC data, no imputation was carried for any missing data.&quot;Off&quot; state is defined as the state at which PD symptoms are not adequately controlled by the drug. &quot;On&quot; state is defined as the state at which PD symptoms are well controlled by the drug. The score of UPDRS part 2 in off status is rated as '0' (Normal/None), if L-dopa adjunct participants do not have diurnal fluctuations.</description>

        <title>Percent Change From Baseline in the Japanese UPDRS Part 4 Total Score at the Indicated Visits in the Long-term Phase</title>
        <description>The Japanese UPDRS assesses the status of PD participants objectively. Part 4 evaluates complications on 11 items, response for 4 items were scored numerically from 0-4 and response for other 7 items were Yes/No questions and responses are numerically scored as 0 for “No” and 1 for “Yes”. The total score for the 11 items ranged from 0 to 23. A higher score indicates more severe PD symptoms. Percent change from Baseline was calculated as Post baseline value minus Baseline value, divided by Baseline value and multiplied by 100. Baseline is defined as the value evaluated at Week 13. If the value evaluated at Week 13 was missing, then first observed value post Week 13 was used as Baseline. The analyses performed using the OC data. In the OC data, no imputation was carried for any missing data.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in the Percentage of Awake Time Spent &quot;Off&quot; at the Indicated Visits Only in Participants Who Received L-dopa Adjunct</title>
        <description>&quot;Off&quot; state is defined as the state at which PD symptoms are not adequately controlled by the drug. Participants were asked to record the duration of their “off ” periods and asleep in diary cards every day. Percentage of awake time spent “off” is defined as sum of two days off time (hours) divided by sum of two days awake time (hours) and multiplied by 100. Change from Baseline was calculated by subtracting the Baseline value (percentage of awake time spent “off”) from the post Baseline value (percentage of awake time spent “off”). Baseline is defined as the value at Week 0. The analyses for Dose Increase Effect Verification Phase was performed using the LOCF data. In the LOCF data, the last available data was used for the imputation for missing data at a planned visit.</description>

Change from Baseline in awake time spent “On”(actual hours) is calculated as awake time spent “On” (hours) at the indicated visit minus awake time spent “On” (hours) at Baseline. Baseline is defined as the value at Week 0. The analyses for Dose Increase Effect Verification Phase was performed using the LOCF data. In the LOCF data, the last available data was used for the imputation for missing data at a planned visit.</description>
          <population>FAS1 Population. Only those participants available at the specified time points were analyzed (represented by n=X,X in the category titles). Different participants may have been analyzed at different time points, so the overall number of participants analyzed reflects everyone in the FAS1 population.</population>

        <description>&quot;On&quot; state is defined as the state at which PD symptoms are well controlled by the drug. Participants were asked to record the duration of their “off ” periods and asleep in diary cards every day. Change from Baseline in awake time spent “On” without troublesome dyskinesias (actual hours) is calculated as [awake time spent “On” minus awake time spent “On” with troublesome dyskinesias] (hours) at visit minus [awake time spent “On” minus awake time spent “On” with troublesome dyskinesias] (hours) at Baseline. Baseline is defined as the value at Week 0. The analyses for Dose Increase Effect Verification Phase was performed using the LOCF data. In the LOCF data, the last available data was used for the imputation for missing data at a planned visit.</description>

            <description>Participants received ropinirole CR 16 mg administered orally OD for 4 weeks in the Screening Phase. After randomization the participant entered Dose Increase Effect Verification Phase, where Ropinirole CR dose was titrated (2 mg/day/week) from 18 mg/day up to a maximum 24mg/day at intervals of 1 week or longer for 8 weeks, until participants reached a dose level above which further symptomatic improvement was not expected; the participants were maintained on that dose for 4 weeks. This was followed by a down titration phase for one week and Long-term Phase for 39 weeks in which the participants received incremental doses (2 mg/day/week) of ropinirole CR from 18 mg/day to a maximum of 24 mg/day until participants reached a dose level above which further symptomatic improvement was not expected; the participants were maintained on that dose. Participants completed the Long-term Phase underwent a down titration phase 2 for 1 to 2 weeks.</description>

        <title>Number of Participants With an Improvement (Responder) in the Clinical Global Impression (CGI) Global Improvement Scale at Week 12</title>
        <description>The CGI global improvement scale allows the investigator to rate the participant’s total improvement since the beginning of treatment (Baseline). Scores on the scale range from 1 to 7 (1=very much improved, 2=much improved, 3=minimally improved, 4=no change, 5=minimally worse, 6=much worse, and 7=very much worse). Participants with a CGI global improvement score of &lt;=2 (representing much improved or very much improved) were considered to be moderate improvement (responder). The analyses performed using the OC data. In the OC data, no imputation was carried for any missing data.</description>

        <title>Number of Participants Achieving a 30% and 20% Reduction From Baseline in the UPDRS Total Part 3 Score at the Indicated Visits in Long Term Phase.</title>
        <description>The Japanese UPDRS assesses the status of Parkinson's Disease (PD) participants objectively. Part III assessed motor examination on 27 items. Participants received a score of 0-4 points per item. The maximum total score is 108 points. A higher score indicates more severe PD symptoms. Number of participants achieving a 30% or greater and 20% or greater reduction from Baseline in UPDRS total part III score at Weeks 17, 21, 25, 37, 49 and 52,are presented using OC data. Change from Baseline was calculated by subtracting the Baseline value from the post Baseline value. Baseline is defined as the value evaluated at Week 13. If the value evaluated at Week 13 was missing, then first observed value post Week 13 was used as Baseline. The OC (observed Case) dataset was defined as the dataset consisting of observed data without any missing data imputation.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in the Actual Hours of Awake Time Spent &quot;Off&quot; at the Indicated Visits Only in Participants Who Received L-dopa Adjunct in Long Term Phase</title>
        <description>&quot;Off&quot; state is defined as the state at which PD symptoms are not adequately controlled by the drug. Participants were asked to record the duration of their “off ” periods and asleep in diary cards every day. Change from Baseline was calculated by subtracting the Baseline value (actual hours of awake time spent “off”) from the week 17, 21, 25, 37, 49 and 52 value (proportion of awake time spent “off”). Baseline is defined as the value at Week 13. If the value evaluated at week 13 was missing then first observed value post week 13 was used as a Baseline.The analyses for long term phase was performed using the OC data. In the OC data, no imputation was carried for any missing data</description>

Participants were asked to record the duration of their “off ” periods and asleep in diary cards every day. Percentage of awake time spent “off” is defined as sum of two days off time (hours) divided by sum of two days awake time (hours) and multiplied by 100. Change from Baseline was calculated by subtracting the Baseline value (percentage of awake time spent “off”) from week 17, 21, 25, 37, 49 and 52 value (percentage of awake time spent “off”). Baseline is defined as the value at Week 13, If the value evaluated at week 13 was missing then first observed value post week 13 was used as a Baseline.

        <description>&quot;On&quot; state is defined as the state at which PD symptoms are well controlled by the drug. Participants were asked to record the duration of their “off ” periods and asleep in diary cards every day. Change from Baseline in awake time spent “On”(actual hours) is calculated as awake time spent “On” (hours) at the week 17, 21, 25, 37, 49 and 52 value minus awake time spent “On” (hours) at Baseline. Baseline is defined as the value at Week 13. If the value evaluated at week 13 was missing then first observed value post week 13 was used as a Baseline. The analyses for Long term phase was performed using the OC data. The OC (observed Case) dataset was defined as the dataset consisting of observed data without any missing data imputation.</description>

After randomization the participant entered Dose Increase Effect Verification Phase, where Ropinirole CR dose was titrated (2 mg/day/week) from 18 mg/day up to a maximum 24mg/day at intervals of 1 week or longer for 8 weeks, until participants reached a dose level above which further symptomatic improvement was not expected; the participants were maintained on that dose for 4 weeks. This was followed by a down titration phase for one week and Long-term Phase for 39 weeks in which the participants received incremental doses (2 mg/day/week) of ropinirole CR from 18 mg/day to a maximum of 24 mg/day until participants reached a dose level above which further symptomatic improvement was not expected; the participants were maintained on that dose. Participants completed the Long-term Phase underwent a down titration phase 2 for 1 to 2 weeks.</description>

          <title>Change From Baseline in Actual Hours of Awake Time Spent &quot;On&quot; at the Indicated Visits Only in Participants Who Received L-dopa Adjunct in Long Term Phase</title>
          <description>&quot;On&quot; state is defined as the state at which PD symptoms are well controlled by the drug. Participants were asked to record the duration of their “off ” periods and asleep in diary cards every day. Change from Baseline in awake time spent “On”(actual hours) is calculated as awake time spent “On” (hours) at the week 17, 21, 25, 37, 49 and 52 value minus awake time spent “On” (hours) at Baseline. Baseline is defined as the value at Week 13. If the value evaluated at week 13 was missing then first observed value post week 13 was used as a Baseline. The analyses for Long term phase was performed using the OC data. The OC (observed Case) dataset was defined as the dataset consisting of observed data without any missing data imputation.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Percentage of Awake Time Spent &quot;On&quot; Without Troublesome Dyskinesias at the Indicated Visits Only in Participants Who Received L-dopa Adjunct in Long Term Phase</title>
        <description>&quot;On&quot; state is defined as the state at which PD symptoms are well controlled by the drug. Par. were asked to record the duration of their “on ” periods and asleep in diary cards every day. Percentage of awake time spent “On” without troublesome dyskinesias is defined as sum of two days on time without troublesome dyskinesias [“On” time minus “On” time with troublesome dyskinesias] (hours) divided by sum of two days awake time (hours) and multiplified by 100. Change from Baseline was calculated by subtracting the Baseline value (percentage of awake time spent “On” without troublesome dyskinesias) from week 17, 21, 25, 37, 49 and 52 value (percentage of awake time spent “On” without troublesome dyskinesias). Baseline is defined as the value at Week 13. If the value evaluated at week 13 was missing the first observed value post week 13 was used as a Baseline.The analyses for Long term phase was performed using the OC data. In the OC data, no imputation was carried for any missing data.</description>
