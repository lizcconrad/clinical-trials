      The purpose of this Collaborative R01, under Program Announcement PAR-09-153, is to conduct a
      full-scale trial of an intervention to assist mothers living with HIV (MLH) with disclosing
      their serostatus to their young age 6 - 14 year old), well children. A pilot study of the
      intervention has recently been completed (R01 MH077493) and met its major aims. The basis for
      development of the pilot intervention was work from three R01s (MH057207, currently Yr. 14)
      designed to longitudinally assess MLH and their children. Within that work, several studies
      were conducted on maternal disclosure, suggesting disclosure is difficult, and outcomes for
      MLH and children could be improved by intervention. The pilot study, known in the community
      as Teaching, Raising, And Communicating with Kids (TRACK), was based on integrative
      disclosure theory. Results of the pilot trial indicate that those in the intervention group
      were six times more likely to disclose their HIV/AIDS status to their child than those in the
      control group (O.R. 6.33); by the 9-month follow-up 33% of intervention MLH disclosed,
      compared to only 7.3% of the control group. Perhaps more importantly, the intervention
      group's emotional functioning and their satisfaction improved significantly following the
      intervention, compared to the control group. Similarly, child mental health indicators among
      children of intervention MLH were significantly better than control group children at
      follow-ups. In this study, TRACK II, we propose to conduct a full-scale trial of the
      intervention in two sites: (1) Los Angeles county (Site 1, where the pilot trial was
      conducted), which will include a high proportion of Latina families and a smaller proportion
      of African-American and White families; and (2) Atlanta, Georgia (Site 2, where the primary
      consultant on the pilot trial conducts research), which will include a high proportion of
      Southern African-American families, as well as White families. MLH and their children (N =
      440 total; 110 mothers and 110 children per site, n = 220 per site) will be assessed at
      baseline and at 3, 9, and 15-month follow-ups. MLH will be randomly assigned to the
      intervention or control. Aims are to:

        1. facilitate disclosure of the mothers' HIV status to the children, which will include
           secondary aims of:

             1. increasing mothers' self-efficacy to disclose and respond to child questions
                regarding HIV;

             2. reducing mothers' fears regarding disclosure and stigma;

             3. improving maternal knowledge of child development and how to provide appropriate
                levels of information given the age of the child;

        2. improve MLH mental health indicators over time (i.e., depression, anxiety, quality of
           life);

        3. improve child mental health indicators over time (i.e., depression, anxiety, acting out
           behaviors); and

        4. improve family functioning indicators (e.g., cohesion, perceived closeness between
           mother and child).
