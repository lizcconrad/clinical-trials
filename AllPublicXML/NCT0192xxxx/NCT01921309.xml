      To demonstrate the safety and effectiveness of the Trinity™ BIOLOX delta™ Ceramic-on-Ceramic
      Total Hip System in comparison to the Trinity™ Acetabular Hip System,which is FDA cleared for
      use in the U.S. The comparison will be based upon clinical success at the Month 24 endpoint.

      The clinical research results for the Trinity™ BIOLOX delta™ Ceramic-on-Ceramic Total Hip
      System will be compared to the control device

      Clinical success is based upon Harris Hip Scores to evaluate functional status, adverse
      events, radiological assessments and no device failure (defined as removal, replacement, or
      modification of any device component).

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. preoperative Harris Hip Score of ≤ 70.

          2. preoperative Harris Hip Total Pain score of at least moderate.

          3. diagnosed with non-inflammatory degenerative joint disease including osteoarthritis
             and avascular necrosis, rheumatoid arthritis, correction of functional deformity,
             developmental hip dysplasia (DDH) and congenital hip dysplasia (CDH).

          4. pain rating of none or slight and are at least 12 months post-operative in the
             contralateral hip, if applicable.

          5. have sufficient femoral and acetabular bone stock as determined by a clinician, and
             are suitable to receive implants as confirmed by x-rays.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. have a nutritional problem (protein, calorie, or vitamin/mineral deficiency) that may
             impair wound healing mechanisms as determined by the clinician /investigator.

         16. have an existing total hip arthroplasty in the contralateral hip with a pain rating of
             3 or more on a scale of 0 to 10, where 0 is &quot;no pain&quot; and 10 is &quot;severe pain&quot;.

         17. have had a total hip arthroplasty in the contralateral hip within the past 12 months.

         18. have previously received a metal-on-metal hip arthroplasty.

         19. have a highly communicable disease or diseases that may limit follow-up (e.g.
             immunocompromised conditions, hepatitis, active tuberculosis, etc.).

         20. have any known sensitivity to device material.
