      This protocol will examine the safety of intratumoral administration of Clostridium Novyi-NT
      spores in patients with treatment-refractory solid tumor malignancies. This investigational
      study will measure anti-tumor activity of C. novyi-NT administered intratumoral in patients
      with treatment-refractory solid tumor malignancies.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Diagnosis of an advanced solid tumor malignancy. There must be a target tumor which is
             measureable, palpable or clearly identifiable under ultrasound or radiographic
             guidance and amenable to percutaneous injection of C. novyi-NT spores. The targeted
             lesion must have a longest diameter ≥ 1 cm and ≤ 12 cm and be measurable as defined by
             RECIST 1.1 criteria. The target lesion must not be located in either the thoracic,
             abdominal or pelvic cavities or in the brain. There must be no clinical, no
             functional, and no radiographic evidence of bone involvement at the site of the target
             lesion.

          2. History of prior treatment with at least one line of systemic anticancer therapy, when
             an approved systemic therapy is available, and no curative option is available for
             continued treatment.

          3. At least 4 weeks have elapsed since the completion of major surgery, and the patient
             has fully recovered from this surgery and any post-surgical complications.

          4. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 2 or less.

          5. Patient is at least 18 years of age.

          6. Patient is capable of giving informed consent.

          7. Patient of childbearing potential (defined by the clinical sites' standards) is using
             adequate birth control measures (e.g., barrier method with spermicide; intrauterine
             device; implantable or injectable hormonal contraceptives; surgical sterilization) for
             the duration of the study and will continue to use such precautions for 12 months
             after receiving treatment.

          8. Patient has no significant valvular heart disease (trace or mild valvular stenosis or
             regurgitation is allowed).

          9. Patient is able to stay within 45 minutes driving time of an emergency room for 28
             days after doing.

               -  International normalized ratio (INR) greater than 1.3

         11. Patient has a foreign body which in the opinion of the treating investigator could be
             difficult to manage in case of infection (e.g. prosthetic hip).

         12. Clinically significant pleural effusion.

         13. Clinically significant pericardial effusion, circumferential pericardial effusion, or
             any effusion greater than 1.0 cm at any location around the heart.

         14. Need for ongoing treatment with an immunosuppressive agent.

         15. History of solid organ transplantation (with the exception of a corneal transplant &gt; 3
             months prior to screening).

         16. History of an ischemic insult in the previous 12 months (myocardial infarction,

             unsuitable for the trial. For example:

             i. Symptomatic congestive heart failure ii. Psychiatric Illness/social situation that
             may make study dangerous iii. Unstable angina pectoris

         18. Asplenia.

         19. Antibiotic allergies that would preclude treatment for a C. novyi-NT infection.
