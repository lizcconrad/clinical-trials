  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Multiple digital injuries are often complex and severe, and the commonly used local and
      regional flaps may not be feasible. The authors reconstruct soft tissue defects of the
      fingers using the dorsal digito-metacarpal flap and evaluate the efficacy of this technique.

      At final follow-up, we measure the sensibility of the flaps using the static 2-point
      discrimination test. The Static 2-point discrimination test determines the minimal distance
      at which a subject can sense the presence of two needle. The modified American Society for
      Surgery of the Hand guidalines are used to stratify discriminator measurements(excellent &lt;6
      mm, good 6-10 mm, fair 11-15 mm, poor &gt;15 mm). Each area is tested 3 times with a
      Discriminator (Ali Med, Dedham, MA). Two out of 3 correct answers are considered proof of
      perception before proceeding to another lower value. We stopp at 4mm as a limit of 2PD and
      consider this normal. The measurements are performed at a single time point at final follow
      up.

    <description>The dorsal digito-metacarpal flap is a vascular island flap based on the dorsal digital artery and dorsal metacarpal artery. It has a longer vascular pedicle and provides tissue coverage of similar quality as that of normal glabrous skin but not sacrifice the digital artery.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  the injured and adjacent fingers are unable to be used as the donor due to multiple
             digital injuries

          -  a soft tissue defect &gt; 1.5 cm in length with exposed bone or tendon

          -  the reverse DMA flap may not be appropriate for tissue reconstruction due to the
             concomitant injuries or due to the limitation of the rotation arc

          -  a patient between 15 and 60 years of age

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  concomitant injuries involved all the finger that precluded their use as donor sites

          -  a defect less than 1.5 cm in length

          -  injuries to the course of the vascular pedicle
