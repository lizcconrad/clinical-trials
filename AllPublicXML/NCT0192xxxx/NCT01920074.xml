  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      RECTIV® is an ointment containing 0.4% nitroglycerin (NTG) for the treatment of moderate to
      severe pain associated with chronic anal fissure approved in June 2011 by the US Food and
      Drug Administration (FDA) for adults. The purpose of this study is to assess the safety,
      pharmacokinetics, and exploratory efficacy of RECTIV® in adolescents
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, multicenter study conducted in up to 10 sites in the United States. A
      total of 13 pediatric male or female patients age ≥12 to &lt;17 years will be enrolled. The
      patients will administer a dose of Rectiv® twice daily to characterize the safety,
      pharmacokinetics , and exploratory efficacy of Nitroglycerin Ointment 0.4% (RECTIV® )over 5
      days

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Noncompartmental pharmacokinetic (PK) analyses will be performed on the full pharmacokinetic curves for NTG and its metabolites (1,2 glyceryl dinitrate and 1,3 glyceryl dinitrate) on Day 5</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 5</time_frame>
    <description>The following PK parameters will be calculated as data permit:
Maximum observed concentration (Cmax)
Time of the maximum observed plasma concentration (Tmax)
Area under the concentration time curve from dosing up to the last quantifiable concentration (AUC0-last).
Area under the concentration time curve from dosing up to 480 minutes (AUC0-480)
The extrapolated area under the concentration time curve from dosing up to 12 hours (AUC0-12h) also will be calculated if quantifiable concentrations are observed during the entire dose interval.
Terminal elimination half-life (t1/2) On the basis of the results of the study, additional noncompartmental PK parameters may be calculated and reported.
In addition, a population PK model for NTG will be developed based on the PK data from Day 5. By using this model, the following additional PK parameters may be reported:
Apparent volume of distribution (V/F)
Apparent clearance (CL/F)</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>• Absolute change from baseline in 24-hour average anal fissure pain scores assessed by the Wong-Baker FACES® and the Numerical Rating Scale for pain after each evening dose over days 1 through 4</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 5</time_frame>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>To assess the safety of Rectiv® in adolescents (age ≥12 to &lt;17 years)</measure>
    <time_frame>Screening through the completion of study participation</time_frame>
    <description>Safety and tolerability are assessed through adverse events (AEs), clinical laboratory test results (hematology, serum biochemistry, and urinalysis), vital sign measurements (heart rate, supine and orthostatic blood pressure, oral temperature, and respiratory rate), 12-lead ECG results, anal area assessment, physical examination findings (including body weight), and concomitant medications (including the use of rescue acetaminophen for headaches).</description>
