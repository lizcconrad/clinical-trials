    <textblock>
      This study compares two different ways to treat pain. The two ways are:

        1. continuing to take current pain medication(s) or

        2. receiving morphine, a pain medication from a drug pump (a system to deliver drug to your
           body) that is implanted.

      None of the procedures or products used in this study are experimental. The length the study
      will be about 25 weeks (between 5½ to 6½ months). The purpose of this study is to compare
      pain and opioid side effects between people who get a drug pump and people who do not get a
      drug pump that will stay on their current pain medication treatment.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This was a randomized, controlled, open-label, multi-center, prospective post-market study to
      assess pain control and opioid-related side effects following a route of delivery change to
      low dose IT morphine therapy from systemic opioid therapy. Subjects with nonmalignant,
      chronic, intractable pain who were experiencing inadequate pain relief and/or intolerable
      side effects from systemic opioid therapy receiving ≤300 mg/day morphine equivalent dose were
      eligible for screening. Additionally, the subjects had no known history of sleep apnea and
      were candidates for IT morphine administration via the SynchroMed Infusion System. Subjects
      must not have previously undergone an intrathecal/epidural trial for pump infusion therapy.

    <description>Determine the proportion of subjects with clinical success based on changes in pain intensity (Numerical Pain Rating Scale: NPRS) and opioid-related Common Toxicity Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) from the National Cancer Institute (NCI).</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Pain Assessment</measure>
    <time_frame>3 Month</time_frame>
    <description>Compare changes from Baseline to Month 3 between the IT group and CMM group in Numeric Pain Rating Scale (NPRS). The scale measures pain intensity. Using NPRS, a pain score ranging from 0 (no pain) to 10 (pain as bad as you can imagine) is recorded on a subject diary twice daily for 5 days before a study visit. The score for each visit is calculated as the mean pain of the 5 diary days morning and evening scores. For each subject, the change in pain will be calculated as the mean pain score at Month 3 minus the mean pain score at Baseline. A negative change value represents a lowering of the pain score (an improvement, or reduction in pain).</description>

    <measure>Opioid-Related Side Effects</measure>
    <time_frame>3 Month</time_frame>
    <description>Summarize the changes from Baseline to Month 3 between the IT group and CMM group in Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) toxicity score. (from the National Cancer Institute) A subset of 23 specific items of the CTCAE v4.03 were evaluated. The subset was chosen as these criteria were most related to opioid side effects that are of interest in this study. The investigator scored the assessment at each visit. The total score for a visit is based on the sum of 23 individual CTCAE's. The individual scales have a range of 0 to 2, 0 to 3, or 0 to 5 and the total score ranges from 0 (best case) to 90 (worst case). For each subject, the change in toxicity will be calculated as the total toxicity score at Month 3 minus the total toxicity score at Baseline. A negative change value represents a lowering of the subjects toxicity score (an improvement, or reduction in toxicity).</description>

    <measure>Sleep Assessment</measure>
    <time_frame>3 Month</time_frame>
    <description>Compare changes from Baseline to Month 3 between the IT group and CMM group for Apnea-Hypopnea Index (AHI). The AHI was collected via overnight sleep lab polysomnography. The AHI is an index used to indicate the severity of sleep apnea. It is represented by the number of apnea and hypopnea events per hour of sleep. The AHI values for adults are categorized as Normal: AHI&lt;5, Mild sleep apnea: 5≤AHI&lt;15, Moderate sleep apnea: 15≤AHI&lt;30, Severe sleep apnea: AHI≥30. For each subject, the change in AHI will be calculated as the AHI at Month 3 minus the AHI at Baseline. A negative change value represents a lowering of the subjects AHI (an improvement, or reduction in sleep apnea).</description>

Using NPRS, a pain score ranging from 0 (no pain) to 10 (pain as bad as you can imagine) is recorded on a subject diary twice daily for 5 days before a study visit. The score for each visit is calculated as the mean pain of the 5 diary days morning and evening scores. For each subject, the change in pain will be calculated as the mean pain score at Month 3 minus the mean pain score at Baseline. A negative change value represents a lowering of the pain score (an improvement, or reduction in pain).</description>

The subset was chosen as these criteria were most related to opioid side effects that are of interest in this study. The investigator scored the assessment at each visit. The total score for a visit is based on the sum of 23 individual CTCAE’s. The individual scales have a range of 0 to 2, 0 to 3, or 0 to 5 and the total score ranges from 0 (best case) to 90 (worst case). For each subject, the change in toxicity will be calculated as the total toxicity score at Month 3 minus the total toxicity score at Baseline.

      <pi_employee>Principal Investigators are NOT employed by the organization sponsoring the study.</pi_employee>
      <restrictive_agreement>The disclosure restrictions on the PI allow for the sponsor to review results communications prior to public release and to embargo communications regarding trial results for a period that is less than or equal to 90 days from the time submitted to sponsor for review. The sponsor is also allowed to require changes for technical correctness and to protect confidential information, copyrightable or patentable material; and when reasonably requested, extend the embargo up to an additional 90 days.</restrictive_agreement>

    <limitations_and_caveats>Due to the small sample size (only 1 IT Group and 0 CMM Group participants completed the primary outcome assessment), statistical tests cannot be performed and conclusions cannot be made on any of the original study objectives.</limitations_and_caveats>
