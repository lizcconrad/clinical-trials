  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Metformin may have complex interactions in the gut and is generally first line therapy for
      type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). It is important to understand whether there are significant
      pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic interactions when GSK2330672 is co-administered with
      metformin in subjects with T2DM. The purpose of this study is to investigate the safety and
      tolerability of GSK2330672 administered for 7 days to subjects with T2DM taking metformin.
      This will be a two-period crossover study; subjects will receive either GSK2330672 or placebo
      for 7 days in each period separated by a washout period of 13 to 15 days. All subjects will
      receive metformin throughout the study

    <measure>Mean Change From Baseline in Overall Gastrointestinal Symptom Rating Scale (GSRS) Scores</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Day -1) and Day 8 of each treatment period</time_frame>
    <description>The impact of gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms on health-related quality of life was assessed using the GSRS. The GSRS is a 15-item related to abdominal pain, reflux, indigestion, diarrhea and constipation syndromes, self-administered questionnaire that assesses the impact of gastrointestinal symptoms during the past week on a scale from 1 (no discomfort at all) to 7 (very severe discomfort). Overall GSRS is the mean of questions 1-15 and range from 1 to 7, with lower scores indicating a better quality of life with respect to gastrointestinal symptoms. Baseline was defined as the assessment done on Day -1. Change from baseline was calculated by subtracting the baseline (Day -1) values from the post-baseline value (Day 8).</description>

    <measure>Maximum and Weighted Mean Change From Baseline in Plasma Glucose Concentrations Over a 24 Hour (h) Period on Day 7</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Day -1) and Day 7 of each treatment period</time_frame>
    <description>Baseline was defined as the time matched assessment done on Day -1. Change from baseline was calculated by subtracting the baseline (Day -1) time matched values from the post-baseline value (Day 8). Data is reported for fasting glucose level and for weighted mean and maximum values for fasting, 0-4 h, 4-10 h, 10-14 h and 0-24 h. Area under the curve (AUC) with respect to these time interval was calculated using the linear trapezoidal rule by the sum of the areas between each chronological pair of assessments (using observed times). The weighted mean was then determined by dividing the AUC by the observed length of the collection interval (time of last assessment - time of first assessment in h). Analysis was done using analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model where, change from baseline was summation of baseline, period, sequence and treatment. Participants were fitted as a random effect.</description>

             objectives, based on a medical evaluation including medical history, physical
             examination, vital signs and laboratory tests.

          -  Female subjects of non-childbearing potential. Non-childbearing potential is defined
             as: Pre-menopausal females with a documented tubal ligation or hysterectomy [for this
             definition, &quot;documented&quot; refers to the outcome of the investigator's/designee's review
             of the subject's medical history for study eligibility, as obtained via a verbal
             interview with the subject or from the subject's medical records]. Postmenopausal
             defined as 12 months of spontaneous amenorrhea. In questionable cases a blood sample
             with simultaneous follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) &gt; 40 milli international units
             (MIU)/mL and estradiol &lt; 40 picograms (pg)/mL (&lt;147 picomole [pmol]/liter [L]) is

             is in doubt will be required to use one of the acceptable contraception methods if
             they wish to continue their HRT during the study. Otherwise, they must discontinue HRT
             to allow confirmation of post-menopausal status prior to study enrollment. For most
             forms of HRT, at least 2 to 4 weeks will elapse between the cessation of therapy and
             the blood draw; this interval depends on the type and dosage of HRT. Following
             confirmation of their post-menopausal status, they can resume use of HRT during the
             study without use of a contraceptive method.

          -  Male subjects with female partners of child-bearing potential must agree to use one of
             the acceptable contraception methods. This criterion must be followed from the time of
             the first dose of study medication until follow up visit.

             subclinical megaloblastic anemia (e.g., increased mean corpuscular volume with low red
             blood cells count and/or haemoglobin level).

          -  Current or relevant previous significant medical disorder that may require treatment
             or make the subject unlikely to fully complete the study, or any condition that, in
             the opinion of the investigator, presents undue risk from the study medication or
             procedures.

          -  Thyroid Disease: Uncorrected Thyroid Dysfunction: Fasting plasma thyroid stimulating
             hormone (TSH) outside of the normal range, as determined at the screening visit;
             Subjects on stable thyroid replacement therapy and with TSH in the normal range are
             eligible if approved by the GSK Medical Monitor; Unevaluated thyroid nodule or goiter
             at Screening.

          -  History of regular alcohol consumption within 6 months of the study defined as: An
             average weekly intake of &gt;14 drinks for males or &gt;7 drinks for females. One drink is
             equivalent to 12 g of alcohol: 12 ounces (360 mL) of beer, 5 ounces (150 mL) of wine
             or 1.5 ounces (45 mL) of 80 proof distilled spirits.

          -  History of sensitivity to heparin or heparin-induced thrombocytopenia.

          -  History of sensitivity to any of the study medications, or components thereof or a
             history of drug or other allergy that, in the opinion of the investigator or GSK
             Medical Monitor, contraindicates their participation

          -  CRITERIA BASED UPON DIAGNOSTIC ASSESSMENTS:

          -  Alanine transaminase, alkaline phosphatase and bilirubin &gt; 1.5x upper limit of normal
             (ULN) (isolated bilirubin &gt;1.5xULN is acceptable if bilirubin is fractionated and
             direct bilirubin &lt;35%).

          -  Based on averaged QTcF values of triplicate ECGs obtained at least 1 minute apart
             within approximately 15 minutes: QTcF &gt;=450 msec; or QTcF &gt;=480 msec in subjects with
             Bundle Branch Block (subjects with left bundle branch block are excluded)

          -  A positive pre-study Hepatitis B surface antigen or positive Hepatitis C antibody

          -  A positive pre-study drug/alcohol urine screen

          -  A subject with a positive urine cotinine test result will be excluded from the study
             unless in the judgment of the Investigator the subject will be able to abstain from
             using tobacco for the duration of the in-house periods of the study.

          -  OTHER CRITERIA

          -  Where participation in the study would result in donation of blood or blood products
             in excess of 500 mL within a 56 day period.

          -  The subject has participated in a clinical trial and has received an investigational
             product within the following time period prior to the first dosing day in the current
             study: 30 days, 5 half-lives or twice the duration of the biological effect of the
             investigational product (whichever is longer).

          -  Exposure to more than four new chemical entities within 12 months prior to the first
             dosing day.

          -  A subject with a fasting plasma glucose at Day -1 that is more than 100 mg/dL lower
             than at screening must not be randomized, unless on a repeat test the value less than
             100 mg/dL of the screening value.

        <description>12-lead ECG assessments were obtained pre-dose at Day 1, Day 3, Day 8 (before discharge) and Follow-up. The assessments were done using an ECG machine that automatically calculated the heart rate and measures PQ, QRS, QT, and QTc(B) intervals. Abnormal ECG findings (clinically significant or not clinically significant) were categorized. The abnormal PCI range for T2DM participants include QTc interval of &gt;450 to &lt;=480 milliseconds (msec) and increase from Baseline QTc interval of &gt; 30 to &lt;=60 msec, PR interval &lt;110 and &gt;220 msec and QRS interval &lt;75 and &gt;110 msec. ECG abnormalities were categorized as clinically significant or not clinically significant based on PCI criteria and judgment of the investigator. Baseline was defined as the mean of three replicate assessments at pre-dose on Day 1.</description>

        <description>The BSFR Scale assessed stool quality using a 7-point scale, where 1=separate hard lumps like nuts (difficult to pass) and 7=watery, no solid pieces (entirely liquid). Bristol Stool Form Scale Rating: 1=separate hard lumps, like nuts, 2=sausage shaped but lumpy, 3=like a sausage or snake but with cracks on its surface, 4=like a sausage or snake, smooth and soft, 5=soft blobs with clear cut edges, 6=fluffy pieces with ragged edges, a mushy stool, 7=watery, no solid pieces. Data is reported for number of events in participants with each category of BSFR scale across Day 1 to 7 post morning dose.</description>

        <description>The impact of gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms on health-related quality of life was assessed using the GSRS. The GSRS is a 15-item related to abdominal pain, reflux, indigestion, diarrhea and constipation syndromes, self-administered questionnaire that assesses the impact of gastrointestinal symptoms during the past week on a scale from 1 (no discomfort at all) to 7 (very severe discomfort). Overall GSRS is the mean of questions 1-15 and range from 1 to 7, with lower scores indicating a better quality of life with respect to gastrointestinal symptoms. Baseline was defined as the assessment done on Day -1. Change from baseline was calculated by subtracting the baseline (Day -1) values from the post-baseline value (Day 8).</description>

        <title>Maximum and Weighted Mean Change From Baseline in Plasma Glucose Concentrations Over a 24 Hour (h) Period on Day 7</title>
        <description>Baseline was defined as the time matched assessment done on Day -1. Change from baseline was calculated by subtracting the baseline (Day -1) time matched values from the post-baseline value (Day 8). Data is reported for fasting glucose level and for weighted mean and maximum values for fasting, 0-4 h, 4-10 h, 10-14 h and 0-24 h. Area under the curve (AUC) with respect to these time interval was calculated using the linear trapezoidal rule by the sum of the areas between each chronological pair of assessments (using observed times). The weighted mean was then determined by dividing the AUC by the observed length of the collection interval (time of last assessment – time of first assessment in h). Analysis was done using analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model where, change from baseline was summation of baseline, period, sequence and treatment. Participants were fitted as a random effect.</description>

            <description>Participants received oral dose of metformin 850 mg tablet BID for 7 days plus matching placebo to GSK2330672 tablet BID for 7 days in a sequence of treatment A/B or B/A according to a plan of randomization. Treatment periods were separated by a washout period of 13 to 15 days in which participants continued metformin 850 mg tablet BID. After completion of the double blind treatment period 2 (after the last dose of period 2), participants received oral dose of metformin 850 mg tablet BID for 7-10 days of Follow-up.</description>

          <title>Maximum and Weighted Mean Change From Baseline in Plasma Glucose Concentrations Over a 24 Hour (h) Period on Day 7</title>
          <description>Baseline was defined as the time matched assessment done on Day -1. Change from baseline was calculated by subtracting the baseline (Day -1) time matched values from the post-baseline value (Day 8). Data is reported for fasting glucose level and for weighted mean and maximum values for fasting, 0-4 h, 4-10 h, 10-14 h and 0-24 h. Area under the curve (AUC) with respect to these time interval was calculated using the linear trapezoidal rule by the sum of the areas between each chronological pair of assessments (using observed times). The weighted mean was then determined by dividing the AUC by the observed length of the collection interval (time of last assessment – time of first assessment in h). Analysis was done using analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model where, change from baseline was summation of baseline, period, sequence and treatment. Participants were fitted as a random effect.</description>

        <title>AUC From Time 0 to 10 h (AUC 0-10 h) of Metformin in Presence of GSK2330672 or Placebo on Day 7</title>
        <description>AUC(0-10) for metformin when co-dosed with GSK2330672 or placebo is defined as the the area under the plasma concentration-time curve from time 0 to 10 h. It was determined using the linear trapezoidal rule for increasing concentrations and the logarithmic trapezoidal rule for decreasing concentrations. Blood samples were collected at 0 h (pre-dose within 15 min of dose and began eating breakfast immediately after taking study drug and finished eating in 15 min), 0.25 h, 0.50 h, 1 h, 2 h, 3 h, 4 h (pre-lunch), 5 h, 5.5 h, 6 h, 8 h and 10 h (pre-dinner) on Day 7. Analysis was done using a mixed effects model with fixed effect terms for treatment, period, and sequence. Participant within sequence was fitted as a random effect in the model.</description>

          <title>AUC From Time 0 to 10 h (AUC 0-10 h) of Metformin in Presence of GSK2330672 or Placebo on Day 7</title>
          <description>AUC(0-10) for metformin when co-dosed with GSK2330672 or placebo is defined as the the area under the plasma concentration-time curve from time 0 to 10 h. It was determined using the linear trapezoidal rule for increasing concentrations and the logarithmic trapezoidal rule for decreasing concentrations. Blood samples were collected at 0 h (pre-dose within 15 min of dose and began eating breakfast immediately after taking study drug and finished eating in 15 min), 0.25 h, 0.50 h, 1 h, 2 h, 3 h, 4 h (pre-lunch), 5 h, 5.5 h, 6 h, 8 h and 10 h (pre-dinner) on Day 7. Analysis was done using a mixed effects model with fixed effect terms for treatment, period, and sequence. Participant within sequence was fitted as a random effect in the model.</description>
