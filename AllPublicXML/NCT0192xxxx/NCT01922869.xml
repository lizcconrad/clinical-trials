  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The era of general dietary recommendations for the whole population may be coming to an end,
      as it is becoming apparent that we are all unique and do not respond in the same way to the
      same foods. Within a decade it is believed that doctors will be able to take profiles of
      their patients, identify specific diseases for which they are at risk and create personalised
      nutrition plans accordingly. At the University of East Anglia, UK the investigators are
      interested in particular food compounds known as flavonoids which can be found in foods such
      as chocolate, orange juice and blackberries (COB). The study will determine if factors such
      as age, gender, genetics and the bacteria present in our guts contribute to variability
      between individuals in their absorption, metabolism and excretion of flavonoids.

      The study will recruit men and women who are aged either 18-30 or 65-77 years and are
      generally healthy.On arriving at the study day we will collect a blood sample. Breakfast will
      then be supplied in the form of a food or drink that will contain freezedried powder from
      orange juice, chocolate and blackberry. After breakfast further blood samples will be taken
      at several time points throughout the day. Urine and faeces samples will also be collected.
      These biological samples will be tested for flavonoid absorption, metabolism and excretion as
      well as influence of genetic make-up of individuals and the gut microflora harboured in
      faecal samples.

    <description>Concentrations of flavonoid metabolites will be assessed using state-of-the-art liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) and quantified against commercially available standards. Serum and urine will be acidified and then extracted by solid phase extraction (SPE). Metabolite identification will be performed using a QTrap 4000 linear ion trap mass spectrometer (ABSciex, Canada) by multi-reaction monitoring (MRM) optimized for the detection of pure standards. Metabolites will be confirmed on the basis of retention time and parent-daughter ion fragmentation transitions.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Genes involved in flavonoid metabolism</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Candidate genes encoding proteins involved in the flavonoid metabolism pathway will be identified from the literature and available pathway databases such as gene ontology, gene network, KEGG. Putative functional SNPs within these genes will be identified from the literature and/or online tools such genepipe and polyphen. In addition tag SNPs will be identified across the selected genes. This approach will involve the genotyping of approximately 200 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). Genotyping of these SNPs will be performed with the MassARRAY and iPlex systems of the Sequenom genotyping platform (Sequenom, San Diego, CA), which uses the MALDITOF primer extension assay. The associations of these SNPs and flavonoid metabolism will them be investigated.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Effect of gut microbiota on flavonoid metabolism</measure>
    <time_frame>18 months</time_frame>
    <description>We will determine the effects of gut-microbiota variation on flavonoid metabolism. To do this, we will collect faecal samples and determine gut-microflora using faecal bacterial phylogenetic analysis using PCR to amplify 16S rDNA genes.</description>
