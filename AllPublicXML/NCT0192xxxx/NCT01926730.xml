  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The proposed study is a randomized controlled trial of a limited restriction diet compared to
      a regular diet among patients with Crohn's disease (CD) in remission. At baseline, patients
      will complete a semi-quantitative food frequency questionnaire assessing usual dietary
      patterns over the preceding month. Disease activity will be assessed with the abbreviated
      Crohn's Disease Activity Index (aCDAI)59. Self-reported disease status will be assessed
      during follow-up using an internet-based questionnaire. Repeat assessment of adherence to the
      study diets will be assessed with food frequency questionnaires (FFQs) administered after 20
      weeks. Follow-up duration will be for 48 weeks. Statistical analysis will compare the time to
      relapse using Cox regression for patients in the two study arms. In the exploratory aim, we
      will compare outcomes among patients in the highest tertile for other food items and
      nutrients to those in the lowest tertile based on self-reported usual dietary patterns at
      baseline. Thus, the study population will be analyzed both as a randomized controlled trial
      and as a prospective cohort study.

    <description>Relapse of CD is defined as an increase in the aCDAI by &gt;=60 points and to &gt;150. Additionally, undergoing CD surgery or starting any new CD medication (steroids, mesalamine, azathioprine, methotrexate, anti-Tumor Necrosis Factor α (anti-TNF), anti-α4) for the treatment of CD symptoms during the interval between two visits will be considered to have identified a clinical relapse.</description>
