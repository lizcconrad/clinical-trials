  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Docetaxel is currently one of standard second-line therapy in patients with gastric cancer.
      As angiogenesis and FGFR pathway has been suggested to be associated with gastric cancer,
      dovitinib, dual VEGFR and FGFR inhibitor, may have the potential to improve the outcomes of
      patients with gastric cancer. Therefore, we investigated the combination regimen of docetaxel
      and dovitinib.
