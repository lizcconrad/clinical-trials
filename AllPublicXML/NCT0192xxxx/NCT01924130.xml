  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to develop and evaluate the effects of a school breakfast policy
      initiative (SBPI) on the incidence of overweight and obesity as well as breakfast patterns
      (both inside and outside of school) among 4th-6th grade children. The study integrates
      research, education and extension to promote healthy breakfast consumption among low-income
      children in urban schools and will leverage ongoing SNAP-Ed and the School Breakfast Program
      efforts.

      Policy makers have promoted school breakfast participation as a tool to help prevent
      childhood obesity. No randomized controlled trials have examined the effects of a school
      breakfast feeding program on obesity. We propose to develop and evaluate a School Breakfast
      Policy Initiative (SBPI) that combines classroom feeding, in-school nutrition education,
      social marketing and parent outreach. Specifically, we will promote the benefits of a healthy
      breakfast at school or home and deter buying &quot;breakfast&quot; at corner stores where purchases are
      high in energy, solid fats and added sugars. This intervention will be evaluated in the &quot;real
      world&quot; of urban schools that make frequent use of the SNAP-Ed and the School Breakfast
      Program. The specific aims are:

        1. To develop the SBPI intervention within the context of SNAP Ed and the National School
           Breakfast Program in the School District of Philadelphia.

        2. To conduct a pilot feasibility study among 4 schools (2 intervention and 2 control) to
           assess feasibility and acceptability.

        3. To compare participants in the intervention (n=8) and comparison schools (n=8) on the
           incidence of overweight and obesity. We predict that intervention schools, compared to
           the comparison schools, will have a significantly lower incidence rate of overweight and
           obesity over a 2 y period.

        4. To compare participants in the intervention (n=8) and comparison schools (n=8) on eating
           one breakfast. We predict that intervention schools, compared to the comparison schools,
           will have significantly greater percentage of children eating one breakfast per day over
           a 2 y period.
