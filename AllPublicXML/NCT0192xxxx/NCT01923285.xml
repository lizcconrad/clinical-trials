    <description>The AXIUM Neurostimulator System is an investigational spinal cord stimulation device that is designed to stimulate the dorsal root ganglion (DRG) of the spine located on the back surface of the spinal cord where nerves exit the backbone. The device has 2 parts that are placed surgically (implanted) : 1) a pulse generator which is placed under the skin in the buttocks or abdomen, and 2) up to four wires (leads) that have one end attached to the pulse generator, and the other end secured to the tissue near the target treatment area.</description>

             causalgia

          5. Subjects have a minimum Visual Analog Scale (VAS) greater than or equal to 60 mm in
             the area of greatest pain in the lower limbs.

             treatments from at least 2 different drugs classes

          7. Subject has had stable neurologic function in the past 30 days

          8. In the opinion of the Investigator, the subject is psychologically appropriate for the

          9. Subject is able to provide written informed consent

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Back pain is the greatest region of pain as measured on the baseline VAS.

          2. Female subject of childbearing potential is pregnant/nursing, plans to become pregnant
             or is unwilling to use approved birth control

          3. Subject has exhibited escalating or changing pain condition within the past 30 days as
             evidenced by Investigator examination

          4. Subject is currently involved in medically related litigation, including workers
             compensation

          5. Subject has had corticosteroid therapy at an intended site of stimulation within the
             past 30 days

          6. Subject's pain medication(s) dosage(s) are not stable for at least 30 days

             within the past 3 months

          8. Subject has previously failed spinal cord stimulation therapy

          9. Subject currently has an active implantable device including implantable cardioverter
             defibrillator, pacemaker, spinal cord stimulator or intrathecal drug pump or subject
             requires magnetic resonance imaging (MRIs) or diathermy

         10. Subject has pain only within a cervical distribution

         11. Subject has cognitive, physical or sensory impairment that, in the opinion of the
