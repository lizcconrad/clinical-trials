      To evaluate the effects of intravitreal ranibizumab (IVR) as adjunctive treatment for
      trabeculectomy with mitomycin C (TMC) in neovascular glaucoma (NVG).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective study of 15 consecutive eyes from 14 patients (One patients had NVG in
      both eyes at presentation.) with NVG presented at the Department of Ophthalmology, Faculty of
      Medicine Siriraj Hospital, Mahidol University, Bangkok, Thailand between December 2008 and
      December 2009. Each eye received IVR (0.5 mg/0.05 ml) 1 week before TMC. Trabeculectomy was
      performed with fornix-based conjunctival flap method.

    <description>The change of intraocular pressure (IOP)between before trabeculectomy with mitomycin C (TMC) and after TMC. We compared this change at several time points such as at 6, 12 months and at last visit. The most important is the change of IOP between before TMC and at last visit as well as the level of IOP at last visit which is at of the longest follow-up time.</description>
