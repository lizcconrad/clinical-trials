  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Worldwide rates of obesity have doubled in the last 30 years, and obesity has been associated
      as a risk factor for hospital-acquired infections and increased occurrence of death in
      critically-ill patients. Piperacillin/tazobactam is a commonly prescribed antibiotic for
      critically ill patients with an infection, however, limited information exists for dosing
      this drug in obese patients. In these limited reports, standard doses of
      piperacillin/tazobactam given to the small number of obese patients resulted in lower blood
      concentrations, which could lead to inadequate killing of bacteria. The purpose of this study
      is to compare blood concentrations from standard piperacillin/tazobactam dosing compared to
      higher dosing regimens in obese patients. This study will also include information on the
      safety and tolerability of the higher dose regimens. The study investigators believe that the
      higher dosing regimen will produce adequate blood levels in obese patients and will not add
      any more risk of harm to obese patients receiving this higher dose.
