    <textblock>
      Regular aerobic physical activity in short-term moderate asthma and severe:

        -  Reduce the levels of inflammatory mediators

        -  Improves functional capacity

        -  Improves Quality of Life

        -  Improved lung function

        -  Reduces the sensation of dyspnea

        -  Improves symptoms scores and medication use

      Methods: Is designed a randomized clinical trial, efficacy, outpatient physical therapy
      developed in the Institute of Integrative Medicine Teacher Fernando Figueira (IMIP). A pilot
      study with 20 participants will be made initially to obtain a sample calculation.
      Subjectively estimated it will take about 50 participants, with possible losses. Will include
      children older than eight years, diagnosis of moderate and severe persistent asthma according
      to criteria of Global Initiative National Asthma (GINA) and forced expiratory volume in one
      minute (FEV1) below 80% predicted. Will be excluded from the study associated with disease
      that limits physical activity, such as neuromuscular diseases, congenital or acquired heart
      disease, chronic lung disease associated exacerbation of the crisis and significant cognitive
      deficit, which makes the participant to respond adequately to the questionnaire and / or
      inability to meet the commands. Eligible patients will be randomized into two groups: control
      group, which is not subjected to any kind of exercise and the intervention group, which will
      be submitted to aerobic exercise for 30 minutes three times a week for six weeks. The two
      groups will be evaluated before and at the end of six weeks by testing for 6-minute walk,
      analysis of dyspnea, questionnaire of quality of life, pulmonary function test (FEV1, FVC),
      inflammatory markers (cytokine ).

    <description>The study will consist of two groups: Group Comparison (GC) will be submitted to two evaluations at the beginning of a week and end of 6 weeks, without receiving any kind of physical training intervention. Group Training (GT) will undergo two assessments at the beginning of the end of the 1st and 6th week, however will be submitted to aerobic training for six weeks. Supervised aerobic training will be held three times a week for six weeks,treadmill in four consecutive steps each (05 minutes stretching, 05 minutes heating, 20 training minutes (1 st and 2 nd week) and 30 minutes (3 rd to 6 weeks) and cool down 05 minutes). The exercise intensity will be maintained through a desired percentage of heart rate for training (x%) from 70% to 80%, obtaining then the optimal heart rate training.</description>
