      and rosuvastatin in healthy male volunteers.

    <textblock>
      After subjects have signed informed consent voluntarily, they go through screening period for
      within 21 days.

      As period I, subjects of Part A take fimasartan for 7 days and subjects of Part B take
      rosuvastatin for 7 days.

      And then, after wash out for 7 days, as period II, subjects of both Part A and B take
      fimasartan and rosuvastatin for 7 days.

      At each period, subjects of Part A have blood sampling 2nd, 4th, 6th day before medication,
      7th day before and 0.25, 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 24, 36, and 48hour after
      medication(17 times in each period, 34 times in total).

      At each period, subjects of Part B have blood sampling 2nd, 4th, 6th day before medication,
      7th day before and 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 5, 8, 12, 24, 48 and 72hour after medication(17
      times in each period, 34 times in total).

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Healthy male subject, aged 20- 55 years at screening.

          2. Body weight of ≥ 50 kg and within ± 20% of ideal body weight (IBW)(kg) = {height (cm)
             - 100} * 0.9

          3. No abnormal symptom or sign, based on medical history and physical examination, with
             no congenital or chronic disease that requires treatment

          4. Subject that is considered appropriate for participating in the study by an
             investigator, based on clinical laboratory test (serology, hematology, clinical
             chemistry, urinalysis) and ECG, performed within 3 weeks prior to administration of
             study drug

          5. Subjects must be able to listen to and understand the detailed statement of informed
             consent, and willing to decide to participate in the study, follow the study
             directions and provide written informed consent

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. History of clinically significant hypersensitivity to study drug, any other drug or
             additives (yellow no.5).

          2. History of any illness that may affect the absorption, distribution, metabolism or
             excretion (hepatobiliary, renal, cardiovascular, endocrine (e.g., hypothyroidism),
             respiratory, gastrointestinal, hemato-oncology, central nervous system, psychiatric
             and musculoskeletal system)

          3. Hypotension (systolic ≤ 100 mmHg or diastolic ≤ 65 mmHg) or hypertension (systolic ≥
             140 mmHg or diastolic ≥ 90 mmHg), measured at screening

         10. Use of any prescribed drugs or herbal remedies within 2 weeks, or use of any
             over-the-counter medication within 1 week prior to the first administration of study
             drug, and this will affect this study or the safety of the subjects in the opinion of
             the investigator

         11. Participation in any other study within 3 months prior to the first administration of
             study drug (The finish time of previous study is the day of the last administration of

         12. Donation of whole blood within 2 months prior to the first administration of study
             drug, or donation of any blood products within 1 month prior to the first
             administration of study drug

         13. Abnormal diet that may affect absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion of
             drugs (*e.g., Grapefruit juice ≥ 1L /day within 7 days prior to administration of
             study drug)

         14. Positive serologic tests (HBsAg, HCV Ab, HIV Ag/Ab, VDRL)

         15. Subject that is judged inappropriate for participating in the study by an
