      The purpose of this study is to try to correlate vitamin D dosing and dosing adjustment with
      Vitamin D levels, measure affects of seizure medications on levels as well as pathologic
      fractures and bone density in severely cognitively impaired, non-mobile children and
      adolescents with CP.
