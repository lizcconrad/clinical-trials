  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to assess the performance and safety of the Optiflow
      Anastomotic Connector (Optiflow) when used to facilitate the creation of autogenous
      arteriovenous fistula (AVF) anastomoses.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigation is designed as a multi-center, prospective, single-arm, clinical study of
      the Optiflow performance and safety in a maximum of 180 subjects which includes one (1)
      roll-in subjects per investigator (maximum of 36 roll-in subjects). Subjects will be followed
      at 14 days post-procedure, 42 days post-procedure, and 90 days post-procedures.

      Results will be compared to a pre-established performance goal.

      Up to fifteen (15) investigational sites will participate in the investigational study.

      The primary performance endpoint is the overall maturation percentage rate at 90 days.
      Maturation is defined as an access site which achieves a diameter of greater or equal to 4 mm
      and blood flow greater or equal t0 500 mL/min as measured via duplex ultrasound.

      The primary safety endpoint is a composite endpoint of serious adverse events known to be
      associated with arteriovenous fistula anastomosis surgical procedures through 90 days.
