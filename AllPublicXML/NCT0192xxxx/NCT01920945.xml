      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect of BOTOX® (OnabotulinumtoxinA) on the
      number of headache days in patients with New Daily Persistent Headache (NDPH). NDPH is a
      benign form of chronic daily headache that comes in two forms: one that resolves on its own
      after months to years, or one that is difficult to treat and does not respond to preventive
      or abortive medications. Some patients experience migrainous features such as nausea,
      vomiting, photophobia, or phonophobia. BOTOX®, a treatment approved for chronic migraine,
      will be injected into specific muscles of the head and neck area by your study doctor, to
      evaluate its effectiveness in reducing or relieving NDPH days or severity. BOTOX has not been
      approved for NDPH and this is the first time it will be used for treatment of NDPH. All
      participants in this study will only receive BOTOX® and no other study drug.

    <description>155 units of OnabotulinumtoxinA, will be injected into 31 sites in the head and neck every 12 weeks for a total of 24 weeks using a sterile 30-gauge, 0.5 inch needle as 0.1 mL (5 Units) injections per each site. Injections will be divided across seven specific head/neck muscle areas (corrugator, procerus, frontalis, temporalis, suboccipital, splenius capitus and medial/lateral occipital, and trapezius).</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

        Subjects aged 18 or older, male or female of any race with the diagnosis of NDPH meeting
        International Classification of Headache Disorders (ICHD-2) criteria will be included in
        the study. The criteria is as follows:

        A. Persistent headache fulfilling criteria B and C B. Distinct and clearly remembered
        onset, with pain becoming continuous and unremitting within 24 hours C. Present for &gt;3
        months D. Not better accounted for by another ICHD-3 diagnosis

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Those with relevant physical or psychological illness, particularly conditions that
             might put them at risk if exposed to OnabotulinumtoxinA (myasthenia gravis,
             Eaton-Lambert syndrome, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, or any other neuromuscular
             disease).

          2. Diagnosis of other primary/secondary headache disorder.

          3. Psychiatric disorders that could interfere with study participation.

          4. Subjects who abuse drugs, including headache treatments and alcohol (DSM IV criteria).

          5. Those allergic to compounds similar to the study medication.

          6. Those who are pregnant or breastfeeding, or who do not use adequate contraceptive
             methods.

          7. Those who have had any prior exposure to any botulinum toxin serotype.
