  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether micronized dehydrated human amniotic
      membrane (dHACM) suspension is more effective in reducing inflammation than conservative
      measures alone when used to treat acute/early lateral epicondylitis.
