  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this clinical research study is to learn if taking Promacta (eltrombopag) will
      help your platelet count improve faster after your stem cell transplant. The safety of this
      drug will also be studied.

      This is an investigational study. Eltrombopag is FDA approved and commercially available for
      the treatment of low platelet counts in patients with idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura
      (ITP -- a severe bleeding disease). Its use in patients with low platelet counts after a stem
      cell transplant is investigational.

      Up to 60 patients will take part in this study. All will be enrolled at MD Anderson.

      Study Drug Administration:

      If you agree to take part in this study, you will take eltrombopag by mouth 1 time each day
      for up to 60 days. The study drug should be taken on an empty stomach (1 hour before or 2
      hours after food/drink). You may drink water, coffee, and/or tea with the study drug. Do not
      use any milk or cream in your coffee or tea. If you vomit the drug within 30 minutes of
      taking, the dose should be repeated.

      If you will have a cord blood transplant, you will start taking eltrombopag 1 day before your
      transplant (Day -1).

      If you will have (or have had) a haploidentical transplant, you will start taking eltrombopag
      5 days after your transplant (Day +5).

      Study Visits:

      You will be admitted to the hospital as part of your transplant and during your stay blood
      will be drawn daily as standard transplant care to check your blood counts, kidney and liver
      functions. Once you are discharged, you will be seen as an outpatient 1-3 times per week as
      standard post-transplant care.

      Blood (about 1 tablespoon) will be drawn once a week while you are taking eltrombopag, and
      then once a week for 4 weeks after the last dose of eltrombopag to check your blood counts,
      kidney, and liver function.

      About 1, 2, 3, 6, and 12 months after your transplant, blood (about 5 tablespoons) will be
      drawn to check your immune system.

      If you have a blood and/or platelet transfusion, research staff will record the number of
      transfusions you receive during the study.

      Length of Study:

      You will be on study for about 1 year. You will be taken off study early if your platelet
      count becomes too high, if you have any intolerable side effects, if you are unable to follow
      study directions, if your doctor thinks it is in your best interest, or if you choose to
      leave the study early.
