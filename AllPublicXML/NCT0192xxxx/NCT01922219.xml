  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to learn whether specific types of brain imaging and
      psychological testing can predict how much benefit patients with depression will receive from
      a well-studied psychotherapy for depression, called cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), and
      how the brain imaging and psychological tests change with treatment. We will also be
      comparing brain scans from this study between individuals suffering from depression and
      volunteers without depression.

      This study offers 14 sessions of one-on-one cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) over twelve
      weeks, administered by an experienced doctoral-level psychologist or psychiatrist.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Major depressive disorder (MDD) affects 13.1 - 14.2 million American adults annually.
      Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) is a structured psychotherapy that has been demonstrated
      in multiple studies to be an effective treatment for MDD. Not all patients achieve a full
      remission from MDD with CBT, however. Mental health clinicians currently lack clinical or
      biological markers that can reliably predict treatment outcome with CBT for MDD. Developing
      such markers could greatly improve clinical outcomes, and could facilitate matching of
      patients to treatments that are likely to help them. A recent functional magnetic resonance
      imaging (fMRI) study in healthy individuals examined the neural correlates of cognitive
      strategies to regulate emotional responses to emotional stimuli. The emotional regulation
      techniques used in this fMRI study map closely onto the cognitive restructuring techniques
      that are a primary tool used in CBT for MDD. There is evidence that patients with depression
      may benefit most from a psychotherapy that draws on their existing strengths. We therefore
      propose to examine the neural representations of emotion regulation as a predictor of
      treatment outcome with CBT for MDD. We will recruit subjects with MDD in a current major
      depressive episode. Research participants will complete baseline psychological and biological
      assessments, including MRI and functional MRI imaging. Following scanning, subjects will
      receive 14 sessions of individual CBT for depression over 12 weeks, administered by an
      experienced psychiatrist or psychologist. Baseline assessments will be examined as predictors
      of treatment outcome with CBT for depression.

    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The primary outcome of this study is remission from depression at the conclusion of 12 weeks of cognitive behavioral therapy for depression. This will be assessed using the Beck Depression Inventory, a self-report questionnaire of symptoms of depression that will be administered at every treatment visit. Remission is defined by a final Beck Depression Inventory score less than or equal to 10.</description>

    <measure>Post-Treatment Beck Depression Inventory</measure>
    <time_frame>Post-Treatment, up to 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Beck Depression Inventory is a self-report measure of depression severity that is a well-characterized scale with excellent psychometric properties and is frequently used in research studies of depression.
The scale measures symptoms related to sadness, pessimism, past failure, loss of pleasure, guilty feelings, punishment feelings, self-dislike, self-criticalness, suicidal thoughts or wishes, crying, agitation, loss of interest, indecisiveness, worthlessness, loss of energy, changes in sleeping pattern, irritability, changes in appetite, concentration difficulty, tiredness or fatigue, and loss of interest in sex.
We report the total score on the BDI, which has a range of 0 to 63. Higher values represent greater severity of depression. The following score interpretations are provided in the scale's manual:
0-9 minimal depression 10-18 mild depression 19-29 moderate depression 30-63 severe depression</description>

    <measure>Final Score on the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Post-Treatment, up to 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Final score on the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS) was calculated for 37 patients who were treated with Cognitive Behavioral Therapy.
The 17-item HDRS is a clinician-administered scale that quantifies depression severity, and includes items assessing mood, suicidal thinking, insomnia, feelings of guilt, work and activities, somatic symptoms, and insight. It is a well-characterized scale with excellent psychometric properties. The total score is the sum of the individual scores of the 17 scale items. Higher scores indicate greater depression severity. When using this outcome measure, we covary for baseline HDRS scores. Published norms for interpretation of the 17-item HDRS use a different version of the scale with a total possible score of 52, and are listed below. Interpretation is comparable (but not identical) with the 17-item HDRS version used in this study, which has a maximum score is 51.
None: 0-7 Mild: 8-13 Moderate: 14-19 Severe: 20-25 Very Severe: 26-52</description>

        <description>The primary outcome of this study is remission from depression at the conclusion of 12 weeks of cognitive behavioral therapy for depression. This will be assessed using the Beck Depression Inventory, a self-report questionnaire of symptoms of depression that will be administered at every treatment visit. Remission is defined by a final Beck Depression Inventory score less than or equal to 10.</description>

        <title>Post-Treatment Beck Depression Inventory</title>
        <description>The Beck Depression Inventory is a self-report measure of depression severity that is a well-characterized scale with excellent psychometric properties and is frequently used in research studies of depression.
The scale measures symptoms related to sadness, pessimism, past failure, loss of pleasure, guilty feelings, punishment feelings, self-dislike, self-criticalness, suicidal thoughts or wishes, crying, agitation, loss of interest, indecisiveness, worthlessness, loss of energy, changes in sleeping pattern, irritability, changes in appetite, concentration difficulty, tiredness or fatigue, and loss of interest in sex.
We report the total score on the BDI, which has a range of 0 to 63. Higher values represent greater severity of depression. The following score interpretations are provided in the scale’s manual:
0-9 minimal depression 10-18 mild depression 19-29 moderate depression 30-63 severe depression</description>

        <title>Final Score on the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale</title>
        <description>Final score on the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS) was calculated for 37 patients who were treated with Cognitive Behavioral Therapy.
The 17-item HDRS is a clinician-administered scale that quantifies depression severity, and includes items assessing mood, suicidal thinking, insomnia, feelings of guilt, work and activities, somatic symptoms, and insight. It is a well-characterized scale with excellent psychometric properties. The total score is the sum of the individual scores of the 17 scale items. Higher scores indicate greater depression severity. When using this outcome measure, we covary for baseline HDRS scores. Published norms for interpretation of the 17-item HDRS use a different version of the scale with a total possible score of 52, and are listed below. Interpretation is comparable (but not identical) with the 17-item HDRS version used in this study, which has a maximum score is 51.
