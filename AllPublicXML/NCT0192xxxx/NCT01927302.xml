  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the effects of treatment for specific language
      deficits in people with aphasia. In addition to language and cognitive measures, changes in
      brain function will also be gathered before and after the treatment is administered in order
      to track any changes resulting from receiving treatment.

      Naming Impairments (Anomia):

      The labs of Dr. Swathi Kiran (Boston University) and Dr. David Caplan (Harvard University,
      Massachusetts General Hospital) will be studying language recovery in adults with anomia
      (naming impairments) following a stroke. Participants will receive treatment focusing on the
      semantic features of common objects (e.g., that birds can fly). The study will examine how
      naming and other language abilities change in response to treatment, as well as how the brain
      changes, as measured by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and other techniques.

      Spelling/Writing Impairments (Dysgraphia):

      At Johns Hopkins University, the lab of Dr. Brenda Rapp will investigate the neurobiology of
      language recovery in individuals with dysgraphia (spelling/writing impairments) resulting
      from a stroke. In this study, treatment will focus on improving spelling ability. The study
      will examine how spelling and other language abilities change in response to treatment, as
      well as how the brain changes, as measured by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and other
      techniques.

      Deficits in Sentence Comprehension &amp; Production:

      Dr. Cynthia Thompson's lab at Northwestern University will investigate language recovery in
      individuals with deficits in sentence production and comprehension. Treatment focuses on
      production and comprehension of complex sentences. At baseline (week 0) and after the
      treatment period (at week 12), participants take part in language, eye-tracking, and MRI
      testing, in order to learn how the processing of language, as well as brain function, changes
      as a result of treatment.
