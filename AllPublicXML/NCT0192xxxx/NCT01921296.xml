  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Many women with breast cancer who are treated with aromatase inhibitor medications develop
      difficulty sleeping and fatigue during treatment. Some examples of aromatase inhibitor
      medications include anastrozole (Arimidex), exemestane (Aromasin), and letrozole (Femara).
      Frequently, sleeping pills do not work very well to improve sleep. Cyclobenzaprine (Flexeril)
      is a medication that was originally developed to treat muscle spasms. It may also improve
      sleep in patients with chronic pain disorders, such as fibromyalgia. In this study we are
      testing to see if cyclobenzaprine at bedtime will help improve sleep in women treated with
      aromatase inhibitors.

    <measure>Number of Patients That Experience an Improvement in Sleep Quality as Assessed Using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) With 8 Weeks of Cyclobenzaprine Therapy.</measure>
    <time_frame>8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Will measure sleep quality using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index at baseline and after 8 weeks of therapy with cyclobenzaprine. A total score is calculated for the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index. The total score ranges from 0-21, with higher scores representing worse sleep quality. Any reduction in PSQI total score was considered an improvement.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Fatigue Between Baseline and Week 8 With Cyclobenzaprine Therapy</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline and 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Will measure fatigue using the PROMIS fatigue questionnaire at baseline and after 8 weeks of therapy with cyclobenzaprine. The PROMIS Fatigue 7a score was calculated according to the information provided on the website. The raw score ranges from 7-35. The raw score is then converted to a T score according to the instruction on the website, with higher scores representing more fatigue. The T score rescales the raw score into a standardized score with a mean of 50 and a standard deviation of 10. The change in fatigue is calculated by subtracting the T score at baseline from the T score at 8 weeks. Positive values represent worsening of fatigue.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Average Pain Between Baseline and Week 8 With Cyclobenzaprine Therapy</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline and 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Will measure average pain using the Brief Pain Inventory at baseline and after 8 weeks of therapy with cyclobenzaprine. On the Brief Pain Inventory, average pain is reported using a 0-10 scale, with higher numbers reflecting more pain. Change is calculated by subtracting pain at baseline is from pain at 8 weeks. A positive value represents an increase in pain.</description>

        <title>Change in Average Pain Between Baseline and Week 8 With Cyclobenzaprine Therapy</title>
        <description>Will measure average pain using the Brief Pain Inventory at baseline and after 8 weeks of therapy with cyclobenzaprine. On the Brief Pain Inventory, average pain is reported using a 0-10 scale, with higher numbers reflecting more pain. Change is calculated by subtracting pain at baseline is from pain at 8 weeks. A positive value represents an increase in pain.</description>
