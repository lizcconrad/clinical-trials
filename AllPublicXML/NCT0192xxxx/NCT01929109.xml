      The purpose of this study is to measure how much of the study drug, LY2409021, gets into the
      blood stream and how long it takes the body to get rid of it when given to participants with
      different levels of kidney function. There are five study groups. Each participant may only
      enroll in one group. Participants in groups 1 through 4 may be healthy or may have mild,
      moderate, or severe kidney disease. They will complete one study period lasting about 29
      days. Study group 5 will enroll participants with kidney disease who are on dialysis. They
      will complete two study periods which together last about 59 days. Screening is required
      within 21 days prior to the start of the study for all participants.
