  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      We propose that the systemic administration of lidocaine following the induction of
      cue-induced craving, relative to saline plus cue-induced craving or lidocaine without
      cue-induced craving, will block the reconsolidation of cue memories. This will lead to a
      reduction in cue-induced craving upon repeated testing as well as subsequent cocaine use and
      basal craving.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cocaine dependence is among the most tenacious of the substance use disorders yet remains one
      of the few lacking an effective pharmacological intervention. As other pharmacologic
      approaches have not been fruitful, new targets are required. A novel treatment approach is to
      disrupt the neural processes involved in cue-related memories (memory links between the
      external stimuli associated with drug use and the subjective drug effect). These engrained
      memories, when reactivated by cues, elicit craving and a return to drug use. Each cue
      re-exposure, however, requires the re-remembering (or reconsolidation) of the drug cue. Key
      molecular processes required for memory reconsolidation are NMDA (N-methyl-D-aspartate)
      receptor activation, the induction of nitric oxide (NO) synthesis and increased extracellular
      signal-regulated kinase (ERK) activity. In rodent models, blocking these processes changes
      the cue-related memory; the cue loses its potency to induce a return to drug
      self-administration. Lidocaine is an FDA approved medication that inhibits activation of NMDA
      receptors and suppresses production of NO and ERK. Lidocaine, like cocaine, is a local
      anesthetic with potent effects as a sodium-channel blocker. Unlike cocaine, lidocaine is
      essentially devoid of activity at monoamine re-uptake transporters and has no rewarding or
      addictive properties. As lidocaine suppresses the molecular processes required for drug cue
      reconsolidation and has relatively specific effects upon the striatal regions necessary for
      drug cue reconsolidation, lidocaine may offer a novel approach for interfering with memory
      reconsolidation. Two other Na+ channel blockers have also decrease craving and/or substance
      use in substance-dependent subjects. We propose that the systemic administration of lidocaine
      following the induction of cue-induced craving, relative to saline plus cue-induced craving
      or lidocaine without cue-induced craving, will block the reconsolidation of cue memories.
      This will lead to a reduction in cue-induced craving upon repeated testing as well as
      subsequent cocaine use and basal craving. If our hypotheses are proven correct, these
      findings will 1) support a role for lidocaine in cocaine addiction treatment, 2) demonstrate
      the feasibility and efficacy of attenuating cue-induced memories, and 3) guide the
      development of a larger study with lidocaine.
