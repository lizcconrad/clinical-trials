  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to compare the efficacy of a combination product
      containing ibuprofen 400 mg and caffeine 100 mg versus either ingredient alone as well as
      placebo for the treatment of post-surgical dental pain over an eight-hour period followed by
      a single dose of study medication (study stage 1). A secondary objective is to evaluate
      efficacy of multiple doses of the combination in comparison to ibuprofen alone over a 5-day
      post-surgical period (study stage 2).

    <measure>Time-weighted Sum of Pain Relief (PAR) and Pain Intensity Difference (PID) From 0 to 8 Hours (SPRID0-8h)</measure>
    <time_frame>0 to 8 hours</time_frame>
    <description>SPRID0-8h: Time-weighted sum of PAR and PID from 0 to 8 hours, score range: -40 (worst) to 112 (best). PI was assessed on a 0-10 numerical pain rating scale (NPRS), where 0=no pain and 10=worst possible pain, pre-dose and at 0.25,0.5,0.75,1,1.5,2,3,4,5, 6,7 and 8 hours; PAR was assessed on a 5-point verbal rating scale (VRS) (0=none to 4=complete) at the same post-dose time points. Time-weights were equal to the elapsed time (hour) between the time point of interest and the preceding time point. All PAR and pain intensity (PI) assessments completed after the patient had taken rescue medication or the second dose of study medication, whichever was first, until hour 8 were considered missing. Last observation carried forward (LOCF) was used with the last completed PI/PAR assessments prior to first rescue/second study medication, whichever was first, to impute missing values up to 8 hours.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Time-weighted Sum of Pain Relief (PAR) and Pain Intensity Difference (PID) From 0 to 2 Hours (SPRID0-2h)</measure>
    <time_frame>0 to 2 hours</time_frame>
    <description>SPRID0-2h: Time-weighted sum of PAR and PID from 0 to 2 hours, score range: -10 (worst) to 28 (best). PI was assessed on a 0-10 numerical pain rating scale (NPRS), where 0=no pain and 10=worst possible pain, pre-dose and at 0.25,0.5,0.75,1,1.5 and 2 hours; PAR was assessed on a 5-point verbal rating scale (VRS) (0=none to 4=complete) at the same post-dose time points. Time-weights were equal to the elapsed time (hour) between the time point of interest and the preceding time point. All PAR and pain intensity (PI) assessments completed after the patient had taken rescue medication or the second dose of study medication, whichever was first, until hour 2 was considered missing. Last observation carried forward (LOCF) was used with the last completed PI/PAR assessments prior to first rescue/second study medication, whichever was first, to impute missing values up to 2 hours.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Duration of Pain Relief</measure>
    <time_frame>8 hours</time_frame>
    <description>Duration of pain relief was defined as the time between the administration of first dose of trial medication and first dose of rescue medication or second dose of trial medication, whichever was first. Duration of pain relief was censored at 8 hours.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Time to Meaningful Pain Relief</measure>
    <time_frame>8 hours</time_frame>
    <description>Time to meaningful pain relief was captured by a stopwatch, which was started by the study staff immediately after the administration of the first dose of trial medication and which was to be stopped by the patient as soon as he/she felt meaningful pain relief. Time to meaningful pain relief was censored at 8 hours.</description>

             with a minimum of two mandibular extractions. The two mandibular third molars may be
             partial bony impactions or full bony impactions (as long as the trauma rating is not
             severe and the surgeons do not feel the subject will have extreme post-surgical pain)
             OR there may be a combination of one full bony impaction with the second mandibular
             being a soft tissue impaction or partial bony impaction. Maxillary third molars (or
             supernumerary teeth) of any type can be extracted;

          -  Use of only the following preoperative medication(s)/ anesthetic(s): topical
             benzocaine, short-acting local anesthetic (mepivacaine or lidocaine) with or without
             vasoconstrictor and/or nitrous oxide;

          -  Ingestion of any caffeine-containing beverages, chocolate, or alcohol 6 hours or less
             before surgery;

          -  Has impaired liver function, e.g., serum Alanine transaminase, aspartate
             aminotransferase, alkaline phosphatase, or Gamma-glutamyltransferase greater than 2.5
             times the upper limit of normal, or blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, or bilirubin
             greater than 1.5 times the upper limit of normal without a known benign explanation;

          -  Has known history of a positive HIV antibody test or known HIV infection;

          -  Has a known history of Hepatitis B or C;

          -  Has a clinically significant abnormal electrocardiogram (ECG) at screening as
             determined by the Investigator:

        <description>SPRID0-8h: Time-weighted sum of PAR and PID from 0 to 8 hours, score range: -40 (worst) to 112 (best). PI was assessed on a 0-10 numerical pain rating scale (NPRS), where 0=no pain and 10=worst possible pain, pre-dose and at 0.25,0.5,0.75,1,1.5,2,3,4,5, 6,7 and 8 hours; PAR was assessed on a 5-point verbal rating scale (VRS) (0=none to 4=complete) at the same post-dose time points. Time-weights were equal to the elapsed time (hour) between the time point of interest and the preceding time point. All PAR and pain intensity (PI) assessments completed after the patient had taken rescue medication or the second dose of study medication, whichever was first, until hour 8 were considered missing. Last observation carried forward (LOCF) was used with the last completed PI/PAR assessments prior to first rescue/second study medication, whichever was first, to impute missing values up to 8 hours.</description>

PI was assessed on a 0-10 numerical pain rating scale (NPRS), where 0=no pain and 10=worst possible pain, pre-dose and at 0.25,0.5,0.75,1,1.5 and 2 hours; PAR was assessed on a 5-point verbal rating scale (VRS) (0=none to 4=complete) at the same post-dose time points. Time-weights were equal to the elapsed time (hour) between the time point of interest and the preceding time point. All PAR and pain intensity (PI) assessments completed after the patient had taken rescue medication or the second dose of study medication, whichever was first, until hour 2 was considered missing. Last observation carried forward (LOCF) was used with the last completed PI/PAR assessments prior to first rescue/second study medication, whichever was first, to impute missing values up to 2 hours.</description>
