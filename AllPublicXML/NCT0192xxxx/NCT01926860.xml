    <textblock>
      The present study explores whether a simultaneously given hepatitis A vaccine (Epaxal) will
      have an impact on the immune response to PCV13 (pneumococcal conjugate vaccine; Prevenar13)
      vaccine in adults. The immune response to PCV13 is measured as levels of serotype specific
      serum antibodies and their opsonophagocytic activity. The results of volunteers receiving
      PCV13 and Epaxal will be compared to that in a control groups of adults receiving either
      hepatitis A or PCV13 vaccines only.

          6. No previous Pnc vaccination

          7. No previous hepatitis A vaccine

          1. Previous pneumococcal or hepatitis A vaccination

          2. Immunization with any other vaccine (oral or parenteral) within 4 weeks prior to study
             start or planned vaccination during the study

          3. Chronic administration of immunosuppressants or other immune-modifying drugs within 6
             months before the first dose of vaccine; patients using oral corticosteroids in

             human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection

          5. Pregnancy or lactation

          6. Acute disease at the time of enrollment (defined as the presence of a moderate or
             severe illness with or without fever (fever is defined as body temperature of ≥38 °C).
