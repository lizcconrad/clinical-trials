  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is an individualized anti-cancer vaccine protocol where the vaccination occurs
      inside of the body. To create the vaccine, a tumor lesion is selected and caused to die by a
      process called &quot;Radiofrequency Ablation&quot; or RFA. RFA causes the tumor to release its internal
      contents to the surrounding environment, such contents include tumor-specific antigens.
      Immune cells respond to the tissue damage and take-up these tumor antigens. The injection of
      the experimental cell drug, AlloStim(TM) into the lesion is designed to cause the responding
      cells to signal the immune system of the danger of the tumor, creating tumor-specific
      immunity.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The protocol design has 4 steps: (1) priming; (2) vaccination, (3) activation and (4)
      boosting. The priming step involves intradermal injections of AlloStim(TM). This is designed
      to increase the circulating titer of allo-specific Th1 memory cells; the vaccination step
      involves percutaneous radiofrequency ablation of a single liver lesion followed immediately
      with an intratumoral injection of AlloStim(TM) into the ablated lesion, followed 3 days later
      by an additional intratumoral injection into the previously ablated lesion with AlloStim(TM).
      This step is designed to elicit tumor-specific Th1 immunity. The activation step involves
      intravenous infusions of AlloStim(TM). This step is designed to cause the activation and
      extravasation of circulating memory cells and the activation of innate immune cells. The
      booster step includes two monthly IV infusions of AlloStim(TM). This step is designed to
      maintain an inflammatory cytokine storm designed to counteract immune suppressor mechanisms
      and tumor immunoavoidance mechanisms.
