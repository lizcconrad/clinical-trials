  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective is to compare the sensitivity and test-retest reliability of Kinesia HomeView
      to electronic and hand-written diaries for tracking medication state in the home.
      Demonstrating comparable or superior results will further support use of the Kinesia HomeView
      system as an outcome measure in clinical drug trials.
