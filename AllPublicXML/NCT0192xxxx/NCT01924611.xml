      AIM: To evaluate influence of two methods to avoid saliva contamination on the survival rate
      of atraumatic restorations in primary molars. 232 children, aged between 6-7 years, of both
      genders, were selected having one primary molar with a proximal dentine lesion. The children
      were randomly divided into two groups: a control group with class II ART restoration made
      using cotton rolls and an experimental group using rubber dam. The restorations were made and
      they were followed up every six months. After two years, the results were compilated and
      analyzed.

    <description>Atraumatic Restorative Technique is typically used in Minimally invasive Dentistry.
This restoration technique is made using only hand instruments and is possible to be carried out in children in schools.
This particular time, the isolation of the surgical/tooth area was made using rubber dam as saliva barrier.</description>
