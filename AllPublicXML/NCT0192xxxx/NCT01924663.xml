      The purpose of this study is to be able to better describe the incidence, timing and severity
      of myocardial dysfunction and acute kidney injury (AKI) following a documented respiratory
      viral illness (RSV, adenovirus, metapneumovirus, parainfluenza, influenza, etc.) in pediatric
      patients.

      This is a single-centre, prospective and retrospective, descriptive data-collection pilot
      study.

      Prospective Data Collection:

      All pediatric patients who are less than 18 years with a confirmed positive respiratory viral
      swab will be invited to participate.

      Retrospective Data Collection:

      The retrospective portion of this study will examine a 5 year period prior to the start of
      enrollment for the prospective study, with the intention to include all pediatric patients
      who are less than 18 years with a confirmed positive respiratory viral swab and admitted into
      the local hospital's PICU.
