    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to determine the bioequivalence of 5 x 0.1 milligram (mg) capsules
      compared to 1 x 0.5 mg capsule of dutasteride in healthy male subjects. The results of this
      study are expected to support registration applications for androgenetic alopecia (AGA) in
      Japan and other international markets.

    <description>Subjects will be hospitalized to the clinical unit on the evening of Day -1. All subjects will receive 1 x 0.5mg oral dose of dutasteride (Sequence A), in the morning; Subjects will remain in the clinical unit until completion of all assessments at 24 hours post-dose on Day 2 including collection of the 24 hour post-dose PK sample. Subjects will return to the unit for the remaining PK samples at 36, 48 and 72 hours. The subject will receive or 5 x 0.1mg oral dose of dutasteride (Sequence B) in similar fashion as that of Sequence A. The two treatment sequences will be separated by a minimum washout period of 28 days to ensure that dutasteride is effectively eliminated from the subject between dosing occasions.</description>

             which is/are not specifically listed in the inclusion or exclusion criteria, outside
             the reference range for the population being studied may be included only if the

             required, judges and documents that the finding is unlikely to introduce additional
             risk factors and will not interfere with the study procedures.
