      Predict the development of multiple organ failure in patients with trauma and severe burns.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Microvascular alterations are frequently seen in patients with sepsis, trauma, burns and
      those who are hemodynamically uncompensated(Shock).

      The use of the Microscan is a non-invasive approach to visualize and assess impaired mucosal
      microcirculation in order to identify early on patients who are predisposed for MOF (multiple
      organ failure)
