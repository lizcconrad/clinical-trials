  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to describe: 1) Differences in perceived health at hospital
      discharge between diagnostic groups and in-hospital predicting factors. 2) Perceived health
      at hospital discharge as a predictor of morbidity and mortality after 1 and 3 years. 3) The
      association between perceived health, sick leave and health care utilization.

      The five heart centres in Denmark diagnose and treat about 50.000 patients with different
      diagnoses every year and offer both invasive and non-invasive treatment.

      Perceived health status is measured by self-reported health, quality of life, anxiety and
      depression and symptoms. Knowledge about perceived health status can help to guide inpatient
      practise and outpatient follow-up. Furthermore, it can be used to evaluate differences
      between diagnostic groups, regional differences and predicting factors for perceived health
      status at hospital discharge and long term morbidity and mortality. Also economic analysis of
      healthcare utilisation and work ability status are possible.

      Five Danish heart centres (Rigshospitalet, Gentofte Hospital, Odense University Hospital,
      Aarhus University Hospital and Aalborg University Hospital) are all including patients from
      April 2013 to April 2014. All patients discharged or transferred from one of the heart
      centres are potential participants in the study. Patients are unselected and consecutively
      included at hospital discharge. Included patients will be asked to complete and return a
      questionnaire before they leave the hospital.

      The following questionnaires will be used to measure the perceived health status of the
      patients at hospital discharge: SF-12, Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, EQ-5D, Brief
      Illness Perception Questionnaire, HeartQoL and Edmonton Symptom Assessment Scale. Furthermore
      14 ancillary about health and health behaviour are included in the questionnaire. This
      amounts to a total of 62 items in the questionnaire.

      The DenHeart study data collection, database development and reporting of primary outcomes
      are funded by the five participating heart centres in Denmark. Further funding for registry
      data, analyses and reporting will be applied for in external funds.

        All patients discharged or transferred from one of the heart centres are potential
        participants in the study. The diagnostic groups include ischemic heart disease, heart
        failure, arrhythmia, heart valve disease, endocarditis, congenital heart disease and heart
        transplantation.
