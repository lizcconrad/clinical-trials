    <textblock>
      Patients with type 2 diabetes can attain superior disease outcomes if multiple therapy goals
      are simultaneously achieved and maintained. In reality, therapy goals are seldom achieved,
      and patients become susceptible to devastating complications and greater health care
      expenses. Studies have shown that regular monitoring and therapy adjustments are a
      prerequisite to achieving and maintaining therapy goals. Unfortunately implementation of
      regular monitoring and therapy adjustments have been hindered by high clinic workload and
      shortage of endocrinologists. Due to this shortage, endocrine care is accessible to less than
      20% of patients with type 2 diabetes. The overwhelming majority are managed by providers who
      may lack the necessary expertise or time to deliver optimal disease management, particularly
      when insulin is prescribed.

      Objectives: We hypothesize that type 2 diabetes endocrine clinics for high-risk patients that
      complement primary care, personalize the frequency of remote disease interventions and employ
      infrequent face-to-face outpatient visits, will achieve comparable clinical outcomes and
      patient satisfaction compared to usual endocrine clinic care, while reducing workload and
      increasing the clinic capacity. The intervention clinic will employ regular remote
      communications initiated by the endocrinologists, based on tailored individual plans.
      Frequent remote monitoring and interventions will reinforce attainment of the therapy goals
      and allow a decrease in the frequency of outpatient visits. In turn, the clinic workload will
      decrease and it will be able to accommodate more patients with type 2 diabetes than
      traditional endocrine clinics. The aims of the study are to test this new endocrine clinic
      model in a clinical trial by monitoring clinical parameters, patient satisfaction and
      clinical workload. The long-term objectives are to modify the current model of endocrine care
      for patients with type 2 diabetes.

      Emerging data suggests that clinical interventions may be implemented successfully by a
      variety of remote communications. Thus far regular monitoring and treatment adjustments by
      remote communications have not yet been fully integrated into endocrine practice in a
      scalable fashion that can be readily disseminated. The PI proposes to test a new endocrine
      model care clinic for high-risk patients with type 2 diabetes that employs regular
      communications initiated by the provider, based on a tailored individual plan. Frequent
      monitoring and interventions will reinforce attainment of prespecified therapy goals, enhance
      patient engagement, and allow a significant decrease in the frequency of outpatient visits.
      In turn, the clinic will be able to accommodate more patients with type 2 diabetes than
      traditional endocrine clinics. Data management and day-to-day clinic operation will be
      computerized with technology that has been developed by the institution. The project is
      highly significant since it proposes a new model of endocrine care for high-risk patients
      with type 2 diabetes that may improved disease outcome in more patients and reduce medical
      expenses.
