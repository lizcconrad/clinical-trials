  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Rationale: Chronic abdominal pain is a frequently occurring condition. Although hardly ever
      considered, the abdominal wall is the primary cause in 10-30% of cases. Most often it is
      caused by entrapment of an intercostal nerve in the anterior rectus sheath, the Anterior
      Cutaneous Nerve Entrapment Syndrome (ACNES). Treatment consists of local anaesthetic
      injections combined with methyl-prednisolon. When ineffective, a neurectomy at the site of
      penetration out of the ventral rectus sheet should be considered. This neurectomy however is
      effective in 73% of cases, leaving some 25% of patients in pain. Whether these refractory
      ACNES patients suffer from underlying pathologic pain disorders is subject to investigation,
      by using quantitative sensory testing (QST).

      Objective: To investigate nociceptive processing and possible underlying pathological pain
      processing mechanisms in ACNES patients.

      Study design: An observational case-control study.

      Study population: Patients treated for ACNES (n = 50) compared to healthy controls from an
      existing database.

      Measurements: Quantitative sensory testing (QST) of nociception, performed after treatment of
      ACNES for both successfully treated and refractory patients in comparison to healthy
      controls. Visual Analogue Scores (VAS) measured before, during and after testing procedures.
      Pain Anxiety Symptom Scale (PASS) and Pain Catastrophizing Scale (PCS) questionnaires.

      Main study parameters: Pressure pain and electrical pain thresholds as investigated by QST.
      Secondary study parameters are VAS-scores and results of PASS and PCS questionnaires.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>pressure pain threshold</measure>
    <time_frame>&gt; 6 weeks after treatment</time_frame>
    <description>The pressure pain threshold (pPT) will be determined by pressing an electronic pressure algometer, which has a surface area of 1 cm2, on a distinct muscles. The patient will be asked to say 'now' when the sensation is rated as unpleasant. The pressure will be increased at a rate of 50 kPa/sec until the pPT is reached.</description>

    <description>Patients will be asked to mark on a 100mm VAS line the average pain in a pain diary. The boundaries of these lines are &quot;no pain&quot; on the upper left site and &quot;unbearable pain&quot; on the upper right site.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Pain and Anxiety Symptom Scale (PASS)</measure>
    <time_frame>&gt; 6wks after treatment</time_frame>
    <description>The pain anxiety symptom scale measures four aspects of pain related anxiety: 1) fear for pain, 2) cognitive anxiety, 3) flight or avoidance behavior, 4) physiological symptoms of pain. Elevated scores on this 40-item questionnaire indicate a high level of pain- related anxiety.</description>
  </other_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Pain Catastrophizing Scale (PCS)</measure>
    <time_frame>&gt; 6wks after treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Pain catastrophizing affects how individuals experience pain. The PCS yields a three component solution comprising ruminating (&quot;I can ÃÅt stop thinking about how much it hurts&quot;), magnifying (e.g. &quot;I'm afraid that something serious might happen&quot;), and helplessness (&quot;There is nothing I can do to reduce the intensity of my pain&quot;).</description>
  </other_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS)</measure>
    <time_frame>&gt; 6wks after treatment</time_frame>
    <description>The Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale is a 14-item questionnaire of which 7 of the items relate to anxiety (HADS-A) and 7 to depression (HADS-D). The scoring system used is a Likert scale (0 to 3 points) and therefore the data returned is ordinal. A patient can score between 0 and 21. The HADS aims to detect emotional disorder in patients under investigation and treatment in medical and surgical departments</description>

               -  Patient had a constant site of tenderness that is superficially located with a
                  small (&lt;2cm2) area of maximal tenderness.

               -  The most intense pain could be localized with the tip of one finger.

               -  Tenderness increased by abdominal muscle tensing (Carnett's test).

          5. Patient is able to speak, read and understand the local language of the
             investigational site, is familiar with the procedures of the study, and agrees to
             participate in the study program by giving oral and written informed consent prior to
             screening evaluations.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Abdominal complaints were due to a condition other than ACNES (e.g. pain related to
             scar tissue).

          2. Patient has (a history of) another (chronic) pain syndrome that interferes with the
             interpretation of QST results.

             interferes with the study measurements or may pose a risk for the patient.

          4. Patient does not feel a pinprick test to the lower extremities, due to affected
             sensory input (e.g. neuropathy as a result of diabetes mellitus).
