  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Frailty is a clinical entity associated with an increase in risk for disease and death and
      becomes more common as people age. Frailty has a strong relationship with the age-related
      loss of muscle and strength, termed sarcopenia. Sarcopenia and frailty are strongly
      associated with disability, especially in women. Adequate protein intake, the amino acid
      leucine, and resistance exercise training have been individually shown to increase muscle
      mass to varying degrees. However, no studies have investigated how a longer-term resistance
      exercise training program with leucine supplementation when protein intake is optimized could
      increase muscle mass in frail and pre-frail elderly women. In addition, this is the
      population that stands the most to gain from such an intervention.

      The purpose of this study is to investigate the effects of the amino acid leucine added to
      resistance exercise training on muscle mass and physical performance in frail and pre-frail
      elderly women with adequate protein intake. We hypothesize that combining leucine in diet
      with an exercise program would be superior to exercise alone in stimulating muscle protein
      synthesis and phosphorylation status of muscle cellular key-regulatory proteins, leading to
      enhanced gains in muscle performance.

      A total of 24 subjects will take part in this study, conducted at the McGill University
      Health Centre (MUHC) Royal Victoria Hospital and the Institut Universitaire de Gériatrie de
      Montréal (IUGM). All subjects will undergo adjustments to their diet to optimize protein
      intake and a resistance exercise training program. Half of the participants will receive a
      supplement of powdered leucine (an amino acid), and the other half of the participants will
      receive a placebo in the same powder form. Neither the participants nor the study
      investigators will know which participants are receiving the leucine nor which are receiving
      the placebo.

      Each subjects participation in this study will involve 4 total visits: 2 initial screening
      visits followed by 2 two-day stays at the Centre for Innovative Medicine (CIM) of the
      MUHC-Royal Victoria Hospital. These two stays will be spaced by 12 weeks of the intervention
      (dietary adjustments, resistance exercise training, and the powdered supplement). The two
      stays each consist of a meal test to assess each subjects metabolic responses to a meal, and
      to obtain muscle biopsies necessary to measure the rate of protein accumulation in the
      muscle. Simple physical performance measurements will be taken before and at the completion
      of the intervention.

      This study aims to better understand how the presence of aging affects the body's responses
      to resistance exercise and how leucine, one of the amino acids that make up proteins, may
      help build muscle. This in turn, could lead to defining combined diet and exercise strategies
      to prevent muscle loss often seen with aging.
