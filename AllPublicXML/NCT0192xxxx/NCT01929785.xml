      This is a single center observational study. Duration of the study is 1 year. Participants
      will be followed in 2 groups. Group 1 will include all patients who have undergone a heart
      transplant, through the first year post transplant. Group 2 will include heart transplant
      recipients from 1 year to 2 years post transplant. Groups will be enrolled simultaneously. It
      is anticipated each group will have 25 participants.

      Application of the BIIR gene expression profile approach to heart transplantation clinical
      diagnostic issues is likely to create new means to detect rejection at the earliest stages,
      to help prevent progression through earlier treatment, to discover new avenues targets for
      treatment of heart graft rejection, and to reduce the cost of post-transplant health care

    <description>To systematically collect blood samples from heart allograft recipients who are 0 -2 years post-transplant for eventual screening of blood cell gene activity, in order to identify diagnostically useful biomarkers that can help distinguish among multiple possible clinical presentation, e.g., acute rejection, antibody mediated rejection, infection, coronary artery disease, a variety of potential causes for heart dysfunction.).</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Recent work using our gene expression profiling (GEP) has shown that peripheral blood cells display a unique GEP that is 90% accurate for detection of acute rejection in liver transplant patients &amp; hopefully hearts as well.</measure>

    <description>Recent work using our gene expression profiling (GEP) has shown that peripheral blood cells display a unique GEP that is 90% accurate for detection of acute rejection in liver transplant patients. The Investigators hypothesize that heart allograft recipients will display a similar pattern (Aim #2). The Investigators will retrospectively select longitudinal samples collected in Aim #1 from patients who did not experience rejection and from those who did, in order to determine if their GEP correlates with what we have observed for liver patients.</description>
