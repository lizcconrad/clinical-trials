      This is local prospective multicenter observational non-interventional local study. Primary
      study objective is investigate and describe prescription pattern of neurologists in secondary
      stroke or non-CNS (non-Central Nervous System) systemic embolism prevention in patients with
      AF (Atrial fibrillation) and prior stroke or TIA (Transient Ischemic attack) who treat with
      rivaroxaban at an initial visit and three follow-up visits.
