    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to demonstrate that using Surgical Pleth Index (SPI) and Entropy
      in adjunct to other clinical information decreases the occurrence rate of inadequate
      anesthesia events, bradycardia and hypotension in comparison to standard clinical practice
      during anesthesia. Adequacy of Anesthesia (AoA) monitoring comprises the use of both Entropy
      and SPI measurements. Adequacy of anesthesia will be monitored using non-invasive blood
      pressure, blood oxygen saturation (SpO2), ECG, and neuromuscular transmission (NMT).

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Ability to provide written informed consent

          -  Age 18-80 years of age

          -  Surgery that is expected to last at least 2 hours under general anesthesia with
             endotracheal tube

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Any subject that meets the definition of vulnerable subject as defined in ISO
             14155:2011

          -  Per ISO 14155:2011, a vulnerable subject is defined as an individual whose willingness
             to volunteer in a clinical investigation could be unduly influenced by the
             expectation, whether justified or not, of benefits associated with participation or of
             retaliatory response from senior members of a hierarchy in case of refusal to
             participate

          -  Any subject with a cardiac pacemaker

          -  Any subject with atrial fibrillation at the time of obtaining the baseline values

          -  Any subject with more than 5 ventricular extra systoles/minute at the time of
             obtaining the baseline values

          -  Any subject who needs invasive blood pressure measurement

          -  Any subject who show hemodynamics that would have qualified for being considered as a
             sign of inadequate anesthesia already at baseline:

          -  Mean blood pressure below 60 mmHg or above 100 mmHg

          -  HR below 45 /min or above 100/min

          -  Any subject with epidural anesthesia or analgesia during the surgery. Epidural
             catheter may be placed pre-operatively, and used in the PACU, but not during the
             surgery

          -  Any subject having surgery that requires prone position

          -  Any subject with very high body mass index (&gt;35) because of incompatibility with the
             target controlled anesthesia models used

          -  Any subject with known allergies to the specific anesthetic agents/ analgesic drugs
             intended for use in their surgeries

          -  Any subject with laryngeal mask airway

          -  Any subject who requires neuromuscular blocking agent infusion

          -  Any subject who is going to have major surgery with a high risk of extensive blood
             loss

          -  Any subject with known chronic use of opioids
