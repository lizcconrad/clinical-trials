    <textblock>
      Rationale: Patients with indolent or smoldering systemic mastocytosis can have severe
      disabling symptoms. Almost all patients have fatigue, a compromised quality of life,
      hampering normal functioning. Because this form of mastocytosis is not considered
      life-threatening, mast cell eradication has never been applied and patients receive only
      symptomatic therapy with histamine blockers. Midostaurin, a c-KIT inhibitor has shown
      activity regarding symptom control and decrease of malignant mast cells in patients with
      aggressive systemic mastocytosis (ASM) or mast cell leukemia

      Objective:

      Primary: To study in a pilot phase II trial the efficacy of midostaurin administered at an
      oral dose of 100 mg twice daily in patients with indolent or smoldering systemic mastocytosis
      on mediator symptom reduction, documented by the Mastocytosis Symptom Assessment
      Questionnaire, measured at 3 months.

      Secondary:

        1. To study whether symptom improvement persists at 6 months, and whether midostaurin can
           reduce mast cell infiltration in the skin and bone marrow, documented by decrease of
           serum tryptase, decrease of urticaria pigmentosa and decrease of bone marrow mast cells.

        2. To assess safety and tolerability of midostaurin in the above mentioned settings

      Study design: Single arm, open label pilot phase II study.

      Study population: Adult patients (n=20) with histologically documented systemic mastocytosis,
      indolent or smoldering subtype, with severe symptoms, not controlled by histamine 1 and 2
      blockers.

      Intervention: treatment with Midostaurin, twice daily 100 mg orally for 6 months
      continuously.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with Indolent Systemic Mastocytosis (ISM) or Smouldering Systemic
             Mastocytosis (SSM) according to the WHO criteria

          -  Presence of the D816V c-KIT mutation

          -  Serum tryptase &gt; 20 mg/l

          -  Serious mediator-related symptoms that cannot be controlled by H1 and H2 blocking
             drugs. Symptoms will be scored by an adapted MSAF (mastocytosis symptom assessment
             form) with at least:

               -  a pre-study score of 4 or more on 3 non-related items,

               -  or a pre-study score of 5 or more on 2 non-related items.

               -  one item from the scoring list can be replaced by flushes 7 or more per week or
                  anaphylactic attacks 1 or more per week.

          -  Age &gt;18 years
