    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether methylphenidate is effective in the
      treatment of binge eating disorder, in a randomized controlled trial extended release
      methylphenidate versus cognitive behavioral therapy for binge eating disorder in overweight
      or obese adult females.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Fifty-six adult female outpatients with binge eating disorder will receive 12 weeks of
      methylphenidate (dosage 18-72 mg) or 12 sessions of manualized cognitive behavioral therapy.
      Participants will complete interviewer-rated and self-report measures of eating, mood,
      attention, and personality features before treatment, after 6 weeks of treatment, immediately
      after treatment is completed, and 3 months after treatment is completed.
