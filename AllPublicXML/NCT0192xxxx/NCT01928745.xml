      To diagnose acid base disturbances using blood gas analysis, multiple approaches are
      currently in use. These include the classic Henderson-Hasselbach bicarbonate approach and the
      physiochemical approach by Stewart1. All have shown to be mathematically compatible2.

      Diagnosing the metabolic component of acid base disturbances relies on the assessment of the
      so called ion gaps: the anion gap for the classic acid-base approach and the strong ion
      difference (SID) for the Stewart approach. This gap may unveil unidentified anions to provide
      a more accurate diagnosis. In particular they allow differentiating between relative
      hyperchloremia and other strong ions such as lactate, ketones, salicylates, citrate and
      ethylene glycol3.

      The accuracy of both gaps relies on the estimation of the weak acid dissociation: A-. This A-
      is dependent on the total concentration of weak acids (Atot) of which albumin is the most
      important and the effective dissociation constant for these (Ka), which determines the
      dissociated fraction of the Atot. This dissociation fraction needs to be accounted for in the
      ion gaps. This is reflected in the recommendation to correct the anion gap for albumin and
      incorporated in the SID which includes a factor for albumin by design3,4. However, the
      correction factor for albumin is currently based on data from animals and healthy
      volunteers4-9. In the critically ill albumin and protein content are very different compared
      to healthy volunteers, most notably in sepsis. Further, it is unknown if subunit composition
      of albumin is different in these patients. In addition, different protein species may be
      either up or downregulated in the critically ill1,8,9.Therefore from a pathophysiological
      point of view Atot and Ka and thus A- may differ in the critically ill. However it has not
      been previously investigated if and to what extent these matters affect Atot and Ka and
      therefore A- in this population.

      In addition, previous studies looking into this values showed a higher than expected value of
      unmeasured anions from the gap calculations. Despite rigorous experimental effort including
      high performance liquid chromatography, the origin of these unmeasured anions have not yet
      been elucidated17-20. However if the assumptions made in the Stewarts approach would not be
      valid, the existence of these unknown anions may have to be questioned.

      Thus it is of great interest to experimentally determine the exact contribution of the weak
      acids and their dissociation in sepsis. This could have major implications for these patients
      because different assumptions will ultimately lead to alterations in their calculated anion
      gap or SID. This may reduce unnecessary diagnostic test, alter final diagnosis and hence
      alter therapy.

      In this study the investigators aim to experimentally determine the Atot and Ka and thus
      their dissociated fraction A- in critically ill septic patients admitted to the intensive
      care unit by using in vitro CO2 tonometry, plasma dialysis and Marquardt regression analysis.
      In addition, as a control the investigators will do the same for patients admitted to the
      intensive care after routine cardiac surgery. Furthermore Atot and Ka values for both groups
      will be compared to values obtained from human volunteers in a previous study4.

      To achieve this, the investigators will plot CO2 versus pH titration curves from plasma
      samples of these patients. The investigators will then use Marquardt nonlinear regression
      analysis to quantify Atot and Ka and the SID by simultaneously solving for these
      parameters21. To make the quantification for Atot and Ka more robust, the investigators will
      also perform the same experiments after dialyzing the obtained plasma samples against a
      crystalloid solution of known composition in order to eliminate errors related to estimation
      of the SID. Finally, Atot and Ka values for both groups will be compared to values obtained
      from human volunteers in a previous study4. For application in the bicarbonate and base
      excess centred frameworks, Atot and Ka values will be related to albumin and protein content
      to update the correction factor for the anion gap in critically ill.
