      Background:

      - Some people have a mutation in the C9ORF72 gene that causes amyotrophic lateral sclerosis
      (ALS) or frontotemporal dementia (FTD). The mutation causes a small piece of DNA to repeat
      itself thousands of times. The C9ORF gene mutation mostly occurs in families. In those
      families, some persons have ALS and others have FTD. Occasionally the C9ORF gene mutation
      occurs in persons without a family history. Researchers want to understand how this gene
      causes different diseases. They will study how symptoms caused by the C9ORF gene develop and
      change over time. They will measure symptoms that occur in ALS and in FTD. In particular,
      they will measure strength, ability to move, thinking, and memory. They will also see if
      other tests are associated with progression of disease. These tests, called biomarkers, may
      help detect or measure C9ORF72 disease in the future.

      Objectives:

      - To understand how symptoms change over time in people with mutations in a gene called
      C9ORF72, which causes ALS and FTD.

      Eligibility:

      - Adults over age 18 who have this genetic mutation

      Design:

        -  Participants will have up to 4 in-person visits and 3 telephone interviews over 3 years.
           Each in-person visit may take place over several days. They may be either inpatient or
           outpatient visits.

        -  At each visit, participants will undergo a series of brain, language, and behavior
           tests. These will include:

        -  Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain. This uses magnets, radio waves, and
           computers to produce detailed pictures of the brain.

        -  Collecting spinal fluid. The clinician will make the participant s back numb and then
           insert a needle to collect fluid.

      &lt;TAB&gt;- Blood samples will be taken.

      &lt;TAB&gt;- Participants will be asked to perform several language and movement tests.

      &lt;TAB&gt;- Small skin samples will be taken on one visit

      - Between visits, participants will answer questions about their health over the phone 3
      times.

      Objective

      The primary objective of this study is to characterize the natural history of disease in
      patients who carry a repeat expansion in the C9ORF72 gene, which causes amyotrophic lateral
      sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD). The secondary objective is to assess
      whether candidate biomarkers correlate with disease progression.

      Study population

      62 persons with a documented repeat expansion in C9ORF72 gene who have ALS, ALS-FTD, or FTD
      or who are carriers of the gene mutation and have a symptomatic family member.

      Design

      Participants will undergo a structured battery of clinical and neuropsychological tests at
      enrollment and at three follow-up visits to NIH to assess disease severity. During these
      visits, physiological, imaging, blood, and CSF for testing of candidate biomarkers will be
      obtained. Between visits to NIH, assessments of functional status and cognition will be
      carried out by phone. Participants may be seen earlier than the scheduled follow-up visit or
      at home if phone assessments indicate clinical deterioration.

      Outcome measures

      There will be three primary outcome measures, for changes in three areas of function over the
      first six months. The primary measure of the severity of motor clinical function will be the
      ALS Functional rating scale-revised (ALSFRS-R). The primary measure of the severity of
      cognitive function will be changes in verbal fluency score. The primary measure of the
      severity of behavioral dysfunction will be the caregiver assessment of the fronto-behavioral
      index (FBI). Secondary clinical outcomes will be the forced vital capacity (FVC) and
      survival. The correlation between primary and secondary clinical outcome measures and
      candidate biomarkers measures will be analyzed in an exploratory fashion to determine whether
      candidate biomarkers are predictive of disease onset or progression.
