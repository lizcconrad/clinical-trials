  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Purpose: the aim of the present study was to analyze the impact of mandibular denture
      relining with soft or hard denture liners in the oral health related quality of life (OHRQoL)
      of edentulous patients.

      The null hypothesis was that there would be no difference in OHRQoL findings after mandibular
      denture relining between patient groups treated with hard or soft denture liners.

    <textblock>
      Complete denture wearers had their existing mandibular dentures relined with a soft
      silicone-based denture liner (Mucopren Soft; Group 1; n=22) or a hard acrylic resin based
      denture liner (Kooliner; Group 2; control n=22) with chairside procedures. The OHIP EDENT
      (Oral Health Impact profile) questionnaire was given to patients prior to reline procedures
      (baseline-T0) and 90 days (T90) post relining. Three possible answers and scores were
      proposed for each question: never (0), sometimes (1) and almost always (2). Results were
      analyzed by means of the generalized linear model (p≤0.05) considering two factors: time (T0
      and T90) and group (hard and soft denture liners).

    <measure>Change from Baseline in Oral health related quality of life at 90 days after denture relining</measure>
    <time_frame>The oral health related quality of life was evaluated before relining (T0- baseline), and after 90 days post denture relining.</time_frame>
    <description>The Oral Health Related Quality of Life (OHRQoL) was assessed through the application of the questionnaire OHIP EDENT at baseline and 90 days post denture relining. Four domains developed for the Brazilian OHIP-EDENT9 were used: (D1) 'masticatory-related complaints, (D2) 'psychological discomfort and disability', (D3) 'social disability' and (D4) 'oral pain and discomfort'.
The questionnaires were carried out via interviews by one individual examiner , who was blinded for the denture liner. The interviews lasted approximately ten minutes.Three possible answers to questions one to nineteen with their scores in parenthesis were given as options: never (0), sometimes (1) or almost always (2).</description>
