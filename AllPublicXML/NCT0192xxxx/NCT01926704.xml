  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Human visual acuity and contrast sensitivity are highly dependent on various different
      parameters. Each should be optimized for perfect visual performance. However, in real life
      our eyes lack such parameters, which might lead to unsatisfying results even after spectacle
      correction or contact lenses.

      A promising approach would be to design intra ocular lenses (IOL), which are implanted into
      the eye for example in the course of cataract extraction and are able to compensate for the
      human eyes' aberrations.

      For example cutoff frequency, edge-sharpness or specific contrast for selected structure
      sizes would need to be considered. Since, an aberration free optical system is almost
      impossible and since the impact of each single parameter is not yet known, IOL design
      parameters would have to be chosen very carefully.

      Furthermore, image quality of IOLs still is tested ex vivo by ray tracing for example, but
      this does not guarantee perfect function after implantation, as our visual system has complex
      image precessing units form the retina to the brain.

      The present study picks one of these parameters and seeks to assess its impact on visual
      quality in-vivo. By subjectively grading different images with objective changes to image
      quality by variations of the modulation transfer function (MTF), the potential influence and
      thus on our subjective visual impression shall be assessed.
