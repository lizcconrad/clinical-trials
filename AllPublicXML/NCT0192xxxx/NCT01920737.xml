  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to find out whether the combination of chemotherapy drugs that
      are routinely used in children with ALL, will be safe and effective in treating adult
      patients with ALL. The standard treatment for adults with ALL consists of many chemotherapy
      drugs that are given in different combinations and in several steps. In adult ALL there is no
      standard which drugs to give and how to combine them. Some leukemias have a chromosome
      abnormality called Philadelphia chromosome (also called Ph Positive) and some leukemias do
      not (called Ph Negative). In this study we want to see whether this combination of
      chemotherapy drugs will be safe and effective in treating adult patients with Ph Negative
      ALL.

    <description>All three criteria must be met for clinical complete remission:
Peripheral Blood Counts. The absolute neutrophil count should be ≥1,000/μl (sustained without growth factor support), and platelet count should be ≥100,000/μl (without transfusions), and no circulating blasts. After Induction remission assessment, blood counts are considered recovered at ANC ≥ 1,000 and PLT ≥75,000.
Bone Marrow Aspirate. Bone marrow cellularity should be approximate normal with evidence of maturation of all cell lineages and should contain &lt;5% blasts.
Extramedullary Leukemia, such as CNS or soft tissue involvement, must not be present. If the patient had CNS involvement by ALL at the time of starting the study, the CNS involvement should be re-examined and interval determined by the treating physicians in order to determine if clinical complete remission</description>

    <description>The treatment plan has 6 treatment cycles. The cycle names are listed in the following order:
Induction Phase I - Induction Phase II - Intensification I - Re-induction I - Intensification II - Re-induction II Each cycle is given over a period of 4-6 weeks and the interval between them can range between 1-3 weeks. Based the patients medical condition, the doctor may decide to change the timing of the drugs, the interval between the drugs in a cycle, or the interval between the cycles. After receiving all cycles you will continue with a 36 months treatment part that is called Maintenance.</description>

             stain, but Ph status is unknown, may also enroll.

          -  Patients with T-cell or B cell lymphoblastic lymphoma confirmed by conventional

          -  Adequate hepatic function as demonstrated by a total bilirubin &lt; 2.0 mg/dl (unless
             attributable to Gilbert's disease) and an alkaline phosphatase, AST, and ALT ≤ 4 times
             the upper limit of normal (unless clinically considered to be related to liver
             involvement with leukemia

          -  Men and women of childbearing potential must be willing to practice an effective
             method of birth control during treatment and at least 4 months after treatment is
             finished.

             translocation by FISH or by PCR for bcr/abl1. Patients who are later found to have Ph+
             ALL should have treatment on this trial discontinued and will not be considered in the
             evaluation

          -  Lymphoid blastic crisis of chronic myelogenous leukemia

          -  Concurrent active malignancy requiring immediate therapy

          -  Clinically significant cardiac disease (NY Heart Association Class III or IV),
             including chronic arrhythmias, or pulmonary disease

          -  Known HIV positive status

          -  Other serious or life-threatening conditions deemed unacceptable by the principal
