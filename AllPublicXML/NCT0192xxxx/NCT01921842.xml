  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is an evaluation of a nutrition and physical activity intervention in child care
      centers in NC, CA, and CT.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The broad, long term goal is to develop a reproducible nutrition and physical activity
      intervention which utilizes child care consultant nutrition specialists to reduce the risk of
      overweight among children in regulated out-of-home child care. The objectives are:

        1. To train Child Care Health consultants (CCHCs) to become specialists in nutrition
           consultation in child care such that they will increase their daily consultation
           activities on nutrition, physical activity, and childhood overweight,

        2. To increase child care staff and parental knowledge of and positive attitudes toward
           providing healthy foods, appropriate portions of foods, and appropriate levels of
           physical activity for young children in out-of-home child care centers.,

        3. To strengthen child care center policies, procedures, practices and behaviors, regarding
           providing healthy foods, appropriate portions of foods, and appropriate levels of
           physical activity for young children in out-of-home child care centers, and

        4. To improve dietary intake and levels of physical activity, and to prevent increases in
           overweight and the risk of overweight as determined by body mass indexes among children
           in out-of-home child care centers.

    <description>Determine if the use of a Nurse Child Care Health Consultant changes nutrition and physical activity policies at child care centers using criteria based on the national standards identified from resources such as NAEYC accreditation guidelines, Child and Adult Care Food Program (CACFP) policies and requirements, and the joint APHA/AAP publication Caring for our Children (American Academy of Pediatrics, American Public Health Association &amp; National Resource Center for Health and Safety in Child Care, 2002; 1992). If written policies were present, they were compared to the gold-standard criteria from the national resource material and assigned a rating of either none (no written policies), poor (written policies fail to meet either state regulatory criteria or national standards), adequate (meets state regulatory criteria but not all of the national standards), or excellent (meets all of the national criteria present).</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Nutrition and Physical Activity Behaviors</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Year 1, Year 2</time_frame>
    <description>Determine if the use of a Nurse Child Care Health Consultant changes nutrition and physical activity behaviors at child care centers using the NAP SACC instrument intervention tool which consists of fifteen different areas of interest (9 nutrition and 6 physical activity) with several items each. The total number of items scored, 34, evaluate the center's environment with regard to support of healthy eating and regular physical activity. The instrument scoring is at one of four levels moving from minimal to best practice.</description>
