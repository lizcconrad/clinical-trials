  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This trial is conducted in Europe. The aim of the trial is to investigate the pharmacokinetic
      (the exposure of the trial drug in the body) and pharmacodynamic (the effect of the
      investigated drug on the body) properties of FIAsp (faster-acting insulin aspart) in subjects
      with type 1 diabetes.
