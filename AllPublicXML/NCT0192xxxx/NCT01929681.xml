      Objectives:

      To demonstrate the duration of the antidepressant effect of Low Field Magnetic Stimulation
      (LFMS)in subjects with bipolar depression.

      Hypotheses:

      Investigators expect subjects who receive LFMS to show significant mood improvement one week
      after the start of a three day course of daily stimulation as compared to subjects who
      receive sham LFMS.

      Investigators expect subjects who receive LFMS to show immediate mood improvement over the
      first treatment as measured by the difference in pre and post-treatment PANAS+ ratings.

      Investigators expect to show that LFMS will be well tolerated in a three-treatment protocol.

      Low Field Magnetic Stimulation is an electromagnetic intervention being investigated at
      McLean Hospital because of its effect on symptoms of depression. It consists of pulsed
      electric fields that are induced remotely in the head by a portable coil. It has been
      observed to have mood elevating effects in depressed patients with Bipolar Disorder (BPD).
      These effects are immediate, occurring upon completion of a 20 minute treatment.

      LFMS is unique because of its low electric field strength, and because of its high frequency
      operation, compared to other electromagnetic treatments. While other treatments such as
      Electroconvulsive Therapy (ECT) use electric fields equivalent to &gt; 100-200 Volts/meter to
      affect the brain, LFMS uses &lt;1 V/m. Such a low electric field strength indicates that another
      mechanism is activated by LFMS, and this provides a possibility for a new treatment. It may
      also give insight into causes of depression.

      LFMS is also unique because it has an immediate effect. This immediate effect may have
      implications for emergency treatment.

      The purpose of this study is to observe the response to LFMS in depressed BPD subjects with
      the aim of assessing the effects of multiple treatments, and of observing the duration of the
      mood improvement.To do so, the investigators propose to study 72 subjects in a protocol of
      three treatments in three days. Subjects will be rated before and after each treatment, and
      will return for mood ratings at one week after treatment. Investigators hope that this
      characterization of LFMS will allow clinical research groups to perform large trials and to
      evaluate its clinical effectiveness in patient populations.

    <measure>Long Term Change: Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Variable based on screening visit schedule, &gt; 2 weeks.</time_frame>
    <description>The Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating scale assesses 10 symptom areas of depression during an interview. Each of the 10 items received a score ranging from 0 to 6. The scale has a range of 0-60 for the reported total. A higher score indicates increased depression for all items and for the total. This outcome measure is the change from pretreatment baseline acquired at the screening visit to a follow-up visit 7 days after the first treatment.</description>

    <measure>Change Over First Treatment: Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS) Positive Items Subscale</measure>
    <time_frame>90 minutes; change immediately (&lt;30min) prior to the first treatment and immediately after (&lt;30min) the first treatment.</time_frame>
    <description>PANAS consists of 10 positive and 10 negative valence word items. Items are rated by the participant to indicate their assessment of how they are feeling about this item &quot;right now&quot; on a scale of 1(slightly) or not at all through 5 (extremely). 10 of of the items form a positive affect subscale, in which a higher score indicates increased positive affect, with a subscale range of 10 to 50. 10 of the items form a negative affect subscale, in which a higher score indicates more negative affect, with a subscale range of 10 to 50. This outcome measure is change in the 10 item positive affect subscale. This outcome measure is the difference between the scale administered immediately (&lt;30min) prior to the first treatment and immediately after (&lt;30min) the first treatment.</description>

Items are rated by the participant to indicate their assessment of how they are feeling about this item &quot;right now&quot; on a scale of 1(slightly) or not at all through 5 (extremely). 10 of of the items form a positive affect subscale, in which a higher score indicates increased positive affect, with a subscale range of 10 to 50. 10 of the items form a negative affect subscale, in which a higher score indicates more negative affect, with a subscale range of 10 to 50. This outcome measure uses the 10 item positive affect subscale. This outcome measure is the least squares fit of a linear coefficient to the three post (&lt;30min oost treatment) minus pre (&lt;30min pre treatment) score differences for the three treatment days</description>

        <title>Rate of Change Over 3 Treatments: Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS) Positive Items Subscale</title>
        <description>PANAS consists of 10 positive and 10 negative valence word items. Items are rated by the participant to indicate their assessment of how they are feeling about this item &quot;right now&quot; on a scale of 1(slightly) or not at all through 5 (extremely). 10 of of the items form a positive affect subscale, in which a higher score indicates increased positive affect, with a subscale range of 10 to 50. 10 of the items form a negative affect subscale, in which a higher score indicates more negative affect, with a subscale range of 10 to 50. This outcome measure uses the 10 item positive affect subscale. This outcome measure is the least squares fit of a linear coefficient to the three pretreatment scores for the three treatment days</description>
