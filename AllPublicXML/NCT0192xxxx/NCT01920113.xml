    <textblock>
      Adequate, safe sedation is essential for Endoscopic submucosal dissection. Dexmedetomidine is
      a potent and selective a2-adrenoceptor agonist used for sedative and analgesic effects, but
      it is limited to use alone. The investigators designed this study to compare the effect and
      safety of two sedatives, dexmedetomidine and propofol in Endoscopic Submucosal Dissection
      (ESD), when sufficient analgesia-remifentanil is administered all throughout the procedure.

    <description>In Group DR, a bolus dose of 0.5mcg/kg dexmedetomidine was injected intravenously 5 minutes before the start of the procedure (Precedex®, Abbott, Istanbul, Turkey). And a continuous infusion dose of 0.3-0.7mcg/hr/kg was started.</description>
