      Aim: To study and compare the clinical effects of platelet-rich plasma (PRP) injections and
      intra-articular (IA) corticosteroid injections in patients with primary osteoarthritis (OA)
      of the knee. This study aims to demonstrate this by using the Oxford Knee Score and Western
      Ontario and McMaster Universities Arthritis Index (WOMAC) to illustrate quantifiable
      difference between the two treatment modalities. Patient satisfaction will be compared by
      utilizing the Short-Form Survey-12 (SF-12) Score. Our null hypothesis states that
      intra-articular PRP injections is more beneficial in the long-term treatment of primary OA of
      the knee.

      This is a single blinded, randomized clinical trial. Subjects will be male or female patients
      with Grade 1,2 or 3 OA of the knee classified based on the radiological Kellgren -Lawrence
      grading system.

      100 patients will be recruited for this study and 50 patients each will be randomized to one
      of the treatment groups using block randomization i.e. receiving either treatment IA
      corticosteroids or IA PRP injections. The patients will be informed of and will be consented
      to the treatment they will be receiving. An investigator from the research team, blinded to
      group assignment, will assist patients in completing the Oxford Knee score, WOMAC and SF-12
      scores prior to receiving the treatment and at 6 weeks, 3 months and 6 months after receiving
      the treatment. In addition, they will be followed by regularly (at 3 weeks, 9 weeks, 4 months
      and 5 months) via telephone to inquire about any side effects of the treatment and to
      document patient satisfaction. Subjects in both groups will continue to receive concomitant
      treatments both pharmacological and nonpharmacological. All subjects will receive
      physiotherapy sessions with their respective intervention. Subjects will continue to receive
      treatment even if they wish to withdraw from the study at any point.

    <description>Intra-articular corticosteroid injections Patients receiving the IA corticosteroid will be injected 3mL of 0.5% Bupivacaine and 2mL of 80mg Depo Medrol in a 10cc syringe, using an aseptic technique into the suprapatellar pouch. After an IA corticosteroid injection, patients are always advised to rest for 24 hours, and weigh bear as little as possible for the following 3 days. The procedure will be performed by a senior resident with several years of experience or a consultant Orthopedic surgeon.</description>
