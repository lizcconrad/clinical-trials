  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients undergoing major procedures in oral and maxillofacial surgery more often develop a
      systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) in the first days of postoperative critical
      care therapy than patients with a comparable major surgery in other regions. The reasons for
      this finding are unknown and have not been studied in depth so far. We hypothesize that
      surgical trauma in this region might activate pro-inflammatory pathways. By examining the
      proteome of patients at different stages (prior to the surgery, at ICU admission, on the
      second postoperative day and when SIRS has ended clinically), we aim to identify the involved
      pro-inflammatory pathways and identify possible target proteins that might be clues to
      modification of postoperative SIRS in the future.
