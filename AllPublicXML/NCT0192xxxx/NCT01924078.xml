      The present study is to determine the adverse effects and clinical efficacy of AI combined
      with Capecitabine metronomic chemotherapy in postmenopausal breast cancer patients with
      Estrogen receptor and/or Progestrogen receptor positive.

      Capecitabine (Xeloda ®) is currently the most biologically active oral fluoropyrimidine drug,
      and is widely used as first-line and second-line rescue therapy for advanced breast cancer
      ,third-generation aromatase inhibitors (AI) is the preferred adjuvant endocrine therapy for
      Postmenopausal hormone-sensitive breast cancer. Study showed that AI combined with metronomic
      chemotherapy could improve the objective response and clinical benefit in neoadjuvant
      therapy.
