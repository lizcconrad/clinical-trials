  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The specific aim of this study is to test whether oxytocin (OT) boosts the positive emotion
      yield of a new wellness behavior (Lovingkindness meditation or Mindfulness meditation) and
      thereby increases nonconscious motives that shape daily behavioral decisions to repeat it,
      which in turn foster positive emotions that further augment nonconscious motives in an upward
      spiral dynamic.

      The proposed research targets three hypotheses: (1) Oxytocin manipulation magnifies (i.e.,
      moderates) the positive emotion yield of Lovingkindness meditation; (2) The positive emotion
      yield of meditation, which varies by experimental condition, increases the nonconscious
      incentive salience of Wellness Behavior-related cues; and (3) Behavioral decisions predict
      positive emotions, sparking the relationships among OT manipulation, positive emotion yield,
      and nonconscious incentive salience of Wellness Behavior-related cues.

    <measure>Change in positive emotions (as measured by the Modified Daily Emotions Scale)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Weeks 1, 2, and 3</time_frame>
    <description>Modified Daily Emotions Scale (mDES) - This measure of explicit positive affect has been successfully used by the PI in multiple studies to detect changes in positive emotion. Previous work by the PI found that Cronbach's alpha coefficient for the mDES positive emotion composite variable was 0.93 in sample of mid-life community adults similar to those anticipated for this study.</description>

    <measure>Change in nonconscious incentive salience (as measured by the Affect Misattribution Procedure).</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Weeks 1, 2, and 3</time_frame>
    <description>Affect Misattribution Procedure (AMP) - This measure of nonconscious incentive salience has acceptable internal consistency for an indirect measure of affect (.69 - .90) and has been found to predict judgments and behavioral outcomes above and beyond self-report measures.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes in meditation time</measure>
    <time_frame>Weeks 1, 2, and 3</time_frame>
    <description>Self-reported meditation time recorded daily and weekly. In addition, meditation track play times will be recorded from the iPod.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Cardiac Vagal Tone</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>This measure of parasympathetic control over the heart has been positively associated with both emotional and social functioning. Previous work by the PI's team has found that baseline vagal tone predicts increased positive response to lovingkindness meditation (LKM), and that LKM in turn increases vagal tone. Previous research by other labs has also found that OT administration increases vagal reactivity.</description>
