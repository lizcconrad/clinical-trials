    <textblock>
      This is an open label, PET study in healthy male subjects to determine if GSK2647544 is able
      to cross the blood-brain-barrier. The study will use GSK2647544 radiolabelled with
      fluorine-18 ([18F] GSK2647544) to determine the ratio of the concentration of the compound in
      tissue to that in plasma at equilibrium, expressed as the PET volume of distribution (VT).
      The study will consist of at least four visits; 2 screening visits, scanning day and
      follow-up. On Day 1 (scanning day) the subject will receive a single oral dose of GSK2647544
      (100 mg) followed approximately 2 hours later by a single intravenous (IV) infusion of
      [18F]-GSK2647544 and a dynamic PET scan. Arterial and venous blood sampling will be used to
      determine the plasma kinetics of [18F]-GSK2647544 and unlabeled GSK2647544. In addition, each
      subject will undergo a structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan of the brain to aid
      in the definition of neuroanatomy. The dose of GSK2647544 was selected based on the review of
      the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK), and pharmacodynamic (PD) data obtained in
      the first time in human (FTIH) study.
