  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This clinical investigation is being undertaken to examine the performance of the CE marked
      Proxima System - a patient attached blood gas analyser.

      The study forms an element of the Post Market surveillance plan for the Proxima system and
      will also generate method comparison data to allow Sphere Medical to submit the Proxima for
      FDA regulatory clearance.

      The PROX006 study is an open and non-randomised study that will be conducted to assess the
      performance of the Proxima (a CE marked Medical Device)on a wide range of patients with a
      variety of conditions. This study will allow the performance of the Proxima and the
      institution's conventional blood gas analyser to be compared when used in the Intensive Care
      Unit and Operating Theatre.

      The PROX006 investigation is an observational method comparison study - the results obtained
      from the Proxima will be compared with those obtained on the institution's conventional blood
      gas analyser (BGA). The potential for bias by the user will be negated in this study by
      directly comparing the results from the BGA and Proxima.

      The data/results documented in the Case Report Form (CRF) will be verified during monitoring
      visits.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Male and female patients â‰¥18 years old

          -  Patients who have (or will have) an arterial line, which was (will be) inserted for
             clinical need, will be considered for inclusion in this study

          -  Patients who give informed consent (or their personal/nominated consultee) to
             participate in the study

          -  Patients who are likely to have an arterial line for at least 48 hours.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients not indicated or contraindicated for an arterial line

          -  Refusal of consent by a patient or their personal/nominated consultee to participate

          -  Not for use with patients with uncorrected hyperphosphataemia, hypocalcaemia or
             hypercalcaemia.

          -  The patient is considered by the investigator to be unsuitable for the study

        Arterial line location/placement is not dictated by this study, however the following
        criteria should be considered when deciding if arterial catheter placement is suitable,
        including but not limited to:

          -  peripheral vascular disease,

          -  history of placement site neuropathy or chronic pain,

          -  history of placement extremity coagulopathy or clot formation,

          -  history of vascular surgery on same extremity as catheter placement (and/or vascular
             grafts)

          -  patients with a plan for perioperative anticoagulation. These patients are at
             increased risk of known complications such as bleeding and arteriospasm and should be
             excluded in order to mitigate patient study risk.
