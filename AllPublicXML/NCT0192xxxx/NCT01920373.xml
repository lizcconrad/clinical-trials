      1.0 BACKGROUND AND HYPOTHESES

      1.1 Osteoarthritis is a continuous and entirely physiologic adaptive process that occurs in
      every joint. These include the replication of cells that produce matrix, enzymes, protease
      inhibitors, cytokines, and other peptides. Along with the synthesis of new tissue there is a
      release of breakdown products into the synovial fluid. Enzymes and phagocytes are required to
      clear these breakdown products. Normal tissue turnover involves synthesis and breakdown in
      well-regulated balance. In the degenerative state this balance is upset producing
      inflammation-derived alterations to the synovium, cartilage, capsule, tendons, and bone.
      Common causes of such alterations include increased loading, physical stress, and traumatic
      injury to the joint.

      1.2 The rationale for the use of corticosteroids in temporomandibular joint therapy is that
      they inhibit prostaglandin synthesis and decrease the activity of collagenase and other
      enzymes that degrade the articular cartilage. Platelet rich plasma is a novel therapeutic
      agent that has several potential advantages over corticosteroids for the treatment of
      degenerative pathology of the temporomandibular joint. Platelet rich plasma has been shown to
      have anti-inflammatory, analgesic, and anti-bacterial properties. It also restores
      intra-articular hyaluronic acid, increases glycosaminoglycan condrocyte synthesis, balances
      joint angiogenesis, and provides a scaffold for stem cell migration. Autologous platelet rich
      plasma injections for treatment of knee cartilage degenerative lesions and osteoarthritis
      have shown longer efficacy than hyaluronic acid injections in reducing pain and recovering
      articular function. Similarly, platelet rich plasma has shown to have better outcomes than
      corticosteroid injections in the management of lateral epicondylitis, and better outcomes
      than hyaluronic acid injections in the management of osteochondral lesions of the talus.

      1.3 Current treatments for degeneration and osteoarthritis of the temporomandibular joint are
      focused primarily on palliation by reducing inflammation and inflammatory mediators. This
      study seeks to validate a therapeutic agent that has the potential to actively prevent the
      progression of degeneration in addition to reducing pain and inflammation

      2.0 OBJECTIVES AND PURPOSE

      2.1 The purpose of this study is to compare the efficacy, in terms of pain relief and
      improvement in function, of intra-articular injections with platelet rich plasma versus the
      current standard which is corticosteroid injections into the temporomandibular joint.

        Inclusion Criteria: The following diagnostic criteria for patient selection are to be used:

          -  Patients will need to have a history of chronic pain (at least 3 months) refractory to
             conservative therapy with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medications, muscle
             relaxants, diet modifications and splint therapy

          -  Patients will also need to have imaging findings (radiography or magnetic resonance
             imaging) that show mild to severe degenerative changes of the temporomandibular joint
