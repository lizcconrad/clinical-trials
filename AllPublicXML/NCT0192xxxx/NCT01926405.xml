  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hypersomnia is defined as a reduced ability to remain awake during the day. There are
      basically two types of central hypersomnia: narcolepsy and idiopathic hypersomnia. Currently,
      the diagnosis of these sleep disorders is based on polysomnographic recordings which is
      difficult to access. Tests of sleepiness (Epworth, Karolinska) are subjective.

      A biological marker of sleepiness, easily accessible and measurable, would be very useful for
      the diagnosis and therapeutic follow up of excessive diurnal sleepiness. Salivary secretions
      appear as good physiological markers. Studies have shown for healthy subjects, that the
      expression and activity of salivary amylase are increased when subjects are deprived of
      sleep.

      The investigators propose to explore the usefulness of salivary biomarkers (including
      amylase) as a new non-invasive and simple technique for the assessment of excessive daytime
      sleepiness.
