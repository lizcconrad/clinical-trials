  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate whether intake of protein supplement just before
      meals lowers the blood sugar levels after the meals. It is believe that pre-meal
      administration of a high-protein supplement can effectively improve glycemic control in type
      2 diabetes (DM).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      11.3% of the population aged 20 years or older (25.6 million individuals) has diabetes. In
      the population aged 65 years or older, the prevalence of diabetes reaches to 26.9%.

      Type 2 DM is caused by insulin resistance accompanied by insufficient compensatory insulin
      response. Therefore insulin secretagogues are a significant component of the therapeutic
      armamentarium. Insulin secretagogues, such as sulphonylureas and meglitinides, are routinely
      prescribed to lower post prandial glucose levels in type 2 DM. However, these medications are
      cleared by the liver and the kidneys and cannot be used in the presence of relevant
      co-morbidities. These medicines can also cause side effects, including hypoglycemia.
      Limitations of these medicines are likely to lead diabetic patients and their health care
      providers to seek alternate methods to treat postprandial hyperglycemia. Thus, our research
      which aims to identify an alternate insulin secretagogue is important and timely.

      Whey protein (WP), a rich source of essential and branch chain (BC) amino acids (AA), is a
      potent insulin secretagogue. Although it is well known that protein and/or AA intakes
      stimulate insulin secretion, protein supplements are not being used clinically in order to
      lower post-prandial glycemia. WP can be a satisfactory alternative to the pharmaceutical
      insulin secretagogues.
