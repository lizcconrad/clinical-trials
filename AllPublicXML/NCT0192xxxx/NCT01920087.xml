  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to test the efficacy of ATNC05 in the treatment of Atypical
      Facial Pain (AFP), also known as Persistent Idiopathic Facial Pain (PIFP). This research
      project targets patients with chronic constant facial pain and excludes patients with
      primarily paroxysmal pain.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      ATNC05 is a rational combination of two well-characterized drugs with decades of clinical
      use. The investigators hypothesize that the combination acts synergistically to reduce AFP.

      The trial consists of a double-blind treatment period of twelve weeks with either Placebo or
      ATNC05. Subjects who do not respond to the study medication will continue on to a twelve week
      Open-Label extension phase, during which they will receive ATNC05.

      The subjects will have six office visits during the Double-Blind phase. Subjects continuing
      to the Open-Label phase will have four additional visits.

      Data gathering procedures include daily pain questionnaire forms, as well as questionnaires
      and physical examination during office visits.
