  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to test effectiveness of an environmental intervention
      designed to encourage healthy food intake during meals. It is hypothesized that fruit,
      vegetable, whole grain, lean protein, and low-fat dairy consumption will increase during the
      intervention. It is also hypothesized that nutrition knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors will
      change as a result of the intervention. The findings from this study will provide insight
      into the applicability of this intervention in military dining facilities.

    <textblock>
      Previous studies attempting to increase consumption of healthy foods in military dining
      facilities have had mixed results, and alternative approaches need to be considered. The
      present intervention was designed with the results of previous studies in mind, and as such,
      does not focus on labeling only healthy food choices. Instead, the present intervention aims
      to encourage consumption of nutritionally well-balanced meals using an environmental cue in
      military dining facilities.
