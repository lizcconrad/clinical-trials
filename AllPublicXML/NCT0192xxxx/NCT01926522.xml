  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Recent studies witnessed how physical exercise may interrupt the devastating decrease of
      muscle performance in DSP and further experiments are underway to find more exercises for the
      recovery of motor function impairment. In fact the rehabilitation treatment, that aims at
      reducing motor disability, preserving gait functions and preventing falling risks, is an
      interesting therapeutic approach. Literature recommends balance re-training exercises, muscle
      strengthening, selective stretching and retraining of motor activity.

      New technologies produced in the recent decades different devices used in strengthening
      exercises (electromechanical dynamometers), balance recovery (balance platforms) and gait
      (analyzing treadmills) have visual feedbacks through which the patients may independently
      monitor accuracy and intensity of their exercises, being therefore strongly motivated and
      resulting in a high training intensity. These technologies are often used in rehabilitation
      of different patients, but are rarely employed for DSP.

      The purpose of this case control study was to examine the effectiveness of the application of
      analysing treadmill, muscle strengthening and balance training compared to a control
      intervention in patients with diabetic neuropathy.

    <description>All evaluation procedures are performed by the same examiner who was blinded to the aims of the study and to which group the participants are allocated. The 6-minute walk test (6MWT) is used to assess endurance.
The 6MWT quantifies functional mobility based on the distance in meters traveled in six minutes. This outcome is a measure of endurance and is particularly significant to evaluate the possibility to perform continuative tasks, that are particularly important for the rehabilitation of diabetic patients and are relevant for an autonomous life. Subjects are instructed to walk at a comfortable speed and subjects neurological are able to use assistive devices.</description>

    <description>Control group receives the same number of treatment sessions of same duration as those in the experimental group: activities targeted to improve the endurance (instead of analyzing treadmill ), manual exercises of lower limb muscle strengthening, stretching exercises (instead of dynamometer), gait retraining on the floor for 20 minutes and static and dynamic balance exercises in upright position (instead of dynamic balance platform).</description>

    <description>The length of stride of reference used during the exercise is personalized and depends on the height of patients. Each patient carries out the feedback for 20 minutes with the aim of generating the most symmetric and regular gait.
Patients, with the dynamometer, work on strengthening of flexor and extensor muscles with ankle speeds at 90°/sec and 120°/sec. The strengthening technique was performed twice for 10 minutes each time with a 1 minute rest between sets.
The session ends with a 20-minute feedback on dynamic balance platform by carrying out exercises in which they need to reach randomly appearing targets. Subjects begin with 12 minutes the first 4 sessions, progress to 16 minutes the next 2 sessions, then 18' (2 sessions), and finally 20', if able, during the last 4 sessions.</description>
