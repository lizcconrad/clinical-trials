      A study was to evaluate the safety and plasma concentration changes of quetiapine after
      repeated administration of FK949E (extended-release formulation of quetiapine) in patients
      with major depressive disorder (MDD).

      The objective of the study was to evaluate the safety and pharmacokinetics of multiple oral
      doses of FK949E (extended-release formulation of quetiapine) of three doses in patients with
      major depressive disorder (MDD).

      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Diagnosis of major depressive disorder by the M.I.N.I. according to the DSM-IV-TR

          -  Female patients of childbearing potential with a negative serum pregnancy test result

             study.

          -  Patients who could understand and comply with the requirements of the study, as judged
             by the investigator/sub-investigator.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  A current or past history of a DSM-IV-TR Axis I disorder other than major depressive
             disorder within 6 months prior to provision of written informed consent.

          -  Diagnosis of a DSM-IV-TR Axis II disorder that was considered to have a major impact
             on the patient's current psychiatric status.

          -  A history of substance or alcohol abuse or dependence excluding caffeine and nicotine.

          -  Patients who were unable to abstain from drugs that induce or inhibit the
             drug-metabolizing enzyme CYP3A4 from 14 days prior to screening assessment and
             throughout the study period.

          -  Patients showing evidence or signs of renal or hepatic failure, serious heart disease,

          -  Patients being treated for hypertension or patients with clinical finding that in the
             opinion of the investigator/sub-investigator could be negatively affected by the study
             or that would affect the study results (e.g., hypertension, unstable angina).

          -  Patients with concomitant hypotension or orthostatic hypotension (hypotension is
             defined as systolic blood pressure of less than 100 mmHg)

          -  Conditions that could affect absorption and metabolism of the study medication (e.g.,
             malabsorption syndrome, liver disease)

          -  A current diagnosis of malignant tumor unless in remission for at least 5 years
             (except basal or squamous cell skin carcinoma).

          -  A history of transient ischemic attack (TIA).

          -  A history of seizure disorder, except for febrile convulsions

          -  Application of electroconvulsive therapy within 90 days prior to the start of study
             drug administration

          -  Use of a depot antipsychotic injection and inability to be off the drug for a period
             of twice the dosing interval prior to screening assessment and throughout the study
             period

          -  A score of â‰¥ 3 on the HAM-D17 Item (suicide) or a suicide attempt within the past 6
             months. Patients judged to be at serious suicidal or homicidal risk in the opinion of
             the investigator/sub-investigator.
