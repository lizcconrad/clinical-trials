  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This Phase II study will evaluate the safety and efficacy of three fluoroquinolone ophthalmic
      agents to determine the optimal treatment in patients with infectious corneal ulcers.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, single masked, comparative, mono-therapeutic trial evaluating three
      fluoroquinolone agents that are approved and marketed for the treatment of conjunctivitis.
      Approximately 120 patients who have corneal ulcers greater than 2 mm but less than 6 mm in
      size who meet all other inclusion criteria will be enrolled into this study. Patients will be
      randomized in a 2:1:1 ratio to receive besifloxacin 0.6% ophthalmic suspension, gatifloxacin
      0.5% ophthalmic solution, or moxifloxacin 0.5% ophthalmic solution.
