        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patient 30 years of age or older

          -  Pathologically confirmed pancreatic cancer (biopsy may be performed at our
             institution)

          -  No evidence of metastases(a)

          -  decide performe Roux-en-Y(b)

          -  single Roux-en-Y reconstruction is technically feasible(c)

          -  Patients will be registered and consent obtained, if the surgeon believes there is no
             evidence of metastases. If metastatic disease is identified at the time of operation,
             the patient will not be randomized.

          -  Patients will be conditionally enrolled, and consent obtained, if the surgeon believes
             the patient may need a sngle Roux-en-Y at the time of operation. If a sngle Roux-en-Y
             is not performed, the patient will not be randomized.

          -  the surgeon feels that the single Roux-en-Y is not technically feasible at the time of
             operation,the patients will be excluded. This may be due to prior abdominal surgery,
             anatomic variants, or anything else at the surgeon's discretion.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Not expected to be able to provide follow-up over 2 years (due to geographic or other
             limitations)
