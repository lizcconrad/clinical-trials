  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Since decades, D-Cycloserine (DCS, drug class: Oxazolidinone) is proven to be an effective
      antibiotic agent in the treatment of tuberculosis. Furthermore it takes action in the central
      nervous system as an partial agonist on NMDA receptors. Because of glutamate mediated
      neuronal long-term potentiation in long-term memory DCS has an augmenting effect on emotional
      learning, as it occurs in exposure therapy of anxiety disorders. In this context we use DCS
      in addition to exposure therapy as a part of cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) in patients
      suffering from agoraphobia with or without panic disorder. Thereby DCS is applicated oral as
      a capsule of 50mg, on three consecutive therapy sessions.

      The present study is a multicenter study with two participating institutions: The &quot;Klinik für
      Psychiatrie und Psychotherapie, Charité - Universitätsmedizin Berlin&quot; and the &quot;ZPHU - Zentrum
      für Psychotherapie am Institut für Psychologie, Humboldt-Universität zu Berlin&quot;. It is a
      randomized, placebo-controlled and double blind study with agoraphobic patients receiving a
      manualized cognitive behavioral therapy. The randomization and blindness refers to medication
      with an antibiotic called D-Cycloserine: One group receives D-Cycloserine after exposure
      sessions and the other group is treated with a placebo. The aim is to find out, whether or
      not D-Cycloserine augments psychotherapy outcome when administered after an exposure.
      Altogether, 78 patients will be treated. Before therapy, all patients receive a clinical
      examination to ensure that no contraindications for participating (like cardiac defects or
      serious central nervous system diseases) are present. In the following diagnostic sessions
      therapists conduct standardized assessments and after four diagnostic sessions therapy
      starts. All patients receive six therapy sessions, whereof three consist of exposures. When
      exposures are successful, D-Cycloserine or Placebo is administered afterwards. At the last
      therapy session another clinical examination to control several parameters is conducted. One
      month after therapy, two follow-up sessions with assessments take place.

    <description>The PAS is designed for patients with agoraphobia or panic disorder who are at least 15 years old. It can be used to determine the severity of the disorder or to examine therapeutic success. There is a self-rating and a clinician-rating version available with 14 items each, yet the items are the same in both versions. Answers are given on a five-point Likert scale from &quot;0&quot; to &quot;4&quot; with higher scores indicating a higher severity. For determination of the severity of the disorder, 13 items are summed up, only item &quot;U&quot; (asking if panic attacks occur expected or unexpected) is not considered, resulting in scores between 0 and 52. There are also five sub scores if only special contents are of interest: Panic attacks, agoraphobic avoidance, anticipatory anxiety, disability, and worries about health.
For the present study the German version of the questionnaire is used.</description>
