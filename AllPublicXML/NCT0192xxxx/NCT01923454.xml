      This study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of immediate anterior chamber paracentesis
      (ACP) with a 30-gauge needle as an initial treatment for acute primary angle closure (APAC).

    <textblock>
      This is a prospective study from patients with APAC presenting at the Faculty of Medicine
      Siriraj Hospital, Bangkok, Thailand in 2005. At presentation, patients received immediate ACP
      with a 30-gauge needle. The IOP, best corrected visual acuity (BCVA), corneal edema grading,
      pupil size and symptoms were recorded at immediately, 15 and 30 minutes, and then 1, 24 and
      48 hours after paracentesis. All affected eyes received antiglaucomatous medications 60
      minutes after ACP and underwent peripheral iridotomy within 24 hours.

    <time_frame>Change of intraocular pressure between before paracentesis and at 48 hours after paracentesis</time_frame>
    <description>The intraocular pressure (IOP) was recorded at immediately(within 2 minutes after paracentesis), 15 and 30 minutes, and then 1, 24 and 48 hours after paracentesis. The change of IOP was study between before paracentesis and at each time-point. All affected eyes received antiglaucomatous medications 60 minutes after paracentesis and underwent peripheral iridotomy within 24 hours.</description>

    <description>This is to observe the potential complications which may occur during and after paracentesis with a 30-gauge needle. Among the potential complications include lens capsular rupture, hyphema, retinal hemorrhage, hypotony and infection. The study will record each complications as numbers of events at each time-point until 48 hours after paracentesis</description>

    <description>Immediate anterior chamber paracentesis (ACP) with a 30-gauge needle as an initial treatment for acute primary angle closure.
Acetamide, given in this study, is a standard treatment for acute angle-closure glaucoma. The participant will receive 1 tablet(250mg) at 1 hours after paracentesis. The following dose will be adjusted according to the level of IOP. The maximal dose is 4 tablets per day. It will be discontinued if the IOP is less than 21 mmHg.
All affected eyes will receive laser peripheral iridotomy with 24 hours after presentation. This a standard treatment for Acute angle-closure glaucoma</description>

    <description>At presentation, patients received immediate anterior chamber paracentesis with a 30-gauge needle. The intraocular pressure (IOP) was recorded at immediately, 15 and 30 minutes, and then 1, 24 and 48 hours after paracentesis. The IOP was compared between before paracentesis and each time-point after paracentesis. All affected eyes received antiglaucomatous medications 60 minutes after ACP and underwent peripheral iridotomy within 24 hours.</description>

    <description>All participants will receive oral acetazolamide (250 mg) 1 tablet at 1 hour after paracentesis to lower the intraocular pressure. After that, the dose of acetazolamide will be adjusted according to the level of intraocular pressure. If the eye pressure goes to normal (lower than 21 mmHg), acetazolamide will be discontinued.</description>

    <description>All affected eyes underwent laser peripheral iridotomy within 24 hours after presentation. This procedure is a standard treatment for acute angle-closure. The fellow eyes will receive laser peripheral iridotomy in the same occasion or later to prevent acute angle-closure in the future.</description>
