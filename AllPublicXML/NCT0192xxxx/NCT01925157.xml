    <textblock>
      The main purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety of the study drug known as LY3090106
      in healthy participants and in participants with RA who are having an inadequate response to
      methotrexate (MTX). The study will investigate how the body processes the study drug and how
      the study drug affects the body. The study will last about 3 months for each participant.
