  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the steady-state pharmacokinetics (PK) and confirm the dose of
      ritonavir (RTV)-boosted elvitegravir (EVG/r). This study will also evaluate the safety,
      tolerability, and antiviral activity of elvitegravir (EVG) administered with a background
      regimen containing a ritonavir-boosted protease inhibitor (PI/r) in HIV-1 infected,
      antiretroviral (ARV) treatment-experienced pediatric participants.

      The study consists of 2 parts: Part A and Part B. Part A will enroll participants with
      suppressed viremia (HIV-1 RNA &lt; 50 copies/mL) or failing a current ARV regimen (HIV-1 RNA &gt;
      1,000 copies/mL) to evaluate the steady state PK and confirm the dose of EVG. Part B will
      enroll participants who are failing a current ARV regimen (HIV-1 RNA &gt; 1,000 copies/mL) to
      evaluate the safety, tolerability, and antiviral activity of EVG.
