    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the hypothesis that, in patients with stable
      vitiligo unresponsive to conventional treatments including traditional phototherapy and/or
      topical steroids, the application of a non-cultured autologous hair follicle
      outer-root-sheath melanocytes suspension in the area affected by the disease followed by
      targeted ultraviolet B (UVB) phototherapy can lead to a significant skin repigmentation. To
      assess the effect of the proposed treatment, a within-subject controlled study involving
      selected symmetric lesion areas localized to the back of the hands will be conducted.

    <description>The treatment consists in depositing a suspension of autologous outer-root-sheath melanocytes, derived from patient's plucked hair follicles, and patient's own serum on the area affected by vitiligo, after properly preparation with dermabrasion. Afterwards a targeted UVB phototherapy will be carried out by patients at home for 3 days / week from the beginning of the 5th week after transplantation till the end of the study period (12th week).</description>
