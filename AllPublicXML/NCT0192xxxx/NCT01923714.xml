  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims at validating in real-life clinical practice and using the self-reported
      Glaucoma Symptom Scale (GSS) questionnaire, the impact of a switch to preservative-free
      dorzolamide/timolol fixed combination (DTFC) in patients using preserved topical therapy for
      glaucoma.

      The study is an 8-week multi-center, prospective, observational and non-interventional,
      open-label study aiming at assessing a change in visual-related quality of life of glaucoma
      patients that switch therapy to preservative-free DTFC. As a non-interventional study, the
      decision for the to switch was at the discretion of the physician. Patients scheduled to
      switch therapy to preservative free DTFC will be asked to fill in the 10 item, linkert-type
      GSS questionnaire at baseline, at week 4 and at week 8 of therapy switch.

      The study data will be collected at a baseline and at 2 follow-up visits occurring 4 weeks
      +/- 1 week and 8 weeks +/- 1 week. If no visit was scheduled, the patient was asked to send
      the completed documents to the physician.

             drops (as monotherapy or replacement of one preserved product of a combined therapy)
