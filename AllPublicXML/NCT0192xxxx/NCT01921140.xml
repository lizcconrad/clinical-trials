  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a 3 part study for patients with solid tumours. The purpose of Part A is to measure
      the amount of olaparib or its breakdown products in the bloodstream for up to 72 hours after
      eating and the effect of olaparib on QT interval following a single oral dose of olaparib
      tablets. Part B will determine the effect of olaparib on the QT interval following multiple
      oral dosing. Part C will allow patients continued access to olaparib tablets and will provide
      additional safety data collection.

        hypokalaemia, family history of long QT syndrome).
