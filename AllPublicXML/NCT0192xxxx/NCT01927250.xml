      Combination of wellness programs may be one of the best approaches to improve quality of
      life; however, the effectiveness of a treatment that combines various programs is also yet to
      be clarified. This study investigated the influence of Okada Health and Wellness program on
      the quality of life for healthy people and those with illness in Japan. Okada Health and
      Wellness program consists of 3 components: diet, art and biofield therapy.
