  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a national multicenter, double-blind, randomized, parallel-group trial of 12 months
      in duration. Following a 4 week wash-out period, subjects will be randomized to one of 2
      treatment groups: (1) galantamine CR 24 mg/day with dose-titration over twelve
      weeks[maintenance phase from week 9], (2) a combination of galantamine CR 24 mg/day plus
      memantine 10 mg b.i.d. with a dose titration of sixteen weeks (12 weeks for galantamine
      [maintenance phase from week 9], additional 4 weeks for memantine).

    <textblock>
      Based on 1. the established efficacy of both, galantamine and memantine in subjects with
      Alzheimer's disease, 2. galantamine's dual mode of action being a cholinesterase inhibitor
      and an allosteric modulator of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) an effect which
      might lead to enhanced neurotransmission in other neuronal populations, i.e., glutamatergic
      and GABAergic, 3. memantine's neuroprotective properties, which have been demonstrated in
      several experimental system, but not yet in a clinical setting the primary hypothesis is
      formulated that treatment with a combination of galantamine plus memantine, which may exert
      additional effects on the level of neurotransmitter modulation, will reduce the
      memory/cognitive problems in AD patients. The effects of the combination therapy will be
      compared to galantamine effects alone.

      As a secondary hypothesis, it is proposed that a combination treatment with galantamine plus
      memantine could conceivably slow disease progression and/or delay the progression of dementia
      in probable AD. It is reasonable to assume that the effect will be clearer with a combination
      therapy (galantamine, memantine) than with cholinesterase inhibitors alone which have been
      evaluated in long-term clinical trials (rivastigmine, donepezil, galantamine). To corroborate
      a potential disease modifying effect and to more reliably separate it from a purely
      symptomatic effect, the disease progress will not only be tracked by clinical measures (CDR
      rating), but also by using volumetric MRI techniques. Fox et al. have developed a sensitive
      method to follow changes in overall brain volume over time. In 'normal' ageing about
      0.2%/year (SD 0.3%) change in brain volume is documented, whereas in AD, changes of 2.8%/year
      (SD 1%) are measured. People 'at risk' for developing AD show changes of about 1.5%/year.
      Recently it was established that rates of hippocampal atrophy correlate with change in
      clinical status in ageing ('conversion') and AD. Overall, brain atrophy or MRI delineated
      hippocampal volumes and memory decline seem to be clearly linked. The project will
      prospectively investigate the validity of investigations of hippocampal volume in assessing
      therapeutic effects in AD. MR-proton-spectroscopy provides consistent evidence that the
      neuronal marker Nacetylaspartat (NAA) is reduced in AD, whereas the role of myo-inositol,
      choline and creatine is less clear. NAA is thought to be present exclusively in neurons in
      gray matter and in their axonal processes in white matter and not in glial cells. NAA signal
      loss suggests neuronal loss when it is observed in gray matter and loss of or damage to
      axonal structures when it is observed in white matter. A correlation of NAA decrease in
      tissue samples of patients with AD with the number of senile plaques and neurofibrillary
      tangles was reported. Recent results indicate that the severity of dementia in patients with
      AD is positively correlated with the decrease in NAA/Cr only in the parietal cortex and in
      the temporal lobe. These data are consistent with the observation that the amount of synaptic
      loss is the dominant indicator of dementia in AD. The cognitive decline in patients with AD
      may be linked with a neuronal loss or dysfunction preferentially in the temporoparietal
      association cortex. This project will prospectively investigate the validity of spectroscopic
      abnormalities in assessing therapeutic effects in AD.

      The primary objective of this trial is to establish the hypothesis that a combination of
      galantamine plus memantine improves memory/cognitive performance to a larger extent than
      galantamine monotherapy in AD subjects after one year of double-blind treatment.

      Memory/cognitive performance will be assessed with the ADAS-cog/11. The confirmatory
      statistical assessment of this hypothesis will be based on the change of the ADAS-cog/11 from
      baseline to the end of the treatment period.

      Additional endpoint variables to be assessed in an exploratory manner in parallel to the
      ADAS-cog are:

        -  Preservation of functionality as assessed using the ADCS-ADL/AD scale.

        -  Global rating of dementia as assessed using the CDR rating instrument.

        -  Neuropsychiatric symptoms as assessed using the NPI rating instrument.

        -  Resource utilization as assessed using the RUD rating instrument.

        -  Caregiver burden as assessed using the burden interview (BI).

        -  Safety with adverse event reports, laboratory parameters, vital signs, physical
           examination and ECG

      The secondary hypothesis states that the combination therapy with galantamine plus memantine
      is more effective than galantamine alone in delaying clinical progression of dementia in this
      population over an observation period of one year. Global severity of dementia will be
      assessed with the CDR scale.

      Supplementary endpoint criteria for this hypothesis are:

        -  Reduction in the rate of serial MRI determined brain (hippocampal) atrophy and of
           MRS-based parameters.

        -  Safety with adverse event reports, laboratory parameters, vital signs, physical
           examination and ECG.

      Further analyses of sub-groups (e.g., determined by biological variables) or biological
      outcome measures investigated by the diagnostic module with respect to the above measures are
      planned.

    <description>Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale (ADAS-cog/11) The ADAS consists of two parts - a cognitive subscale and a behavioral subscale. The behavioural subscale will not be used in this trial. The cognitive subscale, the ADAS-cog/11, consisting of Word Recall and Word Recognition memory tests, Object and Finger Naming, Commands, Constructional Praxis, Ideational Praxis, Orientation, Remembering Test Instructions, Spoken Language Ability, Comprehension of Spoken Language and Word Finding Difficulty will be the primary variable in this trial.

This instrument comprises questions about 23 basic and instrumental ADLs. For each ADL, the scores range from 0 (non-performance of the activity or the need for extensive help) to the highest score (representing independent performance of the activity).

Scores are on a scale of 0 - 5, with 0 = no dementia, 0.5 = questionable dementia, 1 = mild dementia, 2 = moderate dementia, 3 = severe dementia, 4 = profound dementia, and 5 = terminal dementia. Cognitive and functional abilities that are assessed are memory, orientation, judgement and problem solving, community affairs, home and hobbies and personal care. Memory is considered the primary driver for scoring with the other categories secondary.</description>

The NPI uses a screening strategy to minimize administration time. Interrater reliability and test-retest reliability are acceptable.</description>

    <description>The Burden Interview (Zarit &amp; Zarit, 1983, 1990) has been designed to assess the stress experienced by family caregivers of elderly and disabled persons. It can be completed by caregivers themselves or as part of an interview. Caregivers are asked to respond to a series of 22 items about the impact of the patient's disabilities on their life. For each item caregivers are to indicate how often they have felt that way: never, rarely, sometimes, quite frequently, or nearly always.
The Burden Interview is scored by summing the responses of the individual items. The total score ranges from 0 to 88. Higher scores indicate greater caregiver distress.</description>
