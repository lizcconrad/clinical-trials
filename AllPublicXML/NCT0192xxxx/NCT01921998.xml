  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Side effects from chemotherapy can be severe in some patients leading to admission to
      hospital, a worse quality of life and delays in subsequent doses of chemotherapy. A blood
      test that could predict patients who will go on to develop severe side effects could be
      useful and might allow early intervention with medicines to reduce the severity of the
      symptoms and prevent admission to hospital.

      This study will collect blood samples from patients with lymphoma or sarcoma who are
      receiving chemotherapy (with an expected admission rate for neutropenic sepsis, one of the
      side effects that most commonly results in hospital admission, of less than 20%). It will
      assess whether changes in blood proteins (&quot;biomarkers&quot;) taken 2 days after the 1st
      chemotherapy can predict subsequent severe side effects throughout the 4 months of
      chemotherapy. In addition the investigators will collect data on quality of life and contact
      with medical professionals to assess the costs of chemotherapy toxicity to both the patient
      and health service. This will allow us in the future to model the cost effectiveness of using
      biomarkers in this manner to try and reduce chemotherapy toxicity.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with lymphoma or sarcoma identified to receive out-patient chemotherapy with
             an anticipated febrile neutropenia rate of less than 20%. This would include 21 day
             R-CHOP in patients under 70 and single agent doxorubicin [Aapro et al, 2011a].

          -  Age 18 or older

          -  Performance Status 0-2

          -  Before patient registration, written informed consent must be given according to
             ICH/GCP, and national regulations.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Past history of HIV, Hepatitis B or C positive, due to the difficulties in handling
             high-risk specimens within CEP.

          -  Major surgery, radiotherapy, chemotherapy or mechanism based agents within the last 4
             weeks.

          -  Radio-immunotherapy within the last 8 weeks.

          -  Bilirubin greater than 1.5 X the upper limit of normal and ALT greater than 2.5 x the
             upper limit of normal (as disturbed liver function tests are associated with elevated
             CK18) [Gonzalez-Quintela et al, 2009, Lavallard et al, 2011]

          -  Presence of any psychological, familial, sociological or geographical condition
             potentially hampering compliance with the study protocol and follow-up schedule; those
             conditions should be discussed with the patient before registration in the trial.
