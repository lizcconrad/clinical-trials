  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      We already demonstrated that the addiction of PBS to Total Laparoscopic Hysterectomy (TLH)
      has no negative effects in term of ovarian function, evaluated by anti-Müllerian hormone
      (AMH), Follicle Stimulating Hormone (FSH), Antral Follicle Count (AFC), mean ovarian
      diameters and Peak Systolic Velocity (PSV). In addition, in our experience, no negative
      surgical outcomes (in terms of operative time, intraoperative blood loss, postoperative
      hospital stay, postoperative return to normal activity and complication rate) are related to
      PBS step in TLH.

      Although the good statistical reliability of our retrospective data, we want to prospectively
      confirm our results. Moreover we aim to refine PBS safety demonstration by collecting also 3D
      ultrasound parameters [AFC, ovarian volume (OV), Vascularization Index (VI), Flow Index (FI)
      and Vascularization Flow Index (VFI)]. Hormonal and ultrasonographic parameters may possibly
      be unified into a new diagnostic algorithm (already at an advanced stage of production in UMG
      Department) able to estimate the ovarian function both in term of reproductive ability that
      in term of distance from menopause.

      We will enroll the first 77 patients who will agree to implement PBS to laparoscopic
      myomectomy (LM) (study group), starting from September 1, 2013. Other 77 patients who will
      ask us to undergo LM without the addiction of PBS will constitute the control group. For each
      patient, ovarian reserve modification before and after surgery will be recorded as the
      primary outcome. Specifically, one month before and three months after laparoscopy, on day 1
      to 4 of menstrual cycles serum AMH, FSH and E2 will be evaluated and a transvaginal
      ultrasound examination (Voluson E8 Expert or Voluson-i - GE Healthcare Ultrasound) to assess
      AFC, OV, VI, FI and VFI, will be carried out by the same experienced ultrasonographist
      responsible for the ambulatory of ovarian reserve in each Unit.

      Ovarian reserve modification will be defined as the difference (expressed as Δ) between
      post-operative and pre-operative values of AMH, FSH, AFC, OV, VI, FI and VFI. For each
      surgical procedure, moreover, operative time, variation of hemoglobin level, postoperative
      hospital stay, postoperative return to normal activity and complication rate will be recorded
      as secondary outcomes.
