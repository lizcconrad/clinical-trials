      A. Objectives &amp; Hypothesis Overactive bladder (OAB) affects over 10 million adults in the
      United States and each year substantial costs are incurred from private and public funds to
      test the efficacy of new and existing drugs for OAB.14 However, effectiveness and adherence
      data from traditional clinical trials are not generalizable to clinical practice.3, 4 In an
      era of limited resources and competing demands, it is essential that cost-effectiveness data
      from clinical trials be generalizable to the clinical world. Pragmatic clinical trials
      measure the effectiveness of treatments in real clinical practice, and in the full spectrum
      of patients that require treatment.5 Pragmatic trials require patient reported outcomes that
      are valid but have low patient burden.5 The conduct of pragmatic clinical trials for OAB has
      been limited by a lack of instruments that have demonstrable validity and reliability in the
      typical clinical setting Pill counts, used to measure primary outcomes in most traditional
      trials, are burdensome in the clinical setting.1610 The optimal instrument for measuring
      utility scores, general quality of life scores for cost-effectiveness analyses for OAB, is
      also not known.

      Although poor adherence carries the potential for continued suffering for patients and wasted
      health care resources, there is a lack of data on the clinical and economic impact of poor
      adherence to treatment for OAB in real-world clinical practice. We have published preliminary
      data that underscores the role of adherence and utilities in the treatment of OAB. 3 Our
      hypothesis is that effectiveness, adherence, and utility preference scores can be measured
      using pragmatic patient reported instruments and that poor adherence is associated with lower
      effectiveness and quality of life in adults with OAB in a clinical setting. Specifically, the
      overriding goal of this proposal is to validate pragmatic instruments to measure
      effectiveness, adherence and utility preference scores and obtain preliminary data on the
      effect of adherence and quality of life in adults undergoing treatment for overactive bladder
      in a clinical setting.

      Specific Aim 1: To determine the validity and responsiveness of pragmatic patient reported
      outcome instruments to measure clinical effectiveness, adherence and utility preference
      scores in adults undergoing treatment with anti-cholinergic medications for overactive
      bladder. We will perform a prospective cohort study of adults with OAB undergoing treatment
      with anti-cholinergic medication. We will compare improvement in urinary symptoms (clinical
      effectiveness), adherence, and change in utility preference scores from baseline to 3 months
      of treatment using new and existing 'gold standard' instruments. The results will be
      informative as to which, if any of these pragmatic instruments, is useful for measuring
      effectiveness, adherence, and utility preference scores in the 'real world' clinical setting.

      Specific Aim 2: To use the newly validated pragmatic instruments to measure the impact of
      adherence on clinical effectiveness and health related quality of life in a real world
      clinical setting in adults undergoing treatment with anti-cholinergic medications for
      overactive bladder. The impact of adherence on clinical effectiveness and health related
      quality of life will be measured through comparisons in adults with high and low adherence to
      anti-cholinergic medication. This aim will corroborate the findings of aim 1 and establish if
      pragmatic instruments are useful in measuring outcomes of effectiveness, adherence and
      utility preference scores. These results will also provide preliminary data on the
      effectiveness of anti-cholinergic medication and the impact of adherence on clinical
      effectiveness and quality of life in the clinical setting.
