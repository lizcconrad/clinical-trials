    <textblock>
      Patients with Chronic Hepatitis B on long term oral antiviral therapy have to continue
      treatment indefinitely unless they achieve HBeAg seroconversion or HBsAg seroclearance, when
      therapy can be stopped. While HBeAg seroconversion is a more achievable endpoint, only 20-25%
      of patients develop this after one year of oral antiviral therapy. HBsAg seroclearance is
      universally infrequent. Strategies to improve these endpoints such as combination oral
      antiviral therapy have not been generally successful and recently studies have examined the
      possibility of switching or adding peginterferon therapy. However these have not been tested
      adequately in the group of patients that have been on long term oral antiviral therapy.
      Consequently this study was conceived to evaluate whether switching or adding peginterferon
      compared to continuing oral antiviral therapy are more efficacious strategies. HBeAg positive
      and HBeAg negative patients (n=310)will be randomised to continue oral antiviral therapy,
      switch or add pegylated interferon for 48 weeks in a ratio of 1:2:2 respectively. The study
      endpoints are HBsAg seroclearance, reduction of qHBsAg &gt;1 log, qHBsAg&lt;200 IU/ml, HBeAg loss
      and seroconversion, and HBV DNA suppression, all at week 72.

      1. HYPOTHESIS AND OBJECTIVES PEG-IFN as an immunomodulatory agent could potentiate the
           antiviral efficacy of patients on long term nucleos(t)ide analogue therapy and improve
           early indicators of efficacy, HBeAg loss and reduction in qHBsAg. This study will also
           test whether add-on compared to switch PEG-IFN is superior, if at all.

        2. STUDY DESIGN This is a randomized, open-label, active-controlled study to evaluate
           safety and the efficacy of HBeAg loss or reduction in qHBsAg &gt;1 log in nucleos(t)ide
           analogue treated chronic hepatitis B subjects who will be treated with add on PEG (A),
           switch to PEG (B) or continued nucleos(t)ide analogue (C) for 48 weeks. Patients
           randomized to Arm B will have a one-month overlap period when switching from existing NA
           to PEG monotherapy. This is to prevent viral rebound during the switch. Patients will be
           randomized in a 2:2:1 ratio to one of the 3 treatment arms A, B, and C. Arms A and B are
           experimental arms. Arm C is the control arm.

        3. STUDY POPULATION Approximately 255 subjects will be enrolled into this study.

      4.1 Study Treatment

      Product, Dose, and Mode of Administration:

      Peginterferon α-2b (PEG), 1.5 μg/kg, will be administered weekly by subcutaneous injection
      for the specified period of time (see Study Design, Arms A and B). Pegintron® (MSD
      Pharmaceuticals). The dosage will be determined based on the recommended dosing regimen
      stated in the Pegintron product brochure provided by MSD Pharmaceuticals.

      Reference Therapy, Dose, and Mode of Administration:

      Patients will be on their existing nucleosid(t)e analogue therapy comprising lamivudine 100mg
      daily, adefovir 10mg daily, entecavir 0.5mg or 1.0mg daily or tenofovir 300mg daily, (or
      combinations thereof) all taken as oral medication. These will not be provided by the study
      protocol.

      4.2 Method of Assigning Subjects to a Treatment Randomisation will be performed by computer
      generated random codes (performed by Singapore Clinical Research Institute) with a masked
      allocation sequence. Randomization across treatment arms will be stratified by HBeAg status,
      type of nucleosid(t) analogue, and fibroscan score (&lt;8.8 or ≥8.8) to ensure equal
      distribution across the 3 treatment groups.

      4.3 Blinding/Unblinding There will be no blinding of therapy and the study will be conducted
      as an open label study as is standard for interferon clinical trials.
