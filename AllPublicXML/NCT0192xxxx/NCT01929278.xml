  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Clindamycin 1.0% - tretinoin 0.025% gel (CT Gel) is a reformulation of VELAC Gel that
      contains the same active ingredients (clindamycin 1.0% and tretinoin 0.025%) in a modified
      vehicle. This was a single-center, evaluator-blinded, randomized, placebo
      (vehicle)-controlled phase 1 study to evaluate the phototoxic potential of CT Gel using 24
      hour single applications of 3 sets of 3 study patches. The study expected to enroll
      approximately 40 healthy adult volunteers. Each set of study patches consisted of a CT Gel
      patch, a vehicle gel patch, and a blank patch (did not contain CT Gel or vehicle gel).

      After concurrent 24-hour single applications of all 9 patches, 1 set of patches (set A) was
      removed, and those sites were irradiated with 16 joules/cm2 of ultraviolet A light (UVA) and
      0.75 minimal erythema dose (MED) with UVA/ultraviolet B light (UVB). The second set of
      patches (set B) was removed, and those sites were irradiated with 16 joules/cm2 of UVA, 0.75
      MED with UVB/UVA, followed by 15 joules/cm2 of visible light (VIS). The third set of patches
      (set C) was then removed, and those sites served as a non irradiated control. Inflammatory
      responses and other cutaneous effects were scored 1 hour after patch removal and during
      follow-up visits at 24, 48, and 72 hours after patch removal.

    <description>Three CT Gel patches were concurrently applied to designated test sites by trained technicians and held in place with hypoallergenic tape. Patches were prepared no longer than 30 minutes prior to application to study subjects. A minimum distance of ¾ of an inch from patch pad to patch pad was maintained on a subject's back. Approximately 24 ±1 hours after patch application, test patches were removed by trained technicians. Patch sites were evaluated for signs of inflammation according to procedures.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. The capability of understanding and providing signed and dated written voluntary
             informed consent (and any local or national authorization requirements) before any
             protocol-specific procedures were performed.

          2. Male or female subjects aged from 18 to 65 years, inclusive, at time of consent.

          3. The ability to complete the study and to comply with study instructions.

          4. Possessed Fitzpatrick skin type I (always burns easily; never tans), II (always burns
             easily; tans minimally), or III (burns moderately; tans gradually) that would not
             interfere with the reading of any skin responses. Determination of skin types was
             based on sunburn and tanning histories, as well as subjects' opinions of their
             responses to the first 30 to 45 minutes of sun exposure.

          5. Sexually active females of childbearing potential who agreed to use a medically
             acceptable method of contraception while receiving protocol-assigned product. A woman
             of childbearing potential was defined as one who was biologically capable of becoming
             pregnant, including perimenopausal women who were less than 2 years from their last
             menses. Acceptable contraceptive methods included the following:

               -  Hormonal contraception, including oral, injectable, or implantable methods
                  started at least 2 months prior to screening. If hormonal contraception was
                  started less than 2 months prior to screening, then a form of non-hormonal
                  contraception was to have been added until the third continuous month of hormonal
                  contraception was completed.

               -  Two forms of non hormonal contraception, including intrauterine devices or
                  properly used barrier methods (eg, male or female condoms, diaphragm, or cervical
                  cap). Subjects with surgical sterilization, including tubal ligation or partner's
                  vasectomy, were to have used a form of non-hormonal contraception. A barrier
                  method or sterilization plus spermatocide were acceptable.

        Women who were not currently sexually active or lactating agreed to use a medically
        accepted method of contraception if she became sexually active while participating in the
        study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Currently diagnosed with cancer or had a previous history of cancer, including skin
             cancer, or severe photodamaged skin. Severe photodamaged skin was characterized by
             yellow-gray color, wrinkles with no visible normal skin, and prior skin malignancies.

          2. Female subjects who were pregnant, attempting to become pregnant, or breast feeding.

          3. Received any investigational drug within 4 weeks of study day 1 or who were scheduled
             to receive an investigational drug other than the study product during the study.

          4. Used contraindicated prescription drugs within 4 weeks or 5 half-lives, whichever was
             longer, of first dose of study product, unless agreed as not clinically relevant by
             the principal investigator and the project physician.

          5. Participated in a previous study of the same study product.

          6. Current use of any medication which, in the opinion of the investigator, may have
             affected the evaluation of the study product or placed the subject at undue risk.

          7. Suffered from any disease or condition which, in the opinion of the investigator, may
             have affected the evaluation of the study product or placed the subject at undue risk.

          8. Any major illness within 30 days before the screening examination.

          9. Considered immunocompromised or using immunosuppressant drugs.

             products (ie, test and comparator products), to the hypoallergenic tape, or to the
             cotton patches.

         12. Clinically relevant history or presence of respiratory (including chronic asthma

         15. Current use or expected use of photosensitizing medications (over-the-counter and
             prescription), herbal supplements, or any use of a known photosensitizing material.

         16. Clinically significant skin diseases contraindicating participation or interfering
             with test site evaluations, including psoriasis, eczema, atopic dermatitis, acne,
             dysplastic nevi, or other skin pathologies.

         17. Investigator inability to evaluate the skin in and around the potential test sites due
             to sunburns, unevenness in skin tones, tattoos, scars, excessive hair, freckles,

             prior to screening visit 1, or expected to begin injections during study
             participation.

         20. Used antihistamines or prescription anti inflammatory drugs within 72 hours of the day
             1 visit. Permitted exceptions were acetaminophen at recommended doses and aspirin at
             doses of ≤81 mg/day.

         21. Participated in any patch test study for irritation or sensitization or any test
             involving ultraviolet exposures within the last 4 weeks.

         22. Employees of Hill Top Research or Stiefel Laboratories involved in the study, or an
             immediate family member (partner, offspring, parents, siblings, or sibling's
