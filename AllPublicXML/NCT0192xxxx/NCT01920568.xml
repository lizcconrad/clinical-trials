  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, double-blind, double-dummy study designed to provide bridging data in
      an Asian population to Amgen's studies of denosumab in subjects with bone metastases from
      solid tumors. The study is designed to provide data to a large global dataset of phase-III
      studies including breast cancer, prostate cancer, and all solid tumors, plus multiple
      myeloma, to support the regulatory approval for marketing and patient access to denosumab for
      the prevention of SREs in Chinese subjects with bone metastases from solid tumors. The
      primary objective of this study is to evaluate and compare the percent change from baseline
      to Week 13 in the bone marker urinary amino-terminal cross-linking telopeptide of type I
      collagen (uNTx) corrected for urine creatinine (uNTx/uCr) in subjects treated with denosumab
      to those treated with zoledronic acid. The study is designed to test the superiority of
      denosumab over zoledronic acid.

    <measure>Percent Change (Chg) From Baseline (BL) to Week (Wk)13 in Urinary Amino-terminal Cross-linking Telopeptide of Type I Collagen Corrected for Urine Creatinine (uNTx/uCr)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (BL) and Week (Wk) 13</time_frame>
    <description>uNTx/uCr is the bone turnover marker correlated with the presence and extent of metastases, and the prognosis and response to bone targeted treatment (trt). uNTx/uCr was expressed in nanomoles bone collagen equivalent per millimole (nM BCE/mM). Primary objective: to compare the effect of denosumab with that of zoledronic acid on % chg from BL in uNTx/uCr at Wk 13 in par. of Asian ancestry with bone metastases from solid tumors. BL value is the most recent, non-missing value prior to or on the 1st study trt dose date. Chg from BL is the value at Wk13 minus BL value. Percent chg from BL is the chg from BL / BL value * 100. For missing Wk 13 observations, the last post-BL value was carried forward to obtain the Wk 13 value.</description>

    <description>An AE is defined as any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease (new or exacerbated) temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product. A serious adverse event (SAE) is any untoward medical occurrence that, at any dose results in death, is life-threatening, requires hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, results in disability/incapacity, or is a congenital anomaly/birth defect or other events that may jeopardize the participant or may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcome listed above, liver injury and impaired liver function and grade 4 laboratory abnormalities.

    <description>Clinical chemistry parameters were measured at the Screening and Weeks 2, 5, 9, 13, 25, 37, and 53 visits. Clinical chemistry parameters measured on-study included albumin, alkaline phosphatase (ALP), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), total bilirubin, calcium (Ca), creatinine, magnesium, and phosphorous (P) inorganic. All reported values are of participants with worst-case on-therapy increase to the specified grade: Any increase, that is, worst-case increase to grade 1, 2, 3, or 4 (any grade); worst-case increase to grade 3 (WC G3); and worst-case increase to grade 4 (WC G4). The National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI-CTCAE) was used for grading. Participants with missing Baseline grade were assumed to have a Baseline grade of 0. The worst-case during the on-therapy period was determined taking into account both scheduled and unscheduled assessments.</description>

        <title>Percent Change (Chg) From Baseline (BL) to Week (Wk)13 in Urinary Amino-terminal Cross-linking Telopeptide of Type I Collagen Corrected for Urine Creatinine (uNTx/uCr)</title>
        <description>uNTx/uCr is the bone turnover marker correlated with the presence and extent of metastases, and the prognosis and response to bone targeted treatment (trt). uNTx/uCr was expressed in nanomoles bone collagen equivalent per millimole (nM BCE/mM). Primary objective: to compare the effect of denosumab with that of zoledronic acid on % chg from BL in uNTx/uCr at Wk 13 in par. of Asian ancestry with bone metastases from solid tumors. BL value is the most recent, non-missing value prior to or on the 1st study trt dose date. Chg from BL is the value at Wk13 minus BL value. Percent chg from BL is the chg from BL / BL value * 100. For missing Wk 13 observations, the last post-BL value was carried forward to obtain the Wk 13 value.</description>

          <title>Percent Change (Chg) From Baseline (BL) to Week (Wk)13 in Urinary Amino-terminal Cross-linking Telopeptide of Type I Collagen Corrected for Urine Creatinine (uNTx/uCr)</title>
          <description>uNTx/uCr is the bone turnover marker correlated with the presence and extent of metastases, and the prognosis and response to bone targeted treatment (trt). uNTx/uCr was expressed in nanomoles bone collagen equivalent per millimole (nM BCE/mM). Primary objective: to compare the effect of denosumab with that of zoledronic acid on % chg from BL in uNTx/uCr at Wk 13 in par. of Asian ancestry with bone metastases from solid tumors. BL value is the most recent, non-missing value prior to or on the 1st study trt dose date. Chg from BL is the value at Wk13 minus BL value. Percent chg from BL is the chg from BL / BL value * 100. For missing Wk 13 observations, the last post-BL value was carried forward to obtain the Wk 13 value.</description>

        <title>Number of Participants With Worst-case (WC) On-therapy Increase in the Indicated Clinical Chemistry Parameters From Baseline Grade to the Indicated Grade.</title>
        <description>Clinical chemistry parameters were measured at the Screening and Weeks 2, 5, 9, 13, 25, 37, and 53 visits. Clinical chemistry parameters measured on-study included albumin, alkaline phosphatase (ALP), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), total bilirubin, calcium (Ca), creatinine, magnesium, and phosphorous (P) inorganic. All reported values are of participants with worst-case on-therapy increase to the specified grade: Any increase, that is, worst-case increase to grade 1, 2, 3, or 4 (any grade); worst-case increase to grade 3 (WC G3); and worst-case increase to grade 4 (WC G4). The National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI-CTCAE) was used for grading. Participants with missing Baseline grade were assumed to have a Baseline grade of 0. The worst-case during the on-therapy period was determined taking into account both scheduled and unscheduled assessments.</description>

        <description>Hematology parameters included hemoglobin, lymphocytes, platelet count, total neutrophils, white blood cell (WBC) count. All reported values are of participants with worst-case on-therapy increase to the specified grade: Any increase, that is, worst-case increase to grade 1, 2, 3, or 4 (any grade); worst-case increase to grade 3 (WC G3); and worst-case increase to grade 4 (WC G4). Participants with missing Baseline grade were assumed to have a Baseline grade of 0. The worst-case during the on-therapy period was determined taking into account both scheduled and unscheduled assessments.</description>
