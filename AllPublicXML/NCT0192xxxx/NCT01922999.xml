  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study will evaluate the safety and efficacy of melatonin supplementation in CKD and ESRD
      patients with sleep disorders to reduce sleep latency times, the number of apnea/hypopneic
      episodes, and prolong duration in rapid eye movement (REM) sleep in CKD and ESRD patients
      with sleep disordered breathing.

      The study will look at the safety and efficacy of melatonin supplementation given to patients
      with chronic kidney disease and end stage renal disease who have sleep disorders to reduce
      sleep latency times, the number of apnea/hypopneic episodes, and prolong duration in rapid
      eye movement (REM) sleep in CKD and ESRD patients with sleep disordered breathing.

    <description>Patients taking melatonin supplement, 1mg or 3mg daily, compared to placebo controlled group will be compared to see who group achieved a 25% reduction in sleep latency or 25% increase in total sleep time at the end of 60 days. Using the Pittsburg Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) questionnaire as the index to measure quality of sleep and sleep patterns. Study will also use Polysomnography testing that will record duration of sleep patterns.</description>
