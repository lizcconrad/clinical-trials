    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and the
      dose limiting toxicities (DLT) of Minnelide™ and to establish the dose of Minnelide™
      recommended for future phase 2 protocol

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1, open label, multicenter, dose-escalation study of safety,
      pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of Minnelide™

      Minnelide™ will be given as a single agent intravenously as a 30-minute infusion daily x 21
      days followed by a 7-day rest period. One cycle will equal 28 days. Dose escalation will
      follow a modified Fibonacci design.

    <measure>To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and the dose limiting toxicities (DLT) of Minnelide™</measure>
    <time_frame>24 months</time_frame>
    <description>The MTD will be determined using a 3 + 3 design and will continue until 2 patients at any dose level experience a DLT. A DLT will be defined as Grade 4 neutropenia lasting ≥ 5 days or Grade 3 or 4 neutropenia with fever and/or infection;Grade 4 thrombocytopenia (or Grade 3 with bleeding);Grade 3 or 4 treatment-related non-hematological toxicity (Grade 3 nausea, vomiting or diarrhea that last &gt; 72 hours despite maximal treatment constitutes a DLT, insufficient treatment will not constitute an exception to the DLT criteria, as this would constitute inadequate conduct of the study); Dosing delay greater than 2 weeks due to treatment-emergent AEs or related severe laboratory abnormalities.</description>

    <description>As part of exploratory PD, the following assessments will be performed:
Biomarkers including CA19-9 (or CA125, CEA if non-secretors for pancreas cancer), CEA and CA125 as applicable, any tumor marker appropriate to the given cancer or that is known to be elevated in a given patient will be evaluated according the Investigator's discretion, prior to every Cycle.

             progressed on standard therapies (surgery, radiotherapy, endocrine therapy,
             chemotherapy), for which effective therapy is not available or for which patients are
             not a candidate for or intolerant of such therapies.

          2. Have one or more metastatic tumors measurable on CT scan or locally advanced
             measurable disease that has clearly progressed after prior treatment per RECIST
             criteria.

             conditions) that could compromise protocol objectives in the opinion of the
             investigator and/or the sponsor.

          8. Participation in concurrent study of an investigational agent or device.
