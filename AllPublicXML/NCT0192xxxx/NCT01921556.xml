      Background The Swiss health ministry launched a national quality program &quot;QualiCCare&quot; in 2011
      to improve healthcare for patients with COPD.

      The aim of this study is to determine whether participation in the COPD quality initiative
      (&quot;QualiCCare&quot;) improves adherence to recommended clinical processes and shows impact on
      patients COPD care and on quality of life in patients with COPD.

      The care in obstructive lung disease study (CAROL) is a cluster-randomized controlled trial
      with randomization on the practice level. Thirty practices will be randomly assigned to
      equally sized intervention group or control group.

      Each General Practioner (GP) of a practice will approach consecutively and regardless the
      reason for the current encounter, COPD patients diagnosed by spirometric evaluation (FEV1/
      FVC &lt; 0.70), aged 45 years older, with a smoking history of = 10 pack-years (PY). GPs in the
      intervention group will receive &quot;QualiCCare&quot; education, which addresses knowledge,
      decision-making and behavioural aspects as well as delivery of care according to COPD quality
      indicators and evidence based key elements. In the control group no educational intervention
      will be applied and COPD patients will be treated as usual. The study period is one year.

      The primary outcome measure is an aggregated score of relevant clinical processes defining
      elements in the care of patients with COPD: smoking cessation counseling, influenza
      vaccination, motivation for physical activity, appropriate pharmacotherapy, patient education
      and collaborative care.

    <description>We use the COPD Assessment Test (CAT). The CAT provides clinicians and patients with a reliable measure of overall COPD-related health status for the assessment and long-term follow-up of individual patients. The CAT is a validated short and simple patient-completed questionnaire that has been developed for use in routine clinical practice to measure the health status and grading the impact of COPD on patients' life. The CAT has very similar discriminative properties to the much more complex SGRQ (St. Georges Respiratory Questionnaire), and is available in different languages. It compromises 8 simple questions, 8 items on a scale 0-5 with a total scoring range of 0-40. CAT score &lt;10 low impact, 10-20 medium impact &gt;30 very high impact of COPD on patients life</description>

    <description>&quot;QualiCCare&quot;education is a training workshop designed to educate professionals on the guidelines but also and particularly governing professional behavior by feedback, reminders and pathways that help to change their attitudes and care behavior. Based on behavioral and learning theory, QualiCCare intervention not only tries to increase knowledge but also internal motivation and decision making by stimuli and resources and by written instruments that guide evidence based decision support.</description>
