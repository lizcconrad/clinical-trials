  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) commonly experience behavioral challenges that
      may be improved with pharmacotherapy, including difficulties with sleep, attention,
      hyperactivity, impulsivity, anxiety, obsessive-compulsive behavior, mood swings, self-injury,
      and aggression. While 34-58% of children with ASD take medication for such behaviors, there
      is wide practice variation nationally and a lack of evidence to support the use of most
      commonly prescribed agents. Complex clinical situations such as this where there is no clear
      &quot;best choice&quot; regarding which behaviors to target and which medications to use lend
      themselves well to the use of a Shared Decision Making (SDM) tool to ensure that
      well-informed parent preferences shape every treatment plan.

      The primary goal of this study is to modify a previously published decision aid about use of
      medication to manage challenging behaviors in children with autism to make it easy to
      implement in practice and then evaluate this version in terms of proximal decisional outcomes
      and parent/child outcomes 3 months later. Providers in a Developmental-Behavioral Pediatric
      clinic will be enrolled and randomly allocated to intervention or control (treatment as
      usual) groups. Initially, providers randomized to the intervention group will test and refine
      the modified intervention. Once the intervention is finalized, eligible patients of
      participating providers will be enrolled in the randomized controlled trial to test the
      efficacy of the intervention. Following the trial, control group providers will be crossed
      over and receive the intervention. Both proximal decisional outcomes (e.g. parent decisional
      conflict, provider amount of SDM, parent knowledge of treatment options) and outcomes 3
      months later (e.g. parenting stress, decisional conflict, and change in child behavioral
      symptoms) will be assessed.

      Approximately 10 providers and 240 of their patients with autism will be included in the
      study. Chart reviews, parental surveys, and recordings of provider-parent-patient
      interactions during the index visit will be collected at baseline (prior to physician
      allocation), during the intervention trial, and after the control group has crossed over.
      Between- and within-group analyses will examine factors associated with parental decisional
      conflict and whether the intervention produces significant improvements in outcomes over and
      above typical autism care. Analyses will include multiple linear regression modeling and
      general linear models / repeated measure models, accounting for data clustered by provider.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      SDM involves clinicians sharing information about treatment options and parents sharing their
      goals, concerns, and preferences to ensure that treatment plans are based on what matters
      most to well-informed parents. SDM often incorporates use of decision aids, which are
      balanced sources of information about treatment options for a particular condition. Decision
      aids consistently increase knowledge, improve treatment expectations, increase active
      participation in decision making, reduce uncertainty about the appropriate course of action,
      and help patients reach decisions that are more aligned with their stated values.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Decisional Conflict</measure>
    <time_frame>At the end of the Day 1 (initial study) visit</time_frame>
    <description>The primary outcome of interest for this study is decisional conflict as measured immediately at the end of the Day 1 initial study clinic visit. This measure will also be collected before the Day 1 visit to be able to compare pre- and post- visit levels of decisional conflict. Additionally, this measure will be collected 3 months after the Day 1 visit to determine levels of ongoing decisional conflict that parents of children with autism experience.
This will be measured using the Decisional Conflict Scale. This is a validated 16-item questionnaire which reports on the uncertainty experienced when feeling uninformed about the alternatives, benefits and risks, unclear about personal values, or unsupported in making a choice.</description>

    <measure>Parent-physician interaction</measure>
    <time_frame>During the Day 1 (initial study) visit</time_frame>
    <description>The OPTION scale (validated 12-item measure) will be used to score parent-physician interactions developing a treatment plan based on coding of audio or video recordings of the clinic visit.</description>

    <measure>Parental Knowledge of Medications for Challenging Behaviors in ASD</measure>
    <time_frame>At the end of the Day 1 (initial study) visit</time_frame>
    <description>Assess parents' knowledge of medications for challenging ASD behaviors with an 18-item checklist developed for this study. This includes questions on general knowledge about the role of medication in ASD treatment and assesses caregiver expectations of whether medication might improve specific challenging behaviors.</description>

    <measure>Parenting Stress</measure>
    <time_frame>Before or at the time of the Day 1 (initial study) visit and at the 3 month interval follow up</time_frame>
    <description>Will be measured using the Parenting Stress Index- Short Form. This is a validated 36-item questionnaire pertaining to the demands of taking care of a child. It includes 3 subscales and a total score: parental distress, parent-child dysfunctional interaction, and difficult child.</description>

    <measure>Shared Decision Making</measure>
    <time_frame>At the end of the Day 1 (initial study) visit</time_frame>
    <description>Parental perception of shared decision making during the clinical encounter will be assessed using the CollaboRATE. This is a brief, 3-question survey that assesses parent-reported shared decision making.</description>

    <measure>Child Behavioral Symptoms</measure>
    <time_frame>Before or at the time of the Day 1 (initial study) visit and 3 month interval follow up</time_frame>
    <description>Child behavioral symptoms will be measured at the time of the Day 1 (initial study) visit and 3 months later using:
The Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) will be used to assess behavioral functioning by domains of treatment. The CBCL is a commonly used clinical and research measure. The 120 scale items map onto Diagnostic and Statistical Manual(DSM)-oriented scales and will be used as a standardized measure of behavioral symptoms.

    <description>Approximately 120 families will be asked to participate as &quot;usual care&quot; subjects and will complete surveys before and immediately after their visit, and approximately 3 months after the visit. These families will not receive the decision aid nor will their provider have been trained how to use the decision aid. All participating providers will have up to 10 &quot;usual care&quot; patients enrolled at baseline prior to allocation. During the trial, the control group [&quot;usual care&quot; providers] will have up to 10 additional patients enrolled for ongoing &quot;usual care&quot; data collection. After the trial is complete, the control group providers will cross over to the intervention arm.</description>

    <description>Parents will receive an intervention modified from the previously published tool called &quot;Autism: Should My Child Take Medicine for Challenging Behavior?&quot; This packet provides parents with educational information, elicits parent ratings of particular behavioral domains, describes behaviors that are and are not amenable to medication treatment, and elicits parent preferences regarding treatment. Providers will be trained on use of the intervention in practice to promote shared decision making during clinical encounters.</description>
