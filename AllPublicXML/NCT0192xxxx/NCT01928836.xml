  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to verify clinical utility of a simple blood test comprising of
      four protein- based markers for risk stratification of patients presenting symptoms related
      to lung cancer.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study is a multicenter, prospective case-control research. Totally 1,200 cases will be
      collected in the hospitals, with 600 cases in control group, which are not suspected as lung
      cancer from chest CT, and other 600 in suspected group. When inclusion into the two groups,
      clinical information and 10mL blood sample of the patient will be recorded and tested for
      cancer biomarkers, biochemical detection and cardiovascular disease biomarkers, etc. The
      correlation between cancer biomarker panel, CT scan result and clinical pathological
      diagnosis will be investigated through cases follow up. The sample size estimated above was
      set up according to sensitivity and specificity of biomarkers in pre-study, based on lung
      cancer incidence of the population. To compare the diagnostic accuracy among different cancer
      biomarkers through T-test, Mann-Whitney U and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve
      with SPSS 15.0 software. In statistic analysis, 0.05 is set as the p value for significance.
      Effectiveness of the four biomarkers panel in lung cancer diagnoses and staging will be
      analyzed.
