  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The research uses hydrophilic-based dressing (KoCarbonTM) which is developed by Medical
      Technology Company Limited (Bio-medical Carbon Technology; BCT) to investigate the wound
      healing effects of activated-carbon-fiber-based wound dressing on different types of
      wounds.The dressing is composed by three layers. The first layer is a material of
      polyethylene terephthalate (PET) weave which is great breathable; Second layer, the activated
      carbon fiber cloth, is as the absorption of excess tissue fluid, bacteria and contaminations.
      It reduces the smell of wound and restrains the development of bacteria. In addition,
      activated carbon has features of far-infrared and anion, which promote blood circulation,
      speed up metabolism and shorten the time of wound healing. The third layer is a polyethlene
      (PE) film, which touches the wound surface and provides the anti-adhesion effects.

      The aim of this study is to investigate how the application of the dressing affects the wound
      healing conditions on four different types of wounds, including general traumatic wounds,
      elective surgery wound, diabetes foot ulcer (level 2) and chronic wounds. Due to the
      characteristics of great fluid absorption and far-infrared features, the hydrophilic-based
      dressing (KoCarbonTM) is expected to work perfectly on improving the wound repair conditions.

    <description>Photograph of wounds are taken on each visit and pictures are imported to image-analyzing software for the calculation of wound area. And the number of wound area is then transformed to the healing percentage. Healing Percentage N =[(the initial wound area-wound area measured on Day N)/the initial wound area]x100%. N means the number of days counting from the first day initiating this clinical trial.</description>

    <description>&quot;BCT&quot; Hydrophilic Wound Dressing consists of PET non-woven, activated carbon fiber (ACF) cloth and PE film. The PET non-woven is vapor permeable to allow air exchange for the wound. The absorbent ACF absorbs exudate, bacteria and odor to create an effective barrier. Furthermore, far infrared ray (FIR) emitted from ACF accelerates blood circulation and metabolism to reduce healing period. The PE film helps to minimize wound trauma at dressing changes.</description>
