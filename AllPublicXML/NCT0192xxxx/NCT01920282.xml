  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Numerous anti-hypertensive drugs have been reported to be efficacious in reducing central
      arterial stiffness and these effects may contribute to improved outcomes in hypertensive
      patients. However, the results of several studies suggest that beta-blockers may actually
      increase arterial stiffness. In contrast, there is limited evidence to suggest that
      nebivolol, a third generation beta-blocker that augments release of vascular nitric oxide,
      reduces central arterial stiffness in hypertensive individuals. Unfortunately, only a few
      studies have addressed this issue and all of these studies relied on indirect, blood pressure
      dependent measures of arterial stiffness. In addition, none of these studies focused on
      middle-aged and older, obese hypertensives, a population with accelerated arterial stiffening
      and at risk for cardiovascular diseases. Thus, the potential utility of nebivolol as a
      therapy to reduce large artery stiffness, particularly among the latter population, remains
      unclear.

    <description>Longitudinal B-mode images of the left common carotid artery diameter (1-2 cm proximal to the carotid bulb) were obtained over 15 consecutive cardiac cycles. Brachial blood pressure was measured via an automated sphygmomanometer. Quantification of systolic and diastolic carotid artery diameters were analyzed with the Vascular Research Tools 5 software program. Beta-stiffness index was calculated as: Beta = ln(P1/P0)/((D1-D0)/D0), where D0 represents the minimal diameter recorded during diastole, D1 represents the maximal diameter recorded during systole, P0 represents the pressure measured during diastole, and P1 represents the pressure measured during systole.</description>

    <description>Subjects will be provided with daily 5 mg of nebivolol for the first 2 weeks. Subjects receive additional daily doses of 10 mg nebivolol for the remainder of the study period. The dose remains at 5 mg per day, however, if BP falls below 110/70 during the first 2 weeks. Subjects will continue taking the drug during the 2-week follow-up period.</description>

    <description>Subjects will receive weekly lifestyle counseling by a registered dietitian to ensure adequate progress and compliance. Sample menus, 14-days of meal plans, and grocery shopping lists are provided to each individual. Individuals were instructed to reduce their daily caloric intake by 500-1000 calories and to perform a minimum of 150 minutes per week of moderate-intensity physical activity or 3000 steps/day above baseline levels. The diet plan conformed to the Dietary Approach to Stop Hypertension dietary guidelines emphasizing low fat dairy products, fruits and vegetable and contained 55% calories as carbohydrates, 30% calories as fat, and 15% calories as protein. Sodium consumption was set at 2,400 mg/day for all subjects.</description>

        <title>Beta-stiffness Index</title>
        <description>Longitudinal B-mode images of the left common carotid artery diameter (1-2 cm proximal to the carotid bulb) were obtained over 15 consecutive cardiac cycles. Brachial blood pressure was measured via an automated sphygmomanometer. Quantification of systolic and diastolic carotid artery diameters were analyzed with the Vascular Research Tools 5 software program. Beta-stiffness index was calculated as: Beta = ln(P1/P0)/((D1-D0)/D0), where D0 represents the minimal diameter recorded during diastole, D1 represents the maximal diameter recorded during systole, P0 represents the pressure measured during diastole, and P1 represents the pressure measured during systole.</description>

Sample menus, 14-days of meal plans, and grocery shopping lists were provided to each individual. Individuals were instructed to reduce their daily caloric intake by 500-1000 calories and to perform a minimum of 150 minutes per week of moderate-intensity physical activity or 3000 steps/day above baseline levels. The diet plan conformed to the Dietary Approach to Stop Hypertension dietary guidelines emphasizing low fat dairy products, fruits and vegetable and contained 55% calories as carbohydrates, 30% calories as fat, and 15% calories as protein21. Sodium consumption was set at 2,400 mg/day for all subjects.
