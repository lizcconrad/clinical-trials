  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to investigate the effects of Azithromycin (systemic and locally) on
      the clinical and microbiological parameters of periodontal in patients with chronic
      periodontitis.

      The double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial that is carried out in eighty patients
      who referred to the Department of Periodontology, Isfahan School of Dentistry. Main inclusion
      criteria were: 1) Patients with moderate to severe chronic periodontitis 2) At least twenty
      teeth 3) Age over 18 years. Main exclusion criteria were: 1) History of allergy to the
      macrolide group 2) History of antibiotic therapy within the 4 months ago 3) The lack of
      patient cooperation. For all patients is initially performed scaling and root planning (SRP).
      Oral health education is given to all patients. After one month, patients are randomly
      divided into four equal groups (two test groups and two control groups). Azithromycin(AZM)
      250 milligram (mg) capsules, two times a day (bid), for three days will be given to a test
      group. In the other test group, 1% AZM gel is locally injected into the periodontal pockets
      in single-root teeth. Placebo capsules with the same dose and frequency will be given to a
      control group. In the other control group, placebo gel is injected in the same places.
      Clinical parameters included pocket depth (PD), clinical attachment level (CAL), papillary
      bleeding index (PBI), and periodontal disease index (PDI), which are recorded at baseline
      (before SRP), at 1, 2, 3 and 4 months after treatment. Using polymerase chain reaction (PCR),
      microbiological assessment of the percentage of Porphyromonas gingivalis (P.g) and
      Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (A.a) are randomly done for 40 patients (10 patients
      from each group) at baseline and at 3 months after the treatment.
