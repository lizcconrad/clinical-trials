  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Experts agree that neonatal death has long-term impact on parents. Many parents experience
      sadness, pain, anger, bouts of crying, and a depressed mood after the death of a child. There
      are no prospective studies that evaluate the effectiveness of bereavement management and
      follow-up on the grief process following the death of a newborn. The purpose of this study is
      to evaluate the impact of a neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) bereavement support program
      and the use of a newly designed family-centered bereavement DVD. This educational DVD
      includes personal interviews with parents, grandparents and siblings who have experienced the
      lost of a baby in the NICU.

      The care given to a family before and following a neonatal loss can set the stage for a
      family's entire grieving process. For many parents, the support they receive from health care
      providers after the loss of a baby may have crucial effects on the family's ability to
      appropriately respond. It is essential for nurses, practitioners, physicians, and chaplains
      to provide compassionate care that meets or exceeds parents' expectations. However,
      supporting families following the death of an infant is particularly challenging. There is
      limited bereavement intervention guidance in the literature that may benefit grieving
      parents. Follow-up care is a crucial part of bereavement management of families whose babies
      have died. The bereavement committee at St. Louis Children's Hospital (SLCH) is a
      multi-disciplinary team, which includes representation from neonatal nurses and nurse
      practitioners, neonatologists, social workers, chaplains, patient-care associates, and former
      bereaved parents. Their role is to assist families both at the time of an infant's death and
      in securing their baby's personal belongings after the family leaves the hospital. In
      addition to receiving bereavement materials, which is considered standard-practice of care in
      the NICU at SLCH following the death of an infant, half of the parents enrolled in the study
      will be prospectively randomized to receive the educational bereavement DVD entitled
      'Grieving in the NICU— Mending Broken Hearts When a Baby Dies Too Soon'.
