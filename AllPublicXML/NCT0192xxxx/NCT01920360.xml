  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objectives are to evaluate the effects of immersion bath with sulphurous water in pain,
      joint mobility and quality of life in patients with knee osteoarthritis. Patients will
      undergo three weekly baths in sulphurous water and not sulphurous, twenty minutes each, for
      ten weeks.

      The expected results are: reduction of pain, improved range of motion of the lower limbs with
      consequent increase in muscle mass improvement in postural balance, which will come due to
      the reduction of pain and improvement movements of the lower limbs; greater independence in
      performing the activities of daily living, better quality of life.

      The baths were performed in individual tubs, properly disinfected, supplied with thermal
      water and sulphurous thermal sulphurous not at a temperature 37-39 ° C, which encompass the
      optimum temperatures for therapeutic bath. The baths lasted for 20 minutes. The subjects
      drank two cups of water, 300 ml before and after the baths, in order to avoid an imbalance
      water. Treatment consisted of 30 individual treatment sessions, three times a week, lasting
      twenty minutes each session, for ten weeks. The experiment was performed at the Therms
      Antonio Carlos, institution belonging to the Municipality of Poços de Caldas, Minas Gerais,
      Brazil.

    <description>Tools:
Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC): 5 questions about pain, 2 about stiffness, 17 about physical function. Each question receives a score from 0 to 100. After is done the arithmetic mean. The higher the score on each subscale, the greater deficit.
Visual Analogic Scale (VAS): horizontal line marked from 0 (no pain) to 10 (intense pain).
LEQUESNE: 11 questions about pain, discomfort and function, 6 about pain and discomfort, 1 about to walk away, and 4 on daily activities. The scores range from 0 (no impairment) to 24 (severe).
Short Form-36 (SF-36): 36 items grouped into eight areas. The final score from 0 (worst quality) to 100 (the best).</description>
