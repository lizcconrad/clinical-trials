    <textblock>
      This randomized clinical trial studies a cognitive-behavioral intervention to treat worry,
      uncertainty, and insomnia in cancer survivors. Counseling may reduce anxiety and insomnia as
      well as improve the well-being and quality of life of cancer survivors. This study also
      explores the neuro-immunologic correlates of anxiety and insomnia.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To complete a randomized pilot trial of a cognitive-behavioral anxiety-insomnia
      intervention to determine the impact of this intervention on patient worry, intolerance of
      uncertainty, and sleep efficiency.

      II. Explore the underlying endocrine and immune mechanisms responsible for a specific symptom
      cluster (anxiety-insomnia-depression-pain-fatigue) observed among advanced cancer patients.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

      ARM I: Patients wear a wrist actigraph, collect saliva samples, and complete a sleep diary
      and worry record daily in weeks 1 and 5. Patients also receive education on the components of
      anxiety (physical cognitive, and behavioral) and practice relaxation techniques and
      behavioral sleep strategies in weeks 2-5. Blood draw is optional.

      ARM II: Patients wear a wrist actigraph, collect saliva samples, and complete a sleep diary
      and worry record daily in weeks 1 and 5. Blood draw is also optional. This is a wait-list
      control arm, so patients in this arm, after a six-week period of treatment as usual with
      their oncologist, then receive the intervention.

    <time_frame>From baseline to 6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>A linear mixed model will be used to evaluate the change from pre to post on the Penn State Worry Questionnaire. The model will include group (treatment vs. control), time (pre vs. post), and group-time interaction effects. If the outcome measure is not normally distributed with equal variance across groups, then the outcomes will be log transformed in order to meet these assumptions for the mixed models.</description>
