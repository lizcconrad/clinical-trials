  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Fractured neck of femur (FNF) is a common cause of admission to hospital in elderly patients
      with multiple comorbidities. Anaesthetic management of this patient group is extremely
      challenging.Neuraxial anaesthesia with minimum doses of local anaesthetic agents administered
      via a spinal catheter leads to better cardiovascular stability.The minimum dose of local
      anaesthetic with intrathecal fentanyl was not established yet.We propose to study and
      determine the initial minimum local anaesthetic dose (MLAD) of 0.5% bupivacaine with 20 mcg
      of fentanyl administered via a spinal catheter to achieve a sensory block up to T10 for the
      operative fixation of FNF.We will use a previously well established Dixon and Massey
      &quot;up-and-down method&quot; to calculate initial MLAD in this prospective, observational trial.

      Objectives: We would like to determine the initial MLAD of 0.5% bupivacaine with 20mcg of
      fentanyl administered via a spinal catheter required to achieve a sensory block up to T10 on
      the side of FNF.

      Outcomes

      Primary outcome:

        1. Initial MLAD of 0.5% bupivacaine with 20mcg of fentanyl required for a sensory block up
           to T10 on the side of FNF.

           Secondary outcomes:

        2. Total dose of 0.5% bupivacaine with 20mcg of fentanyl required for the operative
           fixation of fractured neck of femur.

        3. The effect on haemodynamic variables (blood pressure, heart rate).

        4. Incidence of side effects

        5. The length of postoperative analgesia (the time from the last dose of local anaesthetic
           administered intrathecally to VAS&gt;3).

        6. The time to first rescue analgesic requirement

      Study Design Prospective, observational trial.

      Study Size Based on the previously well established Dixon and Massey &quot;up-and-down
      method&quot;(10), we will recruit patients until a successful spinal block has been achieved in
      six consecutive patients who received a specific dose. This is the requirement to calculate
      the initial MLAD.

    <description>A blinded observer will assess the dermatome level of sensory blockade with an ice-cold test (ethyl-chloride spray) bilaterally after the injection of the local anaesthetic. Block assessment will be performed every 5min up to 15 min after completion of the initial intrathecal injection. Sensory block up to T10=positive result Sensory block below T10=negative result.</description>

    <description>Noninvasive automated blood pressure and heart rate measurements will be recorded before the spinal anaesthesia (baseline) and every three minutes after the end of local anesthetic injection until the end of surgery.Hypotension is defined as a decrease of more than 20% from the baseline systolic arterial blood pressure (SAP). Severe hypotension is defined as a decrease in SAP more than 30% of baseline value. Hypotension will be treated with IV boluses of ephedrine 6 mg if the heart rate is below 60/minutes or phenylephrine 100 mcg if the heart rate is above 60/minutes.The number of hypotensive episodes, a total amount of vasopressor administered, and the i.v. fluid infused will be recorded as well as duration of anaesthesia.</description>
