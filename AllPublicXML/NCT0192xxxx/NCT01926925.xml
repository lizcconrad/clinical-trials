  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Type 2 diabetes is now more frequent in children/adolescents, especially in those from
      minority populations, including Hispanic Americans (HA). Diabetes and the pre-diabetes state
      markedly increase the risk of cardiovascular disease. Endothelial dysfunction is seen in the
      earliest stages of atherogenesis, which ultimately leads to cardiovascular disease. The main
      aim of this study is to evaluate the endothelial function in HA children/adolescents who are
      at risk for developing type 2 diabetes (obese children/adolescents from the Hispanic
      population).

      The investigators' hypothesis is that endothelial dysfunction is present in this population
      and that it is associated with metabolic abnormalities linked to the insulin resistance
      syndrome. The investigators will study 2 groups of 15 individuals each, age 10-18 years.
      Group 1 will consist of obese (body mass index greater than 85th percentile for age and sex)
      Hispanic American children/adolescents and group 2 will consist of healthy, non-overweight
      (body mass index between the 25th and 50 th percentile for age and sex) Hispanic American
      children/adolescents.

      The study will be carried out at the Joslin Diabetes Center. During the first day,
      participants will have a medical history and full physical examination, a standard OGTT and
      measurement of blood cell count, plasma glucose, insulin, lipids, HbA1c, BUN, creatinine,
      electrolytes, estradiol, testosterone, free fatty acids, CRP, endothelial markers, urinary
      microalbumin and hCG, if appropriate. An OGTT will be performed in order to rule out IGT or
      Diabetes. Estimations of insulin secretion and insulin sensitivity will be assessed using the
      homeostasis model assessment (HOMA). In the second day, the body composition and the brachial
      artery vasodilatory response to hyperemia will be assessed. Those found with diabetes will be
      tested for GAD-65 and IA2.

      The investigators' hypothesis is that Hispanic American children/adolescents at risk for type
      2 diabetes have impaired endothelial function and vascular reactivity that are associated
      with the degree of insulin resistance and its metabolic abnormalities.

               2. Hispanic (we will consider a subject being Hispanic if both parents are reported
                  as Hispanics when asked the following question: &quot;What ethnic group do you
                  consider that you belong to?&quot;);

               3. No history of type 2 diabetes in any first-degree relative;

               4. Body mass index between the 25th and 50th percentile for age and sex

               5. Not have participated in any exercise program for the 6 months prior to the
                  beginning of the study.

        Group 2:

          1. Age between 10-18 years;

          2. Hispanic (same criteria as above);

          3. Body mass index greater than the 85th percentile for age and sex;

          4. Not have participated in any exercise program for the 6 months prior to the beginning
             of the study.

        Exclusion Criteria:
