    <textblock>
      This study, is a Phase I/II clinical trial in three parts: Phase I Dose Escalation, Phase II,
      Part 1 RPTD Cohort, and Phase II, Part 2 Expansion. The first two parts have been completed.
      The Phase II, Part 2 Expansion will assess if treatment with rigosertib in combination with
      azacitidine, has measurable effects in patients with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). Safety
      of patients is an objective throughout all parts of the study.

      This will be a Phase I/II open-label, single-arm, dose-escalating, multicenter study, in
      three parts: Phase I Dose Escalation, Phase II, Part 1 RPTD Cohort, and Phase II, Part 2
      Expansion, in which patients with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), acute myeloid leukemia
      (AML), or chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML) will receive subcutaneous (SC) or
      intravenous (IV) azacitidine per approved label in combination with oral rigosertib. The
      first two parts of the study have been completed.

      The Phase II Part 2 Expansion will enroll up to 40 patients, randomized 1:1 into 2 cohorts of
      up to 20 patients each, to receive 1120 mg of rigosertib over 24 hours: either 560 mg in the
      morning and 560 mg in the afternoon, or 840 mg in the morning and 280 mg in the afternoon.
      The afternoon dose in both cohorts must be administered at 3 PM (±1 hr) at least 2 hr after
      lunch. In the Phase II, Part 2 Expansion patients with RAEB t/non-proliferative AML will be
      eligible, however patients with CMML will not.
