  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hitherto no comprehensive long-term follow-up data of 10 years and more have been obtained
      from survivors of disc surgery that would have considered the type of postoperative care.

      Objectives: 1) To evaluate the long-term effects of postoperative comprehensive physiotherapy
      starting 1 week after lumbar disc surgery. 2) To assess the relative risk of segmental
      instability in the operated segment 12 years following lumbar disc surgery.

      Design: Twelve years' follow-up of a three-armed, randomized, controlled, single blinded
      clinical trial. Setting: Outpatient department of Physical Medicine &amp; Rehabilitation.
      Participants: Of 120 patients following first-time, uncomplicated lumbar disc surgery who
      participated in the original study are invited to a 12 years follow-up examination.
      Interventions: In the original study, patients had been randomly assigned to &quot;comprehensive
      physiotherapy&quot;, &quot;sham intervention&quot; (neck massage), or no therapy. Measurements: Low Back
      Pain Rating Score (LBPRS; Manniche 1993), functional X-rays of the lumbar spine. All data are
      collected by blinded students and physicians at the Department of PM&amp;R, Vienna Medical
      University.

    <description>The LBP-RS measures the health concepts of pain, disability, and physical impairment. Both the original and the translated version of the LBP rating scale are highly reliable within and between raters, uni-dimensional and are shown to have satisfactory construct validity. The sum score ranges from 130 (worst) to 0 (best) and is the composite of 3 subscores (pain, disability, and physical function).</description>
