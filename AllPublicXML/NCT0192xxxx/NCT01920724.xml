    <textblock>
      Thailand has been facing with the double burden of malnutrition. Many studies in Thailand,
      which aim to explore the situation, causes, and strategies to prevent obesity, have focused
      on adults, adolescents, or school-aged children. Few studies have been conducted in preschool
      children. Obesity or stunting during childhood increases the risk of being obesity in
      adulthood and leads to chronic diseases. If obesity is established in adulthood, it is
      difficult to reduce the excess weight. Thus, the prevention of obesity or stunting in young
      children should be highly considered. Study of dietary pattern and reliable field methods to
      measure fat mass (FM) in children may partly contribute to primary prevention of childhood
      obesity. The deuterium dilution technique is an accurate and suitable method for children and
      population-based studies. However, it has not been widely used in children in Thailand.
      Hence, this study aimed to utilize the deuterium dilution technique for assessing body
      composition and to determine the quality and quantity of dietary intake among children 3-5
      years of age with different nutritional status. We conducted a cross-sectional study in 15
      daycare centers in Nakhon Pathom and Samut Prakarn provinces. 120 preschoolers were
      purposively selected according to their nutritional status: stunted, thin, normal, and
      overweight/obese. Anthropometric measurements were conducted. Body composition was determined
      based on total body water using deuterium dilution technique. Dietary intake data were
      obtained using 2-day 24 hr recall.We hypothesized that stunted and obese children will have
      more fat mass compared to the normal children.

      Body composition of the children was assessed using the deuterium technique. Total body water
      (TBW) content was calculated. Then, fat free mass (FFM) and fat mass (FM) was calculated.

      Weight and height of all children were using a standard technique. Body mass index and
      nutritional status was calculated using World Health Organization (WHO) growth standard for
      children 0-5 years.

      Dietary intake of children was assessed using 2 non-consecutive 24 hour dietary recalls. The
      1st and 2nd recall was about 2 weeks apart. Nutrient intake was calculated using the
      INMUCAL-Nutrients WD. 4.0 (Institute of Nutrition, 2010).

        Children in the daycare centers in Nakhon Pathom and Samut Prakarn porvinces will be
        screened and categorized into 4 groups, including wasting (BMI for age Z-scores &lt; -2 SD),
        normal (-1 SD ≤ BMI for age Z-scores ≤ +1 SD), obesity (BMI for age Z-scores &gt; +2 SD), and
        stunting (HAZ &lt; -2 SD). Then, they will be randomly selected to participate in this study.
