  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Degenerative spondylolisthesis describes the slip of one spinal segment relative to the
      adjacent segment. It is usually associated with spinal stenosis (which limits one's ability
      to walk and stand) and is the most common indication for surgery in adults over age 65 years.
      A variety of surgical techniques are available; the most common are the Posterolateral
      Instrumented Fusion (PLF), and Interbody Fusion (IF) including Posterolateral Interbody
      Fusion (PLIF), and Transforaminal Interbody fusion (TLIF). IF uses a cage that is placed
      within the cleaned out disc space between the vertebral bodies being fused. Although this
      approach achieves a good fusion rate and deformity correction it is associated with a higher
      surgical cost and potential intra-operative complication rate. What is more, no consensus
      exists as to whether IF provides better patient rated functional outcome and quality of life.
      If the advantages of IF do not translate into superior patient rated outcomes, then the
      risk-benefit ratio would be tipped in favor of PLF. The purpose of this study is to determine
      if IF is equivalent to PLF for the treatment of degenerative spondylolisthesis. The
      investigators will conduct a prospective randomized control trial comparing these two
      procedures. Our primary outcome measure will be the Oswestry Disability Index, which
      evaluates spinal pain and function.
