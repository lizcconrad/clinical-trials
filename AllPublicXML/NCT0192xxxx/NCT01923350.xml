  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Avoiding Diabetes After Pregnancy Trial (ADAPT) study was designed to test the
      effectiveness of interventions that potentially increase the adoption of Diabetes Prevention
      Program (DPP) elements by women who had a pregnancy with gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM).

      The study was conducted as an integrated trial with two separate arms: one to facilitate
      weight reduction and the other to increase diabetes testing.

      There were two hypotheses:

        1. Women in the testing intervention will be more likely to have received a diabetes test
           within the 6 months post-intervention than women in the control group.

        2. Women in the weight reduction intervention will have lost more weight at the 6-month and
           9-month follow-up than women in the control group.

      The primary study aim was to determine the efficacy of a system of interactive
      technology-based supports to prompt women with a history of gestational diabetes to take
      steps to prevent diabetes. The secondary aims were focused on women's engagement:

        -  To evaluate the impact of the weight reduction intervention in terms of participant
           engagement with the interactive technology-based supports.

        -  To evaluate changes in the women's perception of their personal diabetes risk following
           after exposure to information about diabetes risk following a pregnancy with GDM.

        -  To identify the determinants and motivators of and barriers to diabetes testing in the
           6- to 12-week postpartum period and thereafter, using the Health Belief model to guide
           the study.

      There was an additional secondary aim involving metformin:

        -  To evaluate the impact of the diabetes risk reduction intervention in terms of women
           seeking out their physician's advice on metformin treatment and receiving a metformin
           prescription, if appropriate.

    <description>The weight trial intervention components were:
Electronic feedback from the ADAPT interactive obesity treatment approach (iOTA) system, tracking participants' behavior change goals. Participants received feedback either by daily SMS (text messaging) or by weekly IVR (interactive automated calls).
Seven behavior change coaching calls, once a month for 6 months, and then one at 7.5 months halfway through the maintenance period.
Print mailings/emailings
3 Get Ready e-messages in the four weeks before the weight intervention began
Pedometers and program guides. (IVR users received printed activity logs with their program guides.)
Access to the ADAPT iOTA website for reviewing their progress and obtaining information on behavior change goals.</description>
