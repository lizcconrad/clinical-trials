    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is help people with serious mental illness and receiving vocational
      rehabilitation get and keep the job they want by improving their thinking skills, such as
      attention and memory, using computer exercises and other strategies. One half of the
      participants in the study will receive vocational rehabilitation and the exercises to improve
      thinking skills, and the other half will receive just vocational rehabilitation. All
      participants will receive an assessment of symptoms and thinking skills at the beginning of
      the study and 6, 12, and 24 months later. Work activity during the 24 months in the study
      will be collected. It is expected that those participants who receive the practice of their
      thinking skills will be more likely to get and keep the job they want compared with people
      who do not receive this treatment.

      This randomized controlled trial is evaluating the effectiveness of a pilot-tested,
      manualized cognitive remediation intervention entitled the &quot;Thinking Skills for Work Program&quot;
      by comparing it to enhanced supported employment services in clients with severe mental
      illness (SMI) who are participants in high fidelity supported employment programs at the
      Greater Mental health Center of Manchester and Thresholds, Inc., Chicago, Il, but who have
      had difficulty getting or keeping jobs. Participants are randomized to either the Thinking
      Skills for Work (cognitive remediation +supported employment; CT+SE) or enhanced supported
      employment (E-SE), with cognitive, symptom, and quality of life assessments performed at
      baseline, 3 months (following the completion of the computerized cognitive training component
      of the Thinking Skills for Work program), 12 months, and 24 months, and employment data
      gathered over the full 2-year period. For the E-SE condition, supported employment services
      are enhanced by training provided to the employment specialists regarding to recognize
      cognitive problems related to work performance, and how employment specialists can teach
      clients coping strategies for managing these problems. Primary analyses will focus on testing
      the hypotheses that the Thinking Skills for Work Program (CT+SE) leads to better cognitive
      functioning and better competitive work outcomes over the 2-year follow-up period compared to
      the E-SE program.

    <description>The Thinking Skills for Work Program includes 5 components delivered by a Cognitive Specialist who works collaboratively with the consumer's Employment Specialist: a) assessing the consumer's strengths and weaknesses in cognitive functioning, and analysis of the contribution of cognitive impairments and other factors to job losses and difficulties obtaining a job; b) teaching coping strategies for dealing with cognitive challenges associated with job search or maintaining a job; c) computer cognitive training involving cognitive exercises with a commercially available software program, which is designed to improve the broad range of cognitive skills through a combination of practice and strategy coaching by the Cognitive Specialist; d) job search planning; and e) job support consultation.</description>
