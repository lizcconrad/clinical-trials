  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The general objectives are to evaluate activity and the safety of regorafenib in a population
      of patients bearing advanced, refractory colorectal cancers and to explore the different
      downstream molecular pathways to identify tumor response and resistance mechanisms.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective is to identify in a population of patients bearing advanced, refractory
      colorectal cancers, those who draw no benefit from treatment with regorafenib. There is no
      specific hypothesis underlying sample size and the study is therefore to be seen as
      exploratory.

      Secondary objectives:

        -  To analyze PFS and response rate (RR) in relationship with the same covariates as for OS

        -  To assess regorafenib efficacy (OS, PFS, RR) and safety profile in this study
           population.

        -  To assess the Disease control rate (DCR = Complete response [CR] + partial response [PR]
           + stable disease [SD])

        -  To compare the relative benefit (OS, PFS) of regorafenib according to history of
           treatment with bevacizumab.

    <description>Assessment of safety will follow the WHO guidelines and classified according to NCI-CTCAE v. 4.0 and will be performed every 28 days until 28 days (safety follow up visit) after stopping therapy. Reasons for stopping therapy may include progression of disease or unbearable toxicities, or patient's decision.</description>

    <description>Genetic, epigenetic and molecular aberrations will be investigated using gene expression profiling, RNA and exome sequencing, and methylation profiling on the tumor biopsies and repeated blood samples collected during the trial. The relationship between the molecular aberrations,the patient's outcome (PFS, OS) and with metabolic response after treatment with regorafenib will be studied.</description>
