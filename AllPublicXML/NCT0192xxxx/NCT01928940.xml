      This is a Japanese Phase I/II, open-label, non-controlled study to evaluate the safety,
      tolerability, pharmacokinetic profile, and efficacy of the combination of GSK2118436 and
      GSK1120212 in subjects with BRAF V600E/K mutation positive advanced solid tumors (Phase I
      part) and BRAF V600E/K mutation positive cutaneous melanoma (Phase II part). Phase I part is
      designed to primarily assess the safety and tolerability of GSK2118436 and GSK1120212
      combination therapy in subjects with BRAF V600E/K mutation positive advanced solid tumors.
      Six evaluable subjects will be enrolled into Phase I part and receive the combination therapy
      of GSK2118436 (150 mg, twice daily) and GSK1120212 (2 mg, once daily). A decision for
      starting Phase II part will be made by careful review based on available safety, tolerability
      and pharmacokinetic data in Phase I part. Phase II part is designed to primarily evaluate ORR
      of the combination as first-line therapy in subjects with unresectable (Stage IIIC) or
      metastatic (Stage IV) BRAF V600E/K mutation positive cutaneous melanoma. Subjects who have
      had prior systemic anti-cancer treatment in the advanced or metastatic setting will not be
      eligible for Phase II part although prior systemic treatment in the adjuvant setting will be
      allowed. Six evaluable subjects will be enrolled in Phase II part.

    <measure>Phase II: Change From Baseline in Oxygen Saturation Measured Via Pulse Oxymetry at the Indicated Time Points</measure>
    <time_frame>From Baseline until the post-treatment Visit (average of 1.38 years)</time_frame>
    <description>Oxygen saturation measures the capacity of blood to transport oxygen to other parts of the body. Oxygen binds to hemoglobin in red blood cells when moving through the lungs. A pulse oximeter uses two frequencies of light (red and infrared) to determine the percentage of hemoglobin in the blood that is saturated with oxygen, that is called as blood oxygen saturation, or SpO2. Change from Baseline was calculated as the individual post-Baseline value (Days 8 and 15; Weeks 3 to 132 and post-treatment Visit) minus the Baseline value. The Baseline value is defined as the last pre-treatment value observed.</description>

        <title>Phase I: Number of Participants With the Indicated Worst-case Change From Baseline (BL) in the Indicated Clinical Chemistry Parameters (CCPs)</title>
        <description>CCPs were graded according to NCI CTCAE grade version 4.0 as: G1, Mild; G2, Moderate; G3, Severe; G4, Life-threatening or disabling; G5, Death. Data are presented for only those parameters (para) for which an increase to G3 or G4 from BL G occurred. CCPs that were not G according to NCI CTCAE criteria, were categorized as High and Low with respect to the normal range. Data are presented only for those para for which the category decreased to Low or increased to High relative to the BL category. The worst-case during the on-therapy period was determined taking into account both scheduled and unscheduled assessments. CCPs included: albumin, alkaline phosphatase, alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), total bilirubin, calcium, creatinine, glucose, potassium, magnesium, sodium, inorganic phosphorus, chloride, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), total protein, urea/blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and uric acid.</description>

        <title>Phase I: Number of Participants With the Indicated Worst-case Change From Baseline in the Indicated Hematology Parameters</title>
        <description>Hematology parameters were summarized according to NCI CTCAE G, version 4.0 as: G1, Mild; G2, Moderate; G3, Severe; G4, Life-threatening or disabling; G5, Death. Data are presented for only those parameters for which an increase to G3 or G4 from Baseline G occurred. For hematology parameters that were not graded according to NCI CTCAE criteria, were categorized as High and Low with respect to the normal range. Data are presented only for those parameters for which the category decreased to Low or increased to High relative to the Baseline category. The worst-case during the on-therapy period was determined taking into account both scheduled and unscheduled assessments. Hematology parameters included: hemoglobin, lymphocytes, total neutrophils, platelet count, white blood cell (WBC) counts, basophils, eosinophils, hematocrit, mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (MCHC), mean corpuscular hemoglobin (MCH), mean corpuscular volume (MCV), monocytes and red blood cell (RBC) count.</description>

            <description>In the Phase I part, participants with BRAF V600E/K mutation-positive advanced solid tumors received the combination therapy of GSK2118436 150 milligrams (mg) (a combination of 75 mg capsules) orally twice daily (BID) and GSK1120212 2 mg tablet orally once daily (QD) until disease progression, death or an unacceptable adverse event. GSK2118436 and GSK1120212 were administered in the morning at approximately the same time. The second dose of GSK2118436 was taken in the evening approximately 12 hours (hr) after the morning dose. The second dose of GSK2118436 was not administered on Day 1 for the 24 hr serial pharmacokinetic (PK) blood sampling. Study drugs were taken with approximately 200 milliliters (mL) of water under fasting conditions, either 1 hr before or 2 hr after a meal.</description>

        <description>The ECOG pef status 5-point scale is used to assess how a participant's disease is progressing, to assess how the disease affects the daily living abilities of the par. and to determine appropriate treatment and prognosis: G0, fully active, able to carry on all pre-disease pef without restriction. G1, restricted in physically strenuous activity but ambulatory and able to carry out work of a light or sedentary nature, example, light house work, office work. G2, ambulatory and capable of all selfcare, but unable to carry out any work activities; up and about &gt;50 percent (%) of waking hrs. G3, capable of only limited selfcare; confined to bed or chair &gt;50% of waking hrs. G4, completely disabled; cannot carry on any selfcare; totally confined to bed or chair. G5, dead. The worst-case during the on-therapy period was determined taking into account both scheduled and unscheduled assessments. Number of par. who improved, had no change, or deteriorated in pef status from BL is summarized.</description>

        <title>Phase I: Change From Baseline in Oxygen Saturation (SpO2) Measured Via Pulse Oxymetry at the Indicated Time Points</title>
        <description>Oxygen saturation measures the capacity of blood to transport oxygen to other parts of the body. Oxygen binds to hemoglobin in red blood cells when moving through the lungs. A pulse oximeter uses two frequencies of light (red and infrared) to determine the percentage of hemoglobin in the blood that is saturated with oxygen,that is called as blood oxygen saturation or SpO2. Change from Baseline was calculated as the individual post-Baseline value (Days 8,15; Weeks 3 to 136 and post-treatment Visit) minus the Baseline value. The Baseline value is defined as the last pre-treatment value observed.</description>

            <title>Phase I: GSK2118436 150 mg + GSK1120212 2 mg</title>
            <description>In the Phase I part, participants with BRAF V600E/K mutation-positive advanced solid tumors received the combination therapy of GSK2118436 150 milligrams (mg) (a combination of 75 mg capsules) orally twice daily (BID) and GSK1120212 2 mg tablet orally once daily (QD) until disease progression, death or an unacceptable adverse event. GSK2118436 and GSK1120212 were administered in the morning at approximately the same time. The second dose of GSK2118436 was taken in the evening approximately 12 hours (hr) after the morning dose. The second dose of GSK2118436 was not administered on Day 1 for the 24 hr serial pharmacokinetic (PK) blood sampling. Study drugs were taken with approximately 200 milliliters (mL) of water under fasting conditions, either 1 hr before or 2 hr after a meal.</description>

            <description>In the Phase I part, participants with BRAF V600E/K mutation-positive advanced solid tumors received the combination therapy of GSK2118436 150 milligrams (mg) (a combination of 75 mg capsules) orally twice daily (BID) and GSK1120212 2 mg tablet orally once daily (QD) until disease progression, death or an unacceptable adverse event. GSK2118436 and GSK1120212 were administered in the morning at approximately the same time. The second dose of GSK2118436 was taken in the evening approximately 12 hours (hr) after the morning dose. The second dose of GSK2118436 was not administered on Day 1 for the 24 hr serial pharmacokinetic (PK) blood sampling. Study drugs were taken with approximately 200 milliliters (mL) of water under fasting conditions, either 1 hr before or 2 hr after a meal.</description>

            <description>In the Phase I part, participants with BRAF V600E/K mutation-positive advanced solid tumors received the combination therapy of GSK2118436 150 milligrams (mg) (a combination of 75 mg capsules) orally twice daily (BID) and GSK1120212 2 mg tablet orally once daily (QD) until disease progression, death or an unacceptable adverse event. GSK2118436 and GSK1120212 were administered in the morning at approximately the same time. The second dose of GSK2118436 was taken in the evening approximately 12 hours (hr) after the morning dose. The second dose of GSK2118436 was not administered on Day 1 for the 24 hr serial pharmacokinetic (PK) blood sampling. Study drugs were taken with approximately 200 milliliters (mL) of water under fasting conditions, either 1 hr before or 2 hr after a meal.</description>

        <title>Phase I: Number of Participants With Worst-case On-therapy Change From Baseline in Left Ventricular Ejection Fraction (LVEF) as Assessed by Echocardiogram (ECHO)</title>
        <description>Absolute change from Baseline in LVEF were summarized at each scheduled assessment time and in the worst-case post Baseline. Only the post Baseline assessments that used the same method (ECHO or Multi Gated Acquisition Scan [MUGA]) as the Baseline assessments were used to derive the change from Baseline. The change from Baseline was categorized as: any increase; no change; 0-&lt;10 Decrease, 10-19 Decrease, &gt;=20 Decrease, &gt;=10 Decrease and &gt;= lower limit of normal (LLN), &gt;=10 Decrease and below LLN, &gt;=20 Decrease and &gt;=LLN and &gt;=20 Decrease and below LLN. The worst-case during the on-therapy period was determined taking into account both scheduled and unscheduled assessments.</description>

            <description>In the Phase I part, participants with BRAF V600E/K mutation-positive advanced solid tumors received the combination therapy of GSK2118436 150 milligrams (mg) (a combination of 75 mg capsules) orally twice daily (BID) and GSK1120212 2 mg tablet orally once daily (QD) until disease progression, death or an unacceptable adverse event. GSK2118436 and GSK1120212 were administered in the morning at approximately the same time. The second dose of GSK2118436 was taken in the evening approximately 12 hours (hr) after the morning dose. The second dose of GSK2118436 was not administered on Day 1 for the 24 hr serial pharmacokinetic (PK) blood sampling. Study drugs were taken with approximately 200 milliliters (mL) of water under fasting conditions, either 1 hr before or 2 hr after a meal.</description>

        <title>Phase II: Number of Participant With Confirmed Overall Response</title>
        <description>Confirmed overall response (ORR) is defined as the percentage of participants with a confirmed complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) version 1.1. RECIST is a set of rules that define when tumors in cancer participants improve (&quot;respond&quot;), stay the same (&quot;stabilize&quot;), or worsen (&quot;progress&quot;) during treatment. CR is defined as disappearance of all target lesions. PR is defined as at least a 30% decrease in the sum of the diameters of target lesions after treatment from Baseline (before study drug administration). ORR was assessed by investigator and blinded independent central review (BICR).</description>

            <description>In the Phase II part, participants with BRAF V600E/K mutation-positive cutaneous melanoma received the combination therapy of GSK2118436 150 mg (a combination of 75 mg capsules) orally BID and GSK1120212 2 mg tablet orally QD until disease progression, death or an unacceptable adverse event. GSK2118436 and GSK1120212 were administered in the morning at approximately the same time. The second dose of GSK2118436 was taken in the evening approximately 12 hr after the morning dose. Study drugs were taken with approximately 200 mL of water under fasting conditions, either 1 hr before or 2 hr after a meal.</description>

        <title>Phase I: Area Under the Plasma Concentration Versus Time Curve (AUC) of GSK2118436 and Metabolites, and GSK1120212 After Single and Repeat Dose</title>
        <description>Blood samples were collected from each par. at pre-dose, 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12 and 24 hr after administration of GSK2118436 + GSK1120212 on Day 1 (single dose) and at pre-dose, 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 10 and 12 hr post-dose on Day 21 (repeat dose) for PK analysis. GSK2118436 metabolites included GSK2285403, GSK2298683, and GSK2167542. AUC from time zero to last quantifiable concentration (concn) (AUC[0-t]) was determined using the linear trapezoidal rule for increasing concn and the logarithmic trapezoidal rule for decreasing. The AUC from time zero extrapolated to infinity (AUC[0-inf] was calculated, where data permit, as the sum of AUC(0-t) and Ct/z, where Ct is the observed plasma concn obtained from the log-linear regression analysis of the last quantifiable time-point and z is the terminal phase rate constant. Area under the concentration-time curve over 12 hr and 24 hr dosing interval is called AUC[0-12] and AUC[0-24]. AUC(0-inf) was calculated only at Day 1.</description>

        <title>Phase I: Time of Occurrence of Cmax (Tmax) and Terminal Phase Half Life (t1/2) of GSK2118436 and Metabolites, and GSK1120212 After a Single and Repeat Dose</title>
        <description>Blood samples were collected from each participant at pre-dose, 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12 and 24 hr after administration of GSK2118436 + GSK1120212 on Day 1 (single dose) and at pre-dose, 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 10 and 12 hr post-dose on Day 21 (repeat dose) for PK analysis. GSK2118436 metabolites included GSK2285403, GSK2298683, and GSK2167542. Tmax is defined as the time of occurrence of Cmax. Tmax was determined directly from the raw concentration-time data. The apparent terminal elimination half-life (t1/2) obtained as the ratio of ln2/lamdaz, where lamdaz is the terminal phase rate constant estimated by linear regression analysis of the log transformed concentration-time data. . T1/2 was calculated only at Day 1.</description>

            <description>In the Phase I part, participants with BRAF V600E/K mutation-positive advanced solid tumors received the combination therapy of GSK2118436 150 mg (a combination of 75 mg capsules) orally BID and GSK1120212 2 mg tablet orally QD until disease progression, death or an unacceptable adverse event. GSK2118436 and GSK1120212 were administered in the morning at approximately the same time. The second dose of GSK2118436 was taken in the evening approximately 12 hr after the morning dose. The second dose of GSK2118436 was not administered on Day 1 for the 24 hr serial PK blood sampling. Study drugs were taken with approximately 200 mL of water under fasting conditions, either 1 hr before or 2 hr after a meal.</description>

          <description>Blood samples were collected from each participant at pre-dose, 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12 and 24 hr after administration of GSK2118436 + GSK1120212 on Day 1 (single dose) and at pre-dose, 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 10 and 12 hr post-dose on Day 21 (repeat dose) for PK analysis. GSK2118436 metabolites included GSK2285403, GSK2298683, and GSK2167542. Tmax is defined as the time of occurrence of Cmax. Tmax was determined directly from the raw concentration-time data. The apparent terminal elimination half-life (t1/2) obtained as the ratio of ln2/lamdaz, where lamdaz is the terminal phase rate constant estimated by linear regression analysis of the log transformed concentration-time data. . T1/2 was calculated only at Day 1.</description>

The length of this interval is estimated as the date of death or disease progression minus the date of first dose plus one day. The date of documented disease progression is defined as the date of disease progression based on radiologic evidence. Participants with documented date of disease progresssion or death and who had not received subsequent anticancer treatment prior to the date of documented disease progression or death were included in the analysis of PFS. PFS was assessed by investigator and BICR. Please note the values of the Full Range (min, max) are described irregardless of censoring at data cut-off.</description>

        <description>ORR is defined as the percentage of participants with an unconfirmed CR or PR according to RECIST version 1.1. RECIST is a set of rules that define when tumors in cancer participants improve (&quot;respond&quot;), stay the same (&quot;stabilize&quot;), or worsen (&quot;progress&quot;) during treatment. CR is defined as disappearance of all target lesions. Partial response is defined as at least a 30% decrease in the sum of the diameters of target lesions after treatment from Baseline (before study drug administration). Unconfirmed ORR was assessed by investigator and BICR.</description>

        <description>Duration of response is defined as the time from the first documented evidence of CR or PR until disease progression or death due to any cause among participants with confirmed CR or PR. The participant who showed a CR or PR was included in the analysis of duration of response. Duration of response was assessed by investigator and BICR. Please note the values of the Full Range (min, max) are described irregardless of censoring at data cut-off.</description>

G1, restricted in physically strenuous activity but ambulatory and able to carry out work of a light or sedentary nature, example, light house work, office work. G2, ambulatory and capable of all selfcare, but unable to carry out any work activities; up and about &gt;50% of waking hrs. G3, capable of only limited selfcare; confined to bed or chair &gt;50% of waking hrs. G4, completely disabled; cannot carry on any selfcare; totally confined to bed or chair. G5, dead. The worst-case during the on-therapy period was determined taking into account both scheduled and unscheduled assessments.

G2, ambulatory and capable of all selfcare, but unable to carry out any work activities; up and about &gt;50% of waking hrs. G3, capable of only limited selfcare; confined to bed or chair &gt;50% of waking hrs. G4, completely disabled; cannot carry on any selfcare; totally confined to bed or chair. G5, dead. The worst-case during the on-therapy period was determined taking into account both scheduled and unscheduled assessments. Number of par. who improved, had no change, or deteriorated in pef status from BL is summarized.</description>

SBP was categorized as: G1 (Increase to &gt;=120 to 140 mmHg), G2 (Increase to &gt;=140 to &lt;160 mmHg), and G3 (Increase to &gt;=160 mmHg). DBP was categorized as: G1 (Increase to &gt;=80 to &lt;90 mmHg), G2 (Increase to &gt;=90 to &lt;100 mmHg), and G3 (Increase to &gt;=100 mmHg). The worst-case during the on-therapy period was determined taking into account both scheduled and unscheduled assessments. An increase is defined as an increase in the CTCAE grade relative to the Baseline grade. Participants with missing Baseline values were assumed to have a Baseline value of G0.</description>

        <title>Phase II: Change From Baseline in Oxygen Saturation Measured Via Pulse Oxymetry at the Indicated Time Points</title>
        <description>Oxygen saturation measures the capacity of blood to transport oxygen to other parts of the body. Oxygen binds to hemoglobin in red blood cells when moving through the lungs. A pulse oximeter uses two frequencies of light (red and infrared) to determine the percentage of hemoglobin in the blood that is saturated with oxygen, that is called as blood oxygen saturation, or SpO2. Change from Baseline was calculated as the individual post-Baseline value (Days 8 and 15; Weeks 3 to 132 and post-treatment Visit) minus the Baseline value. The Baseline value is defined as the last pre-treatment value observed.</description>

            <description>In the Phase II part, participants with BRAF V600E/K mutation-positive cutaneous melanoma received the combination therapy of GSK2118436 150 mg (a combination of 75 mg capsules) orally BID and GSK1120212 2 mg tablet orally QD until disease progression, death or an unacceptable adverse event. GSK2118436 and GSK1120212 were administered in the morning at approximately the same time. The second dose of GSK2118436 was taken in the evening approximately 12 hr after the morning dose. Study drugs were taken with approximately 200 mL of water under fasting conditions, either 1 hr before or 2 hr after a meal.</description>

            <description>In the Phase II part, participants with BRAF V600E/K mutation-positive cutaneous melanoma received the combination therapy of GSK2118436 150 mg (a combination of 75 mg capsules) orally BID and GSK1120212 2 mg tablet orally QD until disease progression, death or an unacceptable adverse event. GSK2118436 and GSK1120212 were administered in the morning at approximately the same time. The second dose of GSK2118436 was taken in the evening approximately 12 hr after the morning dose. Study drugs were taken with approximately 200 mL of water under fasting conditions, either 1 hr before or 2 hr after a meal.</description>

        <description>Absolute change from Baseline in LVEF were summarized at each scheduled assessment time and in the worst-case post Baseline. Only the post Baseline assessments that used the same method (ECHO or MUGA) as the Baseline assessments were used to derive the change from Baseline. The change from Baseline was categorized as: any increase; no change; 0-&lt;10 Decrease, 10-19 Decrease, &gt;=20 Decrease, &gt;=10 Decrease and &gt;= LLN, &gt;=10 Decrease and below LLN, &gt;=20 Decrease and &gt;=LLN and &gt;=20 Decrease and below LLN. The worst-case during the on-therapy period was determined taking into account both scheduled and unscheduled assessments.</description>
