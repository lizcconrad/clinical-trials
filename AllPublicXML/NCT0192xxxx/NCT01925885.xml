  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      -  Hypothesis: Focal Impulse and Rotor Modulation (FIRM) will substantially reduce or
           eliminate clinical atrial fibrillation in subjects with accepted indications for
           catheter ablation of paroxysmal AF, compared to standard pulmonary vein isolation.

        -  Summary: This is a prospective randomized study to assess the safety and effectiveness
           of FIRM procedures only, versus standard Pulmonary Vein Isolation (PVI) procedures for
           the treatment of symptomatic paroxysmal atrial fibrillation.

      A total of 188 subjects will be enrolled-subjects will be equally (1:1) randomized between
      those undergoing conventional atrial fibrillation ablation with confirmation of pulmonary
      vein isolation (PVI) versus those actively treated with the FIRM procedure without PVI.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Reported incidence of at least two (2) documented episodes of symptomatic paroxysmal
             atrial fibrillation (AF) during the six months preceding trial entry (at least one
             episode should be documented by rhythm strip or ECG).

          -  Attempt of at least one Class I or III anti-arrhythmia drug with failure defined as
             recurrence of symptomatic AF or adverse drug effect resulting in stopping the
             medication (drug duration and dose will be documented).

          -  Left atrial size &lt;55mm in largest dimension (typically atrial septum to carina of left
             pulmonary veins) as measured and image documented by preoperative imaging (CT or MRI)
