  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This pilot clinical trial studies perfusion computed tomography (CT) in predicting response
      to treatment in patients with advanced kidney cancer. Comparing results of diagnostic
      procedures done before, during, and after targeted therapy may help doctors predict a
      patient's response to treatment and help plan the best treatment.
