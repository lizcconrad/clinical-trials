  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective randomized controlled trial to look into the reduction of catheter
      associated urinary tract infections in the postoperative period. It will specifically look at
      short gynecologic procedures such as D&amp;C (dilation and curettage), hysteroscopies and LEEP
      procedures and the need to perform intraoperative catheterization. If a patient urinates
      immediately before a short operation then there is no need to drain the bladder with a
      catheter during the procedure. The investigators hypothesize that eliminating catheterization
      during these short procedures may decrease postoperative urinary tract infections. The hope
      is that this study would provide evidence to support a change in practice.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The majority of research currently concentrates on indwelling catheters rather than one-time
      catheterization. Current practice at our institution in the gynecologic operating room is to
      perform a one time catheterization on patient's undergoing short procedures, yet it is
      unclear if this is a necessary intervention. If patients are asked to void immediately before
      their procedure it would eliminate the need for intra-operative catheterization and eliminate
      a potential source of infection.

      The study is designed to determine whether routine catheterization prior to a minor OB/GYN
      procedure causes symptomatic or asymptomatic bacteria in the urine. Current practice is
      one-time catheterization of patients undergoing minor OB/GYN procedures prior to the
      beginning of the procedure. The investigators hypothesize that this causes asymptomatic or
      symptomatic bacteriuria.
