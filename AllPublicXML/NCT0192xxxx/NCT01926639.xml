  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with non-curable disseminated follicular lymphoma receive local radiotherapy
      targeting single lymph nodes and injection of low-dose rituximab (anti-CD20) and autologous
      dendritic cells. The therapy is repeated 3 times, targeting different lesion. Aims are to
      induce tumor immunity and clinical responses.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The clinical protocol is based on the rationale that the immune system has been developed to
      combat infectious disease. To mimic the environment in infected tissue, selected
      tumor-affected lymph nodes are treated locally with a single dose of 8 Gy radiotherapy and
      injected with therapeutic antibody (anti-CD20/Rituximab). Later, dendritic cells (DC) are
      injected into the damaged tumor tissue together with a stimulatory cytokine (GM-CSF) to
      initiate an immune response. Patients with untreated or relapsed stage III/IV follicular
      lymphoma not in need of standard therapy receive intra-tumoral injections of low-dose
      anti-CD20 antibodies (5 mg) on days 1 and 3 and local radiotherapy on day 2. On days 4 and 5,
      dendritic cells generated from monocytes isolated from the patients blood are injected into
      the site together with the stimulatory cytokine GM-CSF administered subcutaneously.
      Additional lymph nodes are treated similarly after 2 and 4 weeks. The treatment is thus
      performed three times, targeting different lymphoma nodes. The primary aims are to induce
      tumor-specific immune responses and clinical responses.
