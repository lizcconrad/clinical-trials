  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will test the hypothesis that GSK1278863 will reduce neurologic, renal, and/or
      cardiac ischemia in patients undergoing elective descending thoracic aorta/thoracoabdominal
      aortic aneurysm (DTA/TAAA) repair, a population known to be at high risk for ischemic events
      from their underlying pathology and the surgical complexity required to address their
      disease. Approximately 160 subjects will be stratified according to intervention type
      (surgical or endovascular repair, with the latter limited to 50% of the total study
      population) and randomized in a 1:1 fashion to treatment with GSK1278863 (300 milligrams
      [loading dose] followed by 100 milligrams [mg]/day x 4 days) or placebo starting prior to
      planned repair, through postoperative day 3. The duration of participation in this study is
      expected to be approximately 4 to 8 weeks from screening to follow-up.

        allow confirmation of post-menopausal status prior to study enrollment. For most forms of
        HRT, at least 2-4 weeks will elapse between the cessation of therapy and the blood draw;
        this interval depends on the type and dosage of HRT. Following confirmation of their
        post-menopausal status, they can resume use of HRT during the study without use of a
        contraceptive method.

        <title>Change From Baseline to Peak in Cerebrospinal Fluid (CSF) S100 Beta Within 48 Hours Following Descending Thoracic Aorta/Thoracoabdominal Aortic Aneurysm (DTA/TAAA) Repair</title>
        <description>S100 beta is a CSF biomarker that rise significantly in participants with neurologic injury following DTA/TAAA surgery. CSF samples were collected at Baseline and within 48 hours following DTA/TAAA repair to assess peak change from Baseline in CSF S100 beta. Baseline was defined at Day 0. Change from Baseline was calculated as post-Baseline value minus Baseline value.</description>

        <description>An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a participant, temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease (new or exacerbated) temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product. An SAE is any untoward medical occurrence that, at any dose results in death, is life-threatening, requires hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, results in disability/incapacity, or is a congenital anomaly/birth defect, considered to be medically significant or is associated with liver injury and impaired liver function.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Area Under Curve (AUC) for CSF S100 Beta to 48 Hours</title>
        <description>S100 beta was a CSF biomarker that rise significantly in participants with neurologic injury following DTA/TAAA surgery. AUC for CSF S100 beta from Baseline to 48 hours following DTA/TAAA repair was assessed to measure central nervous system injury. AUC was determined using the linear trapezoidal rule for increasing concentrations and the logarithmic trapezoidal rule for decreasing concentrations. Baseline was defined at Day 0. Change from Baseline was calculated as post-Baseline minus Baseline value.</description>

CSF samples were collected at Baseline and within 48 hours following DTA/TAAA repair to assess peak change from Baseline in CSF tau protein. Baseline was defined at Day 0. Change from Baseline was calculated as post-Baseline minus Baseline value.</description>
          <population>PD Population. For the change from Baseline assessment, only those with both evaluable Baseline and post-dose values (so that the change could be calculated) were included in the analysis.</population>

        <description>The NIHSS was a systematic assessment tool that provided a quantitative measure of stroke-related neurologic deficit. A trained observer rates the participant’s ability to answer questions and perform activities. Ratings for each item are scored with 0 as normal, and there was an allowance for untestable items. The NIHSS scores were categorized as: No event (NIHSS score=0), Mild (NIHSS score 1–4), Moderate (NIHSS score 5-15), or Severe (NIHSS score &gt;15). The single participant assessment required less than 10 minutes to complete. Data for participants with NIHSS administrated at surgical day, post-operative Day 1, Day 2, Day 7 and Follow-up Visit has been reported.</description>

        <description>The mRS was a commonly used scale for measuring the degree of disability or dependence in the daily activities of people who have suffered a stroke or other causes of neurological disability. The mRS was a 6 point disability scale with possible scores ranging from 0 up to 5. A separate category (of 6) was added for participants who died. The mRS scores were categorized as mild (mRS score 0-1), moderate (mRS score 2-3), or severe (mRS score &gt;=4).</description>

        <description>The ASIA score was developed by the American Spinal Injury Association for the neurologic assessment of participants with a spinal injury. In this study, only the ASIA lower extremity motor score was assessed. This comprised five muscle groups scored from 0-5 on both the left and right lower extremities, for a maximal total score of 50. The ASIA scores were categorized as: mild (ASIA score 41-50), moderate (ASIA score 26-40), or severe (ASIA score &lt;=25).</description>

        <description>The NIHSS was a systematic assessment tool that provided a quantitative measure of stroke-related neurologic deficit. Ratings for each item are scored with 0 as normal, and there was an allowance for untestable items. The NIHSS scores were categorized as: No event (NIHSS score=0), Mild (NIHSS score 1–4), Moderate (NIHSS score 5-15), or Severe (NIHSS score &gt;15). The ASIA score was developed by the American Spinal Injury Association for the neurologic assessment of participants with a spinal injury. In this study, only the ASIA lower extremity motor score was assessed. This comprised five muscle groups scored from 0-5 on both the left and right lower extremities, for a maximal total score of 50. The ASIA scores were categorized as: mild (ASIA score 41-50), moderate (ASIA score 26-40), or severe (ASIA score &lt;=25). “Composite above” includes participants with NIHSS&gt;5 or ASIA&lt;40 at the 30-day Follow-up or Death.</description>

        <description>CSF samples were collected immediately after the lumbar drain was placed, just prior to PNI, and 2, 24, 36 and 48 hours post PNI. In participants that developed spinal ischemia, the CSF drain was potentially maintained for longer than 48 hours. In that instance, daily CSF samples for PK were collected until the drain was removed. AUC (0-t) was determined using the linear trapezoidal rule for increasing concentrations and the logarithmic trapezoidal rule for decreasing concentrations.</description>
