  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Recently a new method of induce similar hypertrophy in the liver as is observed after
      hepatectomy has been described and was given the eponym &quot;ALLPS&quot;. &quot;ALPPS&quot; stands for
      Associating Liver Partition with Portal Vein Ligation for Staged Hepatectomy (ALPPS).

      Since the procedure is used worldwide this international registry was created to enable
      tracking of cases performed worldwide for safety and outcomes and innovations by the groups
      involved as well as allows a non-randomized comparison to the conventional methods of portal
      vein occlusion.

      The ALPPS registry is accessible online through the data portal www.allps.net. Registered
      members recieve access through a member ID and password. Data submission is supported by the
      SECUTRIAL software, supported by the Clinical Trials center of the University of Zurich.

      All data submitted are anonymized before entry through the SECUTRIAL Software. Administration
      of the registry data is performed through the Department of Visceral and Transplantation
      Surgery in the University Hospital Zurich and the Clinical Trials Center of the University of
      Zurich, Switzerland, in collaboration with the Italian Hospital in Buenoas Aires, Argentina.

      A Scientific Committee has been appointed to give approval for any data analysis. Any
      participating center may apply for data analysis.

      Particiating International Centers have responsibility for the validity of the data submitted
      and the respective local institutional review procedures.

    <measure>Long term survival</measure>
    <time_frame>5 years</time_frame>
    <description>Outcome variables include long term survival after 3, 6, 12, 18 and 24 month, survival status after 3, 4, and 5 years. If the patient is still alive the data about hepatic recurrence and systemic recurrence will be collected. If there is a recurrence the type of treatment will be recorded.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Perioperative liver and renal function</measure>
    <time_frame>5 days</time_frame>
    <description>Outcome variables include liver and renal function after surgery. INR and Total bilirubin as well as creatinine prior to surgery and 5 days after stage 1 and five days after stage 2 are recorded and commonly accepted citeria for postoperative liver and postoperative renal failure are used to assess these 2 types of complications.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Disease specific recurrence/failure to cure</measure>
    <time_frame>5 years</time_frame>
    <description>Outcome variables include disease specific failure to cure (to completely resect) or disease specific recurrence after 3, 6, 12, 18 and 24 month, survival status after 3, 4, and 5 years. If there is a failure to cure or recurrence, the type of treatment will be recorded.</description>

    <description>ALPPS is the most recent modification of the techniques developed for Two-stage hepatectomies. ALPPS allows to remove an extensive part of the liver in two steps. In the first step the liver parenchyma is transected along the intended line of resection and the future liver remnant cleaned by partial resections from all tumor tissue in the case of bilobar tumors. To this a portal ligation of the larger liver lobe that will have to be removed is added. After a waiting period of 1-2 weeks the second step is performed in which the deportalized liver is removed to render the patient completely tumor-free. (Ann Surg 2012; 255(3):405-14.)</description>
