  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is a randomised, placebo-controlled, double-blind, parallel, dose-finding study
      with healthy volunteers. A total of 100 male and female volunteers will be included. The
      volunteers will be randomized into one of 10 groups, each of 10 participants, consuming
      either active product in various mixes and doses (9 groups) or placebo product (1 group) for
      2 weeks. The 9 groups receiving active product will receive either one of two Human Milk
      Oligosaccharides (HMOs) alone or in combination at different doses. The primary purpose of
      the study is establishing the effects of various compositions and doses of HMOs on the faecal
      flora and on gastrointestinal symptoms in health adults.
