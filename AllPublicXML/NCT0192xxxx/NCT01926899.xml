      The objective of this study is to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of bortezomib in
      combination with calcineurin inhibitor and methotrexate as acute graft versus host disease
      (aGVHD) prophylaxis in pediatric patients undergoing allogeniec hematopoietic stem cell
      transplant (alloHSCT)

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Voluntary written informed consent before performance of any study-related procedure
             not part of normal medical care, with the understanding that consent may be withdrawn
             by the subject at any time without prejudice to future medical care.

               -  Female subject of childbearing potential agree to practice 2 effective methods of
                  contraception from the time of signing the informed consent form through 30 days
                  after the last dose of bortezomib, or agree to completely abstain from
                  heterosexual intercourse.

               -  Male subjects, even if surgically sterilized (i.e., status postvasectomy) must
                  agree to 1 of the following: practice effective barrier contraception during the
                  entire study treatment period and through a minimum of 30 days after the last
                  dose of study drug, or completely abstain from heterosexual intercourse.

               -  Subjects must be greater than or equal to 1 years old and less 22 years old.

               -  Subjects must have any malignant or non-malignant condition that requires
                  treatment with alloHSCT

               -  Karnofsky or Lansky performance score greater than 60%

               -  Subjects must have a 9 of 10 (HLA A, B, C, DR, and DQ) or 10 of 10 HLA
                  matched-related or MUD for bone marrow or peripheral blood alloHSCT

               -  Subjects must meet other institutional criteria for alloHSCT

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  â€¢ Patient has greater than 1.5 times upper limit normal (ULN) Total Bilirubin

               -  Patient has greater than or equal to Grade 2 peripheral neuropathy

               -  Patient had myocardial infarction within 6 months prior to enrollment or has New
                  York Heart Association (NYHA) Class III or IV heart failure, uncontrolled angina,
                  severe uncontrolled ventricular arrhythmias, or electrocardiographic evidence of
                  acute ischemia or active conduction system abnormalities. Prior to study entry,
                  any ECG abnormality at screening must be documented by the investigator as not
                  medically relevant.

               -  Patient has hypersensitivity to bortezomib, boron, or mannitol.

               -  Female subject is pregnant or lactating. Confirmation that the subject is not
                  pregnant must be established by a negative serum beta-human chorionic
                  gonadotropin (beta hCG) pregnancy test result obtained during screening.

                  this clinical study.

               -  Diagnosed or treated for another malignancy within 2 years of enrollment, with
                  the exception of complete resection of basal cell carcinoma or squamous cell
                  carcinoma of the skin, an in situ malignancy, or low-risk prostate cancer after
                  curative therapy.

               -  Participation in clinical trials with other investigational agents not included
                  in this trial, within 14 days of the start of this trial and throughout the
                  duration of this trial.

               -  Radiation therapy within 3 weeks before randomization. Enrollment of subjects who
                  require concurrent radiotherapy (which must be localized in its field size)
                  should be deferred until the radiotherapy is completed and 3 weeks have elapsed
                  since the last date of therapy.

               -  Current active infection per physician determination

               -  HIV positive

               -  Previous myeloablative autoHSCT or alloHSCT in previous 12 months

               -  ALT and AST greater than 5 times ULN for age

               -  Creatinine clearance or glomerular filtration rate (GFR) less than 60 ml/min/1.73

               -  Shortening fraction less than 26% or ejection fraction less than 45%

                  second of forced expiration (FEV1), diffusion capacity less than 50% of predicted
                  (corrected for hemoglobin); if unable to perform lung function tests, oxygen
                  saturation less than 94% on room air
