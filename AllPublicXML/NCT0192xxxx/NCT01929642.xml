  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the feasibility and safety of administering
      rapalogues, sirolimus or everolimus, in participants with Tuberous Sclerosis Complex (TSC)
      and self-injury and to measure cognitive and behavioral changes, including reduction in
      autistic symptoms, self-injurious and aggressive behaviors, as well as improvements in
      cognition across multiple domains of cognitive function.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a feasibility and safety study primarily designed to assess the feasibility and
      safety of conducting a larger clinical trial with sirolimus in individuals with TSC. The
      present study will employ an ABA design in which three pediatric participants will be
      selected to receive baseline medical, developmental, behavioral, and cognitive evaluations,
      followed by a 26 week administration of sirolimus, repeated baseline assessments at the end
      of the 26 week treatment phase, and a 4 week titrated withdrawal followed by a 22 week period
      in which no rapalogue is administered. All participants will again be administered baseline
      medical, behavioral, and cognitive evaluations at the end of the study in order to compare
      all evaluations done at baseline, the end of the 26 week treatment, and completion of the
      study. These comparisons will be done to assess secondary outcomes that include reductions in
      autistic symptoms, self-injury, and aggression, as well as improvements in cognitive function
      across multiple domains. Furthermore, administration of the secondary outcome measures will
      also allow us to better understand the sensitivity of these measures in patients with TSC
      during the course of a clinical trial.

      Families of potentially eligible children who express interest in the study and meet
      prescreening criteria will be invited to attend a screening visit to determine eligibility,
      inclusion/exclusion criteria, and availability for eight additional study visits. Prior to
      enrollment, informed consent will be obtained from the parent or legal guardian.

      Investigators will use the methods of analysis of single-subject research (ABA design, where
      first A represents baseline, B represents treatment, and A represents reversal of treatment.
      The analysis will focus on each of the 3 subjects separately. Data on feasibility and safety
      (primary outcome) and on frequency of disruptive behavior (secondary outcome) will be plotted
      and visually inspected to detect any temporal changes by phase: 1. Baseline, 2. Treatment, 3.
      After treatment. Data in each phase will be summarized as mean +/- standard deviation (SD).
      We will use the summary data to assess the potential effect of the intervention. Consistency
      of the effect will be examined across the 3 study participants.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Caregiver Burden</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline to EOT visit 12 week 53</time_frame>
    <description>The Caregiver Burden Scale is a standard set of questions which will be used to measure the non-medical impact of TSC on caregivers and how it affects the feasibility of study completion.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Feasibility measurements of parental stress</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline to EOT visit 12 week 53</time_frame>
    <description>Measurements of stress will be administered. Specifically, we will use the Parental Stress Index. Quantifying stress, as well as compliance with the study protocol, will allow investigators to objectively assess the feasibility of a larger clinical trial of sirolimus in patients with TSC.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Direct, Structured Behavioral Observation</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
    <description>The secondary outcome measures will include frequency, severity, and characterization of disruptive behaviors, including repetitive, self-injurious, and aggressive behavior as measured by direct and structured behavioral observation by behavioral psychologists from the Neurobehavioral Unit of Kennedy Krieger Institute. These disruptive behaviors are associated with TSC, and no effective treatment has been developed. These behaviors are associated with morbidity, poor quality of life, and decreased opportunities for full participation in society. In this study, our goal will be to assess the feasibility in order to plan for the logistics of determining if treatment with sirolimus reduces the frequency, severity, or duration of repetitive, self-injurious, and aggressive behavior.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Cognitive Function</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
    <description>Participants will be evaluated using the Leiter, Revised edition.Participants unable to complete the Leiter-R will be evaluated using the Mullen Scales of Early Learning by a neuropsychologist. Participants with a cognitive level less than thirty six months will also undergo a developmental evaluation using the Capute scales. Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scales will be completed to measure participants' ability to function in activities of daily living. An experimental developmental paradigm designed to assess visual spatial memory and visual spatial working memory, designed by the investigators, will be administered. This paradigm will involve hiding a toy in the exam room while the participant observes through a two-way mirror. The participant will then be brought into the exam room via a door that is on the adjacent wall to the right of the two-way mirror and will be asked to find the hidden toy. Reaction time and search errors will be recorded.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Repetitive behavior</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
    <description>Repetitive behavior will be assessed using the Repetitive Behavior Scale - revised, a questionnaire to characterize several domains of repetitive behavior including ritualistic behavior, stereotypic behavior, self-injurious behavior, compulsive behavior, and restricted interests.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Self-Injury Trauma Scale--SIT Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
    <description>The SIT Scale is a 3-part clinician-completed scale used to quantify visible injuries caused by self-injurious behavior(SIB). Part 1 includes sections to indicate SIB topographies and any evidence of healed injury. In Part 2 evaluators document the location and severity of injury (on a 3-point scale). In Part 3, respective scores from Parts 1 and 2 are summed to obtain a Number Index, a Severity Index, and Estimate of Current Risk. This Scale has been used in research with adults with SIB with inter-rater reliability averaging 85%.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Confirmation and Characterization of Autism Spectrum Disorder</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
    <description>The Autism Diagnostic Observation Scale and Autism Diagnostic Interview- revised edition, will be completed by a certified speech/language pathologist. These two well validated diagnostic measures of autism and autism spectrum disorders (ASD) will be used in conjunction with clinical history, the Social Responsiveness Scale, the Social Communication Questionnaire, and the Repetitive Behavior Scale - revised edition to confirm a diagnosis of autism or ASD, as well as characterize the participants' specific autistic symptoms. The clinical history and aforementioned questionnaires will be completed with one of the participants' parents or caregivers in an interview format.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Safety</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
    <description>Safety will be assessed by measured by number, type, and severity of adverse events as well as compliance and attrition associated with these events.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Seizure Diary</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
    <description>Parents will be asked to document the frequency of their child's seizures using a manual or electronic (seizuretracker.com) seizure diary. Seizures affect up to 90% of patients with TSC. Although not a primary or secondary outcome measure in the case series of patients treated with sirolimus or the experimental study of participants treated with everolimus, the investigators noted reduction in seizure frequency in all of the sirolimus-treated patients and nine of the sixteen everolimus-treated participants.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>MRI</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and every 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>For participants who have not had brain Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) in the 6 months preceding study entry, this will be obtained at study visits 3 and 12. Participants who have had a brain MRI in the 6 months preceding study entry, will be scheduled every 6 months starting with the date of their most recent brain MRI.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Seizure Characterization and monitoring</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline and visit 6 week 27</time_frame>
    <description>A routine Electroencephalography (EEG) with video will be obtained to identify and characterize neurophysiologic signs of seizures or epileptiform activity. Routine EEGs are clinically indicated for patients with TSC because they are at risk for the development of epilepsy,including seizures without motor manifestation.
In addition to the routine EEG, parents will be given the choice of completion of a manual or electronic seizure diary to monitor the frequency and characteristics of seizures.</description>
