        Subjects with various stages of impaired renal function must meet all of the following
        inclusion criteria at screening will be considered for admission to the study:

          2. Male, between the ages of 18 and 80 years with Body Mass Index (BMI) between 25 and
             42, inclusive, are preferred.

          3. Subjects must meet the criteria of mildly (creatinine clearance 50-80 mL/min) or
             moderately (creatinine clearance 30-50 mL/min) impaired renal function. The
             Investigator will assess the renal impairment category of each subject. Substantiation
             for the diagnosis must be indicated in source documents; (See Appendix B)

             Investigator (See Section 9.3.2, Day -1)

          5. If on medications for treatment of the complications of renal disease, and other
             concomitant chronic illnesses, subjects must have been taking the medications at a
             stable dose for at least 10 days prior to the first Androxal dosing date and are then
             to be continued at the same dose for the duration of the study. The medications must
             be recorded in source documents;

          6. Subject is willing to remain in the clinic for the screening visit (approximately 1
             day for the screening visit) and for the treatment visit (approximately 3 days);

             written informed consent on an IRB-approved form prior to the initiation of any study
             procedures;

          2. Male, between the ages of 18 and 60 years with Body Mass Index (BMI) between 25 and

             in the test groups: should be ± 20 years of the mean of mildly and moderately renally
             impaired subjects included in the study and ± 20% of the average BMI of mildly and
             moderately renally impaired subjects;

          5. No significant abnormal findings at the screening physical examination as evaluated by
             the Investigator;

          6. Normal laboratory values or clinically insignificant findings at screening as
             determined by the Investigator;

          7. Subject is willing to remain in the clinic for the screening visit (approximately 1
             day for the first screening visit) and for the treatment visit (approximately 3 days);

          8. No tobacco (nicotine products) use for at least three (3) months prior to the study;
