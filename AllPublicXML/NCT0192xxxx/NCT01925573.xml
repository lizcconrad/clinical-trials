  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This protocol is designed to generate and provide preliminary data to determine the safety
      and activity of combination therapy using tumor treating fields (TTFields;
      Optune(NovoTTF-100A); Novocure, Haifa, Israel), a novel FDA-approved therapy utilizing
      alternating electric fields to inhibit tumor cell growth, along with bevacizumab (Avastin;
      Genentech, San Francisco, CA), a humanized monoclonal antibody that inhibits vascular
      endothelial growth factor (VEGF), and hypofractionated stereotactic radiotherapy, a
      highly-focal abbreviated course of brain irradiation, in the treatment of patients with
      bevacizumab-naive recurrent GBM. Each of these individual therapies, and also several
      combinations in doublets, has already demonstrated safety and efficacy but prospective
      clinical data for the concurrent combination of all three therapies are lacking.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The combination of Optune(NovoTTF) with the active regimen of bevacizumab and
      hypofractionated stereotactic radiotherapy bases the addition of an effective new treatment
      in the setting of a safe regimen with favorable survival reports. To date, no clinical data
      are available on the interaction of concomitant tumor treating fields with radiation therapy
      either with or without bevacizumab. TTF and radiation both have the potential to enhance the
      other's therapeutic ratio though synergistic mechanisms of action. The addition of
      bevacizumab to this regimen has both therapeutic and improved-toxicity implications. A trial
      combining Optune with the proven regimen of HFSRT and bevacizumab for recurrent glioblastoma
      affords an avenue to demonstrate safety in a population who may more readily derive a benefit
      from novel multimodality therapy and explore the potential for synergistic effect. The
      endpoint of efficacy would clearly need to be more definitively addressed in a future
      categorical trial, which would be the logical positive outcome of this pilot study.
