    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the effects of renal denervation using externally focused
      therapeutic ultrasound with external targeting and tracking on patients with refractory
      hypertension.

      This study is a prospective, multi-center trial wherein each included subject will receive
      the experimental externally focused ultrasound renal denervation therapy. It will be
      conducted on a maximum of twenty patients who meet the eligibility criteria and have signed
      the informed consent form.

      Safety is the primary endpoint of this study. Safety will be assessed by incidence and
      evaluation of any serious adverse effects associated with the investigational procedure
      through the 52-week evaluation. Clinical utility is a secondary endpoint of this study.
      Clinical utility will be evaluated by comparing pre and post therapy systolic and diastolic
      blood pressure.
