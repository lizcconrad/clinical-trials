      termination of pregnancy using misoprostol.

      Misoprostol is the primary drug of choice for medical termination. It is not only cheap, but
      also stable at room temperature and easily available worldwide. It is indicated for the
      treatment of gastritis, but is widely used off-label for a variety of indications in the
      practice of obstetrics and gynecology, including medication abortion, induction of labor, and
      the treatment of postpartum hemorrhage. The optimal dosage and route of administration have
      not been well defined and vary with physicians. The potency of misoprostol's effect varies
      with dosage, route of administration and dosing interval; both maternal and fetal factors
      may, to certain extent, affect the abortion interval. This study aims to analyze the factors
      influencing the abortion interval of second-trimester termination of pregnancy using
      misoprostol.
