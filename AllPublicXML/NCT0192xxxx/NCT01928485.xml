    <textblock>
      This randomized phase II trial studies how well green tea extract works in treating patients
      with low-risk prostate cancer. Green tea extract contains ingredients that may prevent or
      slow the growth of certain cancers.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess changes in the levels of total- and free- prostate-specific antigen (PSA), free
      to total PSA (f/tPSA) ratio and insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-I) levels and IGF-I/free
      PSA (fPSA) ratio, insulin-like growth factor binding protein 3 (IGFBP-3), and vascular
      endothelial growth factor (VEGF) after Sunphenon 90DCF-T (green tea extract) supplementation
      during the period between recruitment and biopsy.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the effects of oral ingestion on Sunphenon 90DCF-T supplementation during the
      period between recruitment and biopsy in the reactivation of glutathione S-transferase pi 1
      (GSTP1) (whole blood deoxyribonucleic acid [DNA]); levels of antigen identified by monoclonal
      antibody Ki-67 (Ki-67), cluster of differentiation 34 (CD34), and M30 apopotosense in the
      prostate tissue.

      II. To evaluate the effects of oral ingestion of Sunphenon 90DCF-T during the period between
      recruitment and biopsy on histologic findings in prostate tissue such as nuclear measurements
      viz. shape, size and texture and quality of life (QOL) assessment.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

      ARM A: Patients undergo active surveillance for 52 weeks.

      ARM B: Patients receive green tea extract orally (PO) once daily (QD) for 52 weeks in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 30 days.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients must be males with histologically confirmed and clinically localized
             low-grade and low-volume prostate cancer demonstrated at the time of initial diagnosis

          -  Prostate biopsy must be positive for cancer: clinically localized T1c or T2a, PSA ≤
             10, Gleason ≤ 6 at the time of initial diagnosis. As the intent of serial biopsy is to
             ensure that the disease has not progressed to the stage or grade of requiring
             treatment, the presence of a negative biopsy following an initial positive biopsy
             (coupled with clinically localized T1c or T2a PSA ≤10 and Gleason ≤6 for a patient who
             has had no treatment, will not render the patient ineligible. If the consecutive
             biopsy is either negative, or if positive and remains clinically localized T1c or T2a,
             PSA≤10 and Gleason ≤6, the patient is eligible

             compliance with study requirements

          -  Patients who have received prior hormonal or surgical therapy for prostate cancer;
             including prior brachytherapy or radiation therapy

          -  Signs or symptoms of progressive or uncontrolled liver disease

          -  Known malignancy at any site within the last two years; with the exception of basal
             cell carcinoma (BCC)

          -  Participation in a research trial within the past three months

          -  Any condition that would interfere with the ability to give informed consent or comply
             with the study protocol

             product capsules
