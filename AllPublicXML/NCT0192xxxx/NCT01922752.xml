      The primary objective is to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD), safety, and
      tolerability of oral CEP-37440 administered daily to patients with advanced or metastatic
      solid tumors.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients must have histologic or cytologic evidence of a solid neoplasm for which no
             standard therapy is available, or have progressed despite standard therapy, or are
             intolerant to standard therapy.

          -  Patients must have evidence of recurrent, locally advanced, or metastatic disease.

          -  Patients can either have had no prior anticancer therapy, multiple lines of either
             prior chemotherapy/biologic therapy/experimental therapy or, if the patient has
             anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK)-positive non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), prior
             crizotinib.

          -  Patients must have a predicted life expectancy of more than 3 months.

          -  Patients must have presence of at least 1 lesion that is measurable or evaluable using
             RECIST v1.1.

          -  Patients must have an ECOG performance score of 0, 1, or 2.

          -  Patients with central nervous system (CNS) metastases will be allowed on this study.
             Patients may have received surgical and/or radiation treatment. The metastases must be
             neurologically stable, on or off corticosteroids. Patients can have low level,
             asymptomatic brain lesions that do not require surgical/radiation intervention
             acutely. Patients with symptomatic lesions with impending neurologic compromise should
             be appropriately treated with high dose steroids/radiation and may be re-evaluated for
             this study when neurologically stable.

          -  Patients must have completed any prior anticancer treatment and must have recovered
             from any acute toxicities. The period between the last dose of prior treatment and the
             first dose of study drug treatment must be at least 1 week for radiotherapy and at
             least 2 to 3 weeks for all other modalities of therapy including chemotherapy,
             monoclonal antibody therapy, immunotherapy, other investigational drugs, or other
             kinase inhibitors.

          -  Other criteria apply.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  The patient has ongoing or active infection requiring parenteral antibiotics.

          -  The patient has uncontrolled hypertension despite adequate therapy (ie, systolic blood
             pressure higher than 150 mm Hg or diastolic blood pressure higher than 90 mm Hg found
             on 2 separate occasions separated by 1 week).

          -  The patient has uncontrolled diabetes mellitus (despite therapeutic intervention) and
             occurrence of more than 2 episodes of ketoacidosis in the 12 months prior to the first
             dose of study drug.

          -  The patient has an active second malignancy other than curatively resected basal cell
             carcinoma of the skin, squamous cell carcinoma of the skin, in situ carcinoma of the
             cervix, or other cancers for which they are treated with curative intent, and no known
             active disease in the 3 years prior to enrollment.

          -  The patient has a primary brain tumor. Patients may have brain metastases from another
             primary site.

          -  The patient has QTcF interval greater than 450 msec, has a known history of QTcF
             prolongation, is taking medications known to prolong QTcF, or has a history of torsade
             de pointes.

          -  The patient has a prior ALK-inhibitor-related toxicity or any other prior
             therapy-related acute toxicity that has not resolved prior to the first dose of study
             drug.

          -  Other criteria apply.
