  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Knee related mobility limitations are the leading cause of disability in the western world.
      It is a very expensive and debilitating condition when the cost of lost productivity and
      personal assistance is considered.

      In recent years there has been a growing interest in alternative medicine and many
      individuals seek such treatments. Rosehip, that is sold as a nutritional supplement, has been
      particular popular, and has been shown effective in relieiving pain - albeit the evidence is
      scarce.

      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of specialized rosehip powder
      nutritional additives (Rosenoids®) on knee joint function during walking in subjects with
      knee-related walking limitations.

    <description>3-D kinematic gait data is obtained using a 6-camera Motion Analysis System sampling at 100 Hz capturing positions and movements of reflective markers placed on the skin and arranged in the Plug-in-Gait configuration. Ground reaction forces and moments are obtained with two 6-channel force platforms (Advanced Mechanical Technologies, Inc., Newton, MA, USA) operating at 1500 Hz synchronized with the camera system. Specialized software is used to generate lower extremity angular kinematic and kinetic data using inverse dynamics.</description>

    <description>Rosehip powder made from the fleshy orange walls (hypanthiums) of Rosehips with the achenes (seeds) removed, from the wild growing species Dog Rose (Rosa canina L.), in addition to vitamin C as sodium ascorbate. The active ingredient complex is Rosenoids®, Vitamin C, flavonoids, carotens, triterpene acids, and galactolipids. Rosenoids® is the registered name for the bioactive complex isolated from the rose-hip (Rosa canina) used in RH01. It is being supplied as capsules containing 750 mg of the Rosehip powder and 26.7 mg vitamin C.</description>
