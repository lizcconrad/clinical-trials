  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a 6-month, nonrandomized, open-label extension study to assess the long-term safety
      of hydrocodone bitartrate extended-release (ER) tablets in patients with moderate to severe
      chronic low back pain who require continuous opioid treatment for an extended period of time.

      To be eligible for Study 3104, patients were required to have completed the entire double
      blind treatment period on study drug (either placebo or hydrocodone bitartrate ER tablets)
      through week 12 of Study 3103 (NCT01789970) and to have met the entry criteria for Study
      3104.

      Eligible patients from Study 3103 (NCT01789970) were enrolled for participation in this
      extension study. For these patients, the final study visit in Study 3103 was visit 1 for this
      study (also referred to as the titration or adjustment baseline visit, depending on whether
      the patient was enrolled under the original or amended protocol, respectively). The original
      protocol was amended after 26 patients had been enrolled in the study. Those who were
      enrolled under the original protocol participated in a double-blind titration period of up to
      approximately 4 weeks followed by an open-label treatment period of 22 weeks. Those patients
      who were enrolled under the amended protocol participated in an open-label adjustment period
      of up to approximately 3 weeks followed by an open-label treatment period of 22 weeks.

    <description>An adverse event (AE) was defined in the protocol as any untoward medical occurrence that develops or worsens in severity during the conduct of a clinical study and does not necessarily have a causal relationship to the study drug. Severity was rated by the investigator on a scale of mild, moderate and severe, with severe= an inability to carry out usual activities. Relation of AE to treatment was determined by the investigator. Serious AEs include death, a life-threatening adverse event, inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, persistent or significant disability or incapacity, a congenital anomaly or birth defect, OR an important medical event that jeopardized the patient and required medical intervention to prevent the previously listed serious outcomes.</description>

    <measure>Participants With Clinically Significant (CS) Hearing Changes From Baseline to the Final Visit in Pure Tone Audiometry Test Results</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline was within two weeks of the final study visit in study 3103; during study exam was within two weeks of the end of trial visit for study 3104 (up to study week 26)</time_frame>
    <description>Pure tone audiometry was performed by trained personnel. Hearing loss was classified in degrees of hearing from normal to profound. This classification was determined by the hearing threshold (or the softest sound detected at a specific frequency). The exact ranges that classified hearing loss depended on the exact technique used during testing and on the patient's age. These values were provided by each audiology laboratory that performed the test. For serial audiograms, the criteria for a clinically significant hearing change were based on guidance from the American Speech Language Hearing Association (ASHA 1994, cited in [Konrad-Martin et al 2005]). These criteria included the following: greater than 20 decibels (dB) pure tone threshold shift at 1 frequency; greater than 10 dB shift at 2 consecutive test frequencies; or threshold response shifting to &quot;no response&quot; at 3 consecutive test frequencies.</description>

          <title>Hydrocodone ER</title>
          <description>Participants were administered hydrocodone ER tablets orally at dosages of 15, 30, 45, 60, or 90 mg every 12 hours at the dosage deemed successful for managing their pain. If enrolled under the original protocol, there was a double-blind titration period of four weeks to adjust the dose taken in study 3103 (NCT01789970). If enrolled under the amended protocol, there was an open-label adjustment period of three weeks to adjust the dose taken in study 3103 (NCT01789970). Both versions of protocol 3104 followed the titration/adjustment period with a open-label treatment period of 22 weeks.</description>

        <description>An adverse event (AE) was defined in the protocol as any untoward medical occurrence that develops or worsens in severity during the conduct of a clinical study and does not necessarily have a causal relationship to the study drug. Severity was rated by the investigator on a scale of mild, moderate and severe, with severe= an inability to carry out usual activities. Relation of AE to treatment was determined by the investigator. Serious AEs include death, a life-threatening adverse event, inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, persistent or significant disability or incapacity, a congenital anomaly or birth defect, OR an important medical event that jeopardized the patient and required medical intervention to prevent the previously listed serious outcomes.</description>

            <title>Hydrocodone ER</title>
            <description>Participants were administered hydrocodone ER tablets orally at dosages of 15, 30, 45, 60, or 90 mg every 12 hours at the dosage deemed successful for managing their pain. If enrolled under the original protocol, there was a double-blind titration period of four weeks to adjust the dose taken in study 3103 (NCT01789970). If enrolled under the amended protocol, there was an open-label adjustment period of three weeks to adjust the dose taken in study 3103 (NCT01789970). Both versions of protocol 3104 followed the titration/adjustment period with a open-label treatment period of 22 weeks.</description>

        <title>Participants With Clinically Significant (CS) Hearing Changes From Baseline to the Final Visit in Pure Tone Audiometry Test Results</title>
        <description>Pure tone audiometry was performed by trained personnel. Hearing loss was classified in degrees of hearing from normal to profound. This classification was determined by the hearing threshold (or the softest sound detected at a specific frequency). The exact ranges that classified hearing loss depended on the exact technique used during testing and on the patient's age. These values were provided by each audiology laboratory that performed the test. For serial audiograms, the criteria for a clinically significant hearing change were based on guidance from the American Speech Language Hearing Association (ASHA 1994, cited in [Konrad-Martin et al 2005]). These criteria included the following: greater than 20 decibels (dB) pure tone threshold shift at 1 frequency; greater than 10 dB shift at 2 consecutive test frequencies; or threshold response shifting to “no response” at 3 consecutive test frequencies.</description>
        <time_frame>Baseline was within two weeks of the final study visit in study 3103; during study exam was within two weeks of the end of trial visit for study 3104 (up to study week 26)</time_frame>

        <description>The WPI was recorded daily by participants in an electronic diary using an 11-point numerical rating scale (NRS-11), a Likert-type scale in which 0=no pain and 10=the worst pain imaginable. At each visit, participants selected the number that best described their worst pain intensity over the last 24 hours. Negative change from baseline scores indicate improvement in pain control.
Endpoint refers to the last observation carried forward.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline to Weeks 2, 6, 10, 14, 18, 22 and Endpoint of the Treatment Period in Daily Average Pain Intensity (API) Scores During the Previous 24 Hours for Each Visit</title>
        <description>The API was recorded daily by participants in an electronic diary using an 11-point numerical rating scale (NRS-11), a Likert-type scale in which 0=no pain and 10=the worst pain imaginable. Participants selected the number that best described their average pain intensity over the last 24 hours. Negative change from baseline scores indicate improvement in pain control.
Endpoint refers to the last observation carried forward.</description>
