  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The combination of poverty-related infectious and lifestyle-related non-communicable
      diseases, both driven by malnutrition, causes a high burden for South Africa. Healthy and
      nutritious diets for populations depend on availability and accessibility of a variety of
      plant and animal foods, within a context that promotes and supports healthy behaviour. Food
      based strategies, such as supplementation, food fortification, and diversification of crops,
      are used to achieve optimal dietary requirements to combat malnutrition, including
      micronutrient deficiencies. A more sustainable food based strategy is the (promotion of) use
      of indigenous and traditional foods, such as African Leafy Vegetables (ALVs). Unfortunately,
      several studies from all over Africa have shown that there is a shift from traditional diets
      as result of the preparing techniques and the absence of women in homes. Furthermore,
      indigenous and traditional foods are considered as &quot;poor people's food&quot;.

      Against this background, a joint project between South Africa, Kenya and Benin is designed to
      fill the gaps in knowledge in these countries regarding the availability, acceptability and
      consumption and evidenced based benefits of foods from local biodiversity. The main aim of
      the study in South Africa is to provide empirical evidence of how the role of biodiversity
      can be translated into improved health status in contemporary poor rural and urban
      communities in the North West Province of South Africa. In order to achieve this it is
      important to gain knowledge on the possibility of using ALVs as a strategy to alleviate
      micronutrient deficiencies. Therefore an intervention study to determine the effect of
      selected ALV on the nutritional status (including zinc, iron, and vitamin A status) of school
      children (grade R-4) residing in contemporary poor rural community in the North West
      Province, South Africa has been designed.
