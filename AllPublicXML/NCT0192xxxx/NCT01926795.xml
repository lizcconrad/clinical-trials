  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Toddler's fractures of the tibia are by definition non-displaced and of a stable pattern.
      Children have thickened periosteum compared with adults, which therefore may impart stability
      to the fracture without the need for additional immobilization. The goal of the study is to
      evaluate whether or not there is a difference in children treated with and without cast
      immobilization in regards to time to ambulation; perceived pain; difficulty in dressing &amp;
      bathing; radiographic displacement or angulation; and time missed from work or daycare. Our
      null hypothesis is that there will be no difference in clinical or radiographic outcomes
      between the groups.
