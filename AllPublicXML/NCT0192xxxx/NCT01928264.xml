  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      We will conduct a randomized control trial to investigate whether and to what extent regular
      and guided group physical activity over 12 weeks (2 sessions Ã  1 hour/week) improves physical
      fitness and (physio-)psychological functions (like subjective sleep, mental toughness,
      perceived stress, self-efficacy, etc.), as well as participation skills and the ability to
      work, in claimants for a disability pension due to psychiatric disorders, whose ability to
      work had recently been assessed by means of a psychiatric expert opinion. The control group
      is designed very similar and implies predominantly sedentary leisure time group activities
      (e.g. playing board games, doing handicrafts). Measures will be performed at baseline,
      post-test, and at follow ups three and twelve months after post-test, some variables will
      additionally be assessed 4-weekly during the intervention. We expect that intervention group
      participants will report and show, respectively, more improved physical fitness,
      (physio-)psychological functioning and participations skills, as well as increased ability to
      work, compared to the control group.
