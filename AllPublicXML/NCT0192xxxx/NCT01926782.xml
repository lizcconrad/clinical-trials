  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To determine the efficacy, long-term safety, and tolerability of alirocumab 300 mg every 4
      weeks (Q4W), in comparison with placebo, as well as its potential as a starting regimen. The
      dose regimen of 75 mg every 2 weeks (Q2W), as used in other studies, was added as a
      calibrator.

    <intervention_model_description>The study was conducted in 2 separate populations concurrently: subjects receiving concomitant statin therapy and subjects not receiving concomitant statin therapy. Subjects receiving concomitant statin were to receive stable daily doses of rosuvastatin, atorvastatin, or simvastatin for at least 4 weeks. Background treatment with other lipid-modifying therapy (LMT) was allowed for all patients, provided they had been on a stable dose for at least 4 weeks (6 weeks for fenofibrate) prior to study entry.</intervention_model_description>

    <description>Adjusted least squares (LS) means and standard errors at Week 24 and at averaged Week 21 to 24 were obtained from a mixed effect model with repeated measures (MMRM) model to account for missing data.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Men and women &gt; age 18 or legal age of majority with elevated LDL-C

          2. Patients not having adequate control of their hypercholesterolemia based on their
             individual level of CVD risk

          3. Willing and able to comply with clinic visits and study-related procedures

          4. Provided signed informed consent

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Recent (within 3 months prior to the screening visit) myocardial infarction, unstable
             angina leading to hospitalization, percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), coronary
             artery bypass graft surgery (CABG), uncontrolled cardiac arrhythmia, stroke, transient
             ischemic attack, carotid revascularization, endovascular procedure or surgical
             intervention for peripheral vascular disease

          2. Known history of positive test for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)

          3. Any clinically significant abnormality identified at the time of screening that in the
             judgment of the investigator or any sub-investigator would preclude safe completion of
             the study or constrain assessment of endpoints, such as major systemic diseases or
             participants with short life expectancy.

          4. Participants considered by the investigator or any sub-investigator to be
             inappropriate for this study (e.g, geographic or social), actual or anticipated, that
             the investigator felt would restrict or limit the participant's participation for the
             duration of the study.

          5. Certain laboratory findings obtained during the screening period

        The information listed above is not intended to contain all considerations relevant to a
        participant's potential participation in a clinical trial and not all inclusion/ exclusion

      <recruitment_details>The study was conducted at 97 sites in 8 countries. A total of 1491 subjects were screened between September 2013 and April 2014, 688 of whom were screen failures. Screen failures were mainly due to inclusion criteria not met.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>Randomization was stratified according to statin therapy (with/ without) and cardiovascular risk (moderate vs. high/ very high) within the population receiving concomitant statin. Assignment to treatment arms was done using an Interactive Voice/Web Response System in 2:1:4 (Placebo: 75 mg: 300 mg) ratio after confirmation of selection criteria.</pre_assignment_details>

        <description>Adjusted LS means and standard errors at Week 24 from MMRM model including all available post-baseline data from Week 4 to Week 24 regardless of status on- or off-treatment. Subjects of the ITT population (with or without concomitant statin therapy) with one baseline and at least one post-baseline Total-C value on- or off-treatment (Total-C ITT population). Alirocumab 75 mg Q2W arm (calibrator arm) was included only to facilitate comparison of results of this study with the results of other studies that used an alirocumab 75 mg Q2W regimen.

        <description>Adjusted LS means and standard errors at Week 12 from MMRM model including all available post-baseline data from Week 4 to Week 24 regardless of status on- or off-treatment. Apo A1 ITT population (subjects with or without concomitant statin therapy). Alirocumab 75 mg Q2W arm (calibrator arm) was included only to facilitate comparison of results of this study with the results of other studies that used an alirocumab 75 mg Q2W regimen. Hence no statistical comparison was performed for this arm.</description>
