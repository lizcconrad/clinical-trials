  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This protocol will seek to enroll up to 60 immunocompromised subjects diagnosed with
      parainfluenza infection.

      All subjects will have additional PK and Immunogenicity blood samples collected.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will investigate the safety, tolerability, clinical and virologic effect of DAS1814
      for the treatment of PIV infections in up to 60 immunocompromised patients with no other
      treatment options.

      Eligible immunocompromised patients positively diagnosed with PIV infection will receive
      DAS181 by DPI or Nebulized formulation.

      DPI: 10 mg DAS181 will be administered for seven (7) consecutive days for up to a total
      cumulative dose of 70mg.

      Nebulized: DAS181 F02 formulation in solution will be administered for seven (7) consecutive
      days for up to a total cumulative dose of 28.9 mg.

      Assessment of viral shedding and viral resistance testing will be performed on collected
      viral load samples. Blood samples will be obtained to evaluate safety at each scheduled
      visit.

      Routine safety monitoring (including Adverse Event (AE) reporting, clinical laboratory tests,
      vital signs, electrocardiogram (ECG) and )2 levels) will be conducted in all subjects. A
      final safety assessment will occur at Day 28 (+/- 2 days) after enrollment/first dose of
      study drug. Survival, diary cards, and quality of life will be collected at Day 60 and 90. PK
      will be collected at each visit on all subjects from baseline/visit 2 to visit 11/Day 28.
      Immunogenicity samples will be collected at selected time points in all subjects.

    <description>The DAS181-F02 nebulized formulation includes 10mL of normal saline to prepare a liquid solution referred to as DAS181-F02 nebulized.
Dry Powder Inhaled Dose:
Non-ventilated subjects, capable of using a cyclohaler, will be treated by Dry Powder Inhalation. Each subject will receive a targeted daily dose of 10mg for 7 days for a total of 70mg of DAS181-F02. If a subject requires ventilation, the subject will be allowed to continue dosing following the Nebulized formulation instruction.</description>

    <arm_group_label>Nebulized Formulation Inhaled Dose</arm_group_label>
    <arm_group_type>Experimental</arm_group_type>
    <description>Subjects unable to use the Dry Powder Inhaler (as determined by site Investigator) on continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP), Bi-level positive airway pressure (BIPAP) or requiring mechanical ventilation will be treated by Nebulized formulation. The subject will remain on the nebulized formulation for the duration of the study regardless of ventilation status. DAS-F02 10 mg will be utilized to prepare the nebulized solution per the Study Reference Manual.
Multiple methods (T piece, face mask, direct to ET tube) will be allowed for the nebulized dose administration. Detailed specification for nebulized dose administration will be defined in the Study Reference Manual.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Age â‰¥12 years

          3. Immunocompromised, as defined by one of the following:

               -  Allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT)

               -  Lung or lung-heart transplantation

               -  Patients treated with chemotherapy for hematologic malignancies or autologous HCT

          4. Confirmed Parainfluenza virus by nasopharyngeal swab or tracheal aspirate for one of
             the following:

               -  Qualitative/quantitative RT-PCR test for parainfluenza virus performed at the
                  local laboratory (a confirmatory PCR test will be done at the central lab but is
                  not required to start the patient on study).

             include intrauterine device, spermicide, barrier, male partner surgical sterilization
             and hormonal contraception. A female subject must agree to practice two acceptable
             methods of birth control during the 28 day study period. Abstinence is not an
             acceptable method of contraception. All reproductive female subjects must have a
             negative serum pregnancy test during the screening visit.

             day study period.

        Exclusion Criteria:

             of the principal investigator, would affect patient safety and/or compliance.

          2. Any significant finding in the patient's medical history or physical examination that,
             in the opinion of the investigator, would affect patient safety, ability to use the
             dry powder inhaler or compliance with the dosing schedule.

          3. Subjects currently treated with oral, aerosolized or IV ribavirin

          4. Subjects taking any investigational drug used to research or treat PIV
