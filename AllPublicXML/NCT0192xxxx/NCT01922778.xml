    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to develop an endometrial biopsy screening program for
      endometrial cancer and its precursor lesions in overweight and obese women.

      There is a BMI threshold at and above which optimal screening parameters exist for
      identifying endometrial cancer and its precursor lesions in overweight and/or obese women.
      Prevention, diagnosis and treatment of endometrial cancer and its precursor lesions in
      overweight and/or obese women offers substantial health benefits.

    <description>Recruits from the Bariatric Surgery Program will be interviewed by a study investigator prior to their bariatric surgery. If the patient consents to the procedure, then this will usually be a D&amp;C performed in one setting at the time of her bariatric surgery under general anesthesia. In the case where a patient is diagnosed with complex atypical endometrial hyperplasia or early endometrial prior to her bariatric surgery, an IUD device can be inserted at the time of her bariatric surgery.
For patients not undergoing bariatric surgery, an endometrial biopsy will be performed in the clinic or office setting. If the biopsy cannot be performed due to technical difficulty (cervical stenosis) or inadequate sampling, we will try again on a different day after a trial of vaginal misoprostol (Cytotec) 400 or 600 mcg per vagina the night before.</description>

    <description>Recruits from the Bariatric Surgery Program will be interviewed by a study investigator prior to their bariatric surgery. During the interview, the purpose of the study will be explained as well as the surgical technique used for obtaining an endometrial sample. If the patient consents to the procedure, then this will usually be a D&amp;C performed in one setting at the time of her bariatric surgery under general anesthesia. In the case where a patient is diagnosed with complex atypical endometrial hyperplasia or early endometrial prior to her bariatric surgery, an IUD can be inserted at the time of her bariatric surgery.
For patients not undergoing bariatric surgery, an endometrial biopsy will be performed in the clinic or office setting using an endometrial suction catheter.</description>
