    <measure>Percentage of Participants Defined by &quot;Excellent&quot; or &quot;Good&quot; in the Aronchick Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>On the day of colonoscopy</time_frame>
    <description>Aronchick scale is a 4-point scale that grades colon cleansing as Excellent (&gt;90% of mucosa seen, mostly liquid stool, minimal suctioning needed for adequate visualization), Good (&gt;90% of mucosa seen, mostly liquid stool, significant suctioning needed for adequate visualization), Fair (&gt;90% of mucosa seen, mixture of liquid and semisolid stool, could be suctioned and/or washed) or Inadequate (&lt;90% of mucosa seen, mixture of semisolid and solid stool which could not be suctioned or washed). The participant is considered to be a responder if overall colon cleansing is &quot;excellent&quot; or &quot;good&quot; on this 4-point scale.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Participants With Adverse Events</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 33 days after colonoscopy</time_frame>
    <description>An adverse event (AE) is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a participant taking part in a clinical trial. Proportion of participants with AE are presented.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Participants With Abnormal Findings in Laboratory Tests</measure>
    <time_frame>From up to 42 days prior to colonoscopy, at the day of colonoscopy, and up to 7 days post colonoscopy</time_frame>
    <description>Proportion of participants with abnormal findings in laboratory tests are presented.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Participants With Abnormal Findings in Physical Examination</measure>
    <time_frame>From up to 42 days prior to colonoscopy, on the day of randomization, and at the day of colonoscopy</time_frame>
    <description>Complete physical examination was conducted at screening and directed physical examinations at other time-points. Directed physical examinations are presented.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Participants Who Took the Assigned Dose for Colon Cleansing</measure>
    <time_frame>Approx. 1 day (From the day before colonoscopy to the day of colonoscopy)</time_frame>
    <description>The proportion of participants who took the assigned dose of Prepopik® was assessed.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Participants in Each Category of the &quot;Subject's Tolerability and Satisfaction Questionaire&quot;</measure>
    <time_frame>1 day of colonoscopy</time_frame>
    <description>Subject's Tolerability and Satisfaction Questionnaire consists of three questions. Question (Q)1 was &quot;How easy was it to drink the bowel cleanout medicine?&quot; and Q2 was &quot;How did the bowel cleanout medicine taste?&quot;. Q3 had five subparts namely: 1. &quot;How often did your tummy hurt since you started the medicine?&quot; and 2. &quot;How often did you feel fullness in your tummy, since you started the cleanout?&quot; and 3. &quot;How often did you wake up last night&quot; and 4. &quot;How often did you feel sick to your stomach (nausea) since you started the cleanout?' and 5. &quot;How much were you bothered by going to the washroom since you started the cleanout?&quot;
Satisfactory was defined as a response of 1 (Very Easy) or 2 (Easy) on Q1 and a response of 1 (Very Well) or 2 (Well) on Q2.
Tolerable was defined as a response of 1 (Never) or 2 (Rarely) to the five subparts specified in Q3.</description>

The second dose was given on the next day, at least 6 hours after the first dose and approximately 5 hours before but no more than 9 hours prior to the colonoscopy.
“Day Before” method was the alternative method if “Split Dose” was not appropriate. In &quot;Day Before&quot; method, the first dose was administered during the afternoon or early evening before the colonoscopy and the second dose was administered 6 hours later during the evening before the colonoscopy.
The dose was 1 sachet for this subset of participants (9-12 years old).</description>

        <description>Subject’s Tolerability and Satisfaction Questionnaire consists of three questions. Question (Q)1 was “How easy was it to drink the bowel cleanout medicine?” and Q2 was “How did the bowel cleanout medicine taste?”. Q3 had five subparts namely: 1. “How often did your tummy hurt since you started the medicine?” and 2. “How often did you feel fullness in your tummy, since you started the cleanout?” and 3. “How often did you wake up last night” and 4. “How often did you feel sick to your stomach (nausea) since you started the cleanout?’ and 5. “How much were you bothered by going to the washroom since you started the cleanout?”
Satisfactory was defined as a response of 1 (Very Easy) or 2 (Easy) on Q1 and a response of 1 (Very Well) or 2 (Well) on Q2.
Tolerable was defined as a response of 1 (Never) or 2 (Rarely) to the five subparts specified in Q3.</description>

          <description>Prepopik® (sodium picosulfate 10 mg; magnesium oxide 3.5 g and anhydrous citric acid 12 g) reconstituted with water was administered in “Split Dose” method.
