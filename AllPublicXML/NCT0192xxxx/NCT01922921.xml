    <textblock>
      This randomized phase I/II trial studies the side effects of vaccine therapy with or without
      polysaccharide-K and to see how well it works in treating patients with stage IV human
      epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) positive breast cancer who are receiving
      HER2-targeted monoclonal antibody therapy. Vaccines made from HER2 intracellular domain (ICD)
      peptide may help the body build an effective immune response to kill tumor cells that express
      HER2. Polysaccharide-K may stimulate the immune system in different ways and stop tumor cells
      from growing. It is not yet known whether vaccine therapy works better when given with or
      without polysaccharide-K in treating breast cancer.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the safety of polysaccharide-K (PSK) when given with HER2-directed
      immunotherapy.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the effect of PSK on natural killer (NK) cell functional activity when given
      with HER2-directed immunotherapy.

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To investigate the effect of PSK when given with HER2-directed immunotherapy on: serum
      levels of pro-inflammatory cytokine and/or chemokines; intermolecular epitope spreading;
      serum transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta levels; progression free survival (PFS) and
      overall survival (OS).

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

      ARM I: Patients receive HER2 ICD peptide-based vaccine intradermally (ID) once monthly for 3
      months, trastuzumab (or trastuzumab and pertuzumab) per standard of care, and placebo orally
      (PO) twice daily (BID) for 4 months.

      ARM II: Patients receive HER2 ICD peptide-based vaccine ID and trastuzumab (or trastuzumab
      and pertuzumab) as in Arm I and polysaccharide-K PO BID for 4 months.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 9 months and then twice
      annually for 3 years.
