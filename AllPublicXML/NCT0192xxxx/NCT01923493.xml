      Objective: To evaluate whether tuina is more effective and cost-effective than no
      intervention waiting list to reduce neck pain measured on a visual analogue scale in patients
      suffering from chronic neck pain.

      Study Design: Open single-centre randomized two-armed controlled trial. Setting: The study
      will be performed at a University out-patient clinic specialized in Integrative Medicine,
      with experience in the treatment of chronic pain.

      Participants: 88 outpatients with chronic neck pain, who will be randomly allocated to two
      groups (tuina, or no intervention (control)).

      Intervention: Patients receive either six tuina treatments within 3 weeks or no additional
      intervention.

      Main outcome measure: The primary outcome is the mean neck pain intensity over the last seven
      days on a visual analogue scale (Huskisson, 1974) (VAS, 0-100 mm, 0 = no pain, 100= worst
      imaginable pain) after four weeks.
