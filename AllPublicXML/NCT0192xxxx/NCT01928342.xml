  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the lipid lowering effects and clinical safety of a
      natural hypolipidemic compound, coenzyme A （CoA） capsule, combined use with statin, in
      Chinese patients with moderate dyslipidemia.

    <textblock>
      Although lowering cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C) is the mainstay
      of medical therapy for cardiovascular event prevention, evidence from clinical trials
      supports a role for elevated triglyceride (TG) and low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol
      (HDL-C) concentrations in the residual cardiovascular risk on statin treatment. Fenofibrate
      is the most commonly used agent to control hypertriglyceridemia as monotherapy or combining
      with statin, which lowers TG and raises HDL-C through multifaceted mechanism by PPARα
      activation. However, safety of coadministration of statin with fenofibrate has been a great
      concern, especially drug-induced hepatotoxicity when they are combined used. Coenzyme A (CoA)
      functions as an acyl group carrier and assists in transferring fatty acids from the cytoplasm
      to mitochondria. It is also involved in the oxidation and catabolism of fatty acids. Animal
      studies have proved its lipid-lowering effects. In a previous multicenter study we conducted
      in 2008, it was found that oral CoA 400U/d effectively lowered serum TG levels in
      hypertriglyceridemia patients without increasing adverse effects when compared with placebo.
      So, the present study was performed to further investigate the lipid-lowing effects and
      safety of CoA capsule combined with statin in dyslipidemia patients.
