    <time_frame>Immediately following the first administration of study drug through Study Week 48.</time_frame>
    <description>Asthma symptoms during night time and daytime are recorded by the patient in the asthma daily diary. Symptom score values are from 0 (No asthma symptom) to 3 (unable to sleep because of asthma, or unable to do normal activities due to asthma), and total asthma symptom score is the sum of the daytime and night time score (0 to 6). Lower score (0) is indicating better asthma symptom, while higher score (6) is indicating worse asthma symptom. Baseline is defined as the average of data collected from the evening of study day -10 to the morning of study day 1. Each time point is calculated as bi-weekly means based on daily diary data. If more than 50% of scores are missing in a 14 day period then this is considered as missing. Symptom score lower is better.</description>

             considered an adolescent for the purposes of this trial.

          3. History of physician-diagnosed asthma requiring treatment with medium-to-high dose ICS
             (&gt;250μg fluticasone dry powder formulation equivalents total daily dose) and a LABA,
             for at least 12 months prior to Visit 1

          4. Documented treatment with ICS and LABA for at least 3 months prior to Visit 1 with or

                  fluticasone propionate dry powder formulation or equivalent daily.

               -  For subjects ages 12-17, the ICS dose must be ≥500 mcg /day fluticasone
                  propionate dry powder formulation or equivalent daily.

        Exclusion criteria:

          1. Clinically important pulmonary disease other than asthma (e.g. active lung infection,
             COPD, bronchiectasis, pulmonary fibrosis, cystic fibrosis, hypoventilation syndrome
             associated with obesity, lung cancer, alpha 1 anti-trypsin deficiency, and primary
             ciliary dyskinesia) or ever been diagnosed with pulmonary or systemic disease, other
             than asthma, that are associated with elevated peripheral eosinophil counts (e.g.
             allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis/mycosis, Churg- Strauss syndrome,
             hypereosinophilic syndrome)

          2. Any disorder, including, but not limited to, cardiovascular, gastrointestinal,
             hepatic, renal, neurological, musculoskeletal, infectious, endocrine, metabolic,
             haematological, psychiatric, or major physical impairment that is not stable in the
             opinion of the Investigator and could:

               -  Affect the safety of the patient throughout the study

               -  Influence the findings of the studies or their interpretations

               -  Impede the patient's ability to complete the entire duration of study

          3. Acute upper or lower respiratory infections requiring antibiotics or antiviral
             medication within 30 days prior to the date informed consent is obtained or during the
             screening/run-in period

          4. Any clinically significant abnormal findings in physical examination, vital signs,
             haematology, clinical chemistry, or urinalysis during screening/run-in period, which
             in the opinion of the Investigator, may put the patient at risk because of his/her
             participation in the study, or may influence the results of the study, or the
             patient's ability to complete entire duration of the study

        <title>Mean Change From Baseline to Week 48 in Asthma Symptom Score for Baseline Eosinophils &gt;=300/uL</title>
        <description>Asthma symptoms during night time and daytime are recorded by the patient in the asthma daily diary. Symptom score values are from 0 (No asthma symptom) to 3 (unable to sleep because of asthma, or unable to do normal activities due to asthma), and total asthma symptom score is the sum of the daytime and night time score (0 to 6). Lower score (0) is indicating better asthma symptom, while higher score (6) is indicating worse asthma symptom. Baseline is defined as the average of data collected from the evening of study day -10 to the morning of study day 1. Each time point is calculated as bi-weekly means based on daily diary data. If more than 50% of scores are missing in a 14 day period then this is considered as missing. Symptom score lower is better.</description>

        <title>Mean Change From Baseline to Week 48 in Asthma Symptom Score for Baseline Eosinophils &lt;300/uL</title>
        <description>Asthma symptoms during night time and daytime are recorded by the patient in the asthma daily diary. Symptom score values are from 0 (No asthma symptom) to 3 (unable to sleep because of asthma, or unable to do normal activities due to asthma), and total asthma symptom score is the sum of the daytime and night time score (0 to 6). Lower score (0) is indicating better asthma symptom, while higher score (6) is indicating worse asthma symptom. Baseline is defined as the average of data collected from the evening of study day -10 to the morning of study day 1. Each time point is calculated as bi-weekly means based on daily diary data. If more than 50% of scores are missing in a 14 day period then this is considered as missing. Symptom score lower is better.</description>

        <description>WPAI+CIQ (Work Productivity and Activity Impairment plus Classroom Impairment Questionnaire) contains 10 questions. Work productivity loss is derived by sum of percentage of missed work due to asthma and product of percentage of actual working hours times degree of asthma affecting work productivity while working. Percentage of missed work due to asthma is calculated by number of hours missed work due to asthma divided by total number of hours missed work plus number of hours actually worked. The work productivity loss is only applicable to patients who employed, which is only subset of the study population.</description>
