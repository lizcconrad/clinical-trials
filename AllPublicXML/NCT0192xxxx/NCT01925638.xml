  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to see if there is a difference between the way your body
      absorbs and distributes BAY86-9766 when given alone or in combination with ketoconazole, a
      drug which may affect how much BAY86-9766 is absorbed, distributed or eliminated from the
      body

    <description>The study will be conducted in two parts and study treatments will be administered as follows: •Part A: Three subjects will be enrolled and will receive 10 mg of refametinib on Day 1. Once daily dosing of ketoconazole 400 mg will be initiated on Day 5 and will continue until Day 12 with 10 mg of refametinib administered concomitantly on Day 8 •Part B: Fifteen subjects will be enrolled and will receive refametinib doses of 10 mg, 20 mg or 30 mg on Days 1 and 8 with the same dose administered on both days. Refametinib dose for Part B will be based on safety and refametinib pharmacokinetics in Part A. Ketoconazole 400 mg will be administered once daily on Days 5 to 12. Subjects will stay in the investigational site for a total period of 15 consecutive days</description>
