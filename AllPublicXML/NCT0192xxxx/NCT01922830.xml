      This study is a randomized clinical trial with 6 months probiotic supplement vs. placebo
      treatment and 6 month follow up on 100 NAFLD patients that will undergo sleeve gastrectomy
      surgery. Measurements will be conducted at: baseline, M3 (3 months after treatment
      initiation), M6 and M12 and will include: abdominal US, Fibroscan, biochemical tests,
      anthropometric measurements, glucose breath test for bacterial overgrowth, fecal samples and
      questionnaires for demographic details, quality of life, food intake, food tolerance and
      habitual physical activity. 20 subjects will undergo an additional liver-MRI test at baseline
      and M6.

      Background:

      Bariatric surgery is an effective and increasingly common treatment for obesity and
      obesity-related comorbidities. Among patients undergoing bariatric surgery, as many as 96%
      have NAFLD (Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease) and up to 25% have NASH (Nonalcoholic
      steatohepatitis). Intestinal microbiota has been shown to play pivotal roles in host
      mammalian developmental, immune and metabolic functions. Alterations in the gut microbiome,
      or 'dysbiosis' has been recently linked to the pathogenesis of metabolic disease including
      obesity, insulin resistance, atherosclerosis and liver diseases. Recent studies show that
      modulation of gut microbiota may represent a novel way to treat or prevent NAFLD and its
      progression. Bariatric surgery is associated with major modifications in microbiota
      composition, quantity and function. Potential mediators to the gut microbiota are probiotics
      which are considered to be a safe therapy since its microorganisms composition is found
      naturally in human microflora. To date, there is lack of evidences on the use of probiotics
      in bariatric surgeries with just 1 randomizes clinical trial in Roux-en-Y gastric bypass
      surgery patients.

      Aims:

      To evaluate the effect of 6 months probiotic supplement vs. placebo on clinical and metabolic
      parameters in patients with NAFLD undergoing sleeve gastrectomy surgery.

      Working hypothesis: Modulation of gut microbiota with probiotic will have a beneficial effect
      on clinical and metabolic parameters in sleeve gastrectomy patients with NAFLD.

      Methods:

      A randomized double blind clinical trial with 6 months treatment and 6 months follow up
      including 2 treatment arms: probiotic and placebo. One hundred NAFLD patients who will
      undergo sleeve gastrectomy surgery through the bariatric surgery clinic at the Tel Aviv
      Assuta medical center will be enrolled during 2013-2016. Baseline and follow up evaluation
      will be performed at the Tel-Aviv Sourasky Medical center and will include: abdominal US
      (hepato-renal index-HRI), Fibroscan, biochemical tests, anthropometric measurements, glucose
      breath test for bacterial overgrowth (BO). Fecal samples will be collected and analyzed for
      gut microbiota utilizing 'state of the art' molecular methods. All patients will fill out
      validated questionnaires of demographic details, quality of life, food intake, food tolerance
      and habitual physical activity. Measurements will be conducted at: baseline, M3 (3 months
      after treatment initiation), M6 and M12. 20 subjects will undergo an additional liver-MRI
      test at baseline and M6.

      Importance of the study: Almost all morbid obese patients have NAFLD and up to 25% have NASH,
      leading to major hepatic and extra-hepatic complications. Only limited data are available
      concerning gut microbiota composition after bariatric surgery and its association with weight
      reduction, metabolic and hepatic parameters. Moreover, there are no clinical trials on the
      role of probiotics administration following sleeve gastrectomy bariatric surgery on hepatic
      parameters. Probiotic supplement after bariatric surgery may improve the therapeutic effect
      of the surgery on hepatic steatosis and may improve also biochemical tests of vitamins (e.g.
      B12), inflammatory mediators (e.g. endotoxin levels) and metabolic parameters, reduce
      bacterial overgrowth and enhance weight loss. The study would help in developing new
      treatment approaches and will contribute to the understanding of the mechanisms underlying
      the hepatic, metabolic and inflammatory consequences of bariatric surgery.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Hepato-Renal Index (HRI) method by abdominal US</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
    <description>US will be performed at pretrial, 6 and 12 month after the surgery. .Fatty liver will be diagnosed by abdominal US using standardized criteria. HRI, a validated quantitative measure, will be calculated on the basis of the ratio between the echogenicity of the liver and that of the right kidney cortex using histogram echo intensity.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Liver fibrosis - by Fibroscan (transient elastography)</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year.</time_frame>
    <description>The liver stiffness will be measured by Fibroscan (using XL probe) and will be performed at pretrial, 6 and 12 month after the surgery. The liver stiffness is measured by Fibroscan in a volume of approximates 1 cm wide and 4 cm long cylinder, representing 1/500 of liver tissue (100 times greater than a biopsy sample). The results of the Fibroscan test are expressed in KiloPascals (kPa). The Fibroscan XL probe reduces Fibroscan failure and facilitates reliable liver stiffness measurement in obese patients compared with the common M probe.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Anthropometric measurements</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
    <description>Measurements of anthropometry will be performed following a uniform protocol at pretrial, 3, 6 and 12 month after the surgery. Height, weight, WC (Waist circumference) will be measured. BMI and %EWL will be calculated. &quot;Tanita&quot; will be used for body composition analysis (%fat mass, fat mass and fat free mass) and will be performed at pretrial and 6 month after the surgery.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Biochemical fasting blood tests</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
    <description>Patients will undergo biochemical tests at pretrial, 3, 6 and 12 month after the surgery. All blood samples will be drawn at the morning after a fast of at least 12 hours. Serological tests that will be taken: lipid profile, inflammatory factors (CRP, TNF-α, IL6, IL10, TGF- β), adipocytokines (leptin, adiponectin), endotoxin (Lipopolysacchride), hepatocyte apoptosis markers (CK-18, sFas), glucose, HbA1C, total bilirubin, liver enzymes, TSH, insulin, vitamin B1, vitamin B12, vitamin D, Iron, ferritin, folic acid. HOMA will be calculated as: serum insulin (μIU/ml) x plasma glucose (mmol/l)/22.5. HOMA index ≥2.77 is considered to be diagnostic for insulin resistance.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>The fecal microbiota composition</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
    <description>Fecal samples will be taken at pretrial and 6 month after the surgery. Fecal samples will be obtained in the morning before breakfast. The stools will be self-collected in sterile boxes that will be given to the participants in advance and will be stored at -800C degrees until further analysis. DNA will be extract from feces for detecting microbiota diversion. Philogenetic analysis will be performed using pyrosequencing and multiplexing of bacterial 16S rRNA segments. Samples from several randomly selected individuals will be used for shotgutn metagenomic sequencing.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Bacterial overgrowth (BO)</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
    <description>BO will be measured at pretrial and 6 month after the surgery. BO can be confirmed by direct culture of small bowel fluid (gold standard) or by a H2 breath test and can be suggested by abnormal vitamin B12 levels or increased folate levels serologically. BO measurement will be determined by glucose breathe testing under standard conditions and is considered when an increase of ≥20 H2 ppm over the baseline value is observed.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Quality of life (QoL)</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
    <description>Patients will fill out a self-reported QoL questionnaire at pretrial, 3, 6 and 12 month after the surgery. The SF-12 (a shorter version of the SF-36) is a QoL questionnaire. The SF-12 yields 2 summary scores: physical component summary (PCS) and mental component summary (MCS). The SF-12 have been translated and validated in many languages (including Hebrew) and were found valid and reliable among the general population. Higher scores on the PCS and MCS indicate better health.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Food tolerance after bariatric surgery</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
    <description>Patients will fill out a self-reported questionnaire for quick assessment of food tolerance after bariatric surgery at pretrial, 3, 6 and 12 month after the surgery. To evaluate food tolerance we will use this questionnaire which was previously described by Suter et al. This questionnaire is simple to fill out, reliable, and useful both in following up individuals after bariatric surgery and in comparing results after different procedures as part of the evaluation of QoL . The score for this questionnaire is divided into 3 parts: Patient's satisfaction of their food intake, food tolerance (for 8 different types of food) and the frequency of vomiting/regurgitation.</description>
