  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Curetis Unyvero LRT55 Application is intended to detect and to identify genes of 21
      microorganisms and 19 genes associated with antibiotic resistance in 4 hours.

      In this study, the performance of the Unyvero LRT55 Application shall be tested under
      clinical conditions and compared to (1) a composite reference method (for non-atypical or
      cultured microorganisms) or (2) a molecular PCR based reference method for the 3 atypical
      microorganisms Chlamydophila pneumoniae, Legionella pneumoniae, and Pneumocystis jirovecii,
      and for resistance genes.

      PCR amplifications are followed by bi-directional sequencing, including comparison of the
      test results Time to result will be compared for the Unyvero LRT55 Application and
      standard-of care.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a non-interventional, controlled, non-randomized multicenter clinical study that
      compares a new diagnostic device, the Unyvero LRT55 Application (based on molecular
      diagnostic methods) to either (1) a composite reference method (for non-atypical
      microorganisms), (2) a composite PCR-based method for 3 atypical microorganisms or (3) a
      PCR-based reference method for resistance genes.

      The study will use leftover lower respiratory tract samples taken from subjects suspected
      with lower respiratory tract infections: (a) Specimens taken prospectively for
      standard-of-care (i.e. microbiology testing) from hospitalized subjects. (b) Banked specimens
      for rare microorganisms.

      As the device is under investigation, the test results provided by the Unyvero LRT55
      Application will not be made available to the treating physician and therefore will not be
      used for diagnosis, treatment or other management decisions.

    <measure>Clinical sensitivity and specificity for microorganism detection as compared to routine microbiology and other reference methods including PCR and sequencing</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Sensitivity for microorganism detection will be determined against the respective reference method consisting of standard procedure and/or a reference method based on PCR and bi-directional sequencing using alternative primers. Sensitivity for non-atypical microorganism detection will thus be determined if at least 1 out of 2 reference methods have identified microorganisms that are covered by the panel of the investigational IVD. Results will further be analyzed against standard of-care alone, as well as against composite comparator. Sensitivity for atypical microorganism detection will be determined against PCR with alternative primers as reference method. Specificity for microorganism detection will be determined in all samples included in the trial. Individual specificities will be calculated for the detection of the respiratory microorganisms analyzed by the investigational IVD compared to the microorganisms reference method.</description>
