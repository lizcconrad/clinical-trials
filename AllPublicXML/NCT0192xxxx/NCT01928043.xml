  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will enroll 30 adolescents with bipolar disorder (BD) who are suffering from
      symptoms of depression despite already taking a traditional mood-stabilizing medication.
      Curcumin will be added to their current medications for 8 weeks. During these 8 weeks, their
      mood symptoms will be assessed regularly. Height, weight, and blood pressure will also be
      measured repeatedly. Blood tests will be completed before treatment, after 4 weeks of
      treatment, and at the end of the study. Blood tests will allow us to determine whether
      changes in inflammation and oxidative stress explain curcumin's effect on mood. Finally, we
      will use sophisticated technology to measure blood vessel functioning. We have three main
      predictions: 1. Curcumin will improve mood symptoms without causing physical problems; 2.
      Curcumin will reduce inflammation and oxidative stress, and these reductions will be linked
      to improvements in mood; 3. Curcumin will improve blood vessel functioning, and these
      improvements will be linked to improved inflammation and oxidative stress.
