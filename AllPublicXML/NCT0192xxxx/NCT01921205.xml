      Study to evaluate the efficacy of Lacosamide (LCM) administered in addition to 1 to ≤3 other
      Anti-Epileptic Drugs in subjects with epilepsy ≥4 years to &lt;17 years of age who currently
      have uncontrolled partial onset seizures.

      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of LCM administered
      concomitantly with 1 to ≤3 Anti-Epileptic Drugs (AEDs) in subjects with epilepsy ≥4 years to
      &lt;17 years of age who currently have uncontrolled partial onset seizures.

      The secondary objective is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of LCM in subjects ≥4
      years to &lt;17 years of age.

      An additional objective is to evaluate the pharmacokinetics (PK) of LCM in subjects ≥4 years
      to &lt;17 years of age.

          <title>Lacosamide</title>
          <description>This arm includes subjects with epilepsy, who received a flexible dose of Lacosamide (LCM) oral solution or tablets, administered twice a day. Subjects weighing &lt;30kg received 8mg/kg/day to 12mg/kg/day Lacosamide (LCM) oral solution; subjects weighing &gt;=30kg to &lt;50kg received 6mg/kg/day to 8mg/kg/day LCM oral solution; and subjects weighing &gt;=50kg received 300mg/day to 400mg/day LCM tablets, or if unable or unwilling to swallow tablets may have received LCM oral solution, however, they were not permitted to exceed the maximum dose of LCM 400mg/day. The subject’s body weight at Baseline (Visit 2) was used to determine the dose throughout the study.</description>
