      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the pharmacokinetics (PK) profile of
      monomethyl fumarate (MMF) following delivery of BG00012 (dimethyl fumarate, DMF) 120 mg (Part
      1) and BG00012 240 mg (Part 2) to varying regions within the GI tract in healthy volunteers.
      The secondary objective of this study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability profile
      following the delivery of BG00012 120 mg (Part 1) and BG00012 240 mg (Part 2) to varying
      regions within the GI tract in healthy volunteers.
