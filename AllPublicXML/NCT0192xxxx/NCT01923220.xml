      This is a single-center, open-label, randomized, prospective study evaluating the safety and
      efficacy of HO/02/02 20µg topically applied daily for 15 minutes (with gauze) on treatment
      fields vs. standard of care (SoC), Aloe Vera treatment in addition to sterile water for
      irrigation applied daily for 15 minutes (with gauze) on treatment fields to create the same
      cooling effect as in treatment arm 1. Both treatment arms 1&amp;2 treatments will be applied
      topically once daily for up to 8 weeks to reduce radiation dermatitis in up to 90 breast
      cancer patients undergoing adjuvant radiation therapy.
