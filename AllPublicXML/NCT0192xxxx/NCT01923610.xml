  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      24 healthy male and female volunteers who are at low risk of HIV infection and entered into
      the RISVAC02 study and were randomly allocated to receive 3 intramuscular injections of MVA-B
      at weeks 0, 4 and 16 will receive a boosting dose 4 years thereafter.

      Participants will attend one of two clinical centres on at least 5 occasions over 16 weeks.
      These visits will comprise:

        -  Screening

        -  Trial entry and boosting immunisation

        -  Early follow-up after immunisation

        -  Follow-up x 2 including the final visit Participants will have blood and urine
           collected, and receive 1 immunisation. They will be counselled prior to and following a
           HIV test, and given health education on prevention of sexually transmitted infections
           including HIV. T

      The two centres which participate are:

        -  Hospital Clinic, Barcelona and

        -  Hospital Gregorio Marañón, Madrid The primary objective is to explore the safety and
           immunogenicity of MVA-B.
