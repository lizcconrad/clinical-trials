      A randomized phase II study for medically inoperable stage I non-small cell lung cancer where
      stereotactic body radiotherapy in three fractions to 66 Gy is compared with conventionally
      fractionated radiotherapy to 70 Gy in 35 fractions.

      This is a multicenter Scandinavian randomized phase II study of stereotactic hypofractionated
      radiotherapy with body frame versus conventionally fractionated radiotherapy for stage I
      medically inoperable non-small cell lung cancer patients. There is a 1:1 randomization
      between arm A: Stereotactic radiotherapy to a dose of 66 Gy with 22 Gy per fraction at the
      isocenter (45 Gy covers the PTV) in 3 fractions during one week with body frame fixation and
      a planning target volume with a 5 mm margin around the macroscopic tumour, and arm B:
      Conventionally fractionated radiotherapy to a dose of 70 Gy with 2 Gy per fraction in 35
      fractions during 7 weeks with fixation in a vacuum pillow and a planning target volume with a
      2 cm margin around the macroscopic tumour.

    <description>Margin between CTV and PTV of 5 mm in transversal direction (except for small targets (&lt;3cm) not fixed to thoracic wall or mediastinal structures, where margin should be 10 mm) and 10 mm in longitudinal direction. Planned heterogeneous dose distribution within the PTV with about 50% higher dose to the center compared to the periphery. Hypofractionation with 22 Gy times 3 at the isocenter (15 Gy at the periphery of the PTV)during one week will be used.</description>

    <description>Clinical target volume (CTV) comprises the Gross Tumor Volume (GTV), including its diffuse growth at the borders. Planning target volume (PTV) is defined as the CTV with a total margin of 2 cm in all directions. The patient will receive 35 fractions, with a dose of 2.0 Gy/fraction at the ICRU reference point to a total dose of 70 Gy. The treatments will be given five days a week. The total treatment time should be as close to seven weeks as possible. The aim is that the dose distribution should be as homogeneous as possible.</description>
