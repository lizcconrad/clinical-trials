      The purpose of this study is to determine if non-invasive electrical brain stimulation can
      enhance the outcome of intensive language therapy in chronic aphasia.

    <textblock>
      Stroke is the leading cause of death and disability worldwide. Given the increasing average
      lifespan worldwide, the incidence and prevalence of patients with stroke will dramatically
      increase in the future. One of the most frequent and devastating conditions after stroke is
      aphasia, which affects language production and comprehension. High-frequent intensive
      speech-and-language therapy is currently the treatment of choice in chronic aphasia. However,
      despite its general effectiveness, treatment effect sizes are only low to moderate. Thus,
      there is a pressing need to explore novel training-adjuvant therapies to enhance treatment
      efficacy. Moreover, very little is known about the neurobiology of treatment-induced recovery
      in chronic aphasia. This is the prerequisite to improve existing and/or develop new treatment
      paradigms.

      Thus, in the present project the investigators aim to assess whether the outcome of intensive
      language training can be enhanced by adjuvant non-invasive brain stimulation. They will be
      using anodal transcranial direct current stimulation (atDCS) that has previously been shown
      to enhance (a) language and motor learning in healthy subjects and (b) motor recovery in
      stroke patients. Specifically, in a longitudinal group comparison design, two matched groups
      of patients with chronic anomia will receive two weeks of intensive language training with or
      without atDCS. Treatment effects will be assessed immediately after the two week intervention
      period and several months after the end of the training. The Investigators will also use
      functional and structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to elucidate language network
      changes in the two groups.
