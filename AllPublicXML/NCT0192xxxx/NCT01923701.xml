  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main objective of this study is to decrease the severity of symptoms and improve
      psycho-social functioning in youth at high risk of developing psychosis by providing a
      specialized Group-and-Family-based Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (GF-CBT).
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      24 adolescents and young adults between the ages of 12 and 25 who are at high risk of
      developing psychosis and exhibit paranoid ideation will be recruited to participate in a
      pilot randomized controlled trial. Subjects will be randomly assigned to the intervention
      (GF-CBT)or control (symptom monitoring) groups. GF-CBT is based on a cognitive
      neuropsychiatric model of delusions, and incorporates recent developments in learning and
      cognitive theories. GF-CBT consists of individual, group, and family group sessions. The
      three-part program teaches adolescents and family members Cognitive Behavioral skills that
      they can continue using on their own after completion of the program. Preliminary efficacy of
      the intervention will be evaluated using standardized measures by blind evaluators conducted
      at baseline, post-treatment, and post-termination follow-up over the next 2 years.
      Hypotheses: (a) GF-CBT will be associated with: high rate of remission from &quot;at risk status&quot;
      and low rates of transition to psychosis (defined by CAARMS criteria); greater improvements
      in severity of symptoms; and improved functioning; (b) decrease in family members'level of
      stress, and improved coping; (c) Family members will demonstrate proficiency in CBT Skills.

    <description>The Global Functioning: Role (GFR) and Global Functioning: Social (GFS) scales are clinician administered scales, derived from the GAF format. The GFR scale anchor points refer to performance in school, work, or as a homemaker, depending on age. Ratings are also based on demands of the role, level of independence or support provided to the individual and the individual's overall performance in the role given the level of support. The GFS scale assesses quantity and quality of peer relationships, level of peer conflict, age appropriate intimate relationships, and involvement with family members. Age-appropriate social contacts and interactions outside of the family are considered, with an emphasis on social withdrawal and isolation (Cornblatt et al., 2007).</description>

    <description>GF-CBT focuses on teaching emotional self-regulation, information processing, decision making strategies,and logical thinking skills. The program is comprised of three parts: 1) Group sessions in which adolescents receive social support from peers who have had similar experiences and learn CBT skills, 2) Family group sessions in which family members learn more about adolescents' experiences and learn CBT skills so that they can encourage and reinforce these skills at home, and 3) Individual sessions in which adolescents can apply CBT skills to their own lives and work toward personal goals. Group sessions are taught with Powerpoint slides and with an accompanying workbook.</description>
