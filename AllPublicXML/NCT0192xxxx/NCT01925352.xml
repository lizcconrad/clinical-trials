      To explore the safety and efficiency of adenovirus-hepatocyte growth factor(Ad-HGF) treatment
      in ischemic heart disease.

      1. Ischemic heart disease refers to a group of closely related syndromes by an imbalance
           between the myocardial oxygen demand and the blood supply.

        2. Gene therapy offers an attractive alternative to current pharmacologic therapies and may
           be beneficial in refractory disease. Gene therapy with hepatocyte growth factor induces
           angiogenesis, decreases apoptosis and leads to protection in the ischemic heart. In this
           study, we mainly explore the safety and effects of adenovirus hepatocyte growth factor
           for the treatment of ischemic heart disease.
