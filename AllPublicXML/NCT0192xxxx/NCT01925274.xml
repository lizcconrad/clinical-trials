  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will investigate whether the combination of PF-05212384 plus Irinotecan improves
      progression free survival in patients with KRAS and NRAS wild type metastatic colorectal
      cancer when compared with the combination of cetuximab plus Irinotecan. A Japanese Lead in
      Cohort will assess the safety of the combination of PF-05212384 + irinotecan in patients
      enrolled at Japanese sites.

    <measure>Progression Free Survival (PFS) as Assessed by Investigators</measure>
    <time_frame>From date of first dose until the date of first documented progression or date of death from any cause, whichever came first, assessed up to 2 years</time_frame>
    <description>Progression-free survival (PFS) was the time from the first dose of study treatment to the first documentation of objective tumor progression or death due to any cause, whichever occurred first. Objective progression was defined as 20% increase in the sum of diameters of target measurable lesions above the smallest sum observed (over baseline if no decrease in the sum was observed during therapy), with a minimum absolute increase of 5 mm. Median PFS was estimated based on the Kaplan-Meier method.</description>

    <measure>Percentage of Participants With Objective Response</measure>

    <description>Percentage of participants with objective response was based on assessment of confirmed complete response (CR) or confirmed partial response (PR) according to Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST), version 1.1. Confirmed PR was defined as disappearance of all target lesions. Confirmed PR was defined as &gt;=30% decrease in sum of the longest dimensions of the target lesions taking the baseline sum as a reference. Confirmed responses were those that persisted on repeat imaging study &gt;=4 weeks after initial documentation of response.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Duration of Response</measure>
    <time_frame>2 years</time_frame>
    <description>For participants with an objective response (CR or PR), duration of response was defined as the time from first documentation of CR or PR to date of first documentation of objective progression or death. Date of first documentation of progression and date of first documentation of CR or PR were based on Investigator's assessment of response.</description>

    <description>An AE was defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical investigation participant administered a product or medical device; the event need not necessarily have a causal relationship with the treatment or usage. An SAE was defined as any untoward occurrence at any dose that resulted in death; was life threatening (immediate risk of death); required inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization; resulted in persistent or significant disability/incapacity (substantial disruption of the ability to conduct normal life functions); resulted in congenital anomaly/birth defect. AEs included both serious and non-serious AEs. Treatment-emergent AEs were those with initial onset or increasing in severity after the first dose of study drug.</description>

    <time_frame>Administration of the first dose of study drug through 28 calendar days after the last administration of study drug</time_frame>
    <description>TEAEs were those AEs with initial onset or increasing in severity after the first dose of study drug. CTCAE version 4.0 was used to grade the severity of TEAEs. Grade 1 referred to mild AEs; Grade 2 referred to moderate AEs; Grade 3 referred to severe AEs; Grade 4 referred to AEs with life-threatening consequences, and urgent intervention was needed to manage them; Grade 5 referred to death related to AE.</description>

          <description>PF-05212384 was administered intravenously (IV) every week (Days 2, 9, 16 and 23 of each 28-day cycle) at a starting dose level of 110 mg. During Cycle 1, PF-05212384 was only dosed on Days 9, 16 and 23. After one cycle of dosing with PF-05212384, in subsequent cycles, the dose level remained at 110 mg or was escalated based on the occurrences of dose limiting toxicities (DLTs) in previous cycle and at the discretion of the investigator. Participants enrolled in Korea remained at the 110 mg starting dose level of PF-05212384. Irinotecan was administered IV every other week (Days 1 and 15 of each 28-day cycle) at a dose level of 180 mg/m^2. Both the dose levels of PF-05212384 and irinotecan were adjusted according to severity of toxicities. Infusion of PF-05212384 followed irinotecan infusion by at least 24 hours (+/- 10%).</description>

        <description>Progression-free survival (PFS) was the time from the first dose of study treatment to the first documentation of objective tumor progression or death due to any cause, whichever occurred first. Objective progression was defined as 20% increase in the sum of diameters of target measurable lesions above the smallest sum observed (over baseline if no decrease in the sum was observed during therapy), with a minimum absolute increase of 5 mm. Median PFS was estimated based on the Kaplan-Meier method.</description>

During Cycle 1, PF-05212384 was only dosed on Days 9, 16 and 23. After one cycle of dosing with PF-05212384, in subsequent cycles, the dose level remained at 110 mg or was escalated based on the occurrences of dose limiting toxicities (DLTs) in previous cycle and at the discretion of the investigator. Participants enrolled in Korea remained at the 110 mg starting dose level of PF-05212384. Irinotecan was administered IV every other week (Days 1 and 15 of each 28-day cycle) at a dose level of 180 mg/m^2. Both the dose levels of PF-05212384 and irinotecan were adjusted according to severity of toxicities.

            <description>PF-05212384 was administered intravenously (IV) every week (Days 2, 9, 16 and 23 of each 28-day cycle) at a starting dose level of 110 mg. During Cycle 1, PF-05212384 was only dosed on Days 9, 16 and 23. Irinotecan was administered IV every other week (Days 1 and 15 of each 28-day cycle) at a dose level of 180 mg/m^2. Both the dose levels of PF-05212384 and irinotecan were adjusted according to severity of toxicities.

During Cycle 1, PF-05212384 was only dosed on Days 9, 16 and 23. After one cycle of dosing with PF-05212384, in subsequent cycles, the dose level remained at 110 mg or was escalated based on the occurrences of dose limiting toxicities (DLTs) in previous cycle and at the discretion of the investigator. Participants enrolled in Korea remained at the 110 mg starting dose level of PF-05212384. Irinotecan was administered IV every other week (Days 1 and 15 of each 28-day cycle) at a dose level of 180 mg/m^2. Both the dose levels of PF-05212384 and irinotecan were adjusted according to severity of toxicities. Infusion of PF-05212384 followed irinotecan infusion by at least 24 hours (+/- 10%).</description>
