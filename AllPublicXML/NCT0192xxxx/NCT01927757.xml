    <measure>Change From Baseline in Disease Activity Score 28-C-Reactive Protein (DAS28-CRP)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and weeks 12 and 24</time_frame>
    <description>The DAS28-CRP is a composite score to measure disease activity in patients with rheumatoid arthritis, derived from the following variables:
The number of swollen and tender joints assessed using the 28-joint count;
C-reactive protein (CRP) level
Patient's global assessment of disease activity assessed on a score from 0 to 100.
The DAS28-CRP score ranges from zero up to approximately ten. DAS28-CRP scores above 5.1 indicate high disease activity. A negative change from baseline indicates improvement.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Health Assessment Questionnaire-Disability Index (HAQ-DI)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and weeks 12 and 24</time_frame>
    <description>The HAQ-DI is a questionnaire on which participants are asked to rate their level of difficulty on daily activities (dressing and grooming, arising, eating, and walking) and personal abilities (hygiene, reach, grip, and activity) as well as their use of aids, devices, or help from another person for these activities and disabilities. Responses are scored from 0 indicating no difficulty to 3 indicating inability to perform a task in that area. The overall score is the average of each of the 8 category scores and ranges from 0 (no disability) to 3 (very severe, high-dependency disability).</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in 36-item Short Form Health Survey (SF-36) at Week 12</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>The Medical Outcome Study Short Form 36-Item Health Survey, Version 2 (SF-36) is a self-administered instrument that measures the impact of disease on overall quality of life and consists of 36 questions in eight domains (physical function, pain, general and mental health, vitality, social function, physical and emotional health). Norm-based scores were used in analyses of each domain, calibrated so that 50 is the average score and the standard deviation equals 10. Higher scores indicate a higher level of functioning.</description>

    <measure>Work Productivity and Activity Impairment (WPAI)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, week 12 and week 24</time_frame>
    <description>This 6-item assessment measures productivity losses during the past 7 days and includes measures on work time missed due to health, impairment while working due to health (the participant's assessment of the degree to which health affected their productivity while working), overall work impairment due to health (takes into account both hours missed due to health and the participant's assessment of the degree to which health affected their productivity while working) and activity impairment due to health (the degree in which health problems affected their ability to do regular daily activities). Scores for each measure are expressed from 0 to 100 with higher numbers indicating greater impairment and less productivity, i.e., worse outcomes.</description>

    <participant_flow>
      <recruitment_details>This study was conducted at 30 centers in the United States and Canada. Participants were enrolled from 06 May 2013 to 02 December 2014.
Patients with moderate-to-severe rheumatoid arthritis (RA) who did not respond to or lost satisfactory response to adalimumab when used as the first biologic agent in combination with methotrexate were eligible.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>A total of 90 participants were enrolled in the study, however, 4 participants from 1 site were excluded from all efficacy analyses due to good clinical practice (GCP) violations. Three of these participants who received etanercept are included in safety results.</pre_assignment_details>

        <description>The DAS28-CRP is a composite score to measure disease activity in patients with rheumatoid arthritis, derived from the following variables:
The number of swollen and tender joints assessed using the 28-joint count;
C-reactive protein (CRP) level
Patient's global assessment of disease activity assessed on a score from 0 to 100.
The DAS28-CRP score ranges from zero up to approximately ten. DAS28-CRP scores above 5.1 indicate high disease activity. A negative change from baseline indicates improvement.</description>

Responses are scored from 0 indicating no difficulty to 3 indicating inability to perform a task in that area. The overall score is the average of each of the 8 category scores and ranges from 0 (no disability) to 3 (very severe, high-dependency disability).</description>

Norm-based scores were used in analyses of each domain, calibrated so that 50 is the average score and the standard deviation equals 10. Higher scores indicate a higher level of functioning.</description>

        <description>The Medical Outcome Study Short Form 36-Item Health Survey, Version 2 (SF-36) is a self-administered instrument that measures the impact of disease on overall quality of life and consists of 36 questions in eight domains (physical function, pain, general and mental health, vitality, social function, physical and emotional health). Norm-based scores were used in analyses of each domain, calibrated so that 50 is the average score and the standard deviation equals 10. Higher scores indicate a higher level of functioning.</description>

        <description>This 6-item assessment measures productivity losses during the past 7 days and includes measures on work time missed due to health, impairment while working due to health (the participant’s assessment of the degree to which health affected their productivity while working), overall work impairment due to health (takes into account both hours missed due to health and the participant’s assessment of the degree to which health affected their productivity while working) and activity impairment due to health (the degree in which health problems affected their ability to do regular daily activities). Scores for each measure are expressed from 0 to 100 with higher numbers indicating greater impairment and less productivity, i.e., worse outcomes.</description>

    <certain_agreements>
      <pi_employee>Principal Investigators are NOT employed by the organization sponsoring the study.</pi_employee>
      <restrictive_agreement>The Clinical Trial Agreement generally does not restrict an investigator's discussion of trial results after completion. The Agreement permits Amgen a limited period of time to review material discussing trial results (typically up to 45 days and possible extension). Amgen may remove confidential information, but authors have final control and approval of publication content. For multicenter studies, the investigator agrees not to publish any results before the first multi-center publication.</restrictive_agreement>
