  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This clinical, randomized, and controlled study will provide valuable scientific evidence
      regarding the effect of adding peripheral nerve blockades to general anaesthesia during ankle
      surgery. In particular, the investigators want to determine if the need for postoperative
      opioids will be reduced and whether this will lead to shorter admission to recovery room and
      fewer instances of side effects such as postoperative nausea and vomiting. In addition, the
      investigators will determine whether the functional outcome is improved i.e. faster and more
      successful rehabilitation. This would have profound benefits not only to the individual
      patient but also to society by reducing expenses during admission, the cost of sick leave
      etc.
