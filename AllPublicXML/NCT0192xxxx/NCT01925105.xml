  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Like most developed countries the population of Sweden is getting older and consequently the
      number of individuals with chronic diseases will be an increasing challenge for its
      healthcare system. To improve care of the frail elderly, wards with a coordinated
      multidisciplinary team and multidisciplinary mobile teams were established several years ago.
      Treatment and follow up is planned in accordance to the patients' medical, psychological and
      functional capabilities (Comprehensive Geriatric Assessment = CGA). There are to our
      knowledge only few studies concerning CGA applicable to Swedish conditions. We plan to
      conduct a Swedish study that evaluates if care and treatment with a modified CGA-model in an
      outpatient setting can improve quality of life for frail older people.
