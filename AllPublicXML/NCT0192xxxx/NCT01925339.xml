  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare two different timings of restoring dental implants
      that are placed right after tooth extraction: The test group will have the provisional crown
      placed at the time of implant placement. The control group will have the tooth removed and
      the implant placed at the same appointment but restorations placed after 4 months. Both
      procedures currently are accepted methods for replacing missing teeth but direct comparisons
      of the two procedures are lacking. The results of this study should aid clinicians in
      selecting the best timing for restoring implants for their patients. The hypothesis is that
      immediate restoration might increase aesthetic outcomes, e.g. less mucosal recession.

      A single center, randomized controlled, parallel-arm study is planned to investigate esthetic
      outcomes after immediate placement and restoration in the esthetic zone. Forty adult patients
      who have a hopeless maxillary anterior or premolar tooth, with intact adjacent teeth will be
      enrolled. A signed written informed consent will be obtained after he or she has been given
      verbal and written information describing the nature and duration of the study. Subjects will
      not be screened or treated until an informed consent has been obtained. Patient information
      will be protected according to the privacy regulations of the Federal Health Insurance
      Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA).

      The enrolled patients will be randomly placed into one of two treatment groups, immediate
      implant placement (IIP) and restoration group (IR) or the IIP + delayed restoration group
      (DR). For all patients, the hopeless tooth will be extracted atraumatically and an implant
      placed immediately. The decision will be made randomly to either restoring the implant
      immediately (Test group) with a provisional crown or restoring the implant at 4 months after
      implant placement (Control group). Outcome analyses will be performed until approximately
      1-year after the implant surgery and primarily evaluate clinical and radiographic parameters
      to determine the esthetic outcomes of immediately restored IIP implants, in comparison to
      those immediately placed but restored in a delayed approach.

             prognosis

          -  Presence of adjacent teeth and enough clearance for an implant crown

          -  Presence of sufficient bone apical to the root apex of the hopeless tooth
