    <textblock>
      This pilot study will provide data to aid in the planning of a follow-up multi-center
      randomized, controlled trial (RCT). As such, the sample size for this pilot is not driven by
      formal statistical hypothesis testing. Rather, the sample size of 100 patients (50 per arm)
      was derived in consultation with the study PI and Co-PI who are experts in vascular surgery,
      and in particular, the field of hemodialysis access interventions. The results of this pilot
      study will provide the data that is necessary for generation of specific hypotheses that can
      then be formally tested in the follow-up RCT

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Patient must be &gt; 18 and &lt; 85 years of age

          2. Patient or legally authorized representative must be willing to participate and able
             to understand, read, and sign the informed consent document before the planned
             procedure

          3. Eligible for de-clot procedure or evaluation of slow flow for a failing hemodialysis
             graft that previously provided access for at least 1 successful hemodialysis session

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Patient or legally authorized representative cannot or will not provide written
             informed consent

          2. Known metal allergy precluding endovascular stent implantation

          3. Known reaction or sensitivity to iodinated contrast that cannot be pretreated

          4. Patients who are pregnant or lactating

          5. Patients with scheduled kidney transplant within the next 6 months

          6. Patients scheduled to switch to peritoneal dialysis within the next 6 months

          7. Patients with life expectancy of less than 6 months

          8. Participation in any other clinical research study that would interfere with the
             patient's participation in this study

          9. Any concurrent disease or condition that, in the opinion of the investigator, would
             make the patient unsuitable for participation in the study
