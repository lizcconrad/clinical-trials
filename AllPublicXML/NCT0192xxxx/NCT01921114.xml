  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main purpose of this study is to confirm whether the AngioDynamics BioFlo™ Peripherally
      Inserted Central Catheter (PICC) is associated with less formation of blood clots compared to
      another commercially available PICC.

      Purpose:

      To investigate whether the BioFlo™ PICC will be associated with a reduced incidence of
      catheter-related venous thrombosis (including both symptomatic and asymptomatic) compared to
      another commercially available PICC: the Bard® PowerPICC SOLO2®

      Design:

      This is a randomized, multi-center clinical study. The study is designed as a two-arm
      prospectively controlled trial. Participants will be randomly assigned to either the study or
      control catheter using a 1:1 schema.

      Enrollment:

      Four hundred sixteen (416) patients will be enrolled at four (4) to eight (8) study sites in
      order to obtain 354 evaluable patients.

      Study Objectives:

      The primary objective of this study is to investigate the incidence of catheter-related
      venous thrombosis in patients receiving either the 5 Fr BioFlo™ PICC catheter or the control
      catheter, i.e., the 5 Fr Dual-Lumen PowerPICC SOLO2® catheter.

      Secondary objectives of this study are to investigate:

        -  Incidence of other catheter-related complications, inclusive of catheter occlusion,
           catheter-related infection, technical failures, and premature catheter removals

        -  Incidence of catheter occlusion (independently from other catheter-related
           complications)

      Additionally, economic outcomes with respect to medical resource utilization requirements
      will be compared between the two catheter groups (at US sites only).

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Is indicated for a PICC based on institutional practices

          2. Is ≥ 18 years of age

          3. Is expected to require use of a PICC for a minimum of 10 days

          4. Has normal findings on initial ultrasonography (complete Ultrasound Checklist)

          5. Vein used for PICC placement must be a minimum of 5mm in diameter

          6. Is able to comprehend and have signed the Informed Consent Form (ICF) to participate
