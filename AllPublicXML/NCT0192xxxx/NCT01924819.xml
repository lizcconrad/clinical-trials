  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Gastric cancer remains a significant global public health problem. Although in developed
      countries its incidence has dramatically decreased, on a worldwide scale it is still a
      leading cause of cancer-related deaths. Surgery is the only potentially curative treatment
      for gastric cancer. Although the survival rates for patients with early stage disease (stage
      1A and 1B) are good, this subgroup of patients constitutes only 20% of those undergoing
      resection. The majority of patients will have locally advanced or metastatic disease at
      presentation, which has an extremely poor prognosis. The current five-year survival rate for
      gastric cancer in Western countries is approximately 20-30%, a figure that has improved
      little over the past 30 years. The intervention arm in TOPGEAR consists of pre-operative
      chemotherapy, pre-operative chemoradiotherapy, surgery and post-operative chemotherapy. The
      control arm consists of pre-operative chemotherapy, surgery and post-operative chemotherapy.
      The primary objective of TOPGEAR is to investigate whether the addition of chemoradiotherapy
      to chemotherapy is superior to chemotherapy alone in the neoadjuvant setting by improving
      pathological complete response rates in the first instance, and subsequently overall
      survival, in patients undergoing adequate surgery (D1+ dissection) for resectable gastric
      cancer.

    <description>The acceptable resections are a total gastrectomy, a subtotal gastrectomy, and an esophagogastrectomy (Ivor-Lewis esophagogastrectomy for gastroesophageal junction cancers [Siewert Type II and Siewert Type III] invading up to but no more than 2cm of the lower esophagus). The minimum extent of the operation should be a D1+ lymph node dissection but it is recommended that a D2 dissection be performed or a D1+ for gastroesophageal junction cancers requiring an esophagogastrectomy.</description>
