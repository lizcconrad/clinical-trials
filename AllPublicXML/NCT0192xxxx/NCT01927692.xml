    <textblock>
      The primary objective of the study is to longitudinally profile immunoglobulin levels and
      autoantibody levels in subjects with myasthenia gravis (MG) who receive therapeutic plasma
      exchange (TPE).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, multi-center, pilot biomarker study in subjects receiving TPE for the
      treatment of MG. No study medications will be given.

      Ten (10) AChR antibody positive MG subjects will be enrolled in the study at 2 sites. Of
      these 10 MG subjects, up to 5 may be receiving chronic TPE.

      The study period will be approximately 3 months and will consist of:

        -  Screening/baseline visit,

        -  TPE visit where subjects will undergo clinical evaluations and blood draws for
           immunological assays,

        -  End of TPE visit where information on the TPE procedure will be recorded, clinical
           measurements will be performed, and a blood sample will be drawn.

        -  Post-TPE period where subjects will undergo clinical evaluations and blood draws for
           immunological assays at week 1, week 2, week 3, week 6, and week 12 after TPE.

      Study procedures performed outside of usual care will include optional single-fiber
      electromyography (SFEMG) studies, blood draws and optional skin biopsies.

    <description>Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) will be analyzed using highly standardized polychromatic flow cytometric techniques for the expression of a broad array of phenotypic markers. A B-cell and T-cell panel will be used to profile specific marker expression among PBMCs and define lymphocyte subpopulations.</description>

    <measure>SFEMG</measure>
    <time_frame>14 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The extensor digitorum communis muscle will be studied in every subject and the muscle tested must have increased jitter at the initial study. If examination of the extensor digitorum communis is not feasible or the jitter is normal at the initial study, the muscle to study will be at the discretion of the investigator performing the SFEMG test, preferably frontalis. In each SFEMG study, jitter from 20 paired muscle fiber potentials will be recorded whenever feasible. Recorded variables will include total number of muscle fiber pairs studied, abnormal muscle fiber pairs, blocking pairs, and mean consecutive difference (MCD).</description>
