  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Suicide is the second leading cause of mortality for Canadian adolescents. Mental health
      complaints are one of the leading reasons for an emergency department visit at the Children's
      Hospital of Eastern Ontario and 60% of adolescents report suicidal ideation. The goal of the
      present investigation is to test the efficacy of a brief group intervention for adolescents
      with passive suicidal ideation and their caregivers that will focus on coping, familial
      support, and emotional regulation. The investigators hypothesize that a brief group
      intervention, delivered in the weeks following presentation for crisis services, will reduce
      suicidal ideation and improve coping and familial support.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Suicidal Ideation</measure>
    <time_frame>6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Suicidal ideation will be measured using the Suicidal Ideation Questionnaire Junior (SIQ-JR; Reynolds, 1988).
Repeated Measures ANOVA or ANCOVA will be used to compare differences in suicidal ideation within groups (pre-post changes). Further comparisons using clinical cut-off will be conducted via McNemar test for matched pairs.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Familial Support</measure>
    <time_frame>6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Familial support will be measured using questionnaires for both caregivers and youth. Youth will respond to the Family Environment Scale (Koren, DeChillo, &amp; Friesen, 1992) and the Inventory of Parent and Peer Attachment (Armsden &amp; Greenberg, 1987). Caregivers will respond to the Family Environment Scale and and Relationship Scale Questionnaire (Griffine &amp; Gartholomew, 1994).
Repeated Measures ANOVA or ANCOVA will be used to compare differences within groups (pre-post changes).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Coping Strategies</measure>
    <time_frame>6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Youth coping strategies will be measured using the Youth Stress and Coping Questionnaire (Cloutier et al., 2008).

    <measure>Depression</measure>
    <time_frame>6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Youth depression will be measured using the Children's Depression Inventory-2 Self report (CDI-2; Kovaks, 2010).
Repeated Measures ANOVA or ANCOVA will be used to compare differences within groups (pre-post changes).</description>
  </other_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Anxiety</measure>
    <time_frame>6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Youth anxiety symptoms will be measured using the Multidimensional Anxiety Scale for Children (MASC-2; March, 1997).
Repeated Measures ANOVA or ANCOVA will be used to compare differences within groups (pre-post changes).</description>
