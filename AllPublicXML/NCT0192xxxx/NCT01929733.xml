  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Percutaneous closure is one of the methods used to treat, among other congenital heart
      disorder, Persistent Ductus Arteriosus (PDA) in children and adults. During the years
      1998-2013 four hundred and fifty patients were catheterized in the department of pediatric
      cardiology and congenital heart diseases in Rambam health care campus, using various devices.

      In this retrospective research, the investigators analyze data from patients' medical files,
      to estimate and define the correlation between the patients' demographic and morphologic data
      to the type and size of chosen closure device.

      Aim of study:

      To create an algorithm that can be used to choose the proper device for percutaneous closure
      of the PDA, based on the characteristics of the patient and the PDA type.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators analyze the demographic characteristics of patients before the procedure
      (Age, gender, weight, height, co-morbidities etc.), the type and characteristics of PDA and
      the chosen device, success and failure rates of the procedure, and adverse effects.

      The data is taken from patients' medical files - based on medical reports regarding physical
      examination, blood tests and imaging studies including cineangiograms and echo-doppler
      studies.
