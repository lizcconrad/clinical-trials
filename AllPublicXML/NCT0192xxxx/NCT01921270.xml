    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to study the efficacy and safety of AbobotulinumtoxinA (Dysport)
      for use in Oromandibular Dystonia (OMD).

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Oromandibular dystonia (OMD) is an uncommon, disabling form of cranial dystonia, involving
      involuntary movements of the lower facial, masticatory, and lingual muscles. This can cause
      jaw movements including opening, closure, protrusion, retraction, or deviation. Common
      additional facial movements involve grimacing or lip pursing. When there is tongue
      involvement, it usually presents as tongue protrusion or curling. Such patients are impaired
      in relation to eating, speaking and swallowing

      This study aims to evaluate the efficacy and safety of a low dose of Dysport® deemed
      tolerable during phase 1 in subjects with oromandibular dystonia (OMD).

      Participants will be injected with Dysport® only, with an unblinded open-label disclosure.
      The safety and efficacy pf receiving Dysport® will be recorded for all subjects that undergo
      injection. All subjects will be examined and videotaped at the injection visit, then at 6 and
      12 weeks after injection with a standardized protocol. The primary outcome will be blinded
      examination scores of the videos performed after the study is complete.The evaluators will be
      three different movement disorders experts, not otherwise involved in the study, who will
      review the videotaped examinations, presented in a random order, using the Global Dystonia
      Rating scale (GDS). Evaluators will rate the dystonia at baseline (injection visit) and 6
      weeks after injection.

    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 6, Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>This scale measures the severity of dystonia for the jaw and tongue by a blinded rater. Dystonia is rated from 0 to 10:
0=No dystonia present, 1=Minimal dystonia, 5=Moderate dystonia,10=Most severe dystonia</description>

    <measure>Change in Analogue Pain Scale Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>Measure of jaw pain by visual analogue scale (0-100) where 0 represents &quot;no pain&quot; and 100 represents the &quot;most severe pain&quot;.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Mean Sialorrhea Clinical Scale for Parkinson's Disease (SCS-PD) Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 6, Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>The SCS-PD measures drooling. Individual items are scored on a scale from 0-3 where 0 represents &quot;never&quot; and 3 represents &quot;always&quot;. The overall maximum score is 21. A higher score indicates greater drooling severity. A lower score indicates lesser severity.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Number of Tongue Bites Per Day</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 12</time_frame>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Mean Swallowing Disturbance Questionnaire (SDQ-20) Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 6, Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>Ease of chewing and swallowing will be assessed by the SDQ-20 (modified to exclude question 5 due to redundancy as it relates to drooling and question 15 which is not relevant to the study as it involves prior aspiration pneumonias). Individual items are scored from 0 (never) to 3 (very frequently). The overall score is the total for all items; a higher score indicating more frequent swallowing disturbance; a lower score indicating no or less frequent disturbance, with a possible maximum score of 39.</description>

        <description>The Clinical Global Impression – Severity scale (CGI-S) is a 7-point scale that requires the clinician to rate the severity of the patient's illness at the time of assessment, relative to the clinician's past experience with patients who have the same diagnosis. Responses are scored on a scale from 1 to 7; 1 represents &quot;normal, not at all ill&quot; and 7 represents &quot;among the most extremely ill patients&quot;.</description>
