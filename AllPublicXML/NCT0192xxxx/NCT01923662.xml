    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to improve the performance of neuroprosthesis for standing after
      SCI by developing and testing new advanced methods that use multiple contact peripheral nerve
      electrodes to slow the onset of fatigue and increase standing duration. The new advanced
      methods will take advantage of the ability of multiple-contact nerve cuff electrodes to
      selectively activate portions of a muscle that perform the same action. Alternating
      activation to multiple muscles (or parts of the same muscle) rather than continuously
      activation the entire muscle group constantly should allow them to rest and recover from
      fatiguing contractions. This should allow users to remain upright for longer periods of time
      to perform activities of daily living, reduce the risk of falls due to fatigue, and increase
      the potential of receiving the health benefits of standing.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Neuroprostheses for standing after SCI currently rely on continuous activation of the hip and
      knee extensor muscles, which results in rapid fatigue and ultimately compromises elapsed
      standing time. The primary objective of this study is to improve the performance of
      neuroprostheses for standing by developing and implementing advanced stimulation paradigms
      that use multi-contact peripheral nerve electrodes to delay fatigue onset and prolong
      standing duration. The new stimulation paradigms will take advantage of the ability of
      multi-contact nerve cuff electrodes to selectively activate independent portions of a muscle,
      or independent muscles that perform the same action. Such a capability will allow one or more
      muscles (or parts of the same muscle) to rest while the others continue to contract to keep
      the knee extended and the user upright. Stimulation waveforms that alternate activation to
      multiple muscles performing the same function, rather than continuously activate the entire
      muscle group constantly, should allow muscles to rest and recover from fatiguing
      contractions.

      In addition to these important clinical benefits, the project is also of high impact and
      significance because the methods to be developed will not be specific to any single electrode
      technology or stimulation system. Any clinical or therapeutic application that requires a
      sustained muscular contraction or the production of constant joint torques for prolonged
      periods of time will benefit from the successful completion of this project.

    <description>Eligible subjects will receive an implanted device (IRS-8 or IST-16) and surgically implanted electrodes to excite muscles that move paralyzed muscles. These electrodes are connected to the implanted stimulator that delivers electrical pulses to the nerves. These pulses cause the muscles to contract to perform functional movements or to exercise.</description>
