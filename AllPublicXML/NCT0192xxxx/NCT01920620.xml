    <textblock>
      In this study we sought to determine whether inpatient weight loss counseling with post
      discharge phone follow-up would result in weight loss at six months. Secondary endpoints
      included weight change from baseline, changes in waist-to-hip ratios, assessment of weight
      perceptions and changes in patient reported health outcome measures. To our knowledge, this
      is the first randomized trial designed to evaluate the effects of an obesity intervention
      with post-discharge follow-up in an inpatient general medicine population.

    <description>Weight loss counseling utilizing a 13 minute patient education video on weight loss and an 25 minute personalized health education session. Subjects set 3 specific behavior set three specific lifestyle goals prior to discharge including a calculated six month weight loss goal (10% of body weight) and specific dietary and fitness goals. Usual care group participants received no specific instruction regarding weight loss prior to discharge.</description>

    <description>All subjects were asked to track their weights over the 6 month duration of the study. Weights were obtained by phone at weeks 1,2,3,4, 8, 12, 16, 20 and 24. Phone calls for the intervention group utilized motivational and troubleshooting techniques whereas calls in the usual care group were used only to obtain weight and assess for changes in medications or health condition.</description>
