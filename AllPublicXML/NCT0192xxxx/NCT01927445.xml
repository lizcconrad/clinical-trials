  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this project is to increase the proportion of patients with AF that receive
      adequate stroke prevention therapy. Over half of patients with AF who suffer strokes are
      permanently disabled. Yet there remains a large portion of patients who do not receive
      appropriate stroke prevention therapy. The investigators hypothesize that a toolkit of
      quality improvement strategies in primary care could increase the proportion of patients with
      atrial fibrillation appropriately treated with stroke prevention therapy. The investigators'
      goal is to ensure the toolkit of interventions can be easily incorporated into day-to-day
      practice in primary care and can be readily and broadly disseminated if successful.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The prevalence of atrial fibrillation (AF) is growing as the population ages and 15% of all
      strokes are already attributed to AF. Unfortunately, half of patients with AF do not receive
      prescriptions for anticoagulation to prevent stroke due to a variety of system, provider, and
      patient-level barriers. The investigators will conduct a pragmatic, cluster-randomized
      controlled trial to test a 'toolkit' of quality improvement interventions in primary care. In
      keeping with the recommendations of the chronic care model to simultaneously facilitate
      proactive care by providers and activate patients, the toolkit includes provider- focused
      strategies (education, audit and feedback, electronic medical record-based tools including
      decision support and reminders) plus patient-directed strategies (educational letters and
      reminders). Thirty three primary care clinics will be randomized to the intervention or usual
      care. The trial will last 12 months and will be powered to show a difference of 10% in the
      primary outcome of proportion of patients receiving guideline-concordant care for stroke
      prevention. Analysis will be blind to allocation.

    <description>Patients with risk factors for stroke (ie. CHADS2 &gt;1 or age &gt;65) who are prescribed anticoagulants and patients with no risk factors for stroke (ie. CHADS2 = 0 and age &lt;65) who are not prescribed anticoagulants will be considered to be receiving guideline concordant therapy. (For patients with CHADS2 = 1 but aged &lt; 65 the guideline recommendations are unclear, so these patients will not be considered in the primary analysis. For example, in patients with AF and hypertension at a younger age, anticoagulation or aspirin or no treatment would each be reasonable.)</description>
