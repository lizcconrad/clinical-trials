      Synchronous Tele-Endoscopy: A clinical feasibility study of gastrointestinal tele-endoscopy
      by implementing and evaluating synchronous tele-endoscopy using ENDOALPHA in a hospital based
      endoscopy unit. EndoAlpha will be used on the hospitals existing Intranet/LAN and the
      possibilities of tele-endoscopy on WAN through existing network, on separate dedicated line
      or through new established transmission lines, will be evaluated. The EndoAlpha system will
      be integrated in a highly advanced endoscopy procedure room. The system will integrate
      through LAN with doctor office, clinic conference and lecture room and GI pathologist room.
      Through either LAN or WAN, connection will be establish to a referral GI center in Denmark.
      Through WAN, connection will be established to doctor home and to an expert Spanish center.

      Evaluate the potential network (LAN +WAN) limitations for video transmission image quality
      and audio transmission (two-way) quality. Validate the tele-endoscopy technology for
      consulting and second opinion in diagnostic endoscopy and therapeutic endoscopy (teaching,
      training and supervision of basic and advanced therapeutic procedures).
