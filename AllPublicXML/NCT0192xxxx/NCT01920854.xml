  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      -  A total of 48 healthy volunteers will be studied.

        -  Depending on the safety profile at completion of the highest dose cohort, an additional
           2 cohorts of subjects may be studied.

        -  Doses of SFP may be modified, depending on the PK and safety findings at each dose
           level.

        -  Cohorts may be dropped for safety or tolerability after discussion with the sponsor.

        -  There will be 6 active and 2 placebo subjects in each study cohort.

        -  Subjects in Cohorts 1-3 will receive ascending doses of SFP by intravenous infusion over
           4 hours.

        -  Subjects in Cohorts 4-6 will receive ascending doses of SFP by intravenous infusion over
           12 hours.

      All subjects will be confined in the CRC for 1 day prior to study drug administration and for
      2 additional days for safety assessments and completion of test procedures.

        <description>Serum iron for Cohorts 1-3 and 6 will be collected at 0, 0.5,1, 2, 3, 4, 4.5, 5, 6, 7, 7.5, 8, 9,10, 12,12.5 14, 16, 20, 24,36, and 48 hours. Serum iron for Cohorts 4 and 5 will be collected at 0, 0.5,1, 2, 4, 6, 9, 12,12.5, 14,16,18,20, 24, 30, 36, and 48 hours.
There was no formal sample size calculation for this study; 48 subjects were enrolled and 48 subjects were analyzed to establish the PK profile of the serum iron from SFP. Study results were summarized by dose group, with descriptive statistics. No additional statistical testing was performed. No imputation of missing data was performed. No windowing of visits was performed.</description>

There was no formal sample size calculation for this study; 48 subjects were enrolled and 48 subjects were analyzed to establish the PK profile of the serum iron from SFP. Study results were summarized by dose group, with descriptive statistics. No additional statistical testing was performed. No imputation of missing data was performed. No windowing of visits was performed.</description>
          <population>The PK Population was defined as all subjects receiving a dose of SFP or placebo who had sufficient post-dose blood samples taken to estimate PK parameters for serum iron endpoints. All 48 enrolled subjects were included in the PK Population.</population>

        <title>Serum Iron Profile From Soluble Ferric Pyrophosphate: Cohorts 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 (Mean Vz)</title>
        <description>Samples for volume of distribution in the terminal elimination phase (Vz) calculations were collected for all Cohorts (just those subjects that received SFP).
There was no formal sample size calculation for this study; 48 subjects were enrolled and 48 subjects were analyzed to establish the PK profile of the serum iron from SFP. Study results were summarized by dose group, with descriptive statistics. No additional statistical testing was performed. No imputation of missing data was performed. No windowing of visits was performed.</description>
