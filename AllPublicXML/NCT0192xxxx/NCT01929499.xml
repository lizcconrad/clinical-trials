  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It has been reported that the immune status of patients with cancer were suppressed,
      especially those after surgery and adjuvant chemotherapy. Thus, immunotherapy may decrease
      the recurrence rate after surgery. CIK cells transfusion has been reported as an effect
      therapy in advanced cancers. In another retrospective study, investigators found that
      adjuvant CIK therapy would prolong the disease-free survival (DFS) for colorectal cancer
      patients.

      The purpose of this study is to determine wether adjuvant immunotherapy with CIK cells in
      patients with colon cancer after operation will prolong DFS, and overall survival (OS).

For mFolfox6 regimen:
Oxaliplatin 85mg/m2 IV over 2 hours on day 1; Leucovorin 400mg/m2 IV over 2 hours on day 1; 5-FU 400mg/m2 IV bolus on day 1, then 2400mg/m2 IV continuous infusion over 46-48 hous; 3×109 CIK cells on days 9-11; Oxaliplatin 85mg/m2 IV over 2 hours on day 15; Leucovorin 400mg/m2 IV over 2 hours on day 15; 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) 400mg/m2 IV bolus on day 15, then 2400mg/m2 IV continuous infusion over 46-48 hours; Repeat every 4 weeks for 5-6 cycles.</description>
