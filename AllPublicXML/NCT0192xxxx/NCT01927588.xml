  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      CMV infection is common in transplant patients and can cause graft loss. CMV is a major
      factor in increasing morbidity, and post-transplant costs. The CMV infection is associated
      with many deleterious indirect effects including rejection, interstitial fibrosis and tubular
      atrophy, mortality. In addition to the potential for undesirable clinical outcomes associated
      with CMV, there is also a negative economic aspect. Patients who developed CMV events have
      been found to use significantly more inpatient and outpatient resources than patients without
      CMV disease. Universal prophylaxis is associated with high treatment cost and the potential
      for drug-related toxicity. It can be speculated that use of EVR may offer additional economic
      benefits in terms of decreased utilization associated with prevention of CMV disease, and
      reduce use of costly prophylaxis. Any efforts to reduce costs in renal transplants are very
      important and may have a great impact in total cost of a renal program. And the other hand,
      the clinical data suggest that EVR is associated with a decrease in CMV incidence compared to
      mycophenolic acid (MPA). CMV replication is dependent upon 1 ou 2 mTor pathways and in vitro
      studies support an association between mTor inhibitors and decreased CMV infection and
      disease. In cardiac transplantation, the use of EVR was associated with a lower incidence of
      CMV events. Some clinical trials data have also shown that use of EVR was associated with a
      lower incidence of CMV infection compared to MPA following renal transplantation. Brennan et
      al compared the incidence of CMV in three clinical trials using EVR versus MPA in De Novo
      renal transplants. They pooled for analysis the studies B201, B251 and A2309, all
      double-blind, randomized, parallel-groups that compared the incidence of freedom form and
      incidence of CMV between EVR groups and MPA groups. The results of this pooled analysis of
      over 2000 patients de novo renal transplant demonstrated that EVR was associated with a
      decrease in and delay in the time of onset of CMV events compared to MPA. Our hypothesis is
      that basiliximab in combination with low dose tacrolimus, everolimus and prednisone may
      result in comparable efficacy (BCAR) observed in patients receiving
      tacrolimus/mycophenolate/prednisone but with a better safety profile (CMV infection) and
      cost-effectiveness.

      Objectives:

      Primary To investigate the effect of early use of EVL plus TAC dose reduced vs. MPS plus TAC
      full dose on CMV infection by antigenemia 12 month after transplantation in stable kidney
      transplant recipients.

      Secondaries

      To evaluate renal function by cGFR (MDRD) To evaluate the incidence of acute rejection and
      nephrotoxicity by protocol biopsies; To evaluate the incidence of poliomavirus, according to
      treatment group, by quantitative PCR the BKviremia in urine and biopsy sample.

    <description>At 1, 3, and 12 month, a renal biopsy will be performed. Conventional staining and polyoma virus and CD4d immunohistochemical staining will be done. Methods for immunohistochemical staining procedures will be briefly described: 1. paraffin blocks were deparaffinized in multiple xylene baths, and tissues rehydrated in sequentially graduated ethyl alcohol baths; 2. Sample are predigested in 0.05% protease for 10 min at 37ºC to increase antigenic binding availability; 3.0 after rinsing in Trisbuffered saline, test slides and appropriate positive and negative controls are processed in an automated stainer. Primary antibody NCL-JCBK is applied for 2 hours (or overnight) at 37ºC temperature; then, the secondary antibody (anti-mouse peroxidase antibody) for 30 minutes at 37ºC.</description>

    <time_frame>one year</time_frame>
    <description>1. Tissue will be stained using standard procedures with monoclonal anti-C4d at 1:100 dilution. 2. Secondary anti-mouse FITC-conjungated antibody is applied at a concentration of 1:20; 3. Quantification of staining is recorded, using routine protocols, including pretreatment for 15 min in boiling citrate (pH 8.0), a primary antibody concentration of 1:20 or 1:40 (titered by antibody lot), and secondary goat anti-rabbit IgG antibody at 1:360 dilution. Detection is performed with streptavidin/horseradish peroxidase (Jackson ImmunoResearch) and developed with Stable DAB (Dako, Carpenteria, CA).</description>

    <description>Urine samples will be collected to perform Decoy cells research and real time PCR analysis. Q-PCR amplification reactions will be set up in a reaction volume of 50 µl using the TaqMan Universal PCR Master Mix (PE Biosystems), containing 10 µl of purified DNA, 200 and 400 nM of VPf and VPr, and 50 nM of TaqMan probe. Thermal cycling was initiated with a 2-min incubation at 50 °C, followed by a first denaturation step of 10 min at 95 °C and then 40 cycles of 95 °C for 15 s (denaturation) and 60 °C for 1min. Real-time PCR amplification data will be collected continuously and analysed with the Sequence Detection System.</description>
