      We hypothesize that ear acupressure will be effective in treating seasonal allergic rhinitis
      by changing the immune parameters and the psychological impact factors are associated with
      ear acupressure treatment outcome.

      The purpose of the study is to investigate the clinical potential of ear acupressure in
      treating seasonal allergic rhinitis. We hypothesize that ear acupressure will be effective in
      treating seasonal allergic rhinitis by changing the immune parameters and the psychological
      impact factors such as expectation, stress, depression, and anxiety can moderate the ear
      acupressure treatment effectiveness in allergic rhinitis by influencing the immune
      parameters.

    <measure>Rhinoconjunctivitis Quality of Life Questionnaire (Nasal Symptoms Domain Only)</measure>
    <time_frame>8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>RQLQ is an instrument that has 28 items in 7 domains (sleep, non-rhinoconjuctivitis symptoms, practical problems, nasal symptoms, eye symptoms activity limitations and emotional function). Participants are asked to recall impairments experienced during the previous week and to respond to each item on a 7-point scale (0=no impairment; 6=maximum impairment).
In this protocol, we used the nasal symptoms domain only; 4 questions, total scale ranges from 0 minimum to 24 maximum.
Longitudinal changes of nasal symptoms domain total were reported from baseline to 8 weeks.</description>

        <title>Rhinoconjunctivitis Quality of Life Questionnaire (Nasal Symptoms Domain Only)</title>
        <description>RQLQ is an instrument that has 28 items in 7 domains (sleep, non-rhinoconjuctivitis symptoms, practical problems, nasal symptoms, eye symptoms activity limitations and emotional function). Participants are asked to recall impairments experienced during the previous week and to respond to each item on a 7-point scale (0=no impairment; 6=maximum impairment).
In this protocol, we used the nasal symptoms domain only; 4 questions, total scale ranges from 0 minimum to 24 maximum.
Longitudinal changes of nasal symptoms domain total were reported from baseline to 8 weeks.</description>
