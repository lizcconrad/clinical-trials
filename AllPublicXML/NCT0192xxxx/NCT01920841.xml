  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate efficacy of two lipolytic creams differing in their
      bases and demonstrate that their herbal ingredients can reduce the size of the thigh and
      smooth the appearance of the thigh skin. It is hypothesized that creams with two different
      cream bases containing herbal products that stimulate the lipolytic process through
      stimulation of the beta-adrenergic receptor, with one cream base applied to each thigh daily
      5 days a week for 4 weeks will reduce thigh girth and smooth the thigh skin compared to
      baseline.

      Participants will apply one cream (A) to one thigh and the second cream (B) to the other
      thigh under the supervision of a female clinic staff. The thigh to which each cream will be
      applied will be selected randomly, but half of the subjects will have cream A on the right
      thigh and cream B on the opposite thigh while the other half of the subjects will have the
      sides reversed. To evaluate the primary endpoint, both thighs will be measured at baseline
      and at the end of each treatment week, and the secondary endpoint will be assessed with
      standardized pictures of each thigh at baseline and on the last day of the fourth week which
      will end the study.
