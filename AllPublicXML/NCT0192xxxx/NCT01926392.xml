  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Partial thickness burns are a common, painful injury requiring a great deal of resources in
      their care. Silver sulfadizine is a commonly-used topical antimicrobial, but is difficult to
      remove due to its lipid base. We are comparing a water-based topical antimicrobial therapy to
      silver sulfadiazine and hypothesize that the water-based therapy is superior in terms of pain
      control and resources required to deliver care.

    <description>Pain is assessed on a 0-10 point scale using both the patient's reported value and correlating with the value derived from nursing assessment using the visual analog scale. This is recorded at defined time points before, during, and after the dressing change</description>
