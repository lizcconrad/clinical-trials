  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multi-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study intended to assess
      the safety, tolerability and humoral and cellular immune response over a 12-month period
      after receiving one dose of either the NDV-3A vaccine, NDV-3 vaccine, or placebo. In
      addition, the clinical efficacy of NDV-3A vaccine in lowering the recurrence rate of
      vulvovaginal candidiasis (VVC) in patients with recurrent VVC (RVVC) will be evaluated
      relative to placebo.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the Phase 1b portion of this study is to compare the NDV-3A vaccine, the NDV-3
      vaccine and the placebo head-to-head in the patient population of interest (women with RVVC)
      to evaluate safety and immunogenicity. The study size for comparing safety and immunogenicity
      (N=15 per group) is based on the dose comparison design used in study NDV3-001 (clinical
      trials.gov Identifier NCT01273922).

      The primary purpose of the Phase 2a portion of this study is to further evaluate safety,
      tolerability, and immunogenicity of the NDV-3A vaccine compared to placebo in a patient
      population of interest (women with RVVC). The secondary purpose is to determine whether the
      NDV-3A vaccine decreases the recurrence rate of VVC in 18-50 year old women with RVVC when
      compared to placebo. The study size for evaluating efficacy (N=87 per group) is based on
      assuming a 50% rate of VVC recurrences over the 6 month post-vaccination period in the
      placebo group and a 50% vaccine efficacy.
