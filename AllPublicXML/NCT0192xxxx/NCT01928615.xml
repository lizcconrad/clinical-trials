  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This open-label, randomized crossover study evaluated the quality of life, efficacy, and
      safety of subcutaneous Herceptin (trastuzumab) injected either into the thigh or the upper
      arm of participants with early HER2-positive breast cancer.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In the run-in phase, participants received trastuzumab intravenously every 3 weeks for 18
      weeks (Cycles 1-6). They first received trastuzumab 8 mg/kg once (Cycle 1) followed by
      trastuzumab 6 mg/kg 5 times for 15 weeks (Cycles 2-6). Participants could also receive a
      maximum of 6 cycles of standard chemotherapy for early breast cancer (neo-adjuvant or
      adjuvant) in the run-in phase.

      Following the run-in phase, participants were randomized to receive trastuzumab 600 mg
      subcutaneously every 3 weeks in the thigh and upper arm in a cross-over design for a total of
      24 weeks (Cycles 7-14). They received trastuzumab either in the thigh first for 4 cycles
      (Cycles 7-10) followed by trastuzumab in the upper arm for 4 cycles (Cycles 11-14) or the
      upper arm first (Cycles 7-10) followed by the thigh (Cycles 11-14). For Cycles 15-18,
      participants could choose the injection site for trastuzumab 600 mg subcutaneously every 3
      weeks.

    <description>Participants rated their quality of life on a visual analog scale (VAS) at the end of each cycle for Cycles 7-14. The left-end of the VAS represented the lowest-rated quality of life and the right-end of the VAS represented the highest-rated quality of life. Both the mean ratings for injections into the thigh and the upper arm and the minimum ratings for during injections into the thigh and the upper arm are reported. Quality of life scores ranged from 1 to 100 with a higher score indicating a better rated quality of life.</description>
