    <textblock>
      The purpose of this protocol is to perform serial physiological measurements and blood
      testing on mechanically ventilated patients comparing conditions of eucapnia and hypercapnia
      in the same patient. We will be testing two hypotheses: (1) while administering inspired
      carbon dioxide (CO2), eucapnia achieved by high respiratory rate (EHR) significantly
      decreases pulmonary artery pressures compared to hypercapnia with a lower respiratory rate
      (HLR), and (2) that EHR decreases myocardial strain compared to HLR.

      The purpose of this protocol is to perform serial physiological measurements and blood
      testing on mechanically ventilated patients comparing conditions of eucapnia (maintaining
      alveolar ventilation to target carbon dioxide partial pressure (pCO2) 35-40 mm Hg) and
      hypercapnia (providing inspired CO2 to target pCO2 55-60 mm Hg) in the same patient. This
      prospective clinical study will enroll consenting adult patients scheduled for elective
      cardiac surgery and who require postoperative mechanical ventilation, pulmonary artery
      (Swan-Ganz) catheter monitoring, and arterial catheterization as part of routine standard
      care during the immediate postoperative period. The study will perform measurements using
      available ventilator monitors, ventilator in-line pneumotachograph and capnograph,
      measurements from the indwelling pulmonary artery catheter, transesophageal echocardiography,
      and other measurements available as part of routine care. The entire experimental protocol
      will be performed in one day over 2-4 hours, and the protocol will not interfere with routine
      postoperative care, nor prolong the need for mechanical ventilation, pulmonary artery
      catheterization, arterial catheterization, or intensive care unit length of stay.

      Ventilation with low tidal volumes has been shown definitively to improve mortality from
      acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)1 and may provide benefit even in patients without
      ARDS.2 During low tidal volume ventilation, practice varies on whether to allow some degree
      of alveolar hypoventilation with incidental hypercapnic acidosis (termed &quot;permissive
      hypercapnia&quot;),3 or to increase respiratory rate to maintain alveolar ventilation and target
      eucapnia, often requiring respiratory rates &gt; 30/min.4 The physiological consequences of
      these divergent strategies remain to be fully elucidated. We propose the following study to
      distinguish the effects of a eucapnic high respiratory rate (EHR) strategy from a hypercapnic
      low respiratory rate (HLR) strategy on pulmonary hemodynamics during low tidal volume
      ventilation.

      Specific Aim: To test the hypothesis that, while administering inspired CO2, eucapnia
      achieved by high respiratory rate (EHR) significantly decreases pulmonary artery pressures
      compared to hypercapnia with a lower respiratory rate (HLR).

      Specific Aim: To test the hypothesis that EHR decreases myocardial strain compared to HLR.

    <description>Patients in this arm will have the &quot;hypercapnia with low respiratory rate&quot; (HLR) strategy first. Once hypercapnia is achieved via inspired carbon dioxide, no additional changes will be made to the ventilator. Once steady-state is achieved, physiological measurements will be taken. The patient will be returned to baseline settings for a 15-minute &quot;rest period&quot; before starting the EHR strategy per the cross-over design.</description>

    <description>Patients in this arm will have the &quot;eucapnia with high respiratory rate&quot; (EHR) strategy first. Once hypercapnia is achieved via inspired carbon dioxide, respiratory rate will be increased until PetCO2 returns to baseline or up to 35 breaths per minute, as limited by the National Heart Lung and Blood Institute (NHLBI) ARDS Network protocol. fraction of inspired oxygen inspired oxygen fraction and set tidal volume will be maintained. Once steady-state is achieved, physiological measurements will be taken.
