  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The combination of HDL-C elevation, lowering of triglycerides and further LDL-C reduction
      accomplished by the addition of niacin to statin medication would improve endothelial
      function as compared to LDL-C reduction alone in patients with and without coronary artery
      disease and the combination of low HDL-C/high triglycerides.

      The combination of lipid lowering therapy would have beneficial effects on markers of
      inflammation. These benefits would be particularly evident in women.

    <description>Patients will be randomized to Niaspan 1.5 g/d in addition to usual care statin lipid lowering agents. The dose of Niaspan will be titrated over a 4-week period and then patients will remain on study drug for additional 12 weeks. The dose of statin will be adjusted in a blinded fashion in both groups at week 10 to similarly achieve a LDL-C of less than 100mg/dl.</description>
