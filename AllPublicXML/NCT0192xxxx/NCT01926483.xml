  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators hypothesized that the Neoadjuvant Chemoradiotherapy was a beneficial
      treatment for Patients with Stage IIIA-N2 Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer, so we try to evaluate
      the security of treatment, the QoL of patients and the influence to the PFS and OS.

      Scheme:

      Patients will receive different chemotherapy regimens depending on the pathological type.

      Squamous cell carcinoma:Docetaxel/Cisplatin and concurrent radiation (46Gy/23f) followed by
      surgery, consolidate Docetaxel/Cisplatin 2 cycles.

      Non-squamous cell carcinoma:Pemetrexed/Cisplatin and concurrent radiation (46Gy/23f) followed
      by surgery, consolidate Pemetrexed/Cisplatin 2 cycles.
