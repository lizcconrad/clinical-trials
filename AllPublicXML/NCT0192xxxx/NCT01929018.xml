  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to examine the feasibility of using a collaborative-care,
      home-based rehabilitation program to improve functional outcomes for people recovering from
      lower limb amputation caused by vascular problems and/or diabetes complications. The primary
      hypothesis is that the rehabilitation program will result in greater improvements in
      performance-based and participant-reported measures of physical function, compared to
      standard of care after outpatient rehabilitation.
