  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to determine whether daptomycin is effective and safe in the
      treatment of pediatric participants with AHO when compared to vancomycin (or equivalent) or
      nafcillin (or β-lactam equivalent). The primary hypothesis is that daptomycin is non-inferior
      compared with vancomycin (or equivalent) or nafcillin (or β-lactam equivalent) with respect
      to improvement in Pain, Inflammation, and Limb Function on or before study Day 5.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Acute hematogenous osteomyelitis is a common problem in the pediatric population, affecting
      approximately 5/10,000 children each year and accounting for approximately 1% of all
      pediatric hospitalizations. In children, osteomyelitis arises from bacteremic seeding of the
      bone metaphysis.

      Daptomycin, is a cyclic lipopeptide antibacterial active against most clinically significant
      gram-positive pathogens including drug-resistant strains such as Methicillin Resistant
      Staphylococcus (S.) aureus (MRSA) and Methicillin Susceptible S. aureus (MSSA). Daptomycin
      has proven clinical efficacy in adults in the treatment of complicated skin and skin
      structure infections (cSSSI) caused by aerobic gram-positive pathogens and the treatment of
      S. aureus bloodstream infections (bacteremia; SAB), including those complicated by
      right-sided infective endocarditis, caused by MSSA and MRSA. Although not indicated for
      osteomyelitis, daptomycin has been successfully used to treat osteoarticular infections in
      adults and children as salvage therapy and at medical centers with increasingly high rates of
      vancomycin resistant organisms.

      In addition, more comparative clinical trials are needed in pediatric AHO to better elucidate
      the optimal treatment regimen and clinical response.

    <time_frame>Up to study Day 5</time_frame>
    <description>Clinical improvement was based on the Investigator's overall assessment of severity of each of the 3 general symptom categories of Pain, Inflammation, and Limb Function. Based on this evaluation, a participant was considered to have met criteria for clinical improvement according to the following definition: If 3 general categories are present at baseline: at least a 1-point improvement (i.e. severe to moderate, moderate to mild, mild to absent) in at least 2 of the general categories and no worsening in the other. If 2 general categories are present at baseline: at least a 2-point improvement (i.e. severe to mild, moderate to absent) in at least 1 of the general categories and no worsening or new findings in the others OR at least a 1-point improvement in both and no new findings in the other. If 1 general category is present at baseline: at least a 2-point improvement (i.e., severe to mild, moderate to absent) in that category and no new findings in the others.</description>

    <measure>Percentage of Participants With Clinical Improvement Measured as a Composite End Point of Pain, Inflammation, Limb Function, Body Temperature, and C-reactive Protein at End-of IV (EOIV) Therapy Visit.</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to study Day 5</time_frame>
    <description>A participant had a favorable outcome in this composite endpoint if all 3 of the following criteria were met: Clinical improvement in the general symptom categories of Pain, Inflammation, and Limb Function on or before Study Day 5; Body temperature ≤ 38°C (100.4°F) over the preceding 24 hours; and C-reactive Protein (CRP) decreased from baseline for participants who had a baseline CRP &gt;ULN (upper limit of normal)) or remain &lt;=ULN for participants who had a baseline &lt;=ULN on or before Study Day 5. The EOIV visit is within 24 hours after the last dose of IV study drug and before switch to optional open label (PO) therapy, if applicable.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline (within 48 hours prior to first dose of IV study drug) - and up to Test of Cure (21-35 days after last dose of IV study drug) (up to Day 77)</time_frame>
    <description>Favorable clinical outcomes are clinical recovery and clinical cure. Clinical cure is defined as resolution of all acute symptoms of AHO or improvement to such an extent that no further intravenous antibacterial therapy is required. Clinical recovery is defined as clinical improvement in the composite end point three general categories of Pain, Inflammation, and Limb Function on or before Study Day 5, and no development of new symptoms of AHO; body temperature ≤ 38°C (100.4°F) for 24 hours; no new or additional bone or joint infection (e.g., abscess, spreading to other osseous or articular locations) such that no further antibacterial therapy or surgery are required; no hematogenous metastatic infection (e.g., abscess in liver, spleen, lung; other bones) or bacteremia.. The End of Therapy (EOT) visit is within 48 hours of last dose of PO therapy.</description>

    <description>At Test Of Cure (TOC) clinical cure is defined as resolution of all acute symptoms of AHO or improvement to such an extent that no further antibacterial therapy is required. Favorable microbiological outcomes are either eradication where the source specimen demonstrated absence of the original baseline pathogen; or presumed eradication where the source specimen was not available to culture, and the subject was assessed as a clinical cure. To have a favorable microbiological response, the outcome for each participant's baseline pathogen must be favorable (eradicated or presumed eradicated). Other pathogens include Arcanobacterium haemolyticum, Gram positive cocci, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus dysgalactiae, Streptococcus mitis group and Streptococcus pyogenes.</description>

        <description>Clinical improvement was based on the Investigator’s overall assessment of severity of each of the 3 general symptom categories of Pain, Inflammation, and Limb Function. Based on this evaluation, a participant was considered to have met criteria for clinical improvement according to the following definition: If 3 general categories are present at baseline: at least a 1-point improvement (i.e. severe to moderate, moderate to mild, mild to absent) in at least 2 of the general categories and no worsening in the other. If 2 general categories are present at baseline: at least a 2-point improvement (i.e. severe to mild, moderate to absent) in at least 1 of the general categories and no worsening or new findings in the others OR at least a 1-point improvement in both and no new findings in the other. If 1 general category is present at baseline: at least a 2-point improvement (i.e., severe to mild, moderate to absent) in that category and no new findings in the others.</description>

Clinical cure is defined as resolution of all acute symptoms of AHO or improvement to such an extent that no further intravenous antibacterial therapy is required. Clinical recovery is defined as clinical improvement in the composite end point three general categories of Pain, Inflammation, and Limb Function on or before Study Day 5, and no development of new symptoms of AHO; body temperature ≤ 38°C (100.4°F) for 24 hours; no new or additional bone or joint infection (e.g., abscess, spreading to other osseous or articular locations) such that no further antibacterial therapy or surgery are required; no hematogenous metastatic infection (e.g., abscess in liver, spleen, lung; other bones) or bacteremia.. The End of Therapy (EOT) visit is within 48 hours of last dose of PO therapy.</description>

        <description>At Test Of Cure (TOC) clinical cure is defined as resolution of all acute symptoms of AHO or improvement to such an extent that no further antibacterial therapy is required. Favorable microbiological outcomes are either eradication where the source specimen demonstrated absence of the original baseline pathogen; or presumed eradication where the source specimen was not available to culture, and the subject was assessed as a clinical cure. To have a favorable microbiological response, the outcome for each participant's baseline pathogen must be favorable (eradicated or presumed eradicated). Other pathogens include Arcanobacterium haemolyticum, Gram positive cocci, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus dysgalactiae, Streptococcus mitis group and Streptococcus pyogenes.</description>

        <description>Sustained clinical improvement was defined as participants with clinical improvement who further met the definition of clinical cure. Clinical improvement was in the three general categories of Pain, Inflammation, and Limb Function on or before Study Day 5. Clinical cure is defined as resolution of all acute symptoms of AHO or improvement to such an extent that no further intravenous antibacterial therapy is required. The EOT visit is within 48 hours of last dose of PO therapy.</description>
