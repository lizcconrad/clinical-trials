  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this trial is to assess the performance of an Artificial Pancreas (AP) device
      using the Portable Artificial Pancreas System (pAPS) platform for subjects with type 1
      diabetes using an insulin pump and rapid acting insulin. This proposed study is designed to
      compare closed-loop control with or without optimization of initialization parameters related
      to basal insulin infusion rates and insulin to carbohydrate (I:C) ratios for meals and
      snacks.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study consists of an evaluation of the Artificial Pancreas device system during two
      24-27.5-hour closed-loop phases in an outpatient/hotel environment. Prior to the closed-loop
      phases, each subject will undergo a 7-day data collection period consisting of his or her
      usual free-living conditions along with 3 meals of known carbohydrate content. Data from the
      insulin pump, a continuous glucose monitoring sensor (CGM), diet and exercise records will be
      collected during this period. These data from this 7-day period will be analyzed in order to
      come up with adapted basal insulin infusion rates and bolus insulin to carbohydrate (I:C)
      ratios.

    <description>The percentage time spent in safe blood glucose range of [80-140] mg/dl will be the primary endpoint. More time spent inside the desired range will be considered successful. Expected levels are [70-180] mg/dl the 5 hours after meals and [70-150] mg/dl 3 hours after exercise.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>glucose level extremes and need for outside intervention</measure>
    <time_frame>24-hour closed loop</time_frame>
    <description>The secondary endpoint measures glucose extremes and the need for outside intervention to prevent hypoglycemia or hyperglycemia. Interventions would be insulin injections or oral carbohydrates given to the subject by the physician. No need for physician intervention will be considered a successful outcome.</description>
