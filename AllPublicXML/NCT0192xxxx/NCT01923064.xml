      Gastroesophageal variceal bleeding is known as one of the most frequent death causes of
      patients with portal hypertension. When a patient has a bleeding episode, if no further
      prophylactic treatments is given, it's very likely that he/she will develop another
      rebleeding event in the future and maybe a terminal event. Gastric varices occur in 18-70% of
      patients with portal hypertension, which appear to be more severe, to require more
      transfusion and to have a higher mortality rate than esophageal variceal bleeding, with a
      high rate of rebleeding(38-89%). It has been recommended to use endoscopic cyanoacrylate
      injection as the first line treatment for hemostasis and secondary prophylaxis for gastric
      varices by general consensus. However, the efficacy and prevalence of complications between
      mixture of cyanoacrylate + lipiodol and cyanoacrylate + lauromacrogol have not yet been
      explored and reported. We conducted this study to evaluate the effect of endoscopic injection
      of a mixture of cyanoacrylate and lipiodol versus cyanoacrylate and lauromacrogol in gastric
      varices.
