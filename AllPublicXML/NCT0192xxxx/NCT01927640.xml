  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will use myocardial contrast echocardiography performed during a continuous
      intravenous infusion of Definity microbubbles (Perflutren lipid microbubbles) to determine if
      dexmedetomidine (an intravenous central sympatholytic drug) can reverse all the
      cardiovascular effects of low-dose intranasal cocaine—including vasoconstriction in the
      coronary microcirculation—both in cocaine-naïve and non-treatment seeking cocaine-addicted
      subjects.

      Each subject will be participating in three study visits: Screening Visit, Visit 1: a
      low-dose dobutamine visit and Visit 2: a low-dose cocaine visit. At the dobutamine visit, the
      subject will only receive low-dose dobutamine, which will be used as an internal
      inotropic/vasodilator control for cocaine. At the cocaine visit, the subject will receive
      low-dose intranasal cocaine followed by either the active study drug (dexmedetomidine) or an
      inactive placebo (saline). Both cocaine and dobutamine will increase myocardial contractility
      and oxygen demand, thereby stimulating metabolic vasodilation. If, as predicted, cocaine also
      causes α-adrenergic agonist in the coronary microcirculation, then myocardial blood flow
      should increase less with cocaine then with dobutamine for a given level of myocardial oxygen
      demand. We will study if dexmedetomidine, a central sympatholytic, can normalize this cocaine
      effect. We previously have used dobutamine as a comparator for cocaine in our research. At
      both visits, myocardial contrast echocardiography will be used to measure regional myocardial
      perfusion.
