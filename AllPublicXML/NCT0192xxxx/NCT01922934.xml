  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Obesity is common, causing many medical problems in adults (e.g., diabetes, hypertension,
      high cholesterol, sleep apnea, heart attack, strokes). A range of treatments have shown to be
      effective for treating obesity. Treatments include lifestyle modification, meal replacements,
      and weight loss medication. Most primary care settings do not provide much obesity treatment,
      though, as primary care providers (PCPs) are not well trained and because reimbursement for
      treatments is not consistent.

      Hypothesis: If PCPs have training in weight management and if most costs of treatment are
      reimbursed, we surmise that a &quot;toolbox&quot; of treatments can produce a clinically important
      weight loss amount in a large group of patients.

      Design: We propose to establish a registry of obese patients with at least one common medical
      condition related to their weight. From the registry, we will randomly select 350 people to
      be offered treatments to assist with weight loss. The remainder of the registry's patients
      can still receive obesity treatment but will not be reimbursed. We will conduct the study at
      Denver Health, a large public health care system that treats a low income, ethnically diverse
      population. All 350 patients will be offered some self-monitoring tools for weight management
      and the chance to do a computer assessment to select the right treatment for weight loss.
      Patients who complete this and record their food intake and physical activity for 1 week will
      be offered a &quot;Level 2&quot; treatment for weight loss. Level 2 treatments include: a voucher for a
      commercial weight loss program; intensive group weight loss counseling; meal replacements;
      gym membership; or weight loss medication. Patients will choose which treatment they want,
      with the approval of their PCP. Researchers at Denver Health will help with the computer
      assessment and dispensing the treatments. We are interested in what percentage of patients
      lose at least 5% of their starting weight. We will also explore changes in glucose, blood
      pressure, and cholesterol, and we will look at how much this intervention costs and whether
      patients need less medication for their weight-related conditions at the end of the study.

      Impact: If the study is successful, we plan to take the results to the leaders at Denver
      Health to see if they will make obesity treatment more broadly available for all patients
      there.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Background: Obesity is prevalent and is a root cause of many common medical conditions
      affecting U.S. adults. A range of treatment options have demonstrated efficacy in producing
      weight loss and reducing health risks in randomized controlled trials. However, very little
      obesity treatment is currently delivered in most primary care settings. Inadequate
      reimbursement for treatment modalities and a lack of systematic training of primary care
      providers (PCPs) are two of the major barriers to more widespread treatment.

      Hypothesis: If PCPs are given training and support for weight management, and if treatment
      options with proven efficacy are offered to obese adults with weight related co-morbidities
      with the majority of the treatment cost reimbursed, then clinically meaningful weight loss
      will be produced in a significant number of these individuals at a reasonable cost.

      Design: This application proposes a 12 month intervention trial among obese adults cared for
      at 4 primary care clinics affiliated with Denver Health (DH), an integrated health care
      system serving an ethnically diverse medically underserved population. From among a large
      population of patients (~8,000) with obesity and at least one co-morbid condition, 350
      individuals will be randomly selected to be offered a &quot;toolbox&quot; of treatment options. The
      remainder will be assigned to a control condition. The &quot;toolbox&quot; will include: 1) meal
      replacements; 2) group weight loss counseling; 3) membership at recreation centers; 4)
      pharmacotherapy with phentermine; and 5) other options. Patients in the intervention arm will
      undergo an initial evaluation using an &quot;expert systems&quot; computer program. They will then be
      required to self-monitor diet and physical activity before gaining access to the higher cost
      weight management services in the toolbox. Primary care providers will help patients choose
      treatment approaches, encourage adherence, and monitor success. Patient Navigators will
      assist patients in accessing prescribed treatments. The primary outcome will be the fraction
      of patients in each group who achieve a 5% weight loss after 12 months of intervention.
      Secondary outcomes will include uptake and utilization of treatment options, changes in
      cardiovascular disease risk factors, and other health care utilization, in particular
      outpatient medications for diabetes, hypertension, and lipids. While the treatment modalities
      to be used in this trial are not new, an intervention delivering a toolbox of weight
      management services in a safety net clinical setting and examining the effect on health care
      utilization is innovative. The submitted letters of support attest to the need for more data
      so that health care providers and payers can make evidence-based decisions regarding the
      provision of obesity treatment to large patient populations.

      Impact: A positive result would encourage the broader adoption of a toolbox approach to
      weight management in primary care settings. A negative result would strongly suggest that
      even with a &quot;best case scenario&quot; of training and support for obesity treatment, the primary
      care clinic is not an effective route of delivery for weight management. Either result would
      be important in shaping future policy decisions about obesity treatment.

          <description>428 randomly-selected patients from four Denver Health clinics are identified for the intervention arm which offers a &quot;toolbox&quot; of weight loss options. The &quot;toolbox&quot; includes: self-monitoring tools; education materials; recreation center passes; commercial weight loss program vouchers (Weight Watchers); intensive group counseling (Colorado Weigh); meal replacements (shakes &amp; entrees); and obesity pharmacotherapy (Qsymia &amp; phentermine). At the initial assessment (visit 0), a computer program helps patients choose a personal treatment mode and they receive a starter kit with self-monitoring tools and meal replacements. Subjects must show self-monitoring of diet and exercise to receive more intensive therapies at their next visit (visit 1). At subsequent monthly visits, patients select a primary intensive therapy, but are able to add/change tools throughout the one year study period. Patients pay a $5-$10 co-pay for the therapies.</description>

    <reported_events>
      <time_frame>Adverse events were collected from the time the first patient in the intervention arm received a tool at their study visit #1 (1/14/2015) through when the final study patient was seen for receiving a tool at their study visit #12 (8/12/2016). Thus, adverse events were collected over a period of 19 months. Adverse events were not collected on those in the control arm; those subjects participated passively by a waiver of consent and never had any interaction with the study team.</time_frame>
      <desc>The definitions used by clinicaltrials.gov for adverse event and serious adverse event apply. Adverse events were only collected and reported on the intervention arm only and not on the control arm, as those in the control participated passively by a waiver of consent and never had any interaction with the study team or knowledge of the study's existence. This waiver was approved by the IRB.</desc>

          <title>Intervention</title>
          <description>428 randomly-selected patients from four Denver Health clinics were selected to be offered a &quot;toolbox&quot; of weight loss options, including: self-monitoring tools; education materials; recreation center passes; commercial weight loss program vouchers (Weight Watchers); intensive group counseling (Colorado Weigh); meal replacements (shakes &amp; entrees); and obesity pharmacotherapy (Qsymia &amp; phentermine) for a $5-$10 co-pay for the therapies. Of these 428 patients, 140 came in and consented at the computer program visit at which these options were offered. 119 of these patients came in for a visit one where they received their tool for the first time. Adverse events from the group of 140 patients who consented to receive the intervention are reported.</description>
