      This phase 2, randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled, multi-center study will evaluate
      the safety and efficacy of three dose levels of AZD1722 in subjects with constipation
      predominant IBS (IBS-C) as defined by the ROME III criteria and who have active disease as
      determined during a two-week screening period. Subjects who qualify and are randomized into
      the study will receive 5, 20, or 50 mg of AZD1722 BID or placebo BID for 12 consecutive
      weeks. At the end of this treatment period, subjects will be followed for an additional 4
      weeks.
