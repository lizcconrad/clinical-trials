    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the safety, tolerability, and PK of MK-8892 in participants with
      pulmonary arterial hypertension. The primary hypothesis is that the geometric mean of MK-8892
      area under the concentration time-curve from Hour 0 to 24 hours (AUC0-24hr) in participants
      with PAH, will be equal to or greater than the efficacious exposure in humans of 0.6 μM•hr.
