  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients in the intensive care unit (ICU) traditionally receive bed rest as part of their
      care. They develop muscle weaknesses even after only a few days of mechanical ventilation
      that may prolong their time in ICU and in hospital, delay functional recovery and delay their
      return home and to work. Weakness may be avoided with simple strategies of early exercise in
      ICU. This pilot study aims to test the hypothesis that early mobilisation may improve
      functional recovery in this patient group and gather pilot data to support a larger
      randomised trial across Australia and New Zealand.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients who are admitted and treated in the intensive care unit (ICU) generally have
      potentially reversible critical illness. While many patients survive, substantial proportions
      of patients fail to recover completely and do not return to their pre-morbid level of health.
      Critically ill patients receive mechanical ventilation, as a lifesaving intervention, but
      this is routinely managed with deep sedation and immobility, which results in prolonged
      periods of bed rest. Severe muscle weakness, termed ICUAW, is common and associated with
      prolonged duration of mechanical ventilation and hospital stay in the ICU, as well as poor
      recovery of physical function. Early mobilisation, exercising patients while they are still
      receiving mechanical ventilation, has been proposed as a candidate intervention to prevent
      ICU acquired weakness (ICUAW). Observational studies indicate that early mobilisation is not
      used routinely in critically ill patients in Australia and New Zealand. TEAM is a pilot RCT
      designed to obtain data to assist in the planning of an adequately powered RCT that will test
      the hypothesis that early mobilisation of critically ill patients improves one or more
      functional outcomes, quality of survival, and proportion of patients who survive.
