      T790M, EGFR exon 20 and other uncommon, HER2, or BRAF-mutated; ALK, ROS1, or RET-rearranged
      NSCLC

      Secondary objective(s):

      (1) To define the disease control rate (complete response + partial response + stable disease
      &gt;=24 weeks) of AUY922 in patients with stage IV EGFR T790M, EGFR exon 20 and other uncommon,
      HER2, or BRAF-mutated; ALK, ROS1, or RET-rearranged NSCLC. (2) To determine the
      progression-free survival of AUY922 in patients with stage IV EGFR T790M, EGFR exon 20 and
      other uncommon, HER2, KRAS, or BRAF-mutated; ALK, ROS1, or RET-rearranged NSCLC. (3) To
      determine the overall survival of AUY922 in patients with stage IV EGFR T790M, EGFR exon 20
      and other uncommon, HER2, KRAS, or BRAF-mutated; ALK, ROS1, or RET-rearranged NSCLC.

      Exploratory Objective(s):

      To study the pharmacodynamics of circulating tumor cells and plasma proteins.

      Planned number of subjects: A total of 63 patients for the first stage of this study in 1 - 3
      centers in Taiwan.

      Patient population:

        1. Stage IV (by AJCC 7th edition) NSCLC.

        2. EGFR T790M mutation; EGFR exon 20 and other uncommon mutation; HER2 mutation; BRAF
           mutation; ALK translocation; ROS1 translocation; or RET translocation in tumor samples.

        3. One line of prior systemic therapy.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Histologically or cytologically proven diagnosis of stage IV NSCLC (AJCC 7th) which
             had been treated with one systemic therapy.

          -  One of the molecular alterations as follows:

               -  EGFR mutations in exon 20 T790M.

               -  EGFR mutations in exon 20; in-frame duplication and/or insertion (e.g.
                  A767_V769dupASV or H773_V774insH) or point mutations other than T790M; or other
                  uncommon mutations.
