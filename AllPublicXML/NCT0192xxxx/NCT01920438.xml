  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A gastrostomy is a feeding tube that communicates from the skin directly into the stomach. It
      is a device frequently used in children that have feeding difficulties or are unable to
      maintain normal growth via oral feeds. The same device may be inserted in two ways: the
      percutaneous endoscopic method (PEG) which is guided by the use of an endoscope (flexible
      camera), or the radiologically inserted method (RIG) which is guided by the use of X-ray
      imaging. Both methods of insertion have been used in children for more than 20 years, but it
      is not clear which is the best method. Both methods are associated with complications,
      including injury to other abdominal organs and leakage leading to sepsis. There are no
      randomised controlled trials comparing the two techniques.

      We aim to compare the outcome of both methods of gastrostomy insertion in children, with
      emphasis on the complication rates. We have devised a complication score with weightage
      assigned to each complication according to its severity.

      A randomised controlled trial will be performed in children requiring a gastrostomy, 100 per
      group. The primary outcome will be the overall total complication rate.
