    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to describe effectiveness and reliability of TachoSil® in lymph
      sealing after lymphadenectomy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this non-interventional study (NIS) was to collect further knowledge on the
      routine use of TachoSil ® in lymph node surgery where its sealing property helps to reduce
      the rate of postoperative complications, especially of seroma formation. Some data are
      already available from gynecology, urology and thoracic surgery.

    <description>An Adverse Event (AE) is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a participant administered a drug; it does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (eg, a clinically significant abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a drug, whether or not it is considered related to the drug. A treatment-emergent adverse event (TEAE) is defined as an adverse event with an onset that occurs after receiving study drug.</description>

        <description>An Adverse Event (AE) is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a participant administered a drug; it does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (eg, a clinically significant abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a drug, whether or not it is considered related to the drug. A treatment-emergent adverse event (TEAE) is defined as an adverse event with an onset that occurs after receiving study drug.</description>
