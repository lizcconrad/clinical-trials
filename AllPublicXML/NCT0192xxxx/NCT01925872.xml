  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      1. Clopidogrel resistance is common in patients of ischemic cerebrovascular disease.

        2. Genetic polymorphisms are the most important factors to clopidogrel resistance.

        3. The purpose of this study is to find the genes which are the related to clopidogrel
           resistance.

        4. Through gene sequencing, we can filter patient of clopidogrel resistance, so another
           drug maybe used to avoid the undesired efficacy.
