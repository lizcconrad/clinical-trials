      The purpose of this study to evaluate safety, tolerability, treatment outcomes, appropriate
      use and pattern of paliperidone palmitate usage in participants with schizophrenia in the
      hospital setting.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective (look forward using periodic observations collected predominantly
      following patient enrollment), multicenter, observational study (a type of study in which
      participants are observed or certain outcomes are measured). This study will consist of
      6-week observational period during which data will be collected for participants who are
      hospitalized due to schizophrenia exacerbation and are receiving treatment with paliperidone
      palmitate (treatment initiated within 3 weeks after admission to hospital). The participant
      satisfaction will be evaluated at week 6 (or early discontinuation). Safety evaluations will
      include body weight, extrapyramidal symptom (eg, inability to initiate movement and inability
      to remain motionless) rating scale scores, concomitant therapy and assessment of adverse
      events.

    <measure>Change from baseline in Extrapyramidal Symptom Rating Scale (ESRS) score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 1, Week 2, Week 5, and Week 6</time_frame>
    <description>The ESRS is a 12 item clinician-rated scale designed to assess the severety of extrapyramidal symptoms. Dyskinesic movements are rated according to bothfrequency and amplitude. It measures the four types of drug-induced movement disorders. (Parkinsonism, Dystonia, akathisia, and Dyskinesia). Items are rated on a 7-point scale ranging from 0 (normal) to 6 (extremely severe). The higher the score, the more severely the symptoms affect function. Higher scores indicate worsening.</description>

    <measure>Change from baseline in total Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS) score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 1, Week 2, Week 3, Week 4, Week 5, and Week 6</time_frame>
    <description>The BPRS is used for the measurement of psychiatric symptoms. The BPRS is an 18 item questionnaire and each question is rated on a 7 point scale ranging from 1 (not present) to 7 (extremely severe). The total score for the 18 question will be calculated by adding score of each question. The interpretation of the total scores are: 0-9 will indicate &quot;not a schizoaffective case&quot;; 10-20 will indicate &quot;possible schizoaffective case&quot;; and 21 or more, will indicate &quot;evident schizoaffective case&quot;. Higher scores indicate worsening.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Clinical Global Impression - Severity (CGI-S) scale score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 1, Week 2, Week 3, Week 4, Week 5, and Week 6</time_frame>
    <description>The CGI-S rating scale is a 7-point global assessment that measures the clinician's impression of the severity of illness exhibited by a participant. A rating of 1 is equivalent to &quot;Normal, not at all ill&quot; and a rating of 7 is equivalent to &quot;Among the most extremely ill participants&quot;. Higher scores indicate worsening.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Clinical Global Impression - Change (CGI-C) scale score</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 6</time_frame>
    <description>The CGI-C is a 7-point assessment scale of change in global clinical status, defined as a sense of well-being and ability to function in daily activities. CGI-C scores range from 1 (very much improved) through to 7 (very much worse). Higher scores indicate worsening.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from baseline in Personal and Psychosocial functioning (PSP) scale score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 6</time_frame>
    <description>The PSP is used as a measure of personal and social functioning of participants with psychiatric disorders. The PSP scale assesses the degree of difficulty a participant exhibits over a 1-month period within 4 domains of behavior: socially useful activities, personal and social relationships, self-care, and disturbing and aggressive behavior and provide rating from 1 to 100. Participants with score of 71 to 100 have a mild degree of difficulty; from 31 to 70 have marked difficulty and from 1 to 30, have represent severe degrees of difficulty. Lower scores indicate worsening.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Subject Satisfaction with previous antipsychotic medication (MSQ) scale score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Treatment satisfaction with previous anti psychiatric medication among participants with schizophrenia will be assessed by using the MSQ scale. It consists of 1 question: &quot;Overall, how satisfied are you with your current antipsychotic medication(s)?&quot; with responses assessed on a 7-point scale rated as follows: 1=extremely dissatisfied, 2=very dissatisfied, 3=somewhat dissatisfied, 4=neither satisfied nor dissatisfied, 5=somewhat satisfied, 6=very satisfied, and 7=extremely satisfied. Lower scores indicate worsening.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>

    <measure>Subject Satisfaction with study medication (paliperidone palmitate) scale score</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 6</time_frame>
    <description>Treatment satisfaction with study medication (paliperidone palmitate) among participants with schizophrenia will be assessed by using the MSQ scale. It consists of 1 question: &quot;Overall, how satisfied are you with your current antipsychotic medication(s)?&quot; with responses assessed on a 7-point scale rated as follows: 1=extremely dissatisfied, 2=very dissatisfied, 3=somewhat dissatisfied, 4=neither satisfied nor dissatisfied, 5=somewhat satisfied, 6=very satisfied, and 7=extremely satisfied.
