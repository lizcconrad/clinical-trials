  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Among the patients with coronary heart disease, those with ACS (acute coronary syndrome) are
      extremely high-risk patients. Therefore, management outside hospital, especially the regular
      administration of drugs, is vital to prevent the recurrence of cardiovascular events.
      However, most patients often fail to stay on a long-term administration regimen, especially
      the administration of statins. According to the statistics, the average duration adhered with
      statin in patients with ACS is less than 3 months, use of statin at hospital discharge was
      only 80% and 65% in 6 month, with a very low LDL-C control rate (about 11% at 6 months),
      which poses a threat to the recurrence rate of cardiovascular events in patients with ACS.

      It was found in previous studies that there were many factors influencing patients'
      compliance, in which patients' refusing to take medicine accounted for a higher proportion.
      It suggests that patient had not recognized the importance of long-term administration.
      Therefore, it is extremely important for physicians to strengthen patient education and
      regular follow-up visits during disease management. Moreover, the effectiveness of patient
      education during chronic disease management has already been proved in some studies abroad,
      and the interventional effect of multiple patient education process outweighs that of single
      approach education.

      Thus, we intend to conduct a randomized and controlled study to explore the effect of
      multi-channel intensive patient education on LDL-C target achieving rate and statin adherence
      in patients with ACS in China.

    <description>The Intensive Educational Group will receive 5 visits, including 2 visits via phone contacts. The expected dates for each visit will be stamped on the follow-up brochure for convenience. Patient education in this group includes routine education at discharge; 4 educational brochures, a calendar with health tips, and follow-up brochure with medical expert letter sent to patients at the day for discharge (baseline); and educational short messages through message platform once a week. Dosage and adjustment of statins, and concomitant medications in all the treated patients will be recorded.</description>

    <description>The Control Group will receive 3 visits and receive care as per usual practice by the treating doctor and a follow-up brochure without medical expert letter. Dosage and adjustment of statins, and concomitant medications in all the treated patients will be recorded. Blood lipid panel (4 items), hepato-renal functions, and creatine kinase will be examined; while, Morisky 8-item questionnaire will be used to evaluate medication compliance at outpatient visits. In addition, the occurrence of major cardiovascular events and AE/SAE will be collected during the study.</description>
