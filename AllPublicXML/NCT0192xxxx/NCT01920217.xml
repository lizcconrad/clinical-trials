  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sepsis is a common cause of death in intensive care unit, timely and accurate diagnosis and
      treatment directly affect the survival rate. Single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) was
      promising genetic biomarker for sepsis patients. The present study was designed to screen
      several SNP by whole exome sequencing which evaluate the sepsis related snp site in order to
      be a new target for the treatment of sepsis.

      The study is a non-intervention, prospective observational study. Purpose of this sudy is to
      screening several SNPs by whole exome sequencing which can be used as genetic marker for
      sepsis patients. We will collect whole blood samples from patients with sepsis inRespiratory
      Intensive Care Unit (RICU), the Emergency Intensive Care Unit (EICU), or the Department of
      Surgery's ICU 301 Hospital since January 2013, and then whole exome sequencing was used to
      Screen SNPs which were related to sepsis. Then another 500 sepsis patients and 500 normal
      controls were used to validated the sequencing results.
