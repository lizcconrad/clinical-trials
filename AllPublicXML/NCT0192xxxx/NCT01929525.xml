      Effectiveness of silver nitrate solution in treatment of anal fistula is is aimed to be
      investigated.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The anal fistula is a granulation tissue-lined tract, we thought of a way to ablate this
      granulation tissue using a chemical agent, which would eventually induce healing with
      fibrosis and closure of the tract without any surgical intervention. Aiming to reduce the
      surgery related complications; we investigated the effectiveness of silver nitrate solution
      as a chemical agent in the treatment of anal fistula.
