      Background

      Surgery offers the only potential cure in many patients with primary or metastatic liver
      cancer. Extending the limits and improving safety of liver resection would allow more
      patients to benefit from surgery and to increase their survival. The prerequisite for
      successful and safe liver surgery is the optimal regeneration of the remaining hepatic tissue
      in order to fulfill the metabolic demands of the patient. Liver regeneration depends on a
      correct portal pressure and portal blood flow. In the preliminary results the investigators
      show an elevation of portal pressure post partial hepatectomy in mice. Pharmacologic
      reduction of such elevated portal pressure using terlipressin, a vasopressin agonist, was
      associated with improved liver regeneration.

      Objective

      Surgery offers the only potential cure in many patients with primary or metastatic liver
      cancer. Extending the limits and improving safety of liver resection would allow more
      patients to benefit from surgery and to increase their survival. Liver regeneration depends
      on a correct portal pressure and portal blood flow. Pharmacologic reduction of elevated
      portal pressure using terlipressin, a vasopressin agonist, is potentially associated with
      improved liver regeneration. Aim: To perform a prospective randomized trial comparing
      terlipressin versus placebo in patients undergoing major hepatic resection.
