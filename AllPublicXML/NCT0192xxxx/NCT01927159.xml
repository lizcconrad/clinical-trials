             updated contact information as necessary, and has no current plans to move from the
             study area for the duration of the study

          4. Agrees to avoid elective surgery for the full duration of the study

          5. For female participants: agrees to avoid pregnancy from 21 days prior to Study Day 0

             sterilized and still menstruating or within 1 year of the last menses if menopausal)
             in sexual relationships with men must use an acceptable method of avoiding pregnancy
             during this period. Acceptable methods of avoiding pregnancy include a sterile sexual
             partner, sexual abstinence(not engaging in sexual intercourse), hormonal
             contraceptives (oral, injection, transdermal patch, or implant), vaginal ring,
             intrauterine device (IUD), or the combination of a condom or diaphragm with spermicide
             gel

          6. Has general good health, confirmed by medical history and physical examination

          7. Has body mass index (BMI) between 19 and 33 (weight/height2) by nomogram

          8. Had BCG vaccination at least 5 years ago, documented through medical history or
             presence of scar

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Acute illness at the time of randomization

          2. Oral temperature ≥37.5°C at the time of randomization

          3. Clinically significant abnormal laboratory values for any of the following screening
             laboratory parameters, per local laboratory normal ranges from blood collected within
             30 days prior to Study Day 0 randomization as follows:

               -  hemoglobin, hematocrit, absolute neutrophil count, absolute lymphocyte count, or
                  platelet count below lower limit of normal (LLN)

               -  white blood cell count above upper limit of normal (ULN) or below LLN (i.e., must
                  be within normal limits)

               -  ALT, AST, total bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase, creatinine, or blood urea
                  nitrogen (BUN) above ULN

          4. Evidence of systemic or local disease process on screening urinalysis

          5. Evidence of significant active infection

          6. History of treatment for active or latent tuberculosis or evidence of active
             tuberculosis

          7. Shared a residence within the last year prior to randomization with an individual on
             anti-tuberculosis treatment or with culture or smear positive tuberculosis

          8. History of autoimmune disease or immunosuppression

          9. Used immunosuppressive medication within 42 days before randomization (inhaled and
             topical corticosteroids are permitted)

         10. Received immunoglobulin or blood products within 42 days before randomization

         11. Received any investigational drug therapy or investigational vaccine within 182 days
             before randomization, or planned participation in any other investigational study
             during the study period

         12. Received investigational Mtb vaccine at any time prior to randomization

         13. Received a live vaccine within past 4 weeks or a killed vaccine within past 2 weeks
             prior to randomization.

         14. Unable to discontinue current chronic prescription drug therapy that can be
             hepatotoxic or toxic to the bone marrow or kidneys.

         15. History or laboratory evidence of immunodeficiency state including but not limited to
             any laboratory indication of HIV-1 infection

         16. History of allergic disease or reactions (including allergy to kanamycin-related
             antibiotics, allergic reaction to eggs, and severe eczema), likely to be exacerbated
             by any component of the study vaccine

         17. Previous medical history that may compromise the safety of the participant in the
             study, including but not limited to: severe impairment of pulmonary function from
             pulmonary disease; chronic illness with signs of cardiac or renal failure; suspected
             progressive neurological disease; or uncontrolled epilepsy

         18. Evidence of chronic hepatitis (e.g., hepatitis B surface antigen or hepatitis C
             antibody)

         19. Chronic heavy ethanol intake which, in the opinion of the investigator, may compromise
             the safety of the participant or interfere with the evaluation of the safety of the
             vaccine

         20. Cannabis smoking 3 or more days per week

         21. Positive urine test for illicit drugs (opiates, cocaine, amphetamines)

         22. History or evidence on physical examination of any systemic disease or any acute or
             chronic illness that, in the opinion of the investigator, may interfere with the
             evaluation of the safety or immunogenicity of the vaccine

         23. All female participants: currently pregnant or lactating/nursing; or positive urine
             pregnancy test during screening or on the day of study injection

         24. Received a tuberculin skin test within 3 months (90 days) prior to Study Day 0

         25. Any current medical, psychiatric, occupational, or substance abuse problems that, in
             the opinion of the investigator, will make it unlikely that the participant will
