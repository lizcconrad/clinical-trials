  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of the study is to evaluate the pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of BIIB019
      (Daclizumab High Yield Process; DAC HYP) administered as a single subcutaneous (SC) dose (75
      mg or 150 mg) Japanese and Caucasian adult healthy volunteers. The secondary objective of
      this study in this study population is to assess the safety and tolerability of BIIB019
      administered as a single SC dose (75 mg or 150 mg).
