  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background: Recent studies have demonstrated that even mild stroke survivors experience
      residual damage, which persists and in fact increases in subsequent years. About 45% of
      stroke victims remain with different levels of disability. While studies on cognitive
      impairment and dementia after stroke are receiving increasing clinical attention, the
      underlying pathophysiology is poorly understood. Identifying the mechanisms involved and
      recognizing early biomarkers for individual vulnerability, require a multi-modal approach, as
      the mechanisms involved in cerebrovascular disease and individual trajectories of post-stroke
      recovery may impact upon each other on various levels.

      Aims and Hypothesis: To date there is no single measure that can be used to identify patients
      who are prone to develop cognitive impairment and other disabilities from those with better
      recovery prospects.

      We hypothesize that data based on biochemical, neuroimaging, genetic and psychological
      measures can, in aggregate, serve as better predictors for subsequent disability, cognitive
      and neurological deterioration, and suggest possible interventions.

      Design: The TABASCO (Tel-Aviv Brain Acute Stroke Cohort) study is an ongoing, prospective
      cohort study aim to recruit about approximately 1125 consecutive first-ever mild-moderate
      stroke patients. It is designed to evaluate the association between predefined demographic,
      psychological, inflammatory, biochemical, neuro-imaging and genetic markers, measured during
      the acute phase, and long-term outcome: subsequent cognitive deterioration, vascular events
      (including recurrent strokes), falls, affective changes, functional everyday difficulties and
      mortality.

      Discussion: This study is an attempt to comprehensively investigate the long term outcome of
      mild-moderate strokes. Its prospective design will provide quantitative data on stroke
      recurrence, the incidence of other vascular events and the evaluation of cognitive, affective
      and functional decline. Identifying the factors associated with post stroke cognitive and
      functional decline could potentially yield more effective therapeutic approaches.

      We believe that an extensive approach of analyzing the interaction between different risk
      factors would more accurately predict neurological deterioration.

      The primary aim of the TABASCO study is to identify predictors of post stroke cognitive
      decline. A particular focus will be on inflammatory and stress markers, as well as
      neuroimaging measures.

      Eligibility

      Participants are recruited from patients admitted to the Department of Emergency Medicine at
      the Tel-Aviv Sourasky Medical Center (TASMC) within 72 hours of their first-ever acute
      ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA) symptoms onset.

      Criteria

      Inclusion Criteria:

        1. Age ≥ 50 years

        2. Israeli residents

        3. Acute stroke that occurred within the last 3 days as defined by:

           acute focal neurological deficit

        4. Written informed consent by patient prior to study participation

        5. Willingness to participate in follow-up

      Exclusion Criteria:

      patients presenting with a primary hemorrhagic stroke (intracerebral or subarachnoid)

        1. history of any preceding cerebral vascular event (excluding TIA)

        2. imminent death or unconscious state

        3. patients unlikely to be released from hospital following the qualifying stroke, or have
           a severe disability after the qualifying stroke which makes follow-up unlikely

        4. known malignant disease or other chronic disease with poor prognosis (predicted survival
           less than two-years)

        5. stroke resulting from trauma or invasive procedure

        6. patients with a prestroke history consistent with dementia

        7. severe aphasia.

      Stroke diagnosis is verified by senior vascular neurologists and baseline demographic and
      clinical data are collected. Interviews are conducted by trained interviewers at baseline, 3,
      6, 12 and 18 months, and yearly thereafter up to 10 years.

      Assessments and data collection A senior vascular neurologist conducts a thorough physical
      examination and reviews the imaging data and medical records of potential participants to
      determine eligibility. Participants are asked to consent for all study examinations and a
      signed informed consent is obtained from patients who agree.

      Information is collected for the evaluation of co morbidities at the time of recruitment and
      throughout the study.

      All subjects are prospectively followed at three-, six-, 12 and 18 months from stroke onset
      and annually thereafter. Approximately three-months after stroke, consenting participants are
      visited at home by trained occupational therapists.

      For subjects who died, the date of death is recorded along with its cause, based on
      information obtained from the family, medical records, death certificates and data from the
      government's official civil registry.

      Sample size In an attempt to identify a 40% difference in post stroke cognitive decline, we
      have calculated the required sample size (Ben Assayag E et al,International Journal of
      Stroke,Vol 7, June 2012, 341-347).

      We aim to recruit at least 1125 participants to allow for loss to follow-up, potential
      clustering effects, missing data and to provide sufficient numbers for multivariate modeling.
