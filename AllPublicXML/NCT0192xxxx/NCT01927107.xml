  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The global obesity epidemic presents an unprecedented challenge to the public health
      worldwide. The factors associated with obesity are complex, and include health behaviors,
      such as eating habits and daily physical activity, and broader social, environmental and
      biological determinants that influence these health behaviors. The intestinal microbiota has
      several beneficial functions related to host health and accumulating evidence indicates that
      the gut microbiota plays a significant role in the development of obesity, obesity-associated
      inflammation and insulin resistance. Experimental studies reveal a shift in the abundance of
      Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes. Presumably, obesity affects the diversity of the gut microbiota
      and, probably, the way individuals harvest energy from nutrients. Differences in community
      composition, functional genes and metabolic activities of the gut microbiota appear to
      distinguish lean vs obese individuals, suggesting that gut 'dysbiosis' contributes to the
      development of obesity and/or its complications.

      Recent studies have suggested some beneficial effects of probiotics and/or prebiotics on
      obesity and metabolic syndrome in adults; such experience is limited in children and
      adolescents. The aim of this study was to evaluate potential effects of add-on probiotics to
      standard therapy on anthropometric measurements, lipid profile and oxidative stress
      parameters in children.
