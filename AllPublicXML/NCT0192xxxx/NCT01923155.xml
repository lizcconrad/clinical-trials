  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There is no theoretical or practical reason why non-medical personnel such as nurses could
      not be trained to perform diagnostic colonoscopy with comparable proficiency as medical
      endoscopists. Nurse endoscopists have been widely accepted in the United Kingdom for the past
      15 years as a valuable resource to cope with the increasing demand for endoscopic service, in
      particular diagnostic colonoscopy for colorectal screening. A pilot study performed in Hong
      Kong in 2008 has shown that endoscopy nurses can be trained to perform diagnostic endoscopy
      safely and reliably. This study aims to demonstrate that properly trained nurse endoscopists
      have a comparable proficiency in performing colonoscopy procedures as their medical
      counterparts.
