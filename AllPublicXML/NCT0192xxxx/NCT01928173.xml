    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test the effectiveness of a 1-session abbreviated
      cognitive-behavior therapy for insomnia among college students. The investigators will
      examine the following hypotheses in the present study: 1) Viewing the treatment video will
      produce an increment in sleep knowledge relative to baseline and minimum treatment control;
      and 2) Viewing the treatment video will result in improved sleep relative to baseline and
      minimum treatment control.

      Students who self-identify as having insomnia will be recruited from the University of
      Alabama's Psychology subject pool. Students who enroll in the study will receive a link to
      the demographic and screening questionnaire. Individuals who have a history of other sleep
      disorders or who currently present with symptoms strongly suggestive of sleep disorders, such
      as obstructive sleep apnea or narcolepsy will be excluded. Individuals who are shift-workers
      and those with a history of severe mental illness will also be excluded.

      Participants who meet criteria for this study will then be directed to complete a measure of
      sleep knowledge. Once they have completed the measure of sleep knowledge, they will be
      directed to complete the Consensus Sleep Diary (CSD) for 14 days as soon as possible after
      awakening in the morning. During the second week of completing the CSD, participants will be
      directed to complete the Insomnia Severity Index and the Patient-Reported Outcomes
      Measurement Information System Sleep Disturbance and Sleep-Related Impairments Short Forms on
      the last day they complete a CSD.

      Participants will be randomized to a treatment group or a minimum treatment control group
      upon completion of these baseline measures. Those in the treatment group will be emailed the
      following components of the insomnia treatment: a link to the treatment video, an mp3 file
      with a relaxation recording, and a pdf file of a brochure reviewing the information presented
      in the treatment video. Participants will be asked to view the treatment video and begin
      practicing the relaxation technique presented in the mp3 file as soon as possible.
      Participants in the minimum treatment control group will receive a link to a sleep education
      video.

      Two weeks after participants have viewed the videos, they will be asked to complete
      post-treatment measures in the same sequence as they did at baseline. One month after the
      post-treatment measures have been completed, both groups will be asked to complete the same
      measures again for follow-up.
