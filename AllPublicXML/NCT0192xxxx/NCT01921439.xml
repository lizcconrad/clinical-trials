  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The long-term goal is to improve the quality of life of children and their parents who smoke
      tobacco by facilitating parental smoking cessation in a way that is easy to administer yet
      effective. We aim to accomplish this goal by administering an interactive computer-based
      program that will facilitate motivation and readiness to engage in smoking cessation by
      providing personalized feedback about the financial and health effects of the parent's
      smoking. We will compare the changes in motivation and readiness to quit smoking after the
      parent has taken the computer-based program and compare them to the changes in motivation and
      readiness to quit in parents who receive only information about the Oklahoma Tobacco
      Helpline. We will also measure salivary cotinine levels in both parents and children, to
      objectively measure changes in smoking habits and secondhand smoke exposure. Our hypothesis
      is that our computer-based program will cause a greater increase in motivation and confidence
      to quit smoking in the group that receives the customized feedback than the group that
      receives only information about the Tobacco Helpline. We also predict that both parent and
      child cotinine levels will show a greater decrease in the group randomized to receive
      personalized feedback.
