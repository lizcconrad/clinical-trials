  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients's demographics and perioperative factors affect the occurrence of hypotensive
      bradycardic events in the patients undergoing arthroscopic shoulder surgery in the sitting
      position under interscalene block.

      Patients' age, Side of the block,Horner's syndrome, the degree of blockade, preoperative
      fasting time and fluid administration volume, waiting time for sitting position after the
      block, intraoperative use of opioids and antihypertensives, and change of heart rate
      variability before the block and after sitting position affect the occurrence of hypotensive
      bradycardic events in the patients undergoing arthroscopic shoulder surgery in the sitting
      position under interscalene block.

    <description>The participants are assigned to hypotensive bradycardic event (HBE) group when they experience signs or symptoms associated with syncope, hypotension, or bradycardia, which are treated with vasopressors or inotropics following sitting position after interscalene brachial plexus block is done. Otherwise, they are assigned to non-HBE group.</description>

    <intervention_name>Interscalene brachial plexus block</intervention_name>
    <description>After sterile draping around interscalene groove with povidone, a nerve stimulating needle connected to a nerve stimulator is inserted through the interscalene groove. Following involuntary contraction of shoulder, arm, forearm, or hand muscles with 0.5 milliamperes at 1 Hz using the nerve stimulator, 30 to 40 ml of mixture of 1% mepivacaine 20 ml and 0.75% ropivacaine 20 ml are injected.</description>
