    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and immune response to two different HIV
      vaccine regimens in healthy, HIV-uninfected people in the United States and South Africa.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the safety, tolerability, and immune response to two different
      vaccine schedules of a prime with either DNA HIV vaccine (DNA-HIV-PT123), or NYVAC HIV
      vaccine (NYVAC-HIV-PT1 and NYVAC-HIV-PT4) followed by a boost combination of NYVAC HIV
      vaccine (PT1 &amp; PT4) and AIDSVAX B/E. Study researchers will also evaluate whether body mass
      index (BMI) and/or sex impact the immunogenicity of the vaccine regimens in participants from
      South Africa, and look at regional differences in immunologic responses between United States
      and South African participants.

      The study will enroll 264 healthy, HIV-uninfected people, ages 18-50, in the United States
      and South Africa.

      Participants will be randomly assigned to one of three groups and receive either one of the
      vaccine regimens or placebo. Participants will receive injections according to their assigned
      group schedule at study entry (Month 0) and Months 1, 3, and 6.

      Participants will remain in the clinic for 30 minutes after receiving the vaccines for
      observation and monitoring. For 7 days after receiving the vaccines, participants will record
      their symptoms and report them to study researchers.

      Study visits will occur at study entry, and Months 1, 1.5, 3, 3.5, 6, 6.5, 9, and 12. All
      study visits will include a physical examination, HIV risk reduction counseling, and
      interviews and/or questionnaires. Select study visits will include urine collection, an
      electrocardiogram (ECG), blood collection, a pregnancy test for female participants, and HIV
      testing. At some visits, some participants may also provide samples of cervical fluid, rectal
      fluid, and/or semen. Study researchers will contact participants by telephone or e-mail once
      a year for 3 years following the first vaccination for follow-up health monitoring.
