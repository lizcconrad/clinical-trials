  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is a randomised comparison of recanalisation of chronic occluded coronary arteries
      with implantation of Sirolimus eluting stents and medical therapy. Myocardial function and
      scar-size are determinated by using magnetic resonance imaging. The study hypothesis is the
      superiority of medical therapy over revascularisation.

    <textblock>
      In the REVASC-study recovery of left ventricular function after recanalization of chronic
      total coronary occlusions (CTO) and implantation of sirolimus-eluting stents will be examined
      and compared to medical treatment. Extent of the scar, viable myocardium in the infarct zone
      and regional left ventricular function will be assessed by cardiac magnetic resonance.
      Patients with regional systolic left ventricular dysfunction of any degree in the supply
      territory of the CTO vessel will be randomized to either recanalization of the occluded
      coronary artery or to conservative therapy. It is of interest whether CTO patients will have
      an improvement in left ventricular function after late coronary reopening, regarding the high
      technical demands and costs of CTO recanalization.
