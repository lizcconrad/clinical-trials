      To measure Axonal Injury in children with mild traumatic brain injury enrolled in an
      Emergency Department using Diffusion Tensor Imaging, a type of MRI and biomarkers.

      Objective: To determine if children with mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) have acute axonal
      injury defined by disruption of diffusion of water in white matter using diffusion tensor
      imaging (DTI) as compared to orthopedic injury (OI) controls.

      Methods: Children ages 11-16 years who presented within 6 hours of either a mTBI or an
      isolated OI were recruited from the emergency department (ED). Patients had Diffusion Tensor
      Imaging (DTI) study performed within 96 hours of injury. Voxel based analysis approach was
      used to quantify the group differences for common DTI measures. In the ED and at the time of
      the scan, symptom burden was measured using the post concussion symptom scale.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        mTBI group: Inclusion: Children between the ages of &gt;11 to &lt; 16 years who present within 6
        hours of injury with a witnessed head injury. A patient may have a self-reported injury to
        the head but there must also be evidence of head trauma on exam to be eligible for the
        study. Subjects must meet the clinical definition of mTBI from the American Congress of
        Rehabilitation Medicine122: A blow to the head or acceleration/deceleration movement of the
        head resulting in one or more of the following: i. loss of consciousness &lt;30 minutes, ii.
        amnesia &lt;24 hours, iii. any alteration in mental state at the time of the injury. Subjects
        without witnessed LOC/amnesia but with demonstrable amnesia in the ED are eligible. Subject
        must have GCS of 13-15 at the time of arrival in the ED. Subject may be enrolled prior to
        CT (if completed). Subjects should only have up to 1 other minor extracranial injury
        defined by an Abbreviated Injury Severity Scale &lt; 1 to that region (AIS; American
        Association for Automotive Medicine, 1990). Subjects will be included if they have multiple
        injuries that affect only 1 body system as noted in the AIS (ie, subjects who sustain skin
        abrasions to more than 1 body region as a result of injury but do not meet exclusion based
        on injury severity) Subjects and their families must be able to speak and read English.
        Subjects must agree to have blood drawn in the ED, and to return three times as an
        outpatient for repeat testing. Subjects are still eligible if they are admitted to the
        hospital. Subjects must have a score of less than 65 on the CBCL to be included in the
        study to limit possible co-morbidities. Children with a diagnosis of Attention Deficit /
        Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) will be included as long as they meet the following criteria:
        physician diagnosed, controlled by only one ADHD medication, and have a T-score of less
        than 50 on the DSM Oriented Scale for Attention Deficit / Hyperactivity Disorder
        (Sub-Category of CBCL).

        Orthopedic Injury Control Group:

        Subjects with isolated extremity trauma requiring radiography and an Abbreviated Injury
        Scale (AIS) of &lt; 3 (AIS; American Association for Automotive Medicine, 1990)123 will be
        included in the study. The presence of a fracture on the x-ray is not a requirement for
        inclusion. Subjects can not require immediate surgery for care. We will attempt to match
        based on gender and age (+/- 365 days within the included age range 11-16); yet, we will
        enroll consecutive eligible patients meeting inclusion/exclusion criteria.Subjects must not
        have any evidence of head trauma / facial trauma or symptoms of concussion (such as LOC,
        amnesia, confusion). This information must be corroborated with a reliable witness or the
        parent and the treating physician. Subjects must have normal neurologic exams and must not
        require a head CT as a part of the clinical care. Subjects may be prescribed narcotics
        and/or opiates prescribed for pain in the ED will be allowed IF the subject agrees to
        refrain from taking the medication for at least 4 hours prior to completing the
        neurobehavioral testing at follow-up. Subjects must meet the same CBCL score and ADHD
        definition as listed in the mTBI group.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        mTBI Group: Exclusion Criteria: Children &lt;11 or &gt;16 years old and subjects and/or the
        families do not speak and read English will be excluded. Subjects with a score of 65 or
        more on the CBCL will be excluded due to probable pre-existing impairment. Any subject who
        has an altered mental status due to the ingestion of substances of abuse or alcohol or who
        are prescribed a drug that impairs cognition (e.g., benzodiazepines, antipsychotics, or
        opiates such as those listed (but not limited to) in Appendix L). Subjects will be excluded
        if they have a prior history of concussion, pre-existing neurologic impairment (stroke,
        prior TBI requiring ED visit or hospitalization, CSF shunt, brain tumor), pre-existing
        cognitive disorders (seizure disorder, mental retardation), psychological problems or
        developmental delay. Subjects with the following illnesses will also be excluded: bleeding
        or coagulation disorders, cancer (who are currently undergoing treatment), HIV/AIDS,
        schizophrenia, multiple sclerosis, cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with
        subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy (CADASIL), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis
        (ALS), Alzheimer's Disease, Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease, and Krabbe Disease. Subjects will be
        excluded if they have the diagnosis of ADHD and require 2 or more medications for control
        or they have a T-score of 50 or greater on the DSM Oriented Scale for Attention Deficit /
        Hyperactivity Disorder. Subjects will be excluded if they are on any medication typically
        prescribed for ADHD but do not carry the diagnosis of ADHD. Subjects will be excluded if
        they have any condition that precluded them from undergoing magnetic resonance imaging as
        detailed in Appendix L. These include having an implanted medical devices (i.e., cardiac
        pace maker, hearing aid, or other implant); having metal in the body that does not meet
        criteria for MRI machines (i.e. braces, plates, screws; since some types of metal are not
        responsive to the magnet and are permitted, the eligibility for MRI will be investigated in
        each such case to ensure safety); having non-removable jewelry or body piercing; pregnancy;
        known claustrophobia; extreme obesity (due to physical limitation of the magnet). Subjects
        with one extracranial (organ group) injury with an AIS score of &gt; 2 or 2 or more
        extracranial (i.e. 2 or more organ groups) injuries will be excluded, those with multiple
        injuries to one organ group (ie, skin abrasion on more than 1 extremity) will still be
        eligible.

        Orthopedic Injury Control Group:

        Subjects who present with an orthopedic injury, as well as head trauma or signs or symptoms
        of mTBI will be excluded. Subjects who do not have a reliable witness to determine that
        there was no loss of consciousness, amnesia, or confusion related to the injury will be
        excluded. Subjects who are enrolled then subsequently receive a Head CT will have
        enrollment discontinued. Subjects who are prescribed a drug that impairs cognition (e.g.,
        benzodiazepines, antipsychotics, opiates) will be excluded. Any inability or unwillingness
        to complete study procedures including follow up procedures will be excluded. Subjects will
        not be eligible to serve as controls if they cannot use a computer mouse due to their
        injury. Patients must not have any of the other exclusion criteria listed for the mTBI
        group (ie, CBCL scores, ADHD diagnosis, pre-existing conditions,MRI Contraindications)
