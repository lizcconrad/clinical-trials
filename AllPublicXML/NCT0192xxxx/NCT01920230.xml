  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to examine the effectiveness of intervention based on mindfulness
      and acceptance-commitment therapy (ACT) in the recovery from job burnout. The 8-week
      intervention is delivered using jointly face-to-face group meetings and web-based program.
      The study hypothesizes that the Muupu-program is more effective than the normal practices
      when promoting work well-being in Finland. The participants are recruited from Finland.

      Mindfulness-ACT-based interventions aren't widely used in Finnish work health care a the
      moment. This study examines the possibility of using this kind of intervention for reducing
      job burnout and stress and also promoting well-being at work. Muupu-program is standardized
      and can be administered in varying settings. If intervention is effective, it can have an
      impact on Finnish practices when treating job burnout and work-related stress.

    <description>Half of the participants (n=109) is assigned to intervention group. The intervention is based on Mindfulness-program presented by Williams &amp; Penman (2011) and on principles of acceptance-commitment therapy (ACT). It aims to increase mindfulness skills and psychological flexibility through different exercises that are developed for improving skills of being present, dealing with thoughts and feelings as well as support clarifying individual values and value-based actions. The basic principles are presented in weekly small group meetings. Participants are guided to deepen their experiences through exercises and information that is provided via specific web-site.</description>
