      The investigators propose an innovative new model of care in which patients identified to be
      at high risk of hospitalization are offered care by a physician who will direct their care
      both in the hospital and in clinic but is able to do so because they see patients only at
      high risk of hospitalization. This allows these physicians to have a panel of patients that
      is small enough that they can provide them with continuing ambulatory care but sick enough
      for those physicians to have enough of their patients hospitalized at any time to justify
      having the physician spend several hours each morning seeing those patients in the hospital,
      making the model economically viable and clinically valuable for the patient. The
      investigators estimate that each of the 5 physicians the investigators propose to establish
      in this model will serve a panel of about 200 patients in steady state with an average of 10
      days of expected hospitalization and $75,000 each in Medicare spending per year, totaling $75
      million annually. The investigators estimate that a 1% reduction in costs for these patients
      will be more than enough to cover the ongoing costs of the model the investigators propose;
      this is because the investigators' program reorganizes care rather than adding new forms of
      care.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators' project has 5 aims:

      Aim 1: To implement an innovative Comprehensive Care Physician (CCP) Model of
      multi-disciplinary team-based care at the University of Chicago Medical Center (UCMC) in
      which care for patients at high risk of hospitalization is led by CCPs who focus their
      practices on patients at high risk of hospitalization so that they can personally care for
      these patients both in clinic and in the hospital, with savings to Medicare shared with the
      AMC.

      As noted above and supported by theory and data below, the key justification for this goal is
      based on the value of the doctor-patient relationship. Building on 15 years experience
      developing our hospitalist program (IRB protocol 9967) from 2 to 30 clinicians, the
      investigators provide detailed plans to efficiently implement the investigators' model to
      improve care within 6 months. To incentivize and assess cost-savings, the investigators
      propose:

      Aim 2: Among patients who meet clinical eligibility criteria for the CCP model and express
      willingness to receive care in the model, to assess the utilization and quality of health
      care, health outcomes, and cost of care of patients randomly assigned to be offered CCP care
      compared to patients randomly assigned not to be offered CCP care.

      Evaluation is important in the investigators' project both to ensure that the investigators
      meet the triple-aim and because assessment of cost savings is needed to implement the shared
      savings model that the investigators think is important to incentivize cost savings. The
      investigators recognize that the use of randomization to assess out-comes cannot be the basis
      for a long-term payment model in Medicare but select this approach to evaluation because the
      investigators think it will provide the most accurate estimate of the effects of the program.
      Assuming capitated payments to Accountable Care Organizations (ACOs) become a major payment
      approach for Medicare, cost savings from CCPs would create sustainable incentives for their
      use. CCPs might also work well in ACOs because selection of high risk patients into a CCP
      program might not be a concern if those patient came from within the ACO's covered
      population. Sustained incentives to use CCPs could also exist if high-risk persons selected
      into ACOs with CCPs, but risk adjustment was adequate. Shared savings programs with adequate
      risk adjustment would produce similar incentives. To address dissemination and risk
      adjustment, the investigators propose:

      Aim 3: To use data collected by UHC from 4 Chicago-area AMCs with linked Medicare data to
      support evaluation and potential local and national dissemination of the CCP model

      UHC (previously University HealthSystem Consortium) includes over 100 AMCs nation-wide and
      has exceptional data on hospital resource use to support risk-adjustment. UHC also houses
      laboratory and Medicare data to enhance risk-adjustment and outcomes assessment. The
      investigators will use this data to inform potential local dissemination and testing of our
      model by helping the other participating Chicago-area AMCs identify the segments of their
      patient populations that are frequently admitted enough to be suitable for the CCP model. If
      the model is successful at UCMC, and perhaps in later local dissemination and evaluation,
      UHC's national scope creates opportunities for dissemination of the investigators' work to
      almost all US AMCs. The risk-adjustment data will also allow us to evaluate alternative
      strategies to assess program savings to estimate shared savings that do not require
      randomization. Thus the investigators propose:

      Aim 4: To compare the results obtained in Aim 2 to three alternative assessment strategies
      that: 1) compare patients in UCMC treated in the CCP model to patients in UCMC who meet CCP
      clinical eligibility criteria but receive usual care, 2) compare patients in UCMC who meet
      CCP clinical eligibility criteria to historical patients in UCMC who met CCP clinical
      eligibility criteria, 3) compare patients in UCMC eligible for the CCP model to current
      patients in 4 other Chicago-area AMCs who meet CCP clinical eligibility criteria.

      The investigators propose to evaluate these alternative approaches for selection of a control
      group because the investigators think they might be feasible approaches to estimate savings
      in a shared-savings model and because they differ in potential threats to validity (e.g., 1
      must address patient selection into the intervention and 2 must address time trends in
      costs), outcomes assessment (patient outcomes will be harder to assess in 2 and 3), and
      generalizability (1 requires local patients treated outside the model and 2 requires
      historical data, which becomes less relevant over time). All models will be adjusted with the
      CMS-Hierarchical Condition Category (HCC) risk adjustment model for our base analysis but the
      investigators will also explore other approaches to risk adjustment, such as using prior year
      total Medicare expenditures and patient-reported variables as risk adjusters. The
      investigators propose to use our randomized control group for our shared savings incentive,
      but to work with CMMI in our cooperative agreement to assess how these control groups and
      approaches to risk adjustment could be used in shared savings incentives. Patient-reported
      outcomes will be assessed from enrolled subjects. Finally, since workforce development is key
      to implementing and disseminating this model, the investigators propose:

      Aim 5: To develop skills of a multidisciplinary team of providers to execute the CCP model,
      and expose medical students, residents and fellows, and other health professions trainees to
      the model.

      Because the investigators are an AMC with a rich pipeline of health professions trainees and
      excellent record of training national leaders, the investigators are excellently situated to
      train clinicians in the investigators' model who have the potential to help disseminate its
      core principles both locally and nationally.

    <description>Following Donabedian's framework, we will first assess the extent to which care is structured with integrity to the CCP model using a primary measure of what fraction of a patient's clinic and hospital encounters are provided by their CCP. Care utilization will be measured using Medicare claims data obtained from RESDAC to examine all care that charged to Medicare, including use of acute care hospitals, physician services, SNF, home health, hospice, etc., and Part D. We are experienced working with these raw claim files for research. We will also link to data from Illinois Medicaid for our dual eligibles. For utilization in the hospital (e.g., ICU days or ICU days in terminal hospitalization), we will use UHC data.</description>

    <description>Provider outcomes are also important. We have surveyed attending physician about job satisfaction for 15 years with multiple domains including satisfaction with ability to provide high quality care, efficient care, relationships with patients, relationships with providers, etc., and will continue these annually for all our attendings and for our CCPs. However, with only 5 CCPs, qualitative reports will be most valuable so we will interview them quarterly, transcribing comments for formal qualitative analysis. Given the tiny number of CCPs, all CCPs will be allowed to review resulting manuscripts before submission and redact elements as they feel appropriate, either out of personal interest or belief that a clinical reference might be identified with a specific patient.</description>

    <description>Patients will receive comprehensive medical care from their CCP in clinic and the hospital. For most patients, the ambulatory care provided by the CCP will be in our onsite medicine clinic, but for some patients with subspecialty needs the CCP may be a specialist who will care for the patient in a nearby ambulatory setting (e.g., nursing home, dialysis facility). The CCPs will also supervise the nurses, pharmacists, social workers, and others who are part of the multi-disciplinary care team. Daytime inpatient care will be provided by CCPs in conjunction with our inpatient advanced practice nurses (APNs). These APNs now work with our hospitalists, so they are experienced providing hospital care.</description>
