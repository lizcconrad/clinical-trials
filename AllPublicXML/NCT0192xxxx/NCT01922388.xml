  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Although deep brain stimulation of the subthalamic nucleus(STN DBS) has become the surgical
      treatment of choice for Parkinson's disease(PD), a consensus on the timing of surgery is
      lacking. This study is intended to demonstrate that early, compared with delayed,
      introduction of STN DBS is more beneficial for PD patients who have developed motor
      complications.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In this prospective study, 200 PD patients will be recruited for STN DBS over three years,
      including 133 with motor complications existing for more than three years (late complication
      group) and 67 less than three years (early complication group). To make a comparison of
      therapeutic efficacy between the two groups, motor and non-motor symptoms will be assessed
      using specific rating scales and questionnaires. To investigate whether DBS is
      neuroprotective, disease progression will be monitored by PET imaging in a half of each group
      preoperatively and at follow-up. A selective vesicular monoamine transporter 2 (VMAT2)
      tracer, 9-[18F]fluoropropyl-(+)-dihydrotetrabenazine (18F-AV-133) will be used to measure the
      number of dopaminergic neurons.
