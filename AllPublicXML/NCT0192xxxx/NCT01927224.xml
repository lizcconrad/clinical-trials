    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the bioequivalence as well as safety and tolerability of a novel 30
      mg tablet of nifurtimox compared to the corresponding marketed 120 mg tablet in adult
      subjects suffering from chronic Chagas' disease when administered after a high-fat /
      high-calorie test meal. This study is a necessary step for the development of an age
      appropriate pediatric oral dosage form for the treatment of Chagas' disease in endemic
      countries according to the recommendations provided by current international guidelines (EMA
      Guideline on Clinical Development of Medicinal Products, EMA Note for Guidance on Oral Dosage
      Forms).

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Upon consent, women of childbearing potential must use 2 forms of highly effective
             contraception for the duration of the study and for 12 weeks after the last drug
             administration. The definition of highly effective contraception will be left at the
             discretion of the investigator and will be in line with ICH Topic M 3 (R2):
             Non-Clinical Safety Studies for the Conduct of Human Clinical Trials and Marketing
             Authorization for Pharmaceuticals

          -  Male subjects who are sterile, not sexually active or agree to use 2 forms of highly
             effective contraception during the study and for 12 weeks after receiving the study
             drug. The definition of highly effective contraception will be left at the discretion
             of the investigator and will be in line with ICH ICH Topic M 3 (R2): Non-Clinical
             Safety Studies for the Conduct of Human Clinical Trials and Marketing Authorization
             for Pharmaceuticals

          -  Male/female subject diagnosed with chronic Chagas' disease: Previous diagnosis of
             acute or chronic Chagas' disease by a health clinic prior to screening for the study.
             The diagnosis of chronic Chagas' disease may be made by clinical findings, supported
             by antibody titers if available. If there is a known history of acute disease, it is
             preferable to have documentation of parasites on the blood smear if available

          -  Age: 18 to 45 years (inclusive) at the first screening visit

          -  Body mass index (BMI): above/equal 18 and below/equal 29.9 kg / mÂ²

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Incompletely cured pre-existing diseases (except chronic Chagas) for which it can be
             assumed that the absorption, distribution, metabolism, elimination and effects of the
             study drugs will not be normal

          -  Acute Chagas'disease (During the acute phase, the parasite on a blood smear may be
             seen under a microscope. Different antibodies are present, depending on the course of
             the disease)

          -  Known hypersensitivity to the study drugs (active substances or excipients of the
             preparations)

          -  Unstable or uncontrolled medical condition such as hypertension or diabetes;
             decompensated heart failure, gastrointestinal (GI) conditions that would interfere
             with the absorption of the study drug (e.g. GI ulceration, peptic ulceration, GI
             bleeding, gastroesophageal reflux, or other GI disease affecting gastroesophageal
             junction), conditions that could potentially have an impact on drug metabolism ar
             elimination (renal, hepatic such as known hepatic or biliary abnormalities), or any
             clinically relevant active infections in the opinion of the investigator within 4
             weeks before the screening visit e.g. clinically relevant history or presence of
             significant respiratory (e.g., interstitial lung disease), hematological, lymphatic,
             neurological, cardiovascular, psychiatric, musculoskeletal, genitourinary,
             immunological, metabolic (e.g., diabetes), and dermatological or connective tissue
             disease

          -  Use of systemic or topical medicines or substances which oppose the study objectives
             or which might influence them within 4 weeks before the first study drug
             administration, e.g. an investigational drug, any drug altering gastrointestinal
             motility and /or gastric pH (e.g. antacids, anticholinergic, para-sympatholytics), any
             drug known to induce liver enzymes (e.g. dexamethasone, barbiturates, St. John's Wort
             [hypericum perforatum]), any drug known to inhibit liver enzymes (e.g. ketoconazole,
             macrolides)

          -  Clinically relevant findings in the electrocardiogram (ECG) such as a second- or
             third-degree AV block, prolongation of the QRS complex over 120 msec or of the
             QTc-interval over 450 msec

          -  Systolic blood pressure below 100 or above 140 mmHg (after at least 15 min supine)

          -  Diastolic blood pressure below 50 or above 90 mmHg (after at least 15 min supine)

          -  Heart rate below 45 or above 95 beats / min (after at least 15 min supine)

          -  Findings that would exclude the subject in the physician's judgment e.g. enlarged
             liver, irregular heartbeat, undiagnosed acute illness, melanoma
