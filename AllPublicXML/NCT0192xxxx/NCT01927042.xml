  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Family therapy is considered an empirically supported treatment approach for adolescents and
      adults with eating disorders. One family based approach, Expert Carers Helping Others (ECHO)
      is based on evidence that suggests family environment, e.g., carer criticism, can influence
      an individual's eating disorder symptoms. ECHO aims to improve carer coping, reduce expressed
      emotion and manage eating disorder symptoms, and has been associated with reduced carer
      distress, caregiver burden, and an increase in general well being. The current pilot study
      seeks to evaluate a new condensed version of the ECHO intervention that is delivered entirely
      in a 2 Â½ hour self-help DVD format (ECHOs). Sixty patients and their carers will be recruited
      from the Capital Health Eating Disorders Service and randomized into either a treatment as
      usual group (TAU) or a TAU+ECHOs group. Both carers and patients will be assessed along a
      variety of dimensions including psychiatric symptoms, family functioning, and carer and
      patient collaboration, at pre-intervention, four weeks later at post-intervention, and then
      three-months post-intervention. ANOVAs will be used to compare the primary outcomes between
      the two groups over time. This pilot study will be the first evaluation of ECHOs, which may
      ultimately boost the efficacy of current treatment for adults with eating disorders and
      reduce carer distress.
