  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study, the investigators are interested in assessing the effects of the isocaloric
      increase of eating frequency on appetite and metabolism. How the consumption of an isocaloric
      breakfast in four intakes vs. one can modify satiety and appetite control in lean and obese
      subjects through :

        -  the physiological consequences : difference in postprandial kinetics of glucose, non
           esterified fatty acid, triglyceride, the secretion of satiety gut hormone (insulin,
           ghrelin, leptin and cholescystokinine (CCK), peptide YY (PYY), glucagon-like peptide-1
           (GLP-1), nutrients oxidative fate and plasmatic oxidative stress (Malondialdehyde (MDA),
           glutathion, lipid hydroperoxides)

        -  eating behavior during an ad libitum buffet test meal

    <description>The subjects receive the same breakfast with two sequences :
breakfast in one intake at 8:00
breakfast in four isocaloric intakes (8:00, 9:00, 10:00, 11:00) The sequence made twice : one for metabolic study and one for the study of eating behavior
The lunch during metabolic study is a standard meal The lunch during behavioural study is an ad libitum buffet test meal.
The administration order is determined by randomized allocation. The wash-out period is one to three weeks.
There are not diet or exercise interventions.</description>
