  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Consumption of whole grains has been heavily endorsed by both government and major health
      agencies, as evidenced in Health Canada's Food Guide, the US Department of Agriculture's Food
      Pyramid, and the Heart and Stroke Foundation's healthy eating guide. Whole grains have been
      championed for their proposed cardioprotective and weight control effects as suggested by
      epidemiological studies. The health benefits of whole grain products may be attributable to
      their nutrient composition, which contains dietary fibre, protein and several essential
      nutrients. There has also been a concurrent increase in seed consumption. Seeds have a
      similar and potentially superior nutritional composition to whole grains and they are rich in
      mammalian lignans and polyunsaturated fats, especially the highly valued omega-3 fatty acids.
      Preliminary studies on seeds have shown that they impart health benefits similar to those
      imparted by whole grains. Consumer choices regarding seed consumption may be based on their
      potential health benefits. Furthermore, they may also be affected by subjective sensory
      factors, such as appearance, taste and pre-conceived perceptions. Therefore, this study will
      compare the health properties of four seeds and their effects on appetite and sensory
      parameters in healthy individuals. These four seeds will be that of flax, poppy and sesame,
      due to their popularity and consumption as well as Salba, which has also recently received
      much attention for its associated health benefits.
