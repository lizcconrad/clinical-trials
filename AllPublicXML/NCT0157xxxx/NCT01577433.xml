      The purpose of this observational registry is to determine the freedom from driveline (DL)
      infection events in subjects implanted with a HeartMate II LVAD in whom only the silicone
      portion of the DL is externalized resulting in a silicone skin interface (SSI)

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subject has signed the INTERMACS informed consent form

          -  Subject has signed the SSI registry informed consent form

          -  Subject age ≥ 18 years

          -  Subject implanted with a HeartMate II LVAD

          -  Subject in whom the full length of the velour portion of the percutaneous lead is
             fully kept under the skin resulting in a silicone skin interface at the skin exit site

          -  In the prospective study cohort, Subject is planned to be supported with the HeartMate
             II LVAD for at least 12 months

          -  In the retrospective study cohort, at the time of enrollment, Subject has been
             supported with a HeartMate II for at least 10 months

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  In the retrospective study cohort, Subject is ongoing with long-term right heart
             mechanical circulatory support (RVAD)

          -  In the retrospective study cohort, Subject had a post-implant sternal re-entry (for
             bleeding, etc.) or delayed sternal closure

          -  In the retrospective study cohort, Subject is participating in any other clinical
             investigation related to driveline (DL) exit site that could confound the study
             results

          -  In the prospective study cohort, Subject is participating in any other clinical
             investigation related to driveline (DL) exit site that could confound the study
             results
