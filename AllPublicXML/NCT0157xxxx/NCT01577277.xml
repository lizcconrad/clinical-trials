  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The present study is based on cross-sectional data from the baseline investigations carried
      out in OPUS School Meal Study - a randomized crossover study carried out in 9 primary schools
      in Denmark 2011-2012. Approximately 800 Danish school children from 3rd and 4th grades (8-12
      year olds) took part in these baseline investigations of socioeconomic status, pubertal
      status, growth status, learning abilities, well-being, sleep, physical activity and risk
      markers of Cardiovascular Disease (CVD), type II diabetes and osteoporosis.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Metabolic syndrome score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Cross-sectional)</time_frame>
    <description>The metabolic syndrome score is a continuous z-score based on individual z-scores for Waist Circumference (WC), Mean Arterial Pressure (MAP), serum High Density Lipoprotein (HDL), serum Triglyceride (TG) and Homeostasis Model Assessment (HOMA) index. It´s an internal score meaning that the basis for the score is the distribution of values in this study population.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Body composition</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Cross-sectional)</time_frame>
    <description>Body composition will be determined by Dual energy X-ray Absorptiometry (DXA) scanning. The parameters included are total body Fat Free Mass Index (FFMI in kg/m2), total body Fat Mass Index (FMI in kg/m2), total body fat percentage and the ratio between android and gynoid fat mass in kg.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Concentration Performance</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Cross-sectional)</time_frame>
    <description>Concentration Performance is assessed by means of a concentration test called the D2-test of Attention. Concentration Performance is derived from the number of correctly crossed out relevant items minus the errors of commission (confused).</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Fatty acid composition in whole-blood</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (cross-sectional)</time_frame>

  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Body weight, Body Mass Index (BMI)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Cross-sectional)</time_frame>
    <description>Body weight (in kg),BMI, BMI z-score calculated on the basis of the current references from WHO and body weight status (underweight/normal weight/overweight and obese) based on the age and gender specific iso BMI´s defined by Cole et al.
Cole et al. (2000) BMJ 320 (7244): 1240-1243. Cole et al. (2007) BMJ 335 (7612): 194-197.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Physical activity</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Cross-sectional)</time_frame>
    <description>Physical activity is measured using waist-worn ActiGraph GT3X and GT3X+. Outcome measures will be counts/min, time spent in sedentary, light, moderate and vigorous activities. The participant are asked to note down non-wear periods in a logbook - mainly to increase compliance - and to note the amount of bicycling and if the child was sick within the measurement period. Questions regarding TV-watching, playing with videogames and physical activity, will help identify activity-pattern.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Sleep</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Cross-sectional)</time_frame>
    <description>Sleep is measured using ActiGraph GT3X and GT3X+ with the monitor placed on the right hip for all students and on the non-dominant wrist for a sub-sample. Using a sleep diary, total sleep time and sleep quality will be derived from these actigraphy measurements. In addition, the abbreviated version of the Children's Sleep Habits Questionnaire (CSHQ) is used to identify sleep problems.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Cardio-respiratory fitness</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Cross-sectional)</time_frame>

    <description>Dietary intake is measured as micro-and macronutrients as well as food groups (e.g. fish and fruit/vegetables) by means of a 7-day dietary survey, which is a web based recall record method developed especially for children. Families without internet access can use a paper version of a 7-day dietary survey. The meal time perception is measured as well.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Appetite-regulating hormones</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (cross-sectional)</time_frame>
    <description>Leptin and ghrelin. If resources are available at the end of the study period, ghrelin will be separated in acylated and deacylated ghrelin, and both the effect of the intervention on total, acylated, deacylated and the ratio between acylated:deacylated ghrelin will be assessed. If the resources are too tight at the end of the study, only total ghrelin will be used.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
