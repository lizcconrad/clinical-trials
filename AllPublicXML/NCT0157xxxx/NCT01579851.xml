    <textblock>
      Sugammadex is used to reverse of a neuro-muscular block deep. It has been reported that its
      administration could induce signs of recovery despite continuation of anesthetic drugs. The
      goal of the present study is to look is the arte of this event is different according to the
      primary anesthetic agent used.
