  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The EndoStim Stimulation System is an investigational device intended to improve the lower
      esophageal sphincter (LES) resting tone and restore LES function in individuals suffering
      with gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD).

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      EndoStim is developing an investigational medical device specifically designed to deliver
      electrical stimulation to the LES and has completed two clinical feasibility studies using
      the EndoStim stimulation system in fifteen subjects.

      Acute electrical stimulation resulted in significant LES pressure with no adverse effects
      reported.

      Results of these studies are promising and warrant additional clinical study to evaluate the
      effectiveness of EndoStim stimulation system to treat GERD over time.

      In this study, EndoStim proposes using a fully implantable system. Results of this study are
      expected to provide confirmation of safety of long-term LES stimulation and may provide long
      term clinical benefit for GERD patients.

    <description>Safety will be assessed by incidence and severity of adverse events through 12-week (3 month) follow-up. Included in this assessment will be the proportion of subjects with any of the following outcomes between device implant and completion of the Week 12 evaluation: (1) death, or (2) medical morbidity, including myocardial infarction, pneumonia, wound infection, or perforation requiring hospitalization.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Primary Endpoint: Functionality</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>Functionality of the EndoStim system will be assessed by the ability of the device to initiate stimulation as programmed and to accurately detect the patient's posture. Indication of device detection when the patient is lying horizontally and when standing up will be recorded.</description>
