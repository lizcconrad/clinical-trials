      INTRODUCTION

      Osteoarthritis (OA) has a major impact on mobility, disability and loss of productivity of
      patients. Patients can become disabled early in life by OA.(1,2,3) Osteoarthritis is
      primarily a genetic disease but can be triggered by trauma, intra-articular fractures, axis
      deviations and joint overloading, including overweight / obesity.

      Perhaps the most common type of disease is hand OA, as debilitating to the patient as the
      changes generated by rheumatoid arthritis. On the other hand, among the most debilitating, is
      knee OA, that greatly diminish the quality of life of the affected patients. (4) At the Knee
      Surgery Group of Instituto de Ortopedia e Traumatologia do Hospital das Clínicas da Faculdade
      de Medicina da Universidade de São Paulo (IOT-HCFMUSP) - Orthopedics and Trauma Institute of
      University of São Paulo's General Hospital - there is a large number of young adult patients
      who were economically active, until the advent of a joint trauma, which led to early OA.
      There is also a large number of people seeking our group for a Total Knee Arthroplasty (TKA)
      without been offered all non-surgical alternatives of treatment. As there are also patients
      who underwent surgical treatment but suffer from consequences of OA and clinical treatment is
      their current need. These patients do not receive an appropriate OA clinical care.

      Those patients should be reabsorbed by the basic health network. But the patient is returned
      by the social services at IOT-HCFMUSP, because there is no such reference in the Unified
      Health System The OARSI is concerned to publish guidelines with the respective levels of
      evidence on the various forms of treatment of osteoarthritis of the knee and hip. Those
      guidelines show the importance of education, phone calls, non-drug methods such as physical
      therapy, exercise, acupuncture, mind and body therapies, the use of insoles and orthotics,
      canes, crutches and knee pads, and finally the drugs for pain and to slow the progression of
      the disease. (5,6) It is believed that an education program has a positive impact on quality
      of life of patients with OA. In England, the simple delivery of educational material showed
      no different from a course associated with the delivery of educational material. But in
      countries like Sweden, primary care is concerned to give courses on OA. In France, teaching
      about the pathology associated with medical consultation was superior to simple medical
      consultation to improve patients' symptoms and treatment adherence. (6) No paper on only
      telephone follow-up was performed, but the addition of patient care by phone, always shows
      better results than a single intervention. (6) The Osteometabolic Diseases Group of
      IOT-HCFMUSP, initially focused on the care of osteoporosis and other diseases of bone
      metabolism such as thalassemia and osteogenesis imperfecta. More recently took over the care
      and research in the treatment of OA, starting with the knee OA, since it's among the most
      prevalent and debilitating types of OA.(3)

      Obesity and knee OA are the most frequent comorbidities in the elderly in the United States
      (U.S.). Although not presenting the same level of obesity of U.S. patients, our patients with
      OA also are overweight, and often have diabetes and hypertension. Changing the habits of
      those patients is imperative for clinical improvement. Those patients should incorporate
      healthier eating habits as well as daily physical activity. But to change behavior, it is
      necessary:

        -  to perceive the problem as important and serious.

        -  to perceive that behaviour change is beneficial. Patients are more prone to health
           information when it is presented in terms of potential gain (11) and when these gains
           are presented in patients of the same sex and race. (12)

      We have a diverse population of patients with level of education ranging from illiterate
      patients at university level. With this diversity of patients, and a number of patients who
      can easily reach four digits, and the total lack of possibility of referral of patients to
      primary or secondary care in the city of São Paulo, we designed a pilot program in three
      phases:

      Phase 1 - Creation of an educational program consisting of various health professionals so
      that we can educate the patients about OA disease, and their role in treatment. This program
      will be administered in a single day and reviewed / reinforced after an interval of time.
      Half the patients will be monitored monthly by phone when questions specific to each health
      area will be made to participants. This way we will evaluate the strength of the telephone
      follow-up. We're going to create educational printed an audiovisual materials for patients,
      so they can access the information given in the theoretical course at home. Calculation of
      cost-effectiveness and presentation of data to the authorities.

      Phase 2 - If we can demonstrate effectiveness in improving the quality of life of patients,
      we will hold training courses for health professionals from the West Region Project to create
      a system of reference and cross-reference with the primary and secondary care centers.
      Patients who have been through the course and demonstrate improved quality of life, will be
      accompanied closer to their homes in the western region of São Paulo.

      Phase 3 - Expansion to all the city of São Paulo and other cities.

      In this pilot, we focus exclusively on Phase 1.

      The variables that can interfere with patient compliance to the program and, therefore, to
      the final result, are:

        -  Length of Interval between interventions (1, 2 or 3 months)

        -  Phone follow-up or not

        -  Attending the course or just receiving the educational material

      GENERAL OBJECTIVES To assess the improvement of quality of life of patients with
      osteoarthritis exposed to an education program multi-professional and / or telephone
      follow-up.

      Develop knowledge, experience and indicators that support the expansion of the project to:

      West Region Project Municipal Programs, State and National.

      Subprojects:

      Social Work - improving the quality of life by the introduction of leisure Nutrition -
      Decrease in body mass index (BMI) by improving the quality and quantity of diet.

      Physical Therapy - Improves the autonomy, function and pain for the introduction of daily
      exercise habits.

      Occupational Therapy - Improves autonomy, function and pain by improving the ergonomics
      and-administration of daily tasks.

      Physical Education - Improvement of autonomy, function and pain for the introduction of daily
      exercise habits.

      Psychology - Improving quality of life for the patient and behavior change induced by the
      intervention.

      METHODS

      Two hundred and forty patients from the public, healthcare at IOT-HCFMUSP, already identified
      with OA of the knees

      Given the inclusion criteria, patients undergo pre-assessment by the group composed of
      multi-professional teams of physicians, orthopedic surgeons, nutritionists, psychologists,
      physiotherapists, occupational therapists, social worker, and physical educators:

      Orthopedics - We treat patients according to the OARSI guidelines, offering everything at our
      disposal for the treatment of OA at IOT-HCFMUSP. Thus, the orthopedic surgeon:

        1. - request and evaluate exams, and classify the disease by knees x-rays,

        2. - prescribe medications to delay the disease (we work with diacerein in our service),
           analgesics, muscle relaxants, and Non-Steroidal anti-inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs), if
           necessary,

        3. - prescribe orthotics (insoles, knee pads, sticks and crutches, braces);

        4. - will report to Social Security and Departamento de Transportes (DETRAN) - Transports
           Department (this, if the social services confirm the need);

        5. - Apply evaluation questionnaires SF 36, Visual Analog Pain Scale (VAS), Western Ontario
           and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) in the first visit and after six
           months, will make the referral to physiotherapy and physical activity on the network
           offered by the government, refers to acupuncture and / or dry needling physiatry in the
           IOT-FMUSP for cardiac evaluation and clearance for physical activity. Apply the Consent
           Report to patients.

      Each of the professional staff will assess the effects of its intervention in a personalized
      way through a subproject:

      Nutritionist - anthropometric Social Worker - Level of education, autonomy and limited
      mobility to the hospital.

      Psychologist - assess cognitive ability, application of World Health Organization Quality of
      Life (WHOQOL) Physical Therapist - assess range of motion, pain, strength and quality of
      life.

      Occupational Therapy - range of motion and quality of life. Physical Educator - Evaluate the
      physical capacity and prescribe appropriate exercise for the patient.

      The 240 patients will be randomly assigned to 4 groups of 60. 3 groups will be subjected to 2
      interventions, varying the time interval between each intervention: Group 1 to 3 months apart
      Group 2 - 2 months apart Group 3 - 1-month interval

      Group 4 will only receive the printed material.

      Patient Flow

      Interventions take place on Saturdays at IOT-HCFMUSP, using the classrooms and the
      dependencies of physiotherapy. We will have a &quot;home simulation&quot; to teach ergonomics in the
      home. The course will take place between 8:00 and 17:00 hours.
