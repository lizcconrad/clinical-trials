      The purpose of the study is to determine whether patients with pulmonary hypertension (PH)
      have dysynchrony, and if so whether it is electrical or mechanical. Once this has been
      determined, during a catheterization the investigators will test if pacing the heart improves
      blood circulation.

      This is a two part study of ventricular dysynchrony in patients with pulmonary hypertension.
      The first part is an observational study, reviewing routinely obtained clinical information
      (such as echocardiograms) to assess whether patients with pulmonary hypertension have
      electrical or mechanical dysynchrony. If so, we will proceed to the second part of the study
      which will assess whether temporarily pacing the right ventricle, during a clinically
      indicated catheterization can acutely improve hemodynamics. We will also gather control data
      for phase 1 from clinically indicated echos and ECG's in patients with ASD's (RV volume load)
      and in patients who are evaluated for an innocent murmur ( Nl heart). We hope to learn
      whether patients with pulmonary hypertension, and compromised right ventricles have
      electrical and mechanical dysnchrony. If this is true, it is theoretically possible that
      resynchronization (pacing) of the right ventricle could improve hemodynamics, symptoms and
      long term outcomes.

    <description>The second part of the study will include patients with pulmonary hypertension &gt;5 who are scheduled for a cardiac catheterization for clinical reasons. We will at the conclusion of the routine catheterization, place two pacing catheters within the right atrium and right ventricle and pace the heart at a rate approximately 10% higher than sinus rhythm for 5 minutes. We will then measure dP/dT max in the ventricles, blood pressure and cardiac output using a Fick equation to assess hemodynamics. We will repeat this 3 times using different sites in the right ventricle while simultaneously obtaining echoes to assess mechanical synchrony.</description>
