    <textblock>
      Circulating tumor cells (CTC) are the subject of increasing interest in clinical oncology as
      a prognostic factor and predictor of therapeutic response. The detection of CTC by
      immunomagnetic method has proved its reliability and its usefulness for monitoring breast
      cancer, colon and prostate in the metastatic and immunomagnetic detection system (CellSearch,
      Veridex LLC) was approved by the FDA in these indications. However, to date there is no
      reliable method to detect CTCs in melanoma (CMC). Studies based on PCR amplification of mRNA
      by reverse specific melanoma is disappointing. Recently, a new detection system of CMC
      immunomagnetic was presented (CellSearch, Veridex LLC, United States). This system has the
      advantage of combining immunomagnetic selection step and a step of identifying by
      immunofluorescence. A preclinical study on serial dilutions of melanoma cells has shown
      encouraging results. The investigators propose a prospective study of the CellSearch system
      in patients with melanoma.

      Primary objective: To determine the effect of treatment on the number of circulating melanoma
      cells in patients with metastatic melanoma.

      Secondary objectives:

        -  determine the percentage of patients with metastatic melanoma with melanoma cells
           circulating

        -  seek a relationship between the number of circulating melanoma cells and prognosis in
           patients with metastatic melanoma

        -  seek a relationship between the change in the number of circulating melanoma cells
           before / after treatment and tumor response in patients with metastatic melanoma
