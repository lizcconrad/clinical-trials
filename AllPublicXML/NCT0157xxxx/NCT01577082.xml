      The purpose of this study is to show the superiority of CHF 1535 (BDP/FF) pMDI over BDP HFA
      pMDI in terms of lung function considering change from baseline to the entire treatment
      period in average pre-dose morning PEF in adult asthmatic patients not adequately controlled
      on high doses of ICS or on medium dose of ICS+LABA.

          -  Patients with persistent asthma not optimally controlled (GINA 2010) on high doses of
