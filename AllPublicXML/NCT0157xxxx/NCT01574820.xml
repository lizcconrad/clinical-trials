  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Objectives:

      The investigators examined whether rosiglitazone, a thiazolidinedione (TZD), is beneficial
      for pre-diabetes mellitus (DM) adults with documented coronary artery disease (CAD).

      Background:

      Microvascular and macrovascular complications are common in type 2 DM. There is no evidence
      about the effects of TZDs, synthetic peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)-Î³
      activators (insulin sensitizers and adipose transcriptional regulation and anti-inflammatory
      process activators) on pre-DM patients with documented CAD.

      Materials and Methods:

      This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study, patients will be randomly
      assigned to the TZD group and to the placebo group with a 6-month treatment period.

      Biomarkers will also examined before and 6 months post-treatment during the trial.

      The primary end-points will be the diagnosis of major cardiovascular events: myocardial
      infarction, overt heart failure, and surgery or coronary intervention for CAD.

    <description>Resistin and adiponectin will be measured to evaluate insulin resistance; CCL/MCP-1 and hsCRP were also analyzed to evaluate inflammation status changes.
Several vascular associated remodeling markers and proteins will also be measured.</description>
