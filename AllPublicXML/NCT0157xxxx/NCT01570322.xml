      Study the factors that explain Health-Related Quality of Life (HRQL) in patients with
      Alzheimer disease including:

        -  The influence of the environment (physical and human) on Health-Related Quality of Life
           (HRQL),

        -  The influence of non-drug and drug treatments on Health-Related Quality of Life (HRQL),

        -  The influence of formal and informal help mobilized,

        -  The influence of interactions &quot;patient - caregiver&quot; on Health-Related Quality of Life
           (HRQL),

        -  The influence of the ratio necessary cost on available resources on Health-Related
           Quality of Life (HRQL)
