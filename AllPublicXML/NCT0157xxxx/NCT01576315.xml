  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Aspergillus infection is an infectious complication which frequently occurs in cystic
      fibrosis. The efficacy of azole therapy in patients with cystic fibrosis with persistent
      positive sputums for Aspergillus is still unknown. Furthermore, the efficacy of itraconazole
      and voriconazole in this indication has never been evaluated in a large prospective
      controlled clinical trial, even though many teams already use it. The ATCF study aims to
      assess in patients with cystic fibrosis with persistent Aspergillus positive cultures the
      efficacy of itraconazole and voriconazole on the negativisation of the sputum cultures for
      Aspergillus.

      Aspergillus infection is an infectious complication which frequently occurs in cystic
      fibrosis. The efficacy of azole therapy in patients with cystic fibrosis with persistent
      positive sputums for Aspergillus is still unknown. Furthermore, the efficacy of itraconazole
      and voriconazole in this indication has never been evaluated in a large prospective
      controlled clinical trial, even though many teams already use it.

      The ATCF study is a prospective, multicenter, randomized, open-label, controlled phase II
      trial, performed in patients with cystic fibrosis with persistent Aspergillus positive
      cultures.

      The primary outcome is to assess the efficacy of itraconazole and voriconazole on the course
      and outcome of the negativisation of the sputum cultures for Aspergillus on two consecutive
      cultures.

      Secondary objectives include the effects of azole therapy on quality of life, FEV1,
      co-prescription of antibiotic and steroids, plasma concentrations of antifungal agents, speed
      of negativisation of sputum culture for Aspergillus, outcome of other diagnostic criteria
      (Aspergillus detection by PCR, precipiting antibodies, total and specific IgE, eosinophilia),
      and the safety profiles of the two products. Mycological failures, and impact of anti-fungal
      treatments on lung and systemic inflammation will also be assessed.
