  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research is to learn more about how children with mental health problems,
      including bipolar disorder (BD), attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and
      generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), differ from children without these problems. The
      investigators want to understand how these 4 groups of children differ in brain activity,
      function, and structure.

      This study has 2 visits (total time ~6 hours):

      Visit #1 (2-3 hours), includes: (a) detailed description of study and study consent, (b)
      interviews about the child's mental health, mood, and behavior, and (c) a screening IQ test
      (word games, playing with blocks).

      If a child fits our study criteria, they will play some special computer games, provide a
      spit sample for DNA, and parents/children will complete questionnaires.

      All children fitting our study criteria, will also be invited to complete visit #2 (2 hours)
      consisting of a special MRI brain scan at Brown University (Providence, RI). To make sure all
      children feel comfortable in the MRI, they will spend time in our practice MRI (i.e., &quot;MRI
      simulator&quot;) that looks and sounds just like the real MRI. During the actual MRI, children
      will play a computerized game in which they can win and lose points. The MRI lasts one and a
      half hours (at most).

      Participants are compensated for their time.

      Spit samples are collected for DNA/RNA extraction.Genetic tests will be performed at the
      Brown University affiliated Molecular Genetics Laboratory located at the Providence VA
      Medical Center. For privacy purposes, all genetic samples will be assigned a study code
      number to ensure that there is no identifiable information with them. After this study is
      over, genetic samples will be disposed.
