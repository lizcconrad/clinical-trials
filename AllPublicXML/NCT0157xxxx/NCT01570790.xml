  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is assess safety, bioactivity, and maximal tolerated dose of
      repeated weekly intravenous infusion of combretastatin A-4 phosphate (CA4P) in patients with
      neovascular age-related macular degeneration
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study is designed as a single escalating dose with cohorts of five subjects. Escalation
      to the next cohort was based on the presence of no more than one subject with a dose limiting
      toxicity (DLT). The first cohort is to receive 27 mg/m2 intravenous infusion of of CA4P,
      36mg/m2 to the second cohort, and 45mg/m2 to the third cohort. CA4P will be infused at
      baseline and every week for a total of 4 doses. Follow up visits will be scheduled at week 8
      and 12.

      Safety data will be collected during the 12-week duration of the study and will be assessed
      using the common terminology criteria of adverse events (CTCAE v3.0). Bioactivity data will
      be assessed by measuring change in best corrected visual acuity, changes in central retinal
      thickness as measured by Optical coherence tomography, and changes in the amount of leakage
      on fluorescein angiography.

      DLTs were defined as specific events that are considered to be probably or definitely related
      to CA4P. Major DLTs included QTc interval ≥ 500 msec (based on measurements provided by the
      core laboratory for ECG analysis), Grade-2 or greater ventricular arrhythmia, unexplained
      syncope, Grade-3 or greater toxicity, delayed recovery postponing re-treatment by &gt;14 days,
      and ocular toxicity such as keratopathy, uveitis, optic neuropathy, and retinopathy, at the
      discretion of the investigator.
