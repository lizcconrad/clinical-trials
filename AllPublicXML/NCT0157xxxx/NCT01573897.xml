  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sleep apnea syndrome (SAS) is a common comorbidity of type 1 and type 2 diabetes. A low
      transcutaneous oxygen tension (PtcO2) measured on the foot is pejorative prognostic factor
      for the healing of a diabetic foot wound. SAS causes intermittent nocturnal hypoxia and
      sympathetic overactivity. The investigators hypothesized that SAS could be a factor reducing
      the PtcO2.Therefore, the main objective of this study is to assess the variation in PtcO2
      between the end of the night and midday in patients with -or at risk of- diabetic foot wound
      according to the presence or not of sleep apnea syndrome.The secondary objective is to
      address the microvascularisation of diabetic patients having foot wounds according to their
      status regarding sleep apnea syndrome.

  <detailed_description>

      The study is observational, cross-sectional. Presence of sleep apnea syndrome will be
      assessed on the same night than the main outcome, that is the difference in PtcO2 between
      5:00 AM and 12:00AM. Microvascularisation will be assessed by Laser Speckle Contrast Imaging
      Analysis (LASCA).

      Sample size is estimated at 60 patients based on previous revascularisation studies having
      PtcO2 as main outcome.

      An intermediary analysis is planned after 40 inclusions.

    <description>Transcutaneous oxygen tension (PtcO2)is measured with a Radiometer TCM4 (Radiometer, Copenhagen, Denmark) device, on the dorsum of the foot at the base of the second metatarsal, or as close to this location as possible. Calibration is performed before each measurement. All measurements are performed in supine position after 20 min of rest. Room temperature is kept constant (around 21°C-24°C). Patients are asked to avoid smoking or drinking coffee for at least 2 h before investigations</description>
