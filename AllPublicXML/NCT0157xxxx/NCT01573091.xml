  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Heart failure is a complex clinical syndrome characterized by a high prevalence and incidence
      in populations at greatest risk and, therefore, with a significant social and economic
      impact. Randomized clinical trials, meta-analyzes, observational studies and controlled
      trials clearly demonstrated that the neuro-hormonal therapy is highly effective in reducing
      mortality, hospitalization and improving quality of life. In recent years the electrical
      therapy is playing an increasingly important role in the treatment of patients with chronic
      heart failure. Such importance is mainly due to the possibility of preventing sudden cardiac
      death by implanting an ICD and to correct the deleterious effects of electrical dyssynchrony
      and / or left ventricular mechanics by CRT. The CRT has proven an effective tool in reducing
      mortality, reducing symptoms and improving quality of life in patients already receiving
      optimal medical therapy. Despite the undoubted benefits that the electrical treatment has
      added to conventional medical therapy, a high percentage of patients does not benefit in
      terms of clinical and echocardiographic. The identification of non-responders to CRT is
      crucial in order not to submit the patients to an unnecessary and costly device whose
      electrical therapy proves to be ineffective. The reason for lack of response is still unclear
      but factors such as lead placement, device-settings and the degree of dyssynchrony before
      implant seems to be important. The purpose of the study is to collect some parameters
      (clinical, electrical, radiographic, echocardiographic and ECG) able to predict response to
      cardiac resynchronization therapy.
