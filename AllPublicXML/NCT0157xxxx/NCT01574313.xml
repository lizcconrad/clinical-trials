  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Stellate ganglion block (SGB) has been the alternative treatment of Meniere's disease for
      years. However, objective evidence of the effect of SGB was still lack. The investigators
      conducted a randomized controlled study to examine the immediate effects of SGB in SP/AP of
      electrocochleography (ECoG).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Ten patients were randomly assigned to receive stellate ganglion block. These ten patients
      made up the experimental group. Another ten patients in the control group were assigned to
      receiving one dosage of oral medications: 0.25mg of erispan@ (fludiazine) , 25mg cephadol@
      (diphenidol), and 200mg kentons@ (tocopherol nicotinate).
