  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether giving the Human Rotavirus Vaccine on
      alternate dosing schedules will enhance the immune response to the vaccine in a low-resource,
      high-burden country in Africa. Alternate dosing schedules studied include giving the 2-dose
      vaccine schedule at a slightly older age and giving an additional dose of the vaccine.

    <description>Anti-rotavirus IgA seroconversion will be defined as the detection of anti-rotavirus IgA antibodies at a concentration ≥20 U/mL post-vaccination in infants seronegative for anti-rotavirus IgA pre-vaccination as measured by Enzyme Immunoassay (EIA).</description>

    <time_frame>4-weeks post-vaccination (All Groups) and 8 weeks post-vaccination (6 &amp; 10 week Group)</time_frame>
    <description>IgA GMTs measured by EIA will be compared post-vaccination between participants receiving Rotarix at 6 and 10 weeks of age and those receiving Rotarix at 6, 10, and 14 weeks of age. For participants in Group 1, where post-vaccination response was measured at both 14 and 18 weeks of age, the highest response between these two visits was used as the final response for comparison.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline, 4-weeks post-vaccination (All Groups) and 8 weeks post-vaccination (6 &amp; 10 week Group)</time_frame>
    <description>The number and percentage of participants demonstrating IgA seroconversion post-vaccination as defined above in infants seronegative for anti-rotavirus IgA pre- vaccination using the EIA assay) by EIA pre- and post-vaccination will be compared between participants in each group who had low as compared to high rotavirus immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibody levels pre-vaccination (i.e., at 6 weeks in Groups 1 and 3 and at 10 weeks in Group 2) as measured by Enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Low and high IgG categories will be determined based on the IgG antibody level distribution.</description>

    <measure>Vaccine-type Rotavirus Shedding in Stool</measure>
    <time_frame>Days 4 and 7 post each study vaccination</time_frame>
    <description>Vaccine-type rotavirus shedding in the stool at 4 (±1 day) and 7 days (±1 day) following each Rotarix vaccination will be identified using EIA for rotavirus antigens and compared to baseline levels obtained just prior to each study vaccination. If shedding in stool is detected at either time point (per manufacturer's specifications) following each Rotarix vaccination, this will be considered evidence of vaccine take.</description>

    <description>Serious adverse events (SAEs) occurring at anytime during the study will be measured as observed by study staff and/or reported by parent at any time. SAEs will be subcategorized according to treatment group as those deemed related to vaccination or not by an independent study monitor.</description>
