  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Although cardiopulmonary bypass (heart-lung machine) is a necessary component of heart
      surgery, it is not without consequences. Cardiopulmonary bypass initiates a potent
      inflammatory response secondary to the body's recognition of the abnormal environment of the
      heart-lung machine. This inflammatory response may lead to poor heart, lung and kidney
      function after the heart surgery. This is turn can lead to longer times on the ventilator
      (breathing machine), the need for higher doses of heart medications, a longer stay in the
      intensive care unit and even death. This is particularly true in infants less than one month
      of age due to their size and the immaturity of their organs. The appreciation of the
      post-cardiopulmonary bypass inflammatory response has resulted in a number of interventions
      directed at its reduction. No therapy has been recognized as the standard of care; however
      steroid therapy has been applied most often despite unclear evidence of a benefit. This study
      aims to determine if steroids improve the outcomes of babies undergoing heart surgery.

    <textblock>
      This study is a multi-institutional randomized double-blind placebo controlled trial of the
      use of glucocorticoids to improve the clinical course of neonates following cardiac surgery.
      Cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) is critical to cardiac surgery, but the pathophysiologic
      processes engendered by CPB play an important role in post-operative recovery. The use, doses
      and schedule of glucocortiocoid administration to ameliorate these CPB induced processes is
      highly variable and without clear data to provide direction. The Primary Aim of this study is
      to compare the effects of intraoperative methylprednisolone to placebo on a composite
      morbidity-mortality outcome following neonatal CPB. Secondary Endpoints include: inotropic
      requirements, incidence of low cardiac output syndrome, fluid balance, ICU stay parameters,
      levels of inflammatory molecules, neuro-developmental outcomes, and safety parameters. The
      study will focus on neonates because their post-CPB clinical course is typically more severe,
      and that high level of severity itself provides a substrate for identifying the positive
      effects of a particular therapy. Finally, a therapy identified as beneficial has the greatest
      potential for benefit in this vulnerable population

    <description>The composite morbidity-mortality outcome will be met if any of the following occur after surgery but before hospital discharge: death, cardiac arrest, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, renal insufficiency (creatinine more than two times normal), hepatic insufficiency (aspartate aminotransferase or alanine aminotransferase more than two times normal), or rising lactic acidosis (&gt;5mmol/L). This outcome was choosen because death rarely occurs in this population. We have found this endpoint to be highly associated with other important clinical outcomes in this population.</description>
