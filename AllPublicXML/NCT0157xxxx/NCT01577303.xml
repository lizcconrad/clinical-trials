  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether different internet-based treatment
      programs, consisting of cognitive bias modification, reduce symptoms of social phobia among a
      population diagnosed with this disorder.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Previous studies have shown that individuals with social phobia have attention biases, often
      focusing on aversive stimuli or avoiding aversive stimuli. Computerized training programs
      have been developed to implicitly direct the users attention towards a neutral,
      non-threatening stimuli. In this study, such a program will be provided to 128 participants
      that meet the diagnostic criteria for social phobia. It will be compared with a program that
      implicitly directs the users' attention towards threatening cues. Pre/post-measurements will
      be compared. Participants will be randomized to one of three groups, receiving one of the two
      variants of the cognitive bias modification program or a control training.

    <time_frame>24 hours</time_frame>
    <description>The Liebowitz Social Anxiety Scale (LSAS) is a questionnaire by psychiatrist and researcher, Michael Liebowitz, whose objective is to assess the range of social interaction and performance situations which patients with social anxiety disorder may fear. It is commonly used to study outcomes in clinical trials. The scale features 24 items, 13 relating to performance anxiety and 11 concerning social situations. It is not intended for use as a self-reporting diagnosis.</description>

    <description>Computerized, internet-based training program for implicit modification of cognitive bias of attention, variant 1. Participant is exposed to two words -- either neutral-negative, neutral-positive, or negative-positive -- for 500ms-1000ms, followed by a probe (&lt; or &gt;) in the previous position of ONE of these words and is then asked to press the corresponding arrow button on a keyboard. A total of 192 word pairs are shown during a session, of one third is the neutral-negative, one third is neutral-positive, and one third is negative-positive. The probe always follows the more positive word.</description>
