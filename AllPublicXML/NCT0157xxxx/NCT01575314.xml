  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare the efficacy and cost difference of using a
      parenchymal stapling device versus hand sewing for a pulmonary lobectomy in patients with
      lung disease (mass or others).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There are many lung diseases that need surgical treatment including malignancy lesion or
      benign lesions such as lung bleb or bullae, lung cyst, benign tumor, infection (necrotizing
      pneumonia, lung abscess, aspergilloma) etc. One of the most common procedure is pulmonary
      lobectomy. The surgical method for dividing parenchyma when performing lobectomy was divided
      in two methods. In the past, the investigators used hand-sewn technique but this procedure
      was time-consuming, high risk of air leakage, infection and re-operation, long length of
      hospital stay and high total cost of treatment. In the present time, the investigators use
      stapling device which has been used worldwide in various field of surgery since 1995. Many
      studies proved that using stapling devices can reduce post-operative complication, length of
      hospital stay and total cost of treatment and also became the standard instrument for lung
      surgery. In Thailand, these devices have been used for at least 5 years but they were not
      included in all of Health Insurance of Thai Government. Many patients had to pay for these
      devices by themselves, approximately 323-484.5 USD. Therefore, the investigators try to prove
      the hypothesis that using stapling devices for lung surgery would reduce the cost of
      treatment, post-operative air leakage, re-operative rate, length of hospital stay and time of
      surgery. The result of this study may effect the decision for including these devices in the
      Health Insurance of Thai Government.

    <description>To compare post-operative air leakage between two groups. This data will be analyzed by fisher exact probability test. We will start observation of the air leakage at postoperative day 1. The stoping role is when statistically significant difference occur. We will measure and report in the number of patients who have post-operative air leakage.</description>

    <description>The cost measurements for each treatment arm focused on the following: 1) direct medical cost (costs of goods and services that are directly provided by the health care system including surgical equipment, drugs and nursing care), 2) direct non-medical cost (costs of goods and services used for health care not directly provided by the heath care system such as transportation, additional meals for patient or their relatives and residence for their relatives),and 3) indirect cost (costs of health care consumption gained as a result of a health care intervention and value of production loss due to illness or treatment such as income lost from sick-leave).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Re-operation due to postoperative air leakage</measure>
    <time_frame>8 month after recording data</time_frame>
    <description>To compare the re-operation due to air leakage between two groups. This data will be analyzed by fisher exact probability test. We will record the re-operation due to air leakage. The stopping role is when statistically significant difference occur. In general, we accepted re-operation for air leakage especially patients who have chronic lung disease (COPD), the rate of re-operation that we can accept approximately 20-30 percent We will measure and report in the number of patients who have to perform re-operation due to post-operative air leakage.</description>

We will measure and report in the unit of time (days).</description>
