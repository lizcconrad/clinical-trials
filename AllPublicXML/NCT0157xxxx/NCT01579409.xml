  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In France, primary cardiovascular and metabolic prevention is supported by the French
      National Program for Nutrition and Health (PNNS: Programme National Nutrition Santé).

      The investigators made the hypothesis that, independently of other diseases, the non
      adherence in PNNS guidelines would lead to arterial stiffness, endothelial dysfunction,
      change in microcirculation and in cardiac autonomic system. These changes may exist at
      fasting but also be reinforced after a standardised breakfast.

      The investigators aim is to evaluate arterial stiffness, endothelial function,
      microcirculation and cardiac autonomic system according to PNNS status in a case control
      study.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a case / control pilot nested in SU.VI.MAX 2 (SUpplémentation en VItamines et
      Minéraux Anti-oXydants) study. The randomized longitudinal placebo controlled SU.VI.MAX study
      tested the preventive effect of vitamin and antioxidant minerals supplementation on the
      incidence and the mortality from cardiovascular pathologies and cancers. SU.VI.MAX 2 was the
      extension of the previous study and included 7200 subjects for whom food habits were known
      and characterized according to PNNS guidelines (PNNS score).

      The subjects will be pre-selected from the original cohort SU.VI.MAX2 if they have a PNNS
      score in 2007 in the 1-40th or 60-100th percentiles of distribution. If they accept to
      participate, a new PNNS score will be calculated in 2012-2013 and the subjects in the 1-25th
      or 75-100th percentiles will be included and explored during one day of participation.

      Our aim is to evaluate arterial stiffness, endothelial function, microcirculation and cardiac
      autonomic system according to PNNS status in a case control study.

      Our secondary objective is to evaluate the same parameters in the same subjects but after a
      breakfast containing 75 g glucose.

    <description>This is a pilot study. Pulse wave velocity, an index of arterial stiffness, was chosen as the primary endpoint. A total of 47 subjects in each group was necessary to detect a difference between groups of 1m/s in pulse wave velocity (standard deviation of 1.7 m/s) with a statistical power of 80%, at fasting.</description>
