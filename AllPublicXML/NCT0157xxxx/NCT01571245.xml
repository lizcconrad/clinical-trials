    <textblock>
      Objective psychophysiologic reactivity data may be useful for predicting post-traumatic
      stress disorder (PTSD) treatment response. Given the variety of PTSD treatments and the lack
      of a clearly superior treatment, a reliable and valid approach to predicting treatment
      response is needed.

      Specific Aims: 1). Evaluate the clinical utility of psychophysiologic reactivity measures to
      predict overall PTSD symptom response among OEF/OIF/OND (Operation Enduring Freedom/Operation
      Iraqi Freedom/Operation New Dawn) veterans receiving treatment for PTSD. 2). Evaluate the
      clinical utility of psychophysiologic reactivity measures to predict psychosocial functioning
      and health-related quality of life (HRQoL) response among OEF/OIF/OND veterans in treatment
      for PTSD. Exploratory). Develop psychophysiologic, neuropsychological, and/or self-report
      models to predict PTSD symptom response to pharmacotherapy, psychotherapy, and combined
      pharmacotherapy/psychotherapy. The investigators will divide psychophysiologic reactivity
      predictors into two groups: heart rate variability and attentional bias (eye gaze tracking
      and modified Stroop). The investigators will collect observational and longitudinal data from
      a treatment-seeking sample of 50 OEF/OIF/OND veterans with PTSD recruited from the Central
      Arkansas Veterans Healthcare System (CAVHS) Mental Health Clinics.

      All subjects will complete a baseline assessment including self-report data and
      psychophysiologic reactivity measures. Trained research assistants will collect
      psychophysiologic reactivity data. The investigators will collect the 3-month data in-person.
      At 6-months, self-report data will be collected in-person. If study participant is unable to
      complete the 6-month assessment in person the investigators will attempt to collect the
      self-report data by phone. The study instruments have all been previously administered by
      telephone. The project coordinator will schedule and track the participants using the
      telephone. The project coordinator will call participants to remind them about follow-up
      appointments. The consent form will also include the name and phone number of at least one
      contact person.

      Psychophysiologic reactivity measures will be collected first to minimize fatigue. In
      addition, the psychophysiologic reactivity measures are context dependent and the
      investigators do not want the psychophysiologic measures to be primed by symptom reporting.
      Heart rate variability data will be collected at baseline for five minutes prior to other
      testing and then continued during eye gaze tracking and modified Stroop testing.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  OEF/OIF/OND Veterans

          -  Ages 18 to 60 (The investigators chose to limit the recruitment age to 60 because
             heart rate variability decreases dramatically with age and therefore may not
             demonstrate the variability necessary for use in a prediction model.)

          -  Currently in or about to start treatment for deployment-related PTSD at Mental Health
             Clinics

          -  PTSD symptom severity score using the PTSD Checklist-Civilian version of 40 or greater

          -  Able to provide the name and phone number of at least one contact person in case of
             difficulty locating participant for the follow-up assessment.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Current diagnosis of schizophrenia

          -  Daily use of benzodiazepines except as needed for sleep,

          -  Daily use of beta-blockers

          -  Plans to leave the area within 6 months.
