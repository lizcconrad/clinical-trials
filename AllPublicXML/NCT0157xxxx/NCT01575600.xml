  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this randomized clinical trial is to evaluate the interaction of intravenous
      fluid therapy during otorhinolaryngological surgery, on postoperative vomiting. The
      hypothesis is that perioperative supplemental intravenous fluid administration reduces the
      incidence of postoperative vomiting.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Postoperative vomiting is a common complication on pediatric surgery, especially
      otorhinolaryngological surgery. Is one of the main reasons of prolonged hospital stay, and
      also a cause of patient´s discomfort and an increase on hospitalization cost.

      There are studies in adults with inconclusive results related to supplemental fluid therapy
      and decrease of postoperative nausea and vomiting. But, in recent years a study in children
      showed favorable results in strabismus surgery. The foundation of this study consist in that
      hypovolemia may possibly cause a decrease in perfusion causing intestinal hypoxia, which in
      turn increase the incidence of nausea and vomiting. The objective of this study is to observe
      the effect of supplemental fluid therapy on postoperative vomiting on otorhinolaryngological
      surgery.
