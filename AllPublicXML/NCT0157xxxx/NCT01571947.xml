  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There is increasing evidence suggests that elevated levels of postprandial triacylglycerol
      (TAG)-rich lipoproteins may promote the development of cardiovascular diseases (CVD). A
      prolonged and elevated postprandial lipemia is associated with increased risk of CVD by a
      variety of mechanisms such as insulin resistance, inflammation, endothelial dysfunction and
      oxidative stress. However, current evidence on the acute effects of type of fats on
      postprandial insulinaemia, gastrointestinal peptide secretion, inflammatory response, as well
      as satiation are limited and inconsistent, in particular in metabolic syndrome population in
      Asian. Hence, this study aimed to investigate the postprandial effects of high fat meals
      enriched with i) palm olein, ii) high oleic sunflower oil, and iii) high linoleic sunflower
      oil, compared with a low fat/high carbohydrate meal, in 30 subjects with metabolic syndrome.

      A randomized, double-blind, crossover design study was conducted to test the acute effects of
      high fat meals enriched with (1) saturated fatty acids (SFA); (2) monounsaturated fatty acids
      (MUFA); (3) polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) vs. (4) a low fat/high carbohydrate (CARB)
      meal on postprandial insulinaemic, lipaemic and inflammatory responses, as well as
      gastrointestinal peptide secretion and satiation on 30 metabolic syndrome subjects (15 men
      and 15 women). Primary outcome of this study is postprandial changes of C-peptide. Other
      measured outcomes including insulin and glucose responses, lipids, cytokines and
      gastrointestinal peptides. Subjective appetite measurements were taken as exploratory
      outcomes using visual analogue scales.

      Subjects were asked to participate in four postprandial challenges, separated by at least one
      week. On the day preceding the postprandial intervention, subjects were provided a low fat
      meal (&lt; 10 g) to consume as their evening meal. They were required to fast over night after
      10 pm and arrive at the research unit at 7:30 am - 9:00 am the following morning. Fasting
      blood samples were collected and subjects were instructed to consume the allocated test meal
      within 10 minutes. Further venous blood will be collected at regular intervals for up to 6
      hours postprandially. During the 6 hours of the experimental study, the subjects were
      refrained from the consumption of any food or drink except plain water which they will be
      asked to consume at regular intervals (up to 750 mL over the 6 hours).

    <description>Test meals were served in the form of muffin + milkshake. For high fat meals, 55g of test fat will be incorporated in muffins, whereas 22g of fat for low fat or high carbohydrate test meal. During study day, subjects were to consume the allocated test meal within 10 minutes.</description>
