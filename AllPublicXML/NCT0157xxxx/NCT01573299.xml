      Even if it is a daily questioning for the stroke physician, no concrete recommendation exists
      regarding the time-point of the mobilization of stroke patients. In this study, we will
      compare two mobilisation strategies: early versus delayed &quot;verticalisation&quot;. 400 ischemic
      stroke patients will be included in this prospective randomized controlled trial, equally
      distributed in two groups. In the early mobilisation procedure the patient is allowed to go
      and sit outside of the bed the day after the stroke onset, whereas in the other arm, this
      procedure is delayed to the third day after stroke onset. The outcome in both groups will be
      assessed by the modified Rankin Scale at 3 months, which is commonly used in stroke study to
      investigate the functional outcome of the patients.

          -  Persistent neurological impairment at the participated time, related to an ischemic
             stroke defined by a sudden neurological deficit. The neurological deficit must not
             accompany hemorrhage on cerebral tomodensitometry which occurs on the same day or the
             day previous to the participation

          -  Patient hospitalized in Neurology department on the day of the participation

          -  Patient affiliated to the social security

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Malignant cerebral infarction, loss of consciousness, comatose with GCS under 13,
             cerebral herniation, life- threatening infarction.

          -  Minor neurological deficit defined by isolated facial palsy, dysarthria, hemianopia,
             sensitive impairment, or every clinical condition that let the physician thinks that
             the stay in the hospital would be less than 72 hours.

          -  Known intracranial stenosis above 50% linked to the current infarction

          -  History of orthostatic neurological degradation

          -  Vomiting

             onset.

          -  Patient's refusal

          -  Patient under legal protection
