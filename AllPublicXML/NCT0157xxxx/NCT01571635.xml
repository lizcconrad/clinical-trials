    <description>The potential recommended dose (PRD) will be determined following the assessment of efficacy and safety parameters based on the first three doses of Sotatercept administered, up to at least 21 days following the first dose, for all doses evaluated. The PRD of Sotatercept will be defined as the highest dose level at which no more than one out of six subjects experiences a dose-limiting toxicity (DLT). The recommended dose of Sotatercept will be defined based on the review of the efficacy and safety parameters as well as dose modification data. The efficacy parameter is defined as: - for transfusion dependent B-Thalassemia major and intermedia : the reduction of transfusion burden by ≥ 20% compared to the calculated baseline transfusion burden to each subject ; - for non-transfusion dependent B-Thalassemia intermedia subjects : increase in Hgb level by ≥ 1 g/dl compared to the baseline Hgb, sustained for 12 weeks.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Men and women ≥ 18 years of age at the time of signing the informed consent document
             with a diagnosis of β-thalassemia major (including all subtypes) or β-thalassemia
             intermedia.

          2. For transfusion dependent subjects: permanent transfusion dependency is defined as
             requiring packed red blood cells (pRBCs) and iron chelation therapy:

               -  Average transfusion requirement of at least 2 units per 30 days of pRBCs (Gale,
                  2011) confirmed for a minimum of 168 days (six months) immediately preceding
                  enrollment (study Day 1);

               -  No transfusion-free period of more than 45 consecutive days during the 168 days
                  immediately preceding enrollment;

               -  Mean prior transfusion Hgb level is ≤ 10.5 g/dL for 168 days immediately
                  preceding enrollment (study Day 1) and the last pre-transfusion Hgb immediately
                  preceding enrollment (study Day 1) is ≤ 10.5 g/dL.

          3. For non-transfusion dependent subjects: non-transfusion dependency is defined as
             transfusion free, with the exception of ≤ one episode of transfusion in the period of
             a minimum of 168 days immediately preceding enrollment (One episode of transfusion is
             defined as ≤ 4 transfusion units administered, occurring within 168 days immediately
             preceding enrollment due to concurrent illness [e.g. infection], [Guidelines Clin
             Management of Thalassaemia, 2008]).

          4. Performance status: Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) score of 0 to 1.

          5. No concurrent severe hepatic disease:

               -  Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) or alanine aminotransferase (ALT) no greater
                  than 3 x upper limit of normal (ULN);

               -  Albumin ≥ 3 g/dL.

          6. Serum creatinine ≤ 1.5 x ULN and creatinine clearance &gt; 60 mL/min.

          7. Females of childbearing potential (FCBP) participating in the study are to use highly
             effective methods of birth control during study participation and for 112 days
             (approximately five times the mean terminal half-life of sotatercept [23 days] based
             on multiple-dose PK data) following the last dose of sotatercept. FCBP must have a
             negative serum beta-human chorionic gonadotropin (β-HCG) pregnancy test within 3 days
             of sotatercept dosing (study Day 1). Subjects must be counseled concerning measures to
             be used to prevent pregnancy and potential toxicities prior to the first dose of
             sotatercept. A FCBP of childbearing potential is a sexually mature woman who has not
             undergone a hysterectomy or bilateral oophorectomy or who has not been postmenopausal
             for at least 24 consecutive months (ie, who has had menses at some time in the
             preceding 24 months).

          8. Males must agree to use a latex condom during any sexual contact with FCBPs while
             participating in the study and for 112 days following the last dose of sotatercept,
             even if he has undergone a successful vasectomy. Subjects must be counseled concerning
             measures to be used to prevent pregnancy and potential toxicities prior to the first
             dose of sotatercept.

             protocol requirements.

         10. Understand and provide written informed consent.
