  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      As mental health care shifted from state psychiatric hospitals to the community in France and
      western countries, the mental health system became inevitably involved in housing as it
      strove to meet the broader psychosocial needs of consumers. Simultaneously, as many consumers
      found themselves unable to find stable living in the community and struggling with
      addictions, they became a significant subgroup within a larger homeless population, which has
      received increasing policy attention over the past three decades. There are two distinct
      service models for adults who have severe mental illness and are homeless: the residential
      continuum model and the Housing First model.
