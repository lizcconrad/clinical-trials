      -  To test the hypothesis that supplementation of DHEA for at least twelve weeks prior to
           and during ovarian stimulation increases oocyte quantity (number of oocytes retrieved)
           and oocyte quality (clinical pregnancy rates and molecular markers) following IVF and
           IVF/ICSI treatment.

        -  To evaluate the feasibility of conducting a large multicentre trial

      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the role of DHEA in counteracting the effects of
      ovarian ageing in an in-vitro fertilization (IVF) model. The study will examine whether the
      use of DHEA could improve clinical pregnancy rates following IVF treatment in women predicted
      to have aged ovaries by increasing oocyte quantity (ovarian response to gonadotrophins) and/
      or by improving oocyte quality. The oocyte quality will be assessed by morphological and
      molecular markers.

      This study will provide a mechanistic framework for translational research on mechanisms of
      ovarian ageing and drug interventions to slow down the ovarian ageing process and subsequent
      adverse physical and psychological consequences. Further, the data that will be produced from
      this research will have the potential to influence clinical practice in fertility clinics
      worldwide.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Women aged above 23 years with diminished ovarian reserve (predicted to be
             poor-responder), defined as antral follicle count &lt;10 and/or Anti-Mullerian hormone
             &lt;5pmol/L

          -  Women undergoing IVF and IVF/ICSI treatment

          -  Women must have a regular spontaneous menstrual cycle of 21 - 35 days

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Women with BMI &gt;35 Kg/M2

          -  Women with a single ovary

          -  Women with untreated hydrosalpinx/ submucous fibroid/ endometrial polyp at the start
             of treatment

          -  Women with any history of seizure disorders

          -  Women with previous participation in this trial in an earlier treatment cycle

          -  Women with any known endocrine disorders such as congenital adrenal hyperplasia,
             thyroid diseases, hyperprolactinemia

          -  Known allergy to DHEA

          -  Diabetic women on insulin as insulin lowers DHEA levels and might reduce the
             effectiveness of DHEA supplements.
