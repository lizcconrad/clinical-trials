  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to learn if women gain weight using progestin-only methods of
      contraception and if so, how much. The investigators will look at users of two progestin-only
      methods: the levonorgestrel-containing intrauterine contraceptive (LNG-IUC) and the
      etonorgestrel (ENG) subdermal implant, and compare these users' weight change to that of
      users of a non-hormonal method, the copper intrauterine device.

      The primary hypothesis is that ENG implant and LNG-IUC users' weight and body composition
      will increase more than the copper-IUD users. The investigators will collect body composition
      data using dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DEXA), and collect information about diet and
      activity using validated questionnaires.
