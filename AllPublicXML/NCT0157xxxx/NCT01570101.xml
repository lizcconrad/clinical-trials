      The primary objective for this clinical study is to assess the role of the CE Marked Sapheon
      Closure System in closure of incompetent great saphenous veins &quot;GSV&quot; in a routine clinical
      setting.

    <textblock>
      This is a post market, observational study of closure of the great saphenous vein &quot;GSV&quot;.
      Efficacy and safety (adverse events) will be compared to appropriate literature reports to
      determine if the results of the treatment of reflux disease with the Sapheon Closure System
      are consistent with or better than the expectations of the medical community for alternative
      treatments, specifically Laser Thermal Ablation and Radiofrequency Ablation. Additional
      comparison points may include measurements of pain and/or length of time to return to work.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Age ≥18 years and ≤ 70 years of age.

          -  Symptomatic primary Great Saphenous Vein &quot;GSV&quot; incompetence diagnosed by clinical
             symptoms, with or without visible varicosities, and confirmed by duplex ultrasound
             imaging.

          -  CEAP classification of C2, C3 or C4.

          -  Ability to walk unassisted.

          -  Ability to attend follow-up visits.

          -  Ability to understand the requirements of the study and to provide written informed
             consent.

          -  &quot;GSV&quot; on standing pre-procedure Doppler Ultrasound ≥3mm and ≤10mm (maximum diameter).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Life expectancy &lt; 1 year.

          -  Regular pain medication.

          -  Anticoagulation including Heparin or Coumadin.

          -  Previous Deep Vein Thrombosis &quot;DVT&quot;.

          -  Previous superficial thrombophlebitis in &quot;GSV&quot;.

          -  Previous venous treatment on target limb.

          -  Known Hyper-coagulable disorder.

          -  Conditions which prevent routine vein treatment like:

               -  Acute disease,

               -  Immobilization or inability to ambulate, and

               -  Pregnancy.

          -  Tortuous &quot;GSV&quot;, which in the opinion of the Investigator will limit catheter
             placement. (no 2 primary access sites allowed).

          -  Incompetent ipsilateral small saphenous or anterior accessory great saphenous vein.

          -  Known sensitivity to the cyanoacrylate &quot;CA&quot; adhesive.

          -  Current participation in another clinical study involving an investigational agent or
             treatment, or within the 30 days prior to enrollment.
