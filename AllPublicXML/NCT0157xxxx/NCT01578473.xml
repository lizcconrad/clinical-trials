  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Two recent studies have identified low levels of serum testosterone in association with
      Peyronie's Disease (PD), with a significant correlation noted between severity of
      testosterone deficiency and severity of curvature. The study hypothesis is to determine
      whether treatment with testosterone may help men with PD and penile curvature.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  acquired penile curvature of &gt; 30 degrees and &lt; 90 degrees associated with palpable
             penile plaque on physical examination

          -  onset of curvature within 18 months prior to signing consent form

          -  serum TT &lt; 500 ng/dl at the screening visit

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  prior history of treatment for PD that includes intra-lesional injections, topical
             creams, or surgery

          -  prior treatment with oral therapy at least 2 weeks prior to signing consent form (e.g.
             Potaba, Vitamin E, colchicines) will be acceptable for inclusion

          -  prior history of treatment for testosterone deficiency

          -  presence of dense calcified plaque by US or plain radiograph

          -  taking the medication Coumadin

          -  hypersensitivity to testosterone, stearic acid, or polyvinyl pyrolidone (the
             constituents of Testopel)

          -  unable to achieve adequate erection with penile injection to access degree of
             curvature

          -  undergone definitive treatment for prostate cancer, bladder cancer, or other pelvic
             malignancies including surgery, external beam radiation therapy, brachytherapy,
             cryotherapy.

          -  prior history of prostate cancer, hematologic disorders, chronic liver disease
             including cirrhosis and hepatitis C, disorders affecting the immune system, including

             depression, schizophrenia, bipolar disease

          -  history of cerebrovascular accident, history of deep venous thrombosis within the past
             5 years or history of untreated or severe sleep apnea

          -  PSA &gt; 4.0 ng/dL at the screening visit, unless prostate cancer has been excluded to
             the investigator's satisfaction

          -  clinically significant abnormal lab results that would put the subject at increased
             risk or compromise the integrity of the study data, in the opinion of the investigator

          -  received any other investigational drug within 30 days
