    <textblock>
      The study seeks to determine the impact of assessing risk for osteoporosis in women on
      patient and physician behaviors through a pharmacist directed osteoporosis screening program.
      Women will be offered a heel ultrasound to screen for their bone density and may or may not
      be asked questions about their risk for bone fracture. Pharmacists will counsel and educate
      all women on ways to prevent the onset of osteoporosis. Women will be telephoned three months
      after the screening and asked a series of 10 questions to follow up on decisions made by
      their physicians or changes made to their health behaviors related to bone health.

      A maximum of 90 participants will be recruited and randomized to the FRAX速 assessment
      intervention group or the control group to a total of 45 participants in each group. The
      number of participants was chosen based on the simple randomized design of the study and use
      of basic statistics (versus regression analysis). Subjects will be recruited from the
      employee population of Duquesne University, clients visiting the Spirit of Health mobile
      health unit, and the downtown Pittsburgh community and surrounding neighborhoods of Duquesne
      University. Participants will be recruited through posted flyers at these various screening
      venues. Data collected will be the T-score at baseline screening in both groups. The percent
      risk for fracture as determined by the FRAX速 tool will be determined for the intervention
      group. After 3 months have elapsed, a questionnaire will be administered via telephone to
      both the intervention and control groups, a series of 12 yes/no questions. Fisher's exact
      test will be used to analyze the data. Data collected will be nominal data with n in each
      group at 45 for a total of 90 participants. Descriptive statistics will also be employed.
