  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This 4-year project will be guided by a biobehavioral model for the study of exercise
      interventions in two phases with the purposes to :

        1. explore the patients' physical activity preferences and develop doable activity lists
           during treatment period

        2. examine the changes of health-related physical fitness component over interferon
           treatment

        3. develop the Personalized Physical Activity and Psych-Education (PPAPE) Program and test
           its effects on decreasing fatigue, physical and psychological distress, and improving
           their health-related physical fitness and quality of life in patients with chronic
           hepatitis C receiving Interferon with Ribavirin Combination Therapy

        4. evaluate the outcome of the PPAPE program on increasing adherence to therapy, the
           sustained virological response (SVR) in 24 weeks after the end of treatment, and the
           time-consuming for education program during intervention.
