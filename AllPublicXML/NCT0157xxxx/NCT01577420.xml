      The aim of this study is to test a complementary therapy intervention (reflexology) that will
      assist in improving quality of life (QOL) for women undergoing chemotherapy for late stage
      (III or IV) breast cancer within the context of conventional medical care. Quality of life
      will be assessed via intermediate indicators: 1) physical indicators (greater physical
      functioning, lower presence of symptoms) 2) emotional indicators (greater spirituality, lower
      anxiety, and lower depressive symptomology); and the outcome indicator of quality of life.

      The goal of this study is to test a complementary therapy intervention that will assist in
      improving quality of life (QOL) for women undergoing chemotherapy for late stage (III and IV)
      breast cancer within the context of conventional medical care. This longitudinal randomized
      clinical trial (RCT) will test a three-group design in which participants will continue to
      receive conventional care. Two groups of the study will involve a single-blinded four-week
      protocol: Group A will receive reflexology (a specialized foot therapy) from a certified
      reflexologist; Group B will receive placebo sessions from a research aide. The control group
      (Group C) will receive conventional medical care alone. The specific aims are: 1) to
      determine if women who receive either Groups (A or B) of an experimental protocol
      (reflexology or placebo) report significantly better QOL outcomes (total and subscales) at 7
      weeks, 13 weeks, and longitudinally over time, relative to women receiving conventional care
      alone (Group C); 2) to determine if women who receive Group A of an experimental protocol
      (reflexology), report significantly better QOL outcomes (total and subscales) at 7 weeks, 13
      weeks, and longitudinally over time, relative to women receiving Group B (placebo; 3) to
      determine if women who receive either Group A or B of an experimental protocol (reflexology
      or placebo), report significant differences on Intermediate Indicators (physical and
      emotional), at 7 weeks, 13 weeks, and longitudinally over time, relative to women receiving
      conventional care alone; and 4) to determine if the Intermediate Indicators mediate the group
      effect on the QOL outcomes (total and subscales) at 7 weeks. This has the potential of
      leading to an enhanced system of care through the integration of conventional and
      scientifically-based complementary therapies. It also focuses on advanced disease that is
      currently under investigation in terms of supportive care measures. Finally, this study
      utilizes an improved design over existing work. It is a RCT with adequate numbers to detect
      group differences, and could ultimately serve as a model for rigorous investigation of other
      complementary therapies.
