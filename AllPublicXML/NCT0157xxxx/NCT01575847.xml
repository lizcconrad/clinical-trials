      This study is a non-intervention, clinical study to test &quot;research use only&quot; APAP protein
      adducts dipsticks in human blood samples. The study will be conducted in two phases. In phase
      1, the research use only dipsticks and dipstick testing components will be tested for
      feasibility in the emergency department at UAMS. Patients will be enrolled that are having an
      acetaminophen level obtained as part of their medical evaluation. In phase 2, the research
      use only dipsticks will be tested in centers that participate in the Acute Liver Failure
      Study Group (ALFSG), a clinical research network funded by the National Institutes of
      Diabetes, Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK). Subjects participating in the clinical
      registry of the ALFSG will be approached for enrollment. These patients all have the
      diagnosis of acute liver failure or acute liver injury from a variety of etiologies,
      including APAP. A single blood sample will be obtained and will be aliquoted for 1) testing
      by the dipstick and 2) testing by high performance liquid chromatography with electrochemical
      detection (HPLC-EC) analysis for APAP protein adducts. APAP levels will also be determined
      from the second aliquot of blood. In both Phase 1 and Phase 2, the dipsticks will be read
      manually and by dipstick readers by independent testers that are not directly involved in the
      clinical care of the patients. The results of the two dipstick readings will be recorded,
      will remain confidential and will not be used in the diagnosis or management of the patient.
      The results of the dipsticks and HPLC-EC assays will be compared to the final patient
      diagnoses.

    <description>The primary purpose of this study is to pilot test the study procedures including the dipstick, dipstick instructions, micro−centrifuges, and dipstick readers in a clinical setting and then in the second phase the primary objective will be to compare the results from the dipstick to the currently used method HPLC−EC</description>

    <description>Part 1 will be a feasibility study conducted in the Emergency Department at UAMS and ACH. This Part will test the research use dipsticks and dipstick testing kit in subjects that are having APAP levels obtained as part of their medical evaluation.
Part 1 20 subjects
Part I
Inclusion Criteria:
Subject is 12-18 years of age. Subject has an APAP level ordered as part of clinical management.
Exclusion Criteria:

    <description>Part 2
Part 2 will be a non-intervention study in adults presenting to hepatology centers participating in the Acute Liver Failure Study Group (ALFSG). The dipstick will be tested in these subjects and the results will be compared to the HPLC-EC measurement of APAP protein adducts. The results of the dipstick testing will not be used for diagnosis or clinical decision-making.
Part 2 100 subjects
Part 2
Inclusion Criteria:
Subject is 18 years of age or older. Subject is enrolled in the ALFSG registry.
