    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to establish the safety and tolerability of BKM120 when combined
      with mFOLFOX6 and to define the maximum tolerated dose of BKM120 in this combination in
      advanced solid tumors including metastatic pancreatic cancer.

    <textblock>
      This single arm, multicenter, open-label Phase I clinical trial has been designed to
      establish the safety and tolerability of dose escalating BKM120 when combined with mFOLFOX6
      and to define the MTD of BKM120 in this combination. Secondary objective will be to estimate
      the response rate, Progression Free Survival rate, and Overall Survival rate, after treatment
      with the Maximum Tolerated Dose of BKM120 in combination with mFOLFOX6 in patients with
      advanced solid tumors and metastatic pancreatic cancer. Eligible patients will be treated
      with BKM120 orally (PO), once per day (QD) in combination with mFOLFOX6 administered
      intravenously (IV) every 2 weeks on Days 1 and 15 of each cycle using a standard 3+3 dose
      escalation scheme. Each cycle will be repeated every 4 weeks (28 days). FOLFOX6 treatment
      will be as follows: Oxaliplatin: 85 mg/m2 IV, Leucovorin: 400 mg/m2 IV, 5FU bolus: 400 mg/m2
      IV and 5FU infusion: 2400 mg/m2 IV.

      In the absence of treatment delays due to adverse events (AEs), treatment may continue until:
      disease progression, intercurrent illness that prevents further administration of treatment,
      unacceptable AE(s), patient decides to withdraw from the study, or general or specific
      changes in the patient's condition render the patient unacceptable for further treatment in
      the judgment of the investigator.
