  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this investigation is to obtain clinical data to show the Health Beacons
      Radiofrequency Identification (RFID) Localization System is safe and performs as intended as
      a localization device for marking and retrieving a non-palpable surgical target from the
      breast.

    <measure>The surgical target is visualized in the removed specimen AND the RFID Tag was removed from the patient's breast.</measure>
    <time_frame>Within 96 hours after lumpectomy</time_frame>
    <description>The study endpoints are known soon after the lumpectomy procedure by 1) confirmation of the pathology lab examination; and 2) retrieval of the implanted RFID tag.</description>
