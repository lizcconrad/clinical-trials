  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to test whether genetic variation in the alpha 2A adrenergic receptor
      affects diurnal variation in platelet aggregation.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There is a marked diurnal fluctuation in the occurrence of acute myocardial infarction and
      sudden death, with peak incidences occurring in the early morning. Platelet aggregation has
      also been shown to increase in the early morning. The investigators will test the hypothesis
      that ADRA2A genetic variation, specifically haplotype 4, affects platelet aggregation. The
      investigators will compare diurnal platelet aggregation in haplotype 4 subjects with subjects
      in the other haplotype families. In addition, the investigators will compare platelet
      aggregation after the cold pressor test in haplotype 4 with the other haplotype families.
