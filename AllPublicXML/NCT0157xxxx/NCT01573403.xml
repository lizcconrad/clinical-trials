  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a 3-arm, double-blind, randomized, controlled, parallel and dose ranging clinical
      study for 3 days of therapy to investigate the effect of DLBS2411 in gastric pH regulation as
      well as its safety in healthy volunteers.

      DLBS2411 has similar mechanism of action with proton-pump inhibitors (PPIs). However, it is
      hypothetically more potential than PPIs in suppressing gastric acid as our previous
      preclinical studies with DLBS2411 have proven its effects not only on the activity of H+/K+
      ATPase, the enzyme that regulates proton pump in stomach, but also on its gene expression. It
      is hypothesized that DLBS2411 may benefit on gastric pH regulation in healthy volunteers.

      There will be 3 groups of treatment; each group will consist of 18 subjects with the
      treatment regimens :

        -  Treatment I : 1 caplet of DLBS2411 250 mg and 1 placebo caplet of DLBS2411, once daily

        -  Treatment II : 2 caplets of DLBS2411 250 mg, once daily

        -  Treatment III : 2 placebo caplets of DLBS2411, once daily

      Clinical examination to evaluate the investigational drug's efficacy will be performed by a
      24-hour-gastric pH monitoring after the first dose of study drug administration. Besides, the
      pH of the gastric fluid will also be measured at the end of study (Day 3 of treatment).
      Safety examination will be performed at baseline and at end of study. The occurrence of
      adverse event will be observed during the study.

      All subjects will be under direct supervision of a medical doctor during the study period.
