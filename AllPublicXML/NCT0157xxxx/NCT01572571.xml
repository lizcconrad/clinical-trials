      Background

        -  Symptomatic undifferentiated hypotension represents a negative prognostic factor and the
           strongest predictor of in-hospital mortality.

        -  Misdiagnosis may lead to delayed or incorrect treatment of some life-threatening
           conditions.

      Aim

      - The aim of the study is to evaluate the feasibility and accuracy of a new bedside
      ultrasound method that consists in the focused imaging of the thorax, abdomen and leg veins,
      in emergency.

      Methods

        -  Hypotensive (&lt;100 mm/Hg) patients presenting to our emergency department, complaining of
           at least one of the neurologic, respiratory and cutaneous signs and symptoms of
           inadequate tissue perfusion, are prospectively studied by ultrasound-focused assessment
           of the heart, lungs, inferior vena cava, peritoneum, aorta and leg deep veins.

        -  On the basis of physical examination and ultrasound results, the operator declares the
           diagnostic hypothesis without influencing the attending physician and the following
           diagnostic procedure (which includes ultrasound, when needed).

        -  The diagnostic hypothesis is compared with the final diagnosis, obtained after the
           hospital route and discussed by a panel of three blinded experts (one radiologist, one
           cardiologist and one emergency physician).

        -  The statistical agreement is calculated by the k of Cohen with p-value, confidence
           intervals and raw agreement (Ra).
