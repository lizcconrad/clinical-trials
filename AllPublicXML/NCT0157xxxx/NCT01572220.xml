  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The current study is designed to have broad generalizability and inform a potential shift
      toward greater utilization of stress echocardiography with UCA. This will be accomplished by
      comparing UCA stress echocardiography with myocardial SPECT among hospitalized patients
      presenting with atraumatic chest pain. This study seeks to demonstrate: clinical
      comparability of the 2 modalities (based on non-diagnostic test rates), improved care
      efficiency (based on length of stay), lower costs, improved provider satisfaction, and a
      presumed improved safety profile through the elimination of radiation exposure.

      Primary Hypothesis: A strategy of routine UCA (Optison™) enhanced stress echocardiography
      will result in a clinically non-diagnostic test rate comparable to myocardial SPECT among
      patients hospitalized (inpatient or hospital observation status) with atraumatic chest pain.
