      Brief Summary: The purpose of this study is to characterize the dose response of GSK573719 in
      combination with Fluticasone furoate 100mcg in patients with asthma. Treatment with inhaled
      Fluticasone furoate and Fluticasone furoate/Vilanterol are included as an active control.

      Detailed Description: Long acting muscarinic receptor antagonists (anti-cholinergic
      bronhcodilator) exert their effects via distinct and complementary bronchodilator mechanisms
      on large and small airways. Most of the experience with older anti-cholinergics had been with
      acute use and little is known about their effect in chronic use in asthma. This is a
      multicenter, randomized, double-blind, crossover study to evaluate 5 doses of inhaled
      GSK573719 inhaled over 14 days in patients with asthma. Fluticasone furoate (100 mcg) and
      Fluticasone furoate/Vilanterol (100/59mcg) will be included as an active comparator. Each
      eligible subject will receive a sequence of 3 of 7 potential treatments for a total of 3
      treatment periods per subject. The total duration of subject participation is approximately
      14 weeks.

    <time_frame>Baseline (Day 1) and Day 15 of each treatment period</time_frame>
    <description>FEV1 is a lung function measure defined as the maximal amount of air that can be forcefully exhaled in one second. Highest FEV1 from the 3 acceptable spirometric efforts were recorded between 5.00 ante meridiem (AM) and 11.00 AM after withholding albuterol (salbutamol) at all visits for at least 4 hours. Baseline was defined as the pre- dose FEV1 value obtained on Day 1 and trough was defined as FEV1 value obtained 24 hours after morning dosing on Day 14 of each treatment period. Change from baseline value for each participant in each treatment period was the difference between the observed on-treatment value obtained 24 hours after morning dosing on Day 14 and the baseline value for that period. Slope-intercept on log dose model was used to predict trough FEV1 change from baseline for each of the FF+UMEC doses adjusted by FF 100 mcg alone. Mean value for the expected response and associated 95% confidence interval (CI) in change from baseline trough FEV1 is presented.</description>

The change from baseline value for each participant in each treatment period was the difference between the observed on-treatment value obtained 24 hours after morning dosing on Day 14 and the baseline value for that period. Analysis was done using a mixed model, including treatment, period, period baseline FEV1, and mean baseline FEV1 as fixed effects and participant as a random effect. A post hoc analysis was performed to confirm nullification of carry over effect of UMEC.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline (Week 0) and last 7 days of each treatment period</time_frame>
    <description>PEF is a measure of lung function and measures how fast a person can breathe out. Morning PEF was measured pre-dose and pre- rescue bronchodilator use with an electronic Peak Flow Meter. Participants were issued an electronic diary (eDiary) for daily use throughout the study and instructed on how to complete it. Best of 3 attempts were recorded in eDiary. Mean change from baseline was calculated where, baseline was defined as the measurement from (Week 0), includes Day 1 and six days immediately preceding Day 1 for each treatment period. The change from baseline values for each participant in each treatment period were differences between on-treatment week (last 7 days of each treatment period) values and baseline week. Analysis was done using a mixed model, including treatment, period, period baseline morning PEF and mean baseline morning PEF as fixed effects and participant as a random effect. A post hoc analysis was performed to confirm nullification of carry over effect of UMEC.</description>

          <description>The participants received 3 of the 7 possible treatments during the 3 double blind treatment periods. Participants received study treatments in a crossover manner according to their randomization sequence. The 7 treatment regimens were, FF 100 mcg, FF 100 mcg + UMEC 15.6 mcg, FF 100 mcg + UMEC 31.25 mcg, FF 100 mcg + UMEC 62.5 mcg, FF 100 mcg + UMEC 125 mcg, FF 100 mcg + UMEC 250 mcg and FF 100 mcg + VI 25 mcg. The study treatments were administered via a DPI taken once daily in the morning for 14 days during each study period. The treatment periods were separated by 2 washout periods of 12-14 days each. During the two week run-in period and during the two washout period, participants were administered open-label FF 100 mcg once daily in the morning via a DPI. Participants were followed-up for 7 days post-treatment. Salbutamol MDI was provided as the rescue medication.</description>

        <title>Model Predicted Change From Baseline Trough Force Expiratory Volume in 1 Second (FEV1)</title>
        <description>FEV1 is a lung function measure defined as the maximal amount of air that can be forcefully exhaled in one second. Highest FEV1 from the 3 acceptable spirometric efforts were recorded between 5.00 ante meridiem (AM) and 11.00 AM after withholding albuterol (salbutamol) at all visits for at least 4 hours. Baseline was defined as the pre- dose FEV1 value obtained on Day 1 and trough was defined as FEV1 value obtained 24 hours after morning dosing on Day 14 of each treatment period. Change from baseline value for each participant in each treatment period was the difference between the observed on-treatment value obtained 24 hours after morning dosing on Day 14 and the baseline value for that period. Slope-intercept on log dose model was used to predict trough FEV1 change from baseline for each of the FF+UMEC doses adjusted by FF 100 mcg alone. Mean value for the expected response and associated 95% confidence interval (CI) in change from baseline trough FEV1 is presented.</description>

        <title>Percentage of Chance That FF 100 mcg Alone Corrected Change From Baseline FEV1 Response Would Exceed a Target Response by Dose of UMEC Combined With FF 100 mcg</title>
        <description>FEV1 is a lung function measure defined as the maximal amount of air that can be forcefully exhaled in one second. Highest FEV1 from the 3 acceptable spirometric efforts were recorded between 5.00 AM and 11.00 AM after withholding albuterol (salbutamol) at all visits for at least 4 hours. Baseline was defined as the pre- dose FEV1 value obtained on Day 1 and trough was defined as FEV1 value obtained 24 hours after morning dosing on Day 14 of each treatment period. Change from baseline value for each participant in each treatment period was the difference between the observed on-treatment value obtained 24 hours after morning dosing on Day 14 and the baseline value for that period. Data is presented as percentage chance that FF 100 mcg alone corrected change from baseline trough FEV1 response would exceed a target response of 50 mL, 75 mL, 100 mL and 150 mL by doses of UMEC combined with FF 100 mcg.</description>

The change from baseline value for each participant in each treatment period was the difference between the observed on-treatment value obtained 24 hours after morning dosing on Day 14 and the baseline value for that period. Analysis was done using a mixed model, including treatment, period, period baseline FEV1, and mean baseline FEV1 as fixed effects and participant as a random effect. A post hoc analysis was performed to confirm nullification of carry over effect of UMEC.</description>

        <title>Mean Change From Baseline in Daily Morning (Pre-dose and Pre-rescue Bronchodilator) Peak Expiratory Flow (PEF) of Each Treatment Period</title>
        <description>PEF is a measure of lung function and measures how fast a person can breathe out. Morning PEF was measured pre-dose and pre- rescue bronchodilator use with an electronic Peak Flow Meter. Participants were issued an electronic diary (eDiary) for daily use throughout the study and instructed on how to complete it. Best of 3 attempts were recorded in eDiary. Mean change from baseline was calculated where, baseline was defined as the measurement from (Week 0), includes Day 1 and six days immediately preceding Day 1 for each treatment period. The change from baseline values for each participant in each treatment period were differences between on-treatment week (last 7 days of each treatment period) values and baseline week. Analysis was done using a mixed model, including treatment, period, period baseline morning PEF and mean baseline morning PEF as fixed effects and participant as a random effect. A post hoc analysis was performed to confirm nullification of carry over effect of UMEC.</description>

        <title>Mean Change From Baseline in Daily Evening (Pre-dose and Pre-rescue Bronchodilator) PEF of Each Treatment Period</title>
        <description>PEF is a measure of lung function and measures how fast a person can breathe out. Evening PEF was measured pre-dose and pre-rescue bronchodilator use with an electronic Peak Flow Meter. Participants were issued an electronic diary (eDiary) for daily use throughout the study and instructed on how to complete it. Best of 3 attempts were recorded in eDiary. Mean change from baseline was calculated where, baseline was defined as the measurement from (Week 0), includes Day 1 and seven days immediately preceding Day 1 for each treatment period. The change from baseline values for each participant in each treatment period were differences between on-treatment week (last 7 days of each treatment period) values and baseline week. Analysis was done using a mixed model, including treatment, period, period baseline evening PEF and mean baseline evening PEF as fixed effects and participant as a random effect. A post hoc analysis was performed to confirm nullification of carry over effect of UMEC.</description>

        <title>Mean Change From Baseline in Rescue Albuterol/Salbutamol Use of Each Treatment Period.</title>
        <description>Short-Acting Beta2-Agonists albuterol/salbutamol was provided to participants as rescue medication, to use in morning and evening. Participants recorded number of puffs of salbutamol MDI used in last 24 hours (sum of night time and day time puffs) daily for relief of symptoms in eDiary. Mean change from baseline was calculated where, baseline was defined as measurement from (Week 0), includes Day 1 and six days immediately preceding Day 1 (for night time puffs) and seven days (for day time puffs) for each treatment period. Change from baseline values for each participant in each treatment period were differences between on-treatment week (last 7 days of each treatment period) values and the baseline week. Analysis was done using a mixed model, including treatment, period, period baseline rescue albuterol use, and mean baseline rescue albuterol use as fixed effects and participant as random effect. A post hoc analysis was performed to confirm nullification of carry over effect of UMEC.</description>
