      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect of timing of food intake on systemic
      abiraterone exposure observed in healthy adult Japanese and Caucasian men.

    <textblock>
      This is a randomized (individuals will be assigned by chance to study treatments), open-label
      (individuals will know the identity of study treatments), single dose, 4-way crossover study
      of abiraterone acetate in approximately 48 healthy adult Japanese and Caucasian men. For the
      crossover design, the treatment sequences are defined as follows: 1 - ADBC, 2 - BACD, 3 -
      CBDA, and 4 - DCAB; where Treatment A = abiraterone acetate administered in the fasted state,
      Treatment B = standardized meal administered 1 hour after abiraterone acetate dose, Treatment
      C = standardized meal administered 2 hours after abiraterone acetate dose, and Treatment D =
      standardized meal administered 2 hours before and 2 hours after abiraterone acetate dose.
      This study will consist of a screening period followed by four open-label treatment periods
      separated by a washout period of at least 14 days between dosing. Eligible participants will
      be randomly assigned on Day 1 to 1 of 4 treatment sequences that differ with regard to timing
      of food intake before and/or after dosing with a single dose of 1000 mg of abiraterone
      acetate. Serial pharmacokinetic (study of what the body does to a drug) samples will be
      collected during the open-label treatment phase as detailed in the protocol. Safety will be
      monitored throughout the study. End-of-study assessments will be performed on Day 4 of Period
      4 or upon early withdrawal.
