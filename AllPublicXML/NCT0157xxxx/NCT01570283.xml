    <textblock>
      The subjects eligible for this trial have a type of blood cell cancer, other blood disease or
      a genetic disease for which they will receive a stem cell transplant. The donor of the stem
      cells will be either the subject's brother or sister, or another relative, or a closely
      matched unrelated donor. The Investigators are asking subjects to participate in this study
      which tests if blood cells from the subject's donor that have been grown in a special way,
      can prevent or be a effective treatment for early infection by five viruses - Epstein Barr
      virus (EBV), cytomegalovirus (CMV), adenovirus, BK virus (BKV) and human herpes virus 6
      (HHV6).

      The Investigators have grown T cells from the subject's stem cell donor in the laboratory in
      a way that will train them to recognize the viruses and control them when the T cells are
      given after a transplant. This treatment with specially trained T cells (also called
      cytotoxic T cells or &quot;CTLs&quot;) has had activity against three of these viruses (CMV, EBV and
      Adenovirus) in previous studies. In this study the Investigators want to see if they increase
      the number of viruses that can be targeted to include BKV and HHV6 using a simple and fast
      approach to make the cells.

      The Investigators want to see if they can use a kind of white blood cell called T lymphocytes
      (or T cells) to prevent and treat adenovirus, CMV, EBV, BKV and HHV6 in the early stages of
      reactivation or infection.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      To make the CTLs, subject's donors' cells were mixed with small pieces of proteins, called
      peptides that come from adenovirus, CMV, EBV, BKV and HHV6. These peptides stimulate donor T
      cells that react against the viruses to grow and train the donor T cells to kill cells that
      are infected with CMV, EBV, adenovirus, BKV and HHV6. Once sufficient numbers of T cells were
      made, they were tested to make sure they would target the cells infected with these viruses
      but not the normal cells. Then the cells were frozen.

      When the Investigators think the subject needs them, the subject's donor's CTL cells will be
      thawed and injected into the intravenous line. To prevent an allergic reaction, prior to
      receiving the CTLs the subject may be given diphenhydramine (Benadryl) and acetaminophen
      (Tylenol). After the subject receives the cells, Investigators will monitor the levels of
      these five viruses in the blood. They will also take blood to see how long the T cells they
      gave the subject are lasting in the body.

      If the CTL infusion has helped the subjects infection or if they have had a treatment, for
      example with steroid drugs that might have destroyed the T cells the subject was given, then
      they are allowed to receive up to 2 more doses of the cells.

      The first part of this study was a dose escalation study. That means that at the beginning,
      patients were started on the lowest dose (1 of 3 different levels) of T cells. The next group
      of patients were started at a higher dose. This process continued until all 3 dose levels
      were studied. They would now like to enroll more patients at the highest dose level to get
      more information about how the T cells work.

      Subjects will continue to be followed by their transplant doctors after the injection. The
      subject will either be seen in the clinic or they will be contacted by a research nurse to
      follow up for this study every week for 6 weeks then at 8 week and 3, 6 and 12 months. The
      subject may have other visits for their standard care. Subjects will also have regular blood
      tests done to follow their counts and the viral infection. To learn more about the way the T
      cells are working in the body, up to an extra 30-40 ml (6-8 teaspoons) of blood will be taken
      before the infusion and then at 1, 2, 4, 5, 6 and 8 weeks and 3 months. Blood should come
      from the central intravenous line, and should not require extra needle sticks.

      If subjects experience a positive response or are taking medicines (such as steroids) that
      may affect how long T cells stay in the body, they may be able to receive up to two
      additional doses of the T cells at the same initial dose level from 28 days after their
      initial dose. After each T-cell infusion, they will be monitored as described above.

      Study Duration: Subjects will be on study for approximately one year. If they receive
      additional doses of the T cells as described above, they will be followed until 1 year after
      their last dose of T-cells.

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

        Patients will be eligible following any type of allogeneic transplant to receive CTLs as
        prevention or for early reactivations as defined below.

          1. Prior myeloablative or non-myeloablative allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant
             using either bone marrow or peripheral blood stem cells within 12 months.

          2. Prevention for patients at risk of CMV, adenovirus, EBV, BK virus, or HHV6 infection

          3. Treatment of reactivation or infection which is defined for each virus as below

               -  CMV- CMV antigenemia is monitored at least weekly post transplant. Reactivation
                  is defined at CMV antigenemia with &lt;10 leukocytes positive or elevated PCR. If
                  any patient develops CMV antigenemia with &gt;10 leukocytes positive or clinical
                  evidence of CMV infection (defined as the demonstration of CMV by biopsy specimen
                  from visceral sites (by culture or histology) either pre or after CTL infusions,
                  standard treatment with Ganciclovir, and/or Foscarnet and Immunoglobulins will be
                  initiated. Patients may receive CTLs for antigenemia or elevated PCR without
                  visceral infection.

               -  Adenovirus- Adenovirus infection will be defined as the presence of adenoviral
                  positivity as detected by PCR or culture from ONE site such as stool or blood or
                  urine or nasopharynx.

             Adenovirus disease will be defined as the presence of adenoviral positivity as
             detected by culture from more than two sites such as stool or blood or urine or
             nasopharynx.

             In patients who meet the criteria for disease Cidofovir may be added unless the
             subject could not tolerate this agent due to nephrotoxicity. Patients may receive CTLs
             for elevated PCR in blood or stool.

               -  EBV- EBV-LPD is defined according to recent guidelines as proven EBV-LPD defined
                  by biopsy or probable EBV-LPD defined as an elevated EBV DNA level associated
                  with clinical symptoms (adenopathy or fever or masses on imaging) but without
                  biopsy confirmation. Patients with EBV DNA reactivation only may receive CTLs on
                  study. Patients with proven or probable EBV-LPD should also receive Rituxan

               -  BK virus- Patients post transplant may develop asymptomatic BKV viruria or
                  viremia. BK reactivation will be defined as detection of elevated BK levels by
                  PCR in blood or urine while disease will be defined as detection in multiple
                  sites or in one site with symptoms. Cidofovir has been administered intravenously
                  in a low dose (i.e. up to 1 mg/kg 3 times weekly, without probenecid) or a high
                  dose (ie, 5 mg/kg per week with probenecid) to HSCT patients with BK infections
                  but no randomized trials are available proving its clinical efficacy. In patients
                  who meet the criteria for disease Cidofovir may be added unless the subject could
                  not tolerate this agent due to nephrotoxicity.

               -  HHV6- HHV6 reactivation will be defined as detection of elevated HHV6 levels by
                  PCR in blood while disease will be defined as detection in multiple sites or in
                  one site with symptoms. Ganciclovir, Cidofovir, and foscarnet have variable in
                  vitro activity against HHV-6, and may have a role in treating HHV-6-associated
                  disease - hence one or more of these agents will be added in patients with
                  disease.

          4. Treatment may be given to eligible patients with a single or multiple infections.
             Patients with multiple infections with one or more reactivation and one or more
             controlled infection are eligible to enroll.

          5. Clinical status at enrollment to allow tapering of steroids to less than 0.5 mg/kg/day
             prednisone.

          6. Karnofsky/Lansky score of ≥ 50

          7. ANC greater than 500/µL.

          8. Bilirubin &lt;/= 2x upper limit normal

          9. AST &lt;/= 3 x upper limit normal

         10. Serum creatinine &lt;/= 2 x upper limit normal

         11. HgB &gt; 8.0

         12. Pulse oximetry of &gt; 90% on room air

         13. Available multivirus-specific CTLs

         14. Negative pregnancy test in female patients if applicable (childbearing potential who
             have received a reduced intensity conditioning regimen).

         15. Written informed consent and/or signed assent line from patient, parent or guardian.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients receiving ATG, or Campath or other immunosuppressive T cell monoclonal
             antibodies within 28 days of screening for enrollment.

          2. Patients with other uncontrolled infections. For bacterial infections, patients must
             be receiving definitive therapy and have no signs of progressing infection for 72
             hours prior to enrollment. For fungal infections patients must be receiving definitive
             systemic anti-fungal therapy and have no signs of progressing infection for 1 week
             prior to enrollment.

             Progressing infection is defined as hemodynamic instability attributable to sepsis or
             new symptoms, worsening physical signs or radiographic findings attributable to
             infection. Persisting fever without other signs or symptoms will not be interpreted as
             progressing infection.

          3. Patients who have received donor lymphocyte infusion (DLI) within 28 days.

          4. Patients with active acute GVHD grades II-IV.

          5. Active and uncontrolled relapse of malignancy
