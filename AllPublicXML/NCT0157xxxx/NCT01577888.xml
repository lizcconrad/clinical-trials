      To study the early safety and performance of the Shockwave Medical System in subjects to
      demonstrate that the device can safely and effectively deliver localized energy for the
      treatment of vascular disease.

    <textblock>
      Shockwave Medical, Inc. intends to conduct a prospective, single-arm, single-center, First in
      Human study designed to evaluate the early safety and feasibility of the Shockwave
      Lithoplasty System in subjects with heavily calcified infrainguinal arteries with 3.75mm to
      6mm reference vessel diameter at target site. The Shockwave Lithoplasty System is indicated
      to generate sonic shockwave energy within the target treatment site and disrupt calcium
      within the lesion to allow for subsequent dilation of a peripheral artery stenosis using low
      balloon pressure. Up to 10 subjects will be enrolled to undergo lihtoplasty.

          -  Meets Angiographic Inclusion Criteria

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with peripheral arterial disease of Rutherford Category 6.
