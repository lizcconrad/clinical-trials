  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This proposal has been developed through collaboration between the University of Minnesota
      and New American Community Services (NACS), and the research design is based on a needs
      assessment conducted by the community partner. The investigators will test the hypotheses
      that women who are offered home vaginal bio-specimen collection will have higher rate of
      cervical cancer screening completion than that of women referred for clinic-based Pap test.
      All participants will be given identical education materials on cervical cancer screening and
      HPV, currently in use by the Minnesota Sage Program.

      The trial will pilot text a protocol for home vaginal bio-specimen collection for human
      papillomavirus (HPV) testing for cervical cancer screening. The main objective is to estimate
      the successful screening completion rate among a sample of Somali women who have not
      undergone cervical cancer screening for three or more years. Women will be randomized to
      either home vaginal bio-specimen collection or referral to undergo a clinic-based Pap test.

    <description>The main outcome will be successful completion of cervical cancer screening by 3 months after enrollment. For the Home Vaginal Biospecimen Collection Group, completion is defined as return of the HPV DNA self-sampling kit by the patient, with a sample suitable for laboratory analysis. In the Clinic Pap Test Group, completion is defined by documentation of Pap test result.</description>
