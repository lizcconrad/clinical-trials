      The purpose of this study is to determine whether the harvest, isolation and culture of
      cardiac stem cells from endomyocardial biopsies is feasible.

    <textblock>
      Heart failure is a devastating condition affecting nearly 6 million patients in the United
      States alone. Ischemic cardiomyopathy, or pump failure secondary to previous heart attack, is
      considered by many to be the leading cause of heart failure. Stem cell therapy, or
      regeneration of the lost myocardium, is an intervention that has the potential for reversing
      the detrimental effects of this disease. Recently published evidence has shown preliminary
      results indicating the safety and feasibility of utilizing cardiac stem cells for the
      treatment of ischemic cardiomyopathy. The ability to use a commonly practiced method, such as
      endomyocardial biopsy, to isolate and expand stem cell cultures could, potentially, make this
      therapy widely available. The results of this study will be important for the design of
      future clinical trials.

      Biopsy samples are taken at the time of right heart catheterization. They are frozen in a GMP
      facility at the University of Louisville. The tissue is shipped either to the Institue of
      Molecular Caridology, Louisville, KY or shipped overnight to the Brigham and Women's Hospital
      in Boston, MA. The tissue is enzymatically dissociated, and cardiac stem cells are isolated
      and maintained in culture for 6-8 passages (point of clinical utility). During that time
      period, experimentation is carried out to charcterize the biological attributes of these cell
      populations. After this experimentation is complete, the cultures are destroyed in accordance
      with the biohazard handling policies of the individual institution.
