  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In total hip arthroplasty several approaches can be used. The newly introduced minimally
      invasive anterior approach is supposed to cause less damage to tendons and muscles. At the
      same time there are reports that there are more complications when this approach is used. The
      direct lateral approach is the most used in Norway and is well documented. There are however
      those who postulate that there is to high risk of damage to the gluteus medius causing
      Trendelenburg gait. In the investigators hospital both the anterior and direct lateral
      approach is used with good result. The investigators main study hypothesis is that there is
      no difference between the use of anterior or direct lateral approach i total hip arthroplasty
      in regards to postoperative function and pain, complications, radiological finds (X-ray and
      MRI), markers for muscle damage (i.e CK-total) or other clinical outcomes.
