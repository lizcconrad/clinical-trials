      Pharmacology of Exenatide in Pediatric Sepsis, PEPS is a phase 1-2 research study that will
      examine drug safety, drug metabolism, drug action and preliminary drug clinical effects of
      four does of exenatide injected every 12 hours to children with shock from infection (septic
      shock). The investigators hypothesize that exenatide can be safely dosed to children with
      sepsis to achieve blood levels of drug similar to that achieved in teenagers with type 2
      diabetes. The investigators further hypothesize that injection of exenatide to children with
      septic shock will normalize blood glucose levels and decrease levels of inflammation proteins
      in the blood during the early course of sepsis.

      Pharmacology of Exenatide in Pediatric Sepsis, PEPS is a phase 1-2 investigation that will
      examine safety, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and preliminary clinical efficacy of 4
      subcutaneous doses of exenatide administered every 12 hours to children with newly diagnosed
      septic shock. The investigators' long term goal is to explore the potential benefit of
      exenatide on: early immunomodulation and glucose homeostasis, organ dysfunction, and
      clinically meaningful outcomes associated with pediatric sepsis. The current study objectives
      are to conduct a &quot;3+3&quot; dose escalation study, and then examine a &quot;best exenatide allometric
      dose&quot; to generate safety, pharmacokinetic, pharmacodynamic, and initial efficacy data in a
      larger cohort. In Phase 1 (three allometric doses; three age strata)the investigators will
      identify an exenatide dosing regimen that mimics area under the exenatide concentration curve
      for exenatide dosing among adolescents with type 2 diabetes with minimal or no adverse
      events. A total of 18 subjects are expected to be enrolled in Phase 1. In Phase 2 the
      investigators will utilize this &quot;best exenatide allometric dose&quot; to further clarify exenatide
      safety (adverse event occurence: e.g. nausea, abdominal pain, delayed gastric emptying,
      hypoglycemia, pancreatitis, renal dysfunction), pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics (glucose
      homeostasis; inflammatory cytokine serum concentrations), and effect on clinical outcomes
      (AUC of Saturation Index, AUC Vasoactive-Inotropic Score, AUC RIFLE Criteria, Pediatric
      Logistic Organ Dysfunction Score; changes in health-related quality of life and functional
      status). In Phase 2, 30 subjects in each age strata in the ratio of 4:1, exenatide: vehicle,
      are expected to be enrolled.
