    <textblock>
      This is a single center, randomized, double-blinded, controlled, Phase I, small targeted
      prospective study in healthy male and non-pregnant female subjects, 18 to 49 years old,
      inclusive, designed to determine the safety, reactogenicity, and immunogenicity of an
      intramuscular subvirion inactivated monovalent influenza A/H5N1 (HA of A/Indonesia/05/2005)
      virus vaccine manufactured by Sanofi Pasteur administered at 3.75 mcg per dose given with or
      without AS03 adjuvant manufactured by GSK. In the study, each subject will receive two doses
      administered 28 days apart. This study will use a systems biology approach to assess the
      human early gene and protein signatures expressed at Days 1, 3, 7, and 28 after the first
      vaccination. The systems data will be integrated with immunogenicity and reactogenicity data
      to develop a systems model of the human immune response to A/H5N1 vaccine with or without
      AS03 adjuvant.

      The long term goals of this project are to identify RNA or protein biomarkers within 1 to 7
      days after vaccination in peripheral blood that will predict a successful immune response and
      protection against disease. Adjuvants are used to boost the response of vaccines by
      stimulating the innate immune response. However, the exact mechanism and safety of adjuvants
      is still debated. Systems biology is the study of complex biological processes as integrated
      systems with many interacting components. The goal of systems biology is to make biology more
      predictive. This proposal will use a systems biology approach to identify successful
      immunization biomarkers. The study will use fresh blood samples and patient data collected in
      the proposed VTEU-funded study. At selected time points, volunteers' blood samples will be
      collected and immediately processed. Using these specimens, we will identify and quantify
      changes in the whole transcriptome and proteome of the major immune cells to identify and
      quantify changes in gene expression. We will integrate the changes in gene expression with
      the changes in the immune cells response. We will use mathematical modeling of the
      accumulated data to identify RNA or protein biomarkers that significantly correlate with the
      observed serum hemagglutination inhibition assay (HAI) response,cytokine/chemokine response,
      and cell mediated immunity (CMI) responses. Ultimately, the predictive biomarkers will be the
      foundation for a simple, rapid, inexpensive test to quickly show protection against a
      pathogen or foreign agent after vaccination. This is a single center, randomized,
      double-blinded, controlled, Phase I, small targeted prospective study in healthy male and
      non-pregnant female subjects, 18 to 49 years old, inclusive, designed to determine the
      safety, reactogenicity, and immunogenicity of an intramuscular subvirion inactivated
      monovalent influenza A/H5N1 (HA of A/Indonesia/05/2005) virus vaccine manufactured by Sanofi
      Pasteur administered at 3.75 mcg per dose given with or without AS03 adjuvant manufactured by
      GSK. In the study, each subject will receive two doses administered 28 days apart.

             conditions, unless such use is on a PRN (as needed) basis only. Non-PRN use of
             systemic, over-the-counter medications and PRN systemic, prescription medication may
             be allowed if, in the opinion of the investigator, they pose no additional risk to

             56 days following the first vaccination. This is inclusive of licensed seasonal
             influenza vaccines.

          -  Have an acute or chronic medical condition that, in the opinion of the site principal
             investigator or appropriate sub-investigator, would render vaccination unsafe, would
             interfere with the evaluation of responses or is not generally seen in &quot;normal,
             healthy subjects&quot;.

          -  Have a history of severe reactions following previous immunization with contemporary
             influenza virus vaccines.

          -  Have an acute illness, including an oral temperature greater than or equal to 100.4
             degree F, within 3 days prior to the first vaccination.

          -  Diastolic blood pressure is less than 60 mm Hg or greater than 90 mmHg.

          -  Received an experimental agent (vaccine, drug, biologic, device, blood product, or
             medication) within 1 month prior to the first vaccination or expects to receive an
             experimental agent, other than from participation in this study, during the 14-month
             study period.

          -  Are participating or plan to participate in another clinical trial with a licensed
             product during the 14-month study period.

          -  Have any condition that, in the opinion of the site principal investigator or
             appropriate sub-investigator, would place the subject at an unacceptable risk of
             injury, or render them unable to meet the requirements of the protocol, or confound
             the interpretation of results.

          -  Participated in an influenza A/H5 vaccine study in the past in a group receiving
             vaccine (does not apply to documented placebo recipients) or have a history of A/H5
             infection prior to enrollment.

          -  Have known active HIV, Hepatitis B, or Hepatitis C infection.

          -  Have a history of alcohol or drug abuse in the last 5 years.

          -  Plan to travel outside the U.S. in the time between the first vaccination and 56 days
