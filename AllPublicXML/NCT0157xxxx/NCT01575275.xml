  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the safety and performance of an investigational
      agent, known as 5-ALA or Gliolan (aminolevulinic acid), that many be useful to a surgeon for
      visualizing a tumor during surgery. It is also being studied to determine if there are
      differences in what Gliolan shows a surgeon compared to intraoperative magnetic resonance
      imaging (MRI)

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the volume of residual enhancing tumor after a 5-ALA guided resection of a
      glioblastoma multiforme (GBM).

      II. Determine the volume of tissue removed compared to the measured enhancing tumor evaluated
      on a pre-operative MRI.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Evaluate the time to tumor progression. II. Evaluate the overall survival.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive aminolevulinic acid orally (PO) 2-4 hours before surgery.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 2 weeks.
