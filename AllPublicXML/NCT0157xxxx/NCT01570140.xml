      Rationale: Accounting for the growth, aging and detrimental life style changes in the Dutch
      population, the investigators expect further growth of number of known diabetes patients. The
      economic burden with this increase will be enormous, the healthcare system is under
      increasing pressure to provide better but more time efficient service to more people with
      limited human resources. the investigators hypothesize that, by increasing the patients
      self-management by offering remote care services, this reduction of the individual caseload
      can be achieved.

      Objective: Primary objective is to test the hypothesis that the consistent use of a web
      portal and its educational content and the possibility to review personal diabetes related
      data for type 2 diabetes patients (T2DM) in the primary care setting, will result in an
      improvement quality of life.

      Study design and methods: In this Prospective observational cohort study the investigators
      examine the effect of the voluntarily use of a web portal and its educational content. The
      primary end point is health related quality of life. We predefined a clinically relevant
      difference of 0.074 in the EQ-5D index score. Secondary endpoints are diabetes-related
      distress and well being and a selection of clinical measurements, number of contacts with
      health care provider and the amount of prescribed medication. The participants are being
      followed for 1-year and the data will be collected at baseline, after 6 months and 12 months.
