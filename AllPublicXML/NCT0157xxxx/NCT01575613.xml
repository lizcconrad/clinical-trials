      In this study, the investigators propose to determine the value of rolling out four targeted
      malaria control efforts in reducing overall malaria transmission. These targeted control
      efforts include local upscaling of IRS and ITNs in hotspots of malaria transmission. In
      addition, larviciding will be employed to target malaria vectors, also those that are less
      susceptible to IRS and ITNs as a consequence of outdoor feeding and resting. Lastly, the
      human infectious reservoir will be reduced in hotspots of malaria transmission by treating
      parasite carriers and their household members with the current first-line antimalarial drug.
      The impact of these targeted interventions on overall transmission intensity will be assessed
      in the context of currently ongoing malaria control activities in a plausibility study.
      Hotspots of malaria transmission are defined in an area of 100km2 and randomized to receive
      hotspot targeted interventions and compared with their baseline and with control clusters
      where the routine (untargeted) malaria control activities continue. The interventions will be
      evaluated based on changes in parasite prevalence measured in community surveys inside and
      outside hotspots of malaria transmission. Parasite prevalence will be compared before and
      after the intervention in intervention clusters and between intervention and control
      clusters.

      In addition to malaria surveys in the human population, an entomological evaluation will take
      place where the densities of mosquito larvae and adult mosquitoes are monitored
      longitudinally.

      DEFINITIONS This study uses a plausibility design to determine the plausible impact of
      hotspot-targeted interventions on overall malaria transmission. Hotspots will be detected in
      the 100km2 study area. Hotspots are defined as areas with a level of transmission intensity
      that exceeds that in the surrounding area; indicated by a higher sero-conversion rate and/or
      age-adjusted density of malaria-specific antibodies.

      Clusters for the intervention are defined as a hotspot and the area surrounding this hotspot
      in each direction up to 500 meters.

      INTERVENTION Half of the clusters will be randomized to hotspot-targeted interventions, while
      the other half will serve as control. The plausible impact of hotspot targeted interventions
      will be evaluated by comparing malaria indices in intervention clusters with their baseline
      and with control clusters.

      In each phase four hotspot-targeted interventions will be superimposed on ongoing control
      measures: hotspots will be targeted with a combination IRS, long-lasting insecticide treated
      nets (LLINs), larviciding and a focal screening and treatment (FSAT).

      EVALUATION The primary outcome will be parasite prevalence in evaluation zones (i.e. the area
      surrounding malaria hotspots) of targeted and untargeted clusters. In addition, parasite
      prevalence will be determined inside hotspots of malaria transmission and in evaluation zones
      in relation to distance to the hotspot boundary. For this, community surveys are planned
      prior to the intervention and at two time-points after the intervention.

      An entomological evaluation will take place concurrently in which mosquito breeding sites are
      monitored for productivity and mosquitoes will be sampled indoors and outdoors.

      Malaria morbidity is assessed by passive case detection.
