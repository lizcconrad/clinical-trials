  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS) is considered to be a major public health problem.
      The prevalence of OSAS is estimated at 2% and 4% for adult women and men respectively, most
      of whom are undiagnosed and untreated. The prevalence of snoring in children is high - 5% in
      the age group of 6 and less and about 1.5% above. The in-lab sleep study using full
      Polysomnography (PSG) and the manual scoring criteria set by the American Academy of Sleep
      Medicine was considered the gold standard for OSAS diagnosis. The high cost of in-lab full
      night PSG, together with long waiting lists for sleep studies, have led to the commonly used
      procedure of &quot;split-night&quot; for OSAS patients, as well as to the development of a variety of
      ambulatory sleep study systems. The primary study objective is to compare the efficacy of the
      WatchPAT200 (WP200), as an ambulatory device for aiding in the diagnosis of sleep disorders
      for subjects from age 5 to 90, to the manual scoring of the PSG that serves as a &quot;gold
      standard&quot;.
