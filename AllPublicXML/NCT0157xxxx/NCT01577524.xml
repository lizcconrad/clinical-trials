  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to determine whether diluted Povidone Iodine solution used to
      irrigate surgical wounds during spine surgery decreases the incidence of surgical site
      infections.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Post-operative infections in spine surgery have been extensively investigated in the
      literature. These investigations focus on the efficacy of using peri-operative antibiotics,
      Povidone Iodine skin preparations, the effects of shaving around the surgical sit, and the
      use of intra-operative diluted Povidone Iodine wound irrigation in preventing post-operative
      infections.

      Povidone-iodine is a complex of polyvinyl pyrrolidine and tri-iodine ions widely used as an
      antiseptic agent. It has bactericidal activity against a wide spectrum of pathogens,
      including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). The safety of its use
      intra-operatively has been evaluated in animal studies and also supported through Randomized
      Controlled Trials in spinal surgery and in other surgical subspecialties.

      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of the intra-operative use of diluted
      Povidone Iodine solution in reducing post-operative infections when used for irrigating
      surgical incisions during spinal surgery compared with 0.9% Sodium Chloride Irrigation
      Solution (i.e. normal saline solution).

      The primary outcome measure will be seen as a reduction in the number of post-operative
      infections. As a result and although not directly measured, it is suspected that a reduction
      in post-operative infections may result in quicker healing with fewer complications and pain.

    <description>Subjects in the treatment group will receive 3.5% diluted Povidone Iodine solution in the surgical incision in a quantity sufficient to fill the wound to the level of the skin. The Povidone Iodine solution will be maintained in the incision for 3 minutes, after which it will be flushed from the wound with normal saline solution.</description>
