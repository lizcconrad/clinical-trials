      The purpose of this study is to determine whether transforaminal dexamethasone injections are
      effective in the treatment of chronic Hemiplegic Shoulder Pain.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Shoulder pain is the most common complication in hemiplegia after Stroke (CVA). Almost three
      quarters of all patients with hemiplegia will suffer from shoulder pain in the first twelve
      months after stroke. Because of the lack of effective treatment today, the optimal management
      of hemiplegic shoulder pain is prevention. Although widely studied, all clinical trials for
      shoulder pain in stroke fail to show efficacy. TF was never investigated to treat Hemiplegic
      Shoulder Pain (HSP). The investigators hypothesize that injecting the epidural space at the
      C6 level via transforaminal would desensitize both central medullary components of pain as
      peripheral sensitized structures such as the suprascapular nerve of the affected shoulder.

      To test this hypothesis, the investigators developed a treatment protocol consisting of two
      C6 transforaminal epidural steroid injection with dexamethasone (TF with 0.5mL of lidocaine
      1% and 1.5mL of Dexamethasone 10mg/ml). This procedure was compared to a sham intervention.
