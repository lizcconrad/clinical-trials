    <textblock>
      CMV disease is a challenge to the success of renal transplantation. Recently, the
      investigators analyzed data from 792 renal transplant recipients performed at our hospital
      between 1999 and 2005. After the usual exclusions, 663 patients were analyzed. This
      population showed that the incidence of CMV disease is stable and occurs in approximately
      20-22% of all patients and invasive disease in approximately 5% every year. In seronegative
      patients and those receiving anti-lymphocyte (AL), CMV prophylaxis, done with ganciclovir for
      90 days is our routine and in the majority of transplant centers. In seropositive patients
      without associated risk factors (such as the use of AL) universal prophylaxis is not done.
      Rather, in this group, early diagnosis, by detection of antigenemia or viremia by
      quantitative PCR, is performed in patients who show symptoms compatible with CMV disease. In
      the investigators analysis the incidence of CMV disease in seropositive patients is around
      16%. These patients are usually hospitalized and treated with GCV IV for 14-21 days. This
      leads to an additional costs of admissions, biopsies for the diagnosis of disease invasion,
      etc. Besides these costs, the survival of the grafts in the long run is lower in patients
      with CMV disease than in those without CMV, particularly when associated with acute
      rejection. In recent years, monitoring of viremia (PCR / antigenemia) and preemptive
      treatment when it reaches substantial values, have increasingly been suggested. Patients in
      whom the detection of viremia in progressive values is detected would be treated as
      outpatients before the disease develops. To turn this hypothesis into reality, there is an
      urgent need to define cutoff values for CMV-PCR in the detection of developing CMV disease.
