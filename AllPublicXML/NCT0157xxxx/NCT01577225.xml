  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      OPSITE Post-Op Visible is a tri-layer dressing made up of a low adherent wound contact layer,
      lattice shaped absorbent pad and a top film that is waterproof and a bacterial barrier and is
      coated with a water-based adhesive. The comparator is a standard care treatment regime
      comprising tape and gauze.

      This study requires 100 eligible patients which will be recruited from the patients routinely
      see by the study investigators at each study site. Eligible patients will undergo surgery
      that results in a surgical wound of 27cm or less that is expected to have low or moderate
      levels of exudate and will have received at least one randomised study treatment. The primary
      objective is to compare OPOV and tape/gauze in terms of wear time per patient.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      OPSITE Post-Op Visible (OPOV) is a post-operative dressing that has been developed to protect
      the wound from bacteria in the environment and absorb blood or other fluid exuding from the
      wound. The honeycomb nature of the dressing pad allows direct visibility of the wound through
      the dressing, minimising the need to expose the wound to the environment and the patient to
      the trauma of a dressing change just for the clinician to inspect the wound. OPOV is unique
      in combining these features and offers a real benefit over other standard post-operative
      dressing regimes.
