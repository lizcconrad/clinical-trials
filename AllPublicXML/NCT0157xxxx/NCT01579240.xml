  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study evaluated the efficacy of a 12-week Internet intervention to help sedentary older
      adults adopt and maintain an exercise regimen. A total of 368 men and women over 55 years of
      age (x = 60.3; SD 4.9 ) were recruited and screened on line. They randomized into treatment
      and control groups and assessed at pre-test, 12 weeks, and at six months.

      The multivariate model was significant at posttest (p = .001; large effect size) and at six
      months (p = .001; medium effect size). At posttest, intervention participation showed
      significant improvement on 13 of 14 outcome measures compared to the control group. At six
      months, treatment group participants were found to maintain large gains compared to the Ctrl
      participants on all 14 measures.

    <textblock>
      Based on the treatment group users self reported fitness level, activity goals, and
      self-identified barriers to exercise, the program helped users select exercise activities in
      the areas of endurance, flexibility, strengthening, and balance enhancement. They returned
      weekly for automated video and text support and education, with the option to change or
      increase in their exercise plan, and on-going problem solving to overcome barriers to
      exercise.
