  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Thinning of fibrous cap in atherosclerotic plaques is associated with plaque vulnerability.
      The high resolution of optical coherence tomography (OCT) provides an accurate measurement of
      fibrous cap thickness. Endothelial dysfunction is a key component of vulnerable plaque and
      digital reactive hyperemia-peripheral arterial tonometry (RH-PAT) is a non-invasive automatic
      and quantitative method to evaluate endothelial function. The investigators will investigate
      the association between endothelial function assessed by RH-PAT and plaque vulnerability
      determined by OCT-derived thin-cap fibroatheroma (TCFA).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Consecutive patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS) who undergo both OCT examination and
      RH-PAT examination are enrolled. OCT examination is performed to observe the culprit lesion
      before percutaneous coronary intervention, and endothelial function is evaluated using RH-PAT
      before discharge.
