      The purpose of this study is to assess the efficacy and safety of intravitreal injection of
      aflibercept for the treatment of Choroidal Neovascularization (CNV) secondary to presumed
      ocular histoplasmosis syndrome (POHS).

    <description>The Incidence &amp; Severity will be assessed during study participation. Baseline medical conditions &amp; abnormal findings present prior to the patient signing the Informed Consent Form (ICF)will be recorded as pre-existing illnesses in the medical history. Clinical study staff will start assessing subjects for adverse events once the ICF has been signed starting at month 1 and at each monthly visit,and will be instructed to request the adverse event information in a nonspecific, non-suggestive type of questioning. The Investigators will record all adverse events regardless of causality.</description>

    <description>Intravitreal aflibercept injection 2.0mg dosed every 4 weeks (monthly)for the first 3 months followed by 2.0 mg (0.05mL) via intravitreal injection every eight weeks (2 months).
Dosing at monthly intervals is allowed if needed in the opinion of the investigator based on presence of fluid on OCT and/or a decrease in visual acuity of greater than or equal to 5 letters from the previous visit.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  CNV of less than 1 year duration due to presumed ocular histoplasmosis

          -  Ability to provide written informed consent and comply with study assessments for the
             full duration of the study

          -  Age 21 years and older

          -  Subfoveal or juxtafoveal CNV lesion of less than 5400um in diameter

          -  Best corrected visual acuity of 20/25 to 20/400

          -  Birth control therapy for females of child-bearing age

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  CNV due to presumed ocular histoplasmosis for greater than 1 year

          -  Pregnancy (positive pregnancy test) or lactation

          -  Premenopausal women not using adequate contraception. The following are considered
             effective means of contraception : surgical sterilization or use of oral
             contraceptives, barrier contraception with either a condom or diaphragm in conjunction
             with spermicidal gel, an IUD, or contraceptive hormone implant or patch

          -  A recent history of smoking (within 1 year of study enrollment)

          -  Prior treatment with intravitreal aflibercept injection

          -  Any other condition that the investigator believes would pose a significant hazard to
             the subject if the investigational therapy were initiated

          -  Uncontrolled glaucoma in the study eye (defined as IOP greater or equal to 30 mmHg
             despite treatment with anti-glaucoma medication)

          -  History of cerebral vascular accident, myocardial infarction, transient ischemic
             attacks within 3 months of study enrollment

          -  Active infectious conjunctivitis, keratitis, scleritis, or endophthalmitis in either
             eye

          -  Presence of significant subfoveal fibrosis or atrophy

          -  Intraocular surgery (including cataract surgery) in the study eye within 2 months of
             enrollment

          -  Active intraocular inflammation (grade trace or above) in the study eye

          -  History of allergy to fluorescein, ICG or iodine, not amendable to treatment

          -  Any concurrent intraocular condition in the study eye (e.g., cataract or diabetic
             retinopathy) that, in the opinion of the investigator, could either

          -  Require medical or surgical intervention during the 12 month study period to prevent
             or treat visual loss that might result from that condition, or

          -  If allowed to progress untreated, could likely contribute to loss of at least 2
             snellen equivalent lines of BCVA over the 12 month study period

          -  Prior/Concomitant Treatment:

          -  Panretinal photocoagulation treatment

          -  Previous intraocular steroids or PDT within 3 months

          -  Previous participation in any studies of investigational drugs within 30 days
             preceding Day 0 (excluding vitamins and minerals)

          -  Previous treatment with intravitreally (in either eye) or intravenously administered
             Avastin (bevacizumab) within 60 days

          -  Previous use of Macugen or Lucentis in study eye within 60 days

          -  Prior submacular or vitreous surgery
