      Hypothesis: The use of a mobile robotic telepresence system for off-hours rounding in the
      surgical intensive care unit has an impact on nurse-physician collaboration.

      Study question: Does the addition of mobile video communication provided by RTP affect
      nurse-physician collaboration during off shift rounding in the surgical intensive care unit
      when compared to the more common clinical practice of off-shift rounding using the telephone?

      This is a mixed-method study, involving both surveys and ethnographic fieldwork. The research
      team will utilize the Collaboration and Satisfaction About Care Decisions (CSACD) survey
      instrument at regular intervals to assess nurse-physician collaboration. The instrument is
      validated and reliable and has been extensively tested. Permission was obtained to use the
      instrument. The ethnographic investigation will run concurrently and be performed by a
      doctoral student from Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). No part of the study will
      involve patient intervention. The study will be conducted in the surgical intensive care unit
      (SICU).

      The survey-based portion of the study is a prospective, randomized, crossover-controlled
      trial; it will generate ordinal data regarding nurse-physician collaboration and
      satisfaction. The ethnographic portion of the study will involve observation and interviews.
      The MIT student will engage in unobtrusive observational shadowing of APs and nurses
      throughout the study, and will formally interview each observed AP and nurse twice during the
      entire length of the study: once at the onset of the study, and once as the study draws to
      conclusion. This observational shadowing will include visits to the SICU. All participants
      will be consented for the study. Consent for and implementation of these methods will be
      undertaken in a manner consistent with current best research practice; extensive measures
      will be taken to protect staff confidentiality.

    <description>The SICU's practice involves daily morning team rounding at the bedside. The team includes the critical care attending physician (AP), surgical resident physician, and critical care nurse. The AP is physically present in the SICU during these rounds and for the hours between approximately 7am and 7pm. During off-shift hours (7pm-7am), the AP is available by phone as the &quot;on-call&quot; attending physician. In addition to this on-call availability, the standard of practice in SICU for years has been that the on-call physician proactively places a telephone call to the SICU at least once every evening to perform &quot;telephone rounds&quot; with the resident physician aeach SICU patient.</description>

    <description>Remote Telepresence Robotics (RTP) is a form of telemedicine that enables a fast and direct face-to-face response by a physician, located remotely, and may sometime utilize a mobile robot.
RTP provides the physician the ability to teleconference with patients and other healthcare providers using two way audio visual technology. The sophistication of these devices varies and can range from simple video conferencing to remote robotic control devices with audio visual conferencing capabilities. The &quot;robotic&quot; capabilities refer to ability of the physician to remotely direct or drive the device from one location to another.
The technology allows clinical experts to provide the right care at the right time and has become an accepted standard of care when used under appropriate circumstances.</description>
