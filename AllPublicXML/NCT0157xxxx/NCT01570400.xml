  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether an internet-based treatment program,
      consisting of combined cognitive bias modification and cognitive behavioral therapy, reduces
      symptoms of social phobia among a population diagnosed with this disorder.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Previous studies have shown that individuals with social phobia have attention biases, often
      focusing on or avoiding aversive stimuli (such as judging facial expressions) and thereby
      reinforcing the bias. Computerized training programs have been developed to implicitly direct
      the users attention. In this study, such a program -- combined with an established,
      well-researched and proven effective form of internet-based cognitive behavioral therapy
      (iCBT) -- will be provided to 128 participants that meet the diagnostic criteria for social
      phobia, and the pre/post-measurements will be compared. Participants will be randomized to
      one of two groups, receiving one of two variants of the cognitive bias modification program
      (both receive iCBT).

    <description>The Liebowitz Social Anxiety Scale (LSAS) is a questionnaire by psychiatrist and researcher, Michael Liebowitz, whose objective is to assess the range of social interaction and performance situations which patients with social anxiety disorder may fear. It is commonly used to study outcomes in clinical trials. The scale features 24 items, 13 relating to performance anxiety and 11 concerning social situations. It is not intended for use as a self-reporting diagnosis.</description>

    <description>Computerized, internet-based training program for implicit modification of cognitive bias of attention, variant 4. Participant is exposed to a pair of words or a pair of faces -- either neutral-negative, neutral-positive, or negative-positive -- for 500ms-1000ms, followed by a probe (&lt; or &gt;) in the previous position of ONE of these words or faces and is then asked to press the corresponding arrow button on a keyboard. A total of 96 word pairs and 96 face pairs are shown during a session. One third is neutral-negative, one third is neutral-positive, and one third is negative-positive. The probe always follows the more negative word or face.
Duration: approx. 10 min. per session. Frequency: Once every day for 2 weeks.</description>

Participant is exposed to a pair of words or a pair of faces -- either neutral-negative, neutral-positive, or negative-positive -- for 500ms-1000ms, followed by a probe (&lt; or &gt;) in the previous position of ONE of these words or faces and is then asked to press the corresponding arrow button on a keyboard. A total of 96 word pairs and 96 face pairs are shown during a session. One third is neutral-negative, one third is neutral-positive, and one third is negative-positive. The probe follows the more positive stimulus and the more negative stimulus with equal frequency.
Duration: approx. 10 min. per session. Frequency: Once every day for 2 weeks.</description>
