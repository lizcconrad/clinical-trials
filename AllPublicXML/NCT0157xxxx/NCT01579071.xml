  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Insufflation is essential procedure to observe the lumen of gastrointestinal tract in
      gastroscopy or colonoscopy Currently, most of hospital in Korea are using room air for
      insufflation According to recent clinical studies have shown that carbon dioxide have better
      safe and reduce stomachache than room air when endoscopy and endoscopic procedure is
      performed.

      However, there was still no research data or study in Korea. In this study, the investigators
      will try to make comparison between Carbon dioxide and room air insufflation for endoscopic
      submucosal dissection for Gastric Tumor and investigate the efficacy and safety
