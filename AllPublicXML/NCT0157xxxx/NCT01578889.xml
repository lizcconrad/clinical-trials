  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Some vaccines may work better when given together with another substance known as an adjuvant
      or when given with an experimental procedure called electroporation (EP). EP is a method
      where an electric pulse is administered to the same muscle where the vaccine injection is
      given. The addition of the adjuvant to the vaccine and the delivery with EP may increase a
      person's immune response to the vaccine. Combination approaches such as a DNA vaccine
      followed by live vector boost may also increase a person's immune response to the vaccine
      components. All of these interventions will be tested in this study.

      This study will evaluate the safety and tolerability of and immune response to an HIV DNA
      vaccine with or without plasmid IL-12 adjuvant, when given by EP and followed by a live
      vector vaccine given IM by needle and syringe in healthy, HIV-uninfected adults.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The effectiveness of a vaccine may be increased when combined with an adjuvant and/or when
      given with EP. The addition of an adjuvant or EP may increase a person's immune response to a
      vaccine. Furthermore, the immune response to HIV antigens may be improved by giving a DNA
      vaccine boosted with a live vector vaccine. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the
      safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of an HIV DNA vaccine (HIV-MAG) alone or in
      combination with an IL-12 pDNA adjuvant, delivered IM via EP followed by a Vesicular
      Stomatitis Virus (VSV) HIV gag vaccine boost given IM by needle and syringe in healthy,
      HIV-uninfected adults.

      Participants will be enrolled into the study in one of four groups. Each of the four groups
      will receive 3 mg of the HIV-MAG vaccine alone or combined with one of three different doses
      of the IL-12 pDNA adjuvant, followed by the VSV HIV gag vaccine boost. Within each of the
      four groups, participants will be randomly assigned to receive the study vaccines or placebo.
      At study entry (Day 0), all participants will undergo a physical examination and blood
      collection. Female participants will also take a pregnancy test. Participants will complete
      questionnaires and receive counseling on HIV risk reduction. They will also receive their
      first vaccination. Participants will remain in the clinic for 30 minutes after the
      vaccination for observation and monitoring.

      Additional vaccination study visits will occur at Months 1, 3, and 6. At Months 1 and 3,
      participants will receive the same vaccine or placebo they received at study entry; at Month
      6, participants will receive the VSV HIV gag vaccine or placebo. For 3 days after the study
      entry and Months 1 and 3 vaccination visits, participants will record their symptoms in a
      diary. After the Month 6 vaccination visit, participants will record their symptoms for 7
      days.

      Participants in Groups 1 and 3 will attend additional study visits on Days 1, 3, 14, 42, 91,
      98, 169, 171, 175, 182, 273, and 364. Participants in Groups 2 and 4 will attend additional
      study visits on Days 14, 42, 98, 182, 273, and 364. Most study visits will include a physical
      examination, blood collection, oral mucosa examination, interviews and questionnaires, and
      oral mucosa examination. If participant has any oral sores, oral swabs may be collected.
      Saliva also may be collected. Select study visits will include a mini mental state exam,
      urine collection, HIV testing, and risk reduction counseling. Study researchers will contact
      participants at Months 15, 24, and 36 for follow-up health monitoring.

             the investigator, would interfere with, or serve as a contraindication to, protocol
             adherence, assessment of safety or reactogenicity, or a participant's ability to give
             informed consent

          -  Serious adverse reactions to vaccines, including anaphylaxis and related symptoms such
             as hives, respiratory difficulty, angioedema, and/or abdominal pain. (Not excluded: a
             participant who had a nonanaphylactic adverse reaction to pertussis vaccine as a
             child.)

          -  Autoimmune disease

          -  Immunodeficiency

          -  Asthma other than mild, well-controlled asthma. More information on this criterion can
             be found in the protocol.

          -  Diabetes mellitus type 1 or type 2, including cases controlled with diet alone. (Not

          -  Hypertension:

               1. If a person has been found to have elevated blood pressure or hypertension during
                  screening or previously, exclude for blood pressure that is not well controlled.
                  Well-controlled blood pressure is defined as consistently less than or equal to
                  140 mm Hg systolic and less than or equal to 90 mm Hg diastolic, with or without
                  medication, with only isolated, brief instances of higher readings, which must be
                  less than or equal to 150 mm Hg systolic and less than or equal to 100 mm Hg
                  diastolic. For these participants, blood pressure must be less than or equal to
                  140 mm Hg systolic and less than or equal to 90 mm Hg diastolic at enrollment.

               2. If a person has NOT been found to have elevated blood pressure or hypertension
                  during screening or previously, exclude for systolic blood pressure greater than
                  or equal to 150 mm Hg at enrollment or diastolic blood pressure greater than or
                  equal to 100 mm Hg at enrollment.

          -  Body mass index (BMI) greater than or equal to 40; or BMI greater than or equal to 35
             with two or more of the following: age greater than 45 years old, systolic blood
             pressure greater than 140 mm Hg, diastolic blood pressure greater than 90 mm Hg,
             current smoker, or known hyperlipidemia

          -  Deltoid skin fold measurement by caliper greater than 40 mm

          -  Bleeding disorder diagnosed by a doctor (e.g., factor deficiency, coagulopathy,
             platelet disorder requiring special precautions)

          -  Cancer (Not excluded: a participant with a surgical excision and subsequent
             observation period that in the investigator's estimation has a reasonable assurance of
             sustained cure or is unlikely to recur during the period of the study.)

          -  Asplenia: any condition resulting in the absence of a functional spleen

          -  Psychiatric condition that precludes compliance with the protocol. Specifically
             excluded are people with psychoses within the past 3 years, ongoing risk for suicide,
             or history of suicide attempt or gesture within the past 3 years.

          -  Pregnant or breastfeeding
