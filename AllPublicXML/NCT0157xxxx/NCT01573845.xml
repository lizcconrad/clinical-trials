      The central hypothesis of The GREEN Project Lunch Box Study is that a school-based
      communication campaign that combines healthy eating and eco-friendly messages will improve
      the quality of foods that children bring from home to school more than a healthy eating
      campaign alone and compared to a control/delayed intervention condition at the end of one
      school year.

    <textblock>
      The proposed intervention seeks to improve the quality of foods brought to school from home
      by taking advantage of a natural synergy between healthy eating and eco-friendly behaviors to
      increase motivation to adopt healthy eating behaviors. The project involves the design,
      implementation and evaluation of a novel, school based communications campaign to
      simultaneously improve the nutrition quality and eco-friendliness of foods that elementary
      school children bring from home to school.

      The intervention is a theory-based multi-channel communications campaign based on qualitative
      research with the target population: children in grades three and four in public schools in
      Eastern Massachusetts and their caregivers. Schools were randomized to one of three
      conditions: (1) a campaign that includes healthy eating and eco-friendly messages; (2) a
      campaign that includes healthy eating messages only; and (3) a delayed healthy eating
      eco-friendly campaign after serving as a control group. Foods brought from home and the
      packaging associated with those foods will be assessed at baseline and at the end of the
      school year using a photographic technique.

      The primary outcome of interest is change in the number of servings of fruits and vegetables.
      Secondary outcomes will include changes in the quantity of sugar-sweetened beverages; changes
      in processed, energy-dense foods; and changes in sugar sweetened beverages brought from home.
      We will also be able to assess changes in trash associated with foods brought from home.
