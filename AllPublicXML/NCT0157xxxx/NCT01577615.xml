  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The PEPI study is designed to provide a patterned feeding experience. By using a regularly
      occurring and necessary caregiving event, feeding, as the vehicle for the patterned
      experience, the intervention should be effective at promoting and reinforcing neuronal growth
      and connections that are critical for neurobehavioral and cognitive function while at the
      same time being cost effective in its delivery.

      Infants will be randomly assigned to a study group or control group. The research study will
      last for approximately twenty four months. Infants will have daily assessments while in the
      hospital and three study visits after hospital discharge. All post-discharge visits will
      occur in an out patient hospital setting. During the first days of life, study staff will
      start observing infant's development by using assessment tools. Lab samples include one blood
      sample taken when other blood is being collected in the first days of life and one saliva
      sample when the infants starts bottle feeding.

      When tube feedings are started in the study group, caregivers (nurses, parents or research
      staff) will gently place hands on the infant while in the incubator (ill babies) or bundled
      outside the incubator. If the infant is in the control group, they will receive standard tube
      feeding care.

      When oral feedings are started in the study group, the infant will have an opportunity at
      every feeding to be breast or bottle fed while being held. If unable to complete the entire
      feeding orally, the rest will be tube fed.

      If the infant is in the control group, feeding opportunities will be decided by the medical
      team providing care.

      All infants will be observed during oral feedings twice a week while in the hospital. Study
      staff will watch heart rate, sucking activity (a sensor on the chin) and level of
      wakefulness.

    <description>Infants in the patterned experience group will receive a patterned feeding experience with all feedings through discharge. They will receive a touch intervention at each gavage feeding. Once oral feedings are initiated, they will be offered an oral feeding at every scheduled feeding. They will be held for feedings. They will be observed twice a week utilizing the computer data acquisition system. Follow up visits will occur at 2,6 amd 24 months corrected age.</description>

Infants in the usual care group are orally fed at the discretion of the nurses or medical team. Once oral feedings are initiated, infants will be observed twice a week using the computer data acquisition system. Follow up visits will occur at 2,6 and 24 months corrected age.</description>

Nonnutritive sucking will be offered to infants.
Blood work will be collected for inflammatory cytokines.
Saliva will be collected for genetic analysis
Saliva will be collected in 10 infant sub study for cortisol pre and post feedings
All scheduled feedings will include an opportunity for the infant to try feeding orally by bottle or breast while being held in a swaddled flexed position.
Once bottle feedings are initiated, infants will be observed twice a week utilizing the computer data acquisition system.
Follow up visits will occur at 2,6and 24 months corrected age.</description>
