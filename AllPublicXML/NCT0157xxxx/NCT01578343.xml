      1. Rationale In mantle cell lymphoma, the conventional chemotherapy achieves only temporary
           responses with a median duration of remissions only from 1 to 2 years. Therefore, mantle
           cell lymphoma is known as one of the B-cell lymphomas with poor prognosis. Although the
           treatment outcome of mantle cell lymphoma has been improved since intensive chemotherapy
           regimens such as HyperCVAD was used, a substantial number of patients are still
           frequently relapsed after chemotherapy. After relapse, most of them became refractory to
           various kinds of salvage treatment. That is why the results of most salvage chemotherapy
           regimens were disappointing. In addition, mantle cell lymphoma generally occurs in
           elderly people. Thus, intensive salvage chemotherapy may not be feasible for elderly
           patients. Therefore, an effective, novel combination treatment is urgently needed in
           relapsed or refractory mantle cell lymphoma patients.

        2. Hypothesis

             -  Vorinostat will produce synergism with a combination treatment regimen
                (Fludarabine, mitoxantrone, dexamethasone, FND) without overlapping toxicity

             -  Vorinostat maintenance treatment will reduce the relapse rate in patients
                ineligible for autologous stem cell transplantation.

        3. Purpose A phase II investigation to determin the effectiveness of vorinostat in
           combination with intravenous fludarabine, mitoxantrone, and dexamethasone in patients
           with relapsed or refractory mantle cell lymphomain patients with relapsed or refractory
           mantle cell lymphoma.
