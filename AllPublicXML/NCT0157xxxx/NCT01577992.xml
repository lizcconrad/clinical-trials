  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Multiple system atrophy (MSA) is a sporadic neurodegenerative disorder. MSA is dominated by
      autonomic/urogenital failure which may be associated with either Parkinsonism (MSA-P subtype)
      or with cerebellar ataxia (MSA-C subtype). The prognostic of this disease is bad because it
      ended with the patient's death few years later. No neuroprotective treatment has shown a real
      efficacy. 50% of patients suffering of MSA frequently experienced painful sensation. The
      origin of this pain is unknown. In Parkinson disease (PD) ; arguments suggest the implication
      of dopamine neuromediator pathway in integration and modulation of pain. Several studies
      suggest the existence of various influences with dopamine implication in the appearance of
      painful sensation and that would be inhibitory. That's why observed painful symptoms in MSA
      and PD could be due to a decrease of pain appearance threshold, secondary to a lost of
      control of sensitizes centres, to Parkinson control.

      It is interesting to determine if MSA as PD is responsible for a decrease of pain threshold
      and to characterise the levodopa effect on the patient's pain threshold. Better
      physiopathology knowledge of pain in MSA is necessary to improve the therapeutic care.
      Because the efficacy of others treatments is low, it's important to improve the research for
      a better comfort of patients with a better understanding, analysing and treating of the pain.
