  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the validity of previously identified prognostic
      variables that may identify patients with shoulder pain that are likely to benefit from
      cervicothoracic spine manipulation.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators have recently identified prognostic variables in a preliminary Clinical
      Prediction Rule (CPR) that are purported to identify patients with shoulder pain who respond
      favorably to cervicothoracic spinal manipulative therapy (SMT) and daily home exercises of
      cervical and thoracic active range of motion exercises. These prognostic variables have been
      identified in a single study, and therefore it is not known if these factors will be valid in
      a different group of patients, even ones with similar characteristics as those used in the
      investigators' initial exploratory study. Further study of these identified factors is needed
      for validation in an independent sample of patients, which will improve generalizability for
      clinical practice. In this study, patients with a primary complaint of shoulder pain will be
      randomly assigned to receive cervicothoracic spine manipulation followed by therapeutic
      exercises or therapeutic exercise alone. If the variables are in fact meaningful, patients
      who exhibit 3 or more of the identified prognostic variables and receive cervicothoracic SMT
      should experience improved outcomes compared to patients who have less than 3 of these
      variables and receive the same intervention. Additionally, patients who exhibit 3 or more of
      the identified variables that receive cervicothoracic SMT should also have superior outcomes
      to patients who exhibit 3 or more of the identified variables and receive an alternate
      intervention (exercise only). Finally, the investigators will determine if the addition of
      cervicothoracic SMT to exercise improves outcomes as compared to exercise alone.

    <measure>Change in Shoulder Pain and Disability Index (SPADI) Score</measure>
    <time_frame>1 week, 4 weeks, 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The SPADI is a 13 item questionnaire. The pain domain consists of five questions and the disability domain consists of eight. Each question refers to the past week.</description>

    <measure>Change in the Shortened version of the Disability of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand Index (QuickDASH)</measure>
    <time_frame>1 week, 4 weeks and 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The QuickDASH4 is an eleven-item questionnaire that addresses symptoms and physical function in people with any or multiple disorders involving the upper limb.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Global Rating of Change (GROC)</measure>
    <time_frame>1 week, 4 weeks, 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The GROC asks patients to rate whether their health condition has improved or deteriorated over time to determine the efficacy of a particular treatment. Scores range from -7 (a very great deal worse) to zero (about the same) to +7 (a very great deal better). Intermittent descriptors of worsening or improving are assigned values from -1 to -6 and +1 to +6 respectively.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in the Numeric Pain Rating Scale (NPRS)</measure>
    <time_frame>1 week, 4 weeks, 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>An 11-point NPRS will be used to measure pain intensity. The scale is anchored on the left with the phrase &quot;No Pain&quot; and on the right with the phrase &quot;Worst Imaginable Pain&quot;. Patients rate their current level of pain and their worst and least amount of pain in the last 24 hours. The average of the three ratings or any single rating may be used to represent the patient's level of pain.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in the Modified Fear-Avoidance Beliefs Questionnaire (FABQ)</measure>
    <time_frame>1 week, 4 weeks, 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The FABQ is a 16-item questionnaire designed to quantify fear and avoidance beliefs in patients with musculoskeletal disorders. The FABQ has two sub-scales, a 7-item scale to measure fear-avoidance beliefs about work and a 4-item scale to measure fear-avoidance beliefs about physical activity. Each item is scored from 0-6 with possible scores ranging between 0-24 and 0-42 for the physical activity and work subscales, respectively, with higher scores representing increased fear-avoidance beliefs.</description>

During the first two sessions, patients in the manipulation+exercise group will receive cervicothoracic spine manipulations and range of motion (ROM) exercises only. Beginning on the third session these patients will receive the same exercise program as the exercise group.</description>
