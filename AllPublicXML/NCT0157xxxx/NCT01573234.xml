  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Evaluation of clinical efficacy of My Skin (hydrogel and polyurethane film) plus best
      practice clinical care in subjects with cut injuries and abrasions with particular regard to:
      Wound healing (complete reepithelialization) and patient's pain.

      In the context of the study will be collected secondary outcomes related to type of lesion
      and its clinical evolution through the analysis of the items in the scale of the Pressure
      Sore Status Tool(PSST).
