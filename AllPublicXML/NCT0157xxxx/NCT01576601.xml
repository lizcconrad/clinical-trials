    <textblock>
      The purpose of this prospective, clinical observational trial is to assess the incidence of
      pain (and analgesia), methods of pain assessment (and by whom), prescribed analgesics,
      methods of analgesic delivery, and patient/parent satisfaction in patients undergoing
      craniotomy surgery at three major children's hospitals (Boston Children's Hospital,
      Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, The Children's Center Johns Hopkins Hospital) in the
      United States.

    <description>To determine the severity of pain and the compliance of physicians and nurses in implementation of institutionally mandated pain assessment tools by chart review. We will also assess which pain assessment tools are in use by health care providers in the 3 participating institutions along with compliance with frequency of pain assessment based on institutional policy.</description>

    <description>To independently determine patient/parent satisfaction and quality of recovery (QOR). Daily, an investigator will use a validated, standardized parental satisfaction tool (a subset of the NRC Picker satisfaction tool) and in adolescents a modified QoR-40.</description>

        200 patients who are scheduled for craniotomy surgery under general anesthesia at 3 major
        children's hospitals will be eligible. Potential patients include those undergoing brain
        surgery for cancer, epilepsy, vascular malformations, and craniofacial reconstructive
        surgery. Following surgery, patients will receive routine postoperative management and
        treated for pain based on institutional routine. We will follow patients for the first 5
        post-operative days or until discharge, whichever comes first.

        Once daily, a study investigator will make an independent pain assessment using an age
        appropriate, validated tool (FLACC, Pain Face Scale-Revised, self report on a 0-10 scale).
        The study investigator will also assess overall quality of life and patient/parent
        satisfaction using a subset of the NRC Picker satisfaction tool and in adolescents a
        modified QoR-40 (see below).

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Pediatric patients 0-18 years, who are scheduled to undergo craniotomy surgery for any
             reason (e.g., brain tumor, epilepsy surgery, craniofacial reconstruction) at either
             the Boston Children's Hospital, the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, or the
             Children's Center of the Johns Hopkins Hospital will be eligible for enrollment.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients who remain intubated after surgery. Additionally, we will exclude patients
             who are allergic to opioids or who have a history of substance abuse
