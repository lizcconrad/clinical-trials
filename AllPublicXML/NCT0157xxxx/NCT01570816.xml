  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to evaluate the effectiveness of functional electrical
      stimulation (FES) provided by an implanted pulse generator (IPG) in correcting hip, knee and
      ankle function to improve walking in people with partial paralysis.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In a surgical procedure electrodes are inserted into muscles of the lower extremities to
      correct hip, knee and ankle function. The electrode leads are connected to an implanted pulse
      generator located in the abdomen. After a typical post-operative period of two to five days,
      the recipient will be discharged home for two to six weeks of moderate activity. Following a
      6 week period of laboratory exercise and training, functional use of the neuroprosthesis will
      begin at home and in the community with follow-up evaluations at 1, 3, 6 and 12 months.
      Laboratory assessments include walking speed and distance, physiologic cost, muscle strength,
      measure of spasticity, and gait analysis with and without stimulation. A number of
      self-reporting instruments are administered to capture individual's participation, quality of
      life and various aspects of perceived community ambulation.
