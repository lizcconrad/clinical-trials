      The purpose of this study is to demonstrate that the combined used of low dose of oxytocin
      and misoprostol prevent from post partum haemorrhage better than oxytocin or misoprostol
      alone at cesarean sectionOne hundred fifty women with singleton term pregnancy undergoing
      elective or emergency lower segment cesarean section under spinal anesthesia were included in
      this study. The patients were randomly allocated to one of three groups of 50 each. The
      oxytocin group(group O) received intravenous infusion of 20 units of oxytocin soon after
      delivery of the neonate and one tablet of placebo sublingually. (20 IU syntocinon dissolved
      in 1liter of lactated Ringer's solution) at the rate of 1000 ml over a 1h period, immediately
      after delivery of the neonate ,The misoprostol group (groupM) received 400 µg sublingually
      and infusion of lactated Ringer ( which one ampoule placebo dissolved it) and the combined
      misoprostol-oxytocin group(group MO) received 200 µg and 5 iu oxytocin bolus intravenously
      immediately after delivery of the neonate . The main outcome measures were blood loss at
      cesarean section, change in hemoglobin levels, need for additional oxytocics and drug related
      side effects.The volume of blood in the suction bottle was measured, blood soaked sponges and
      added to volume from suction bottle. Hemoglobin values were determined both before surgery
      and 24 h following surgery. Hemodynamic variables were recorded every 5 minutes during
      surgery .The need for additional oxytocic therapy, operating time, infusion volume given
      intraoperatively, need for blood transfusion, side effects of study drug and any significant
      puerperal morbidity were also recorded.
