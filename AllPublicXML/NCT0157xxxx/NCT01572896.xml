  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to demonstrate the effectiveness of the &quot;Taking Charge: Managing
      JIA Online&quot; Internet intervention, when compared with an attention (static education only
      websites) control group in improving pain and HRQL as well as other health outcomes (anxiety,
      depression, treatment adherence, pain coping, knowledge, and self-efficacy) in adolescents
      with JIA. The proposed study will enroll and randomize 294 adolescents with JIA attending 10
      pediatric rheumatology hospital clinics in the Canada to either the experimental or control
      groups.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In summary, no rigorous Internet self-management intervention has been undertaken to improve
      HRQL, symptoms, treatment adherence, knowledge, and self-efficacy in youth with JIA. The
      proposed &quot;Managing JIA Online&quot; Trial will rigorously examine the effects of this Internet
      intervention on HRQL and other health outcomes thereby filling a significant gap in our
      knowledge related to promotion of self-management care for adolescents with JIA.

    <description>In addition to standard medical care, adolescents in the experimental group will receive the &quot;Taking Charge: Managing JIA Online&quot; Internet self-management program. The intervention is a 12-module interactive multi-component treatment protocol - that consists of JIA-specific education, self-management strategies, and social support - that is available in English and French.</description>

    <description>The control group is designed to control for the potential effects on outcomes of time, attention and computer use during the intervention and through the 9-month follow-up period. In addition to standard medical care, adolescents in the attention control group will be provided with access to a self-guided patient education study website, which will have two components: basic patient educational materials about JIA (&quot;JIA Resource Centre&quot;) and online assessments.</description>
