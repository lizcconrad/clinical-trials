  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single arm, open label study of up to 24 high risk prostate cancer patients
      scheduled for prostatectomy and/or pelvic lymph node dissection. Patients receive a single IV
      dose of 99mTc-MIP-1404 (study drug) followed by SPECT/CT scan 3-6 hours after injection. As
      standard of care, patients will undergo prostatectomy and/or pelvic lymph node dissection
      (PLND) within two weeks of study drug dosing. Patients may receive a second injection of
      study drug within 24 hours of surgery to measure activity counts in tissue samples
      post-surgery, but prior to pathology processing. 99mTc-MIP-1404 image data will be evaluated
      for visible uptake and compared with histopathology.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Male aged 21 years or older.

          2. Ability to provide signed informed consent and willingness to comply with protocol
             requirements.

          3. Past biopsy indicating the presence of adenocarcinoma of the prostate gland.

          4. Participant is deemed to be high-risk with potential for pelvic lymph node
             involvement. The criteria for high-risk are:

               -  Patient has PSA value &gt;10 and clinical stage T2 or higher, and Gleason score 8, 9
                  or 10.

               -  Patient has PSA value &gt;20 and clinical stage T2 or higher, and Gleason score

          5. Participant is or will be scheduled to undergo standard of care prostatectomy and/or
             pelvic lymph node dissection.

          6. Have had (within previous 2 months) or will undergo diagnostic CT or MRI imaging prior
             to surgery.

          7. Have had (within previous 2 months) or will undergo bone scan imaging prior to
             surgery.

          8. Participants must agree to use an acceptable form of birth control throughout the
             study period. Participants must use condoms for a period of seven days after each
             injection, if engaged in sexual activity.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Participants for whom participating would significantly delay the scheduled standard
             of care therapy.

          2. Participants administered a radioisotope within 5 physical half lives prior to study
             enrollment.

          3. Participants with any medical condition or other circumstances that, in the opinion of
             the Investigator, would significantly decrease obtaining reliable data, achieving
             study objectives or completing the study.
