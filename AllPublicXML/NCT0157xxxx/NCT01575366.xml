      Aim 1. Determine whether higher-velocity finger tracking training improves hand function more
      than slower velocity training. Working hypotheses: The higher-velocity training will have
      significantly greater functional improvement compared to the lower-velocity training, as
      measured by standardized upper extremity functional tests (Jebsen Taylor test, Box &amp; Block
      Test, and Finger extension force test)

      Aim 2. Ascertain whether higher-velocity finger tracking training differentially induces
      cortical reorganization as compared to lower-velocity finger tracking training.

      Working hypotheses: The higher-velocity training will have significantly greater cortical
      reorganization compared to the lower-velocity training, as measured by:

        1. TMS - increased amplitude of motor evoked potentials (MEP) from paretic extensor
           digitorum muscle in response to paired-pulse TMS to ipsilesional primary motor area
           (M1).

        2. fMRI - increased volume of activation, signal intensity, and laterality of ipsilesional
           M1.

      Aim 3. Explore whether the functional improvements correlate with the cortical
      reorganization. Working hypotheses: The functional improvements will correlate with the
      cortical reorganization.

    <description>The paretic finger movement training at different velocities included two 5-week periods of five days per week, 2-hours per day phases. The frequency for the higher-velocity training is 0.8 Hz, whereas the lower frequency training is 4 times slower, at 0.2 Hz. The two periods are each followed by a 3-week baseline period. The subject is seated in front of a laptop computer with the paretic forearm resting on the arm of the chair in a quiet room at home. The position of the forearm is pronated. An electrogoniometer, composed of a potentiometer attached to a custom hand splint, is placed on the paretic index finger with the potentiometer centered at the metacarpophalangeal joint. To keep the training session time equal between the two training phases, the duration of each slow training trial is 5 sec, compared to 20 sec for each fast training trial. Ultimately, the total number of required finger extension/flexion training movements is equal between the two phases.</description>

        Inclusion criteria include:

          -  Ischemic stroke - due to higher risk of seizures in hemorrhagic stroke

          -  Subcortical location of stroke

          -  Stroke after 6 months - lower limit of 6 months to avoid confounding from spontaneous
             recovery (Jorgensen, Nakayama et al. 1995) and no upper limit to maximize pool of
             candidate subjects while still showing training effect (Carey, Kimberley et al. 2002)

          -  At least 18 years of age - to maximize pool of candidate subjects

          -  Mini-Mental State Examination score &gt;24 - to ensure satisfactory cognition to perform
             tasks

          -  Satisfactory corrected vision - to see computer screen during training and testing

          -  Active range of MP joint at paretic index finger of at least 10 degrees - based on
             minimal movement required to perform training task successfully, and that larger
             amplitudes would reduce the pool of subjects available for participating in the study.

          -  Ability to pronate the forearm so that index finger extension movement during training
             is vertically upward and relaxation results in the finger falling back to the flexed
             starting position

          -  not currently receiving any other therapy - to avoid confounding treatment effects

          -  Approval for participation by a neurologist - to ensure subject is reasonably safe to
             receive TMS testing. Subjects with proprioceptive loss or expressive aphasia will be
             included, providing they can carryout the training task.

        Exclusion criteria include:

          -  Inability to follow 3-step commands

          -  A visual field cut that causes subjects not to see all indicators on a computer screen
             positioned centrally in from of them

          -  History of seizures

          -  Family member with history of seizures

          -  Presence of any other neuromuscular disorders

          -  Pregnancy

          -  Claustrophobia

          -  Indwelling metal or medical devices/implants incompatible with functional fMRI testing

          -  History of exposure to finger tracking training.

          -  Informed consent will be obtained and TMS/fMRI safety screenings will be conducted
             prior to testing procedures.

          -  Subjects will be recruited as volunteers from letters sent to previous research
             subjects inviting their participation, through visits to local stroke support groups
             meetings, newspaper advertisements and referrals from neurologists.
