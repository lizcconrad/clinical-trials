      Background:

      - Tuberculosis (TB) is a leading cause of death worldwide. Those who are exposed to the TB
      bacteria but have not become sick are said to have latent TB. Many people with latent TB will
      not get sick from it, but some people will develop active TB and become sick. Much is known
      about how to treat and diagnose active TB, but little is known about the best way to treat
      latent TB. Researchers also want to know more about the risk that latent TB will develop into
      active TB, and whether it is possible to test for this risk.

      Objectives:

      - To test possible methods of determining a person s risk for developing active TB.

      Eligibility:

      - Individuals between 20 and 60 years of age who (1) have active TB, (2) were exposed to
      someone with active TB in the past 9 months, or (3) have not been exposed to TB.

      Design:

        -  Participants will be separated into groups based on their exposure to TB.

        -  Healthy participants who were not exposed to TB will answer questions about their
           medical history. They will also provide blood and urine samples.

        -  Participants who have active TB will have a physical exam and medical history. They will
           provide blood, urine, and sputum samples, and will have a chest x-ray. They will be
           treated with the standard of care for active TB. Some participants with active TB may
           have additional tests as part of this study.

        -  Participants who were exposed to TB and have latent TB will have a physical exam and
           medical history. They will provide blood, urine, and sputum samples, and will have a
           chest x-ray. They will be asked to return for five more clinic visits over the next 12
           months to repeat these tests. They may also have additional chest imaging studies
           depending on the study needs.

        -  Some of the exposed participants may have been exposed to drug-resistant TB. These
           participants will receive the drug isoniazid to take on a regular schedule to help
           prevent the latent TB from becoming active TB.

    <textblock>
      The efficacy of treating tuberculin skin test (TST) positive, or interferon gamma release
      assay (IGRA) positive, contacts of tuberculosis (TB) cases to prevent progression to disease
      is well established. However the length of treatment, and the toxicity associated with the
      currently used regimens, means that the risk may outweigh the benefit and treatment
      completion rates are poor. In addition, no proven regimens are available for contacts of
      multidrug resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) cases. Because as few as 2% of contacts develop
      active TB over 1 year and no surrogate markers are available, drug trials to assess novel
      treatments typically require thousands of subjects followed up for many years.
      (18F)-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose positron emission tomography/computer tomography (FDG-PET/CT)
      may prove a useful surrogate for more targeted chemoprophylaxis as well as a means to rapidly
      evaluate novel prophylactic regimes in future studies.

      Up to 40% of immune-sensitized TB contacts with normal chest radiographs (CXR) have
      abnormalities on conventional chest CT. FDG-PET/CT not only will allow characterization of
      the metabolic activity of these lesions but is also likely to reveal significantly increased
      metabolic activity within regional lymph nodes that may otherwise be anatomically normal.
      Based on previous studies, we predict that up to 65% of contacts will have combined chest
      PET/CT abnormalities and that up to 50% of contacts who are treated, will have increased FDG
      uptake that will resolve with treatment. By contrast, PET screening studies demonstrate
      abnormal pulmonary FDG uptake occurs in 0.9% of healthy individuals.

      The development of biomarkers more predictive of disease progression is also highly
      desirable, but for similar reasons evaluating them is challenging. This novel approach of
      using FDG-PET/CT to benchmark the dynamic immunological, transcriptional, or metabolic
      changes that occur early in tuberculosis infection, we hope will accelerate biomarker
      discovery. In this study we propose to evaluate these predictions in order to lay the
      foundation for future studies.
