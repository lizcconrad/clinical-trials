      The objectives of the present trial are to test the following three hypotheses in anovulatory
      women with PCOS:

        1. Acupuncture protocol 1 plus CC (Arm A) is more likely to result in live birth than
           acupuncture protocol 2 combined with CC (Arm B),

        2. Acupuncture protocol 2 plus CC (Arm B) is more likely to result in live birth than
           acupuncture protocol 1 plus placebo (Arm C),

        3. Acupuncture protocol 1 plus placebo (Arm C) is more likely to result in live birth than
           acupuncture protocol 2 plus placebo (Arm D).

               -  Age of women between 20 and 40 years.

               -  Confirmed diagnosis of PCOS according to the modified Rotterdam criteria and all
                  subjects must have anovulation plus either polycystic ovaries and/or
                  hyperandro-genism.

               -  Patency of at least one tube and a normal uterine cavity shown by
                  hysterosalpingogram, HyCosi or diagnostic laparoscopy.

                    1. a. Sperm concentration ≥15×106/ml and b. total motility (a+b+c) ≥40% or
                       forward motility (a+b) ≥32% in the semen analysis of the husband (based on
                       World Health Organization, 2010).

                    2. Total motile sperm count ≥9 million [based on WHO (2010) criteria, volume
                       1.5 ml; conc 15 million; motility 40%. 1.5 x 15 x 0.04=9 million].

                       values). The goal of eliminating patients with documented hyperprolactinemia
                       is to decrease the heterogeneity of the PCOS population. These patients may
                       be candidates for ovulation induction with alternate regimens (dopamine
                       agonists). A normal level within the last year or on treatment is adequate

                       (including Implanon). A two month washout period will be required prior to
                       screening for patients on these agents. Longer washouts may be necessary for
                       certain depot contraceptive forms or implants, especially where the implants
                       are still in place. A one-month washout will be required for patients on
                       oral cyclic progestins.

                    -  Patients with liver disease defined as AST or ALT &gt; 2 times normal or total

                    -  Patients with a history of deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolus, or
                       cerebrovascular accident.

                    -  Patients with known heart disease that is likely to be exacerbated by
                       pregnancy.

                    -  Patients with a history of, or suspected cervical carcinoma, endometrial
                       carcinoma, or breast carcinoma. A normal Pap smear result will be required
                       for women 21 and over.

                    -  Patients with a current history of alcohol abuse. Alcohol abuse is defined
                       as &gt; 14 drinks/week or binge drinking.

                    -  Patients enrolled simultaneously into other investigative studies that
                       require medications, proscribe the study medications, limit intercourse, or
                       otherwise prevent compliance with the protocol.

                    -  Patients who anticipate taking longer than a one month break during the
                       protocol should not be enrolled.

                    -  Patients taking other medications known to affect reproductive function or
                       metabolism. These medications include oral contraceptives, GnRH agonists and
                       antagonists, antiandrogens, gonadotropins, anti-obesity drugs, Chinese
                       herbal formula, anti-diabetic drugs such as metformin and
                       thiazolidinediones, somatostatin, diazoxide, ACE inhibitors, and calcium
                       channel blockers. The washout period on all these medications will be two
                       months.

                    -  Patients with a suspected adrenal or ovarian tumor secreting androgens.

                    -  Couples with previous sterilization procedures (vasectomy, tubal ligation)
                       which have been reversed. The prior procedure may affect study outcomes, and
                       patients with both a reversed sterilization procedure and PCOS are rare
                       enough that exclusion should not adversely affect recruitment.

                    -  Subjects who have undergone a bariatric surgery procedure in the recent past
                       (&lt; 12 months) and are in a period of acute weight loss or have been advised
