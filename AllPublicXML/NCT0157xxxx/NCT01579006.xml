    <measure>Change From Baseline in Disease Activity Score Based on 28 Joints (DAS28) at Month 6</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>DAS28 was calculated from SJC and TJC using an assessment of 28 joints, the erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) (milliliter per hour [mm/hr]), and Patient's Global Assessment (PGH) of disease activity (measured on a 0 to 100 mm Visual Analogue Scale [VAS] where 0=no disease activity and 100=worst disease activity). DAS28 was calculated using the following formula: DAS28 = 0.56*square root (sqrt) (TJC28) + 0.28*sqrt(SJC28) + 0.70*natural logarithm (ln) (ESR) + 0.014*PGH of disease activity. Total score range: 0-10, with a higher score indicated more disease activity. DAS28 &lt;=3.2 implied low disease activity, DAS &gt;3.2 to 5.1 implied moderate disease activity and DAS &gt;5.1 implied high disease activity, and DAS28 &lt;2.6 = clinical remission.</description>

    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Clinical response assessed as per EULAR categorical DAS28 response criteria was defined as clinically meaningful improvement at a particular time point. EULAR response was based on change from baseline (CFB) in the DAS28 score and also on the actual DAS28 score at the time point so was more reflective of the current status of the participant. The DAS28 score was a measure of the participant's disease activity, based on the TJC (28 joints), SJC (28 joints), PGH (mm), and ESR (mm/hr). DAS28 total scores ranged from 0 to approximately 10. Scores &lt;2.6 = best disease control and scores &gt;5.1 = worse disease control. A negative CFB indicated clinically meaningful improvement. EULAR Good response: DAS28 &lt;=3.2 and a CFB &lt;-1.2. EULAR Moderate response: DAS28 &gt;3.2 to ≤ 5.1 or a CFB &lt; -0.6 to ≥ -1.2. EULAR No response: DAS28 ≤3.2 or CFB &gt;=-0.6, DAS28 &gt;3.2 to &lt;=5.1 or CFB &gt;=-0.6 and DAS28 &gt;5.1 or CFB &gt;=-0.6.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Disease Activity Score Based on 28 Joints (DAS28) at Month 6</title>
        <description>DAS28 was calculated from SJC and TJC using an assessment of 28 joints, the erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) (milliliter per hour [mm/hr]), and Patient’s Global Assessment (PGH) of disease activity (measured on a 0 to 100 mm Visual Analogue Scale [VAS] where 0=no disease activity and 100=worst disease activity). DAS28 was calculated using the following formula: DAS28 = 0.56*square root (sqrt) (TJC28) + 0.28*sqrt(SJC28) + 0.70*natural logarithm (ln) (ESR) + 0.014*PGH of disease activity. Total score range: 0-10, with a higher score indicated more disease activity. DAS28 &lt;=3.2 implied low disease activity, DAS &gt;3.2 to 5.1 implied moderate disease activity and DAS &gt;5.1 implied high disease activity, and DAS28 &lt;2.6 = clinical remission.</description>

        <description>Clinical response assessed as per EULAR categorical DAS28 response criteria was defined as clinically meaningful improvement at a particular time point. EULAR response was based on change from baseline (CFB) in the DAS28 score and also on the actual DAS28 score at the time point so was more reflective of the current status of the participant. The DAS28 score was a measure of the participant's disease activity, based on the TJC (28 joints), SJC (28 joints), PGH (mm), and ESR (mm/hr). DAS28 total scores ranged from 0 to approximately 10. Scores &lt;2.6 = best disease control and scores &gt;5.1 = worse disease control. A negative CFB indicated clinically meaningful improvement. EULAR Good response: DAS28 &lt;=3.2 and a CFB &lt;-1.2. EULAR Moderate response: DAS28 &gt;3.2 to ≤ 5.1 or a CFB &lt; -0.6 to ≥ -1.2.

        <title>Change From Baseline in Clinical Disease Activity Index (CDAI) Score at Month 6</title>
        <description>The CDAI was a combined index for measuring disease activity in RA and used to evaluate disease activity in the absence of laboratory testing of CRP and ESR. It was the numerical sum of 4 outcome parameters: TJC and SJC based on a 28-joint assessment, PGH and PhGH (assessed on 0-100 mm); VAS (0 = no disease activity and 100 = worst disease activity). CDAI total score = 0-76. A CDAI score of &lt;=2.8 represented clinical remission, a score of &lt;=10.0 represented low disease activity, a score of &lt;=22.0 represented moderate disease activity and a score of &gt;22.0 represented high (or severe) disease.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in HAQ-DI at Month 6</title>
        <description>The HAQ-DI was a participant self-reported questionnaire for assessing the extent of a participant’s functional ability. It consisted of 20 questions in 8 categories (dressing and grooming, rising, eating, walking, reach, grip, hygiene, and carrying out daily activities). Each question had 4 response options, ranging from “no difficulty” to “unable to do”, corresponding to scores from 0 to 3. The HAQ-DI scale was an average of all the scores and ranged from 0 to 3, where higher scores represented higher disease activity. A score of &lt;0.5 represented clinical remission. A participant achieved a clinically meaningful improvement in HAQ-DI if they had a reduction from baseline of &gt;=0.22.</description>

        <title>Change From Administration 1 in Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy (FACIT)- Fatigue Questionnaire at Month 6</title>
        <description>The FACIT Measurement System was a collection of health-related quality of life questionnaires targeted to the management of chronic illness and included questions on Physical Well-Being, Social/Family Well-Being, Emotional Well-Being and Functional Well-Being. The FACIT Fatigue Scale was a 13-item tool that measured an individual’s level of fatigue during their usual daily activities over the past week. The level of fatigue was measured on a five-point Likert scale (4 = not at all fatigued to 0 = very much fatigued). The total score of FACIT ranged from 0 to 160. An increase of 4 points in the FACIT-Fatigue score was considered clinically meaningful. Change from Administration 1 was reported for individual administration schedules. TCZ was administered every 4 weeks according to the label. Due to the observational nature of the study, the suggested schedule was subject to changes according to physician and participant considerations.</description>
