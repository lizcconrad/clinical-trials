      The aim of this study is to evaluate the usefulness of magnifying colonoscopy with narrow
      band imaging.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The accuracy of histologic prediction for the colorectal polyps with the use of narrow band
      imaging is evaluated between the test group with magnifying colonoscopy and the control group
      without magnifying colonoscopy.

    <measure>Accuracy of colorectal polyp histologic prediction with NBI colonoscopy plus magnification</measure>
    <time_frame>After 1 week</time_frame>
    <description>After radomization of the subjects into two groups(1) NBI with magnification, 2) without magnification), one experienced endoscopist records its site, size, shape, and predicted histologic diagnosis on the every polyp observed and endoscopically resected. After 1 week, confirmed pathologic diagnosis and predicted histologic diagnosis based on endoscopic observation are compared and its accuracy is evaluated.</description>
