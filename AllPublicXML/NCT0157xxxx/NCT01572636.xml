    <textblock>
      This is a standard of care treatment guideline for patients with the diagnosis of
      mucopolysaccharidosis type IH (MPS I, Hurler syndrome) who are being considered as candidates
      for first hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) according to a University of
      Minnesota myeloablative HSCT protocol.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Laronidase Enzyme Replacement Therapy will be performed using laronidase once a week for 12
      weeks prior to hematopoietic stem cell transplantation and for 8 weeks post-transplant to
      reduce pulmonary complications.

    <description>The incidence of donor engraftment will be estimated by taking the simple proportion of patients achieving donor engraftment over the number of evaluable patients. Donor engraftment will be defined as achieving an absolute neutrophil count â‰¥ 5x10^8/kg for three consecutive days before day 42 and maintenance of &gt;10% donor chimerism through one year post transplant or death.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>

    <description>Cumulative incidence will be used to estimate grade III-IV acute GvHD, treating death as a competing risk.</description>
