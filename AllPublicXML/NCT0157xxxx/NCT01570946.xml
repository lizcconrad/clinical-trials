  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Primary prevention of diabetes is of paramount importance in both developed and in developing
      countries. Several studies including the Indian Diabetes Prevention Programmes have shown
      that Lifestyle modification in people with prediabetes can reduce the progression to diabetes
      by 58%. However, there are two main problems in applying diabetes prevention strategies to
      the population as a whole. (1) Trial based interventions are unrealistic on a population
      level in any country. (2) The oral glucose tolerance test applied so far to identify those at
      high risk is a poorly reproducible and time consuming test both for the participant and for
      health care workers. Hence more practical means of defining individuals who would benefit
      from lifestyle intervention are required.

      The current study proposes a prevention strategy that will employ a lifestyle modification
      programme delivered by text messaging in both India and the UK.Subjects will be identified
      based on the HbA1c measurement instead of the oral glucose tolerance test. The study will
      also assess the efficacy, acceptability and cost effectiveness of mobile phone based
      intervention both in India and the UK.

      Messages will be based to deliver education, treatment targets, advice, support and
      motivation. Subjects will be invited to participate and, once recruited, will be randomised
      to usual care or the SMS intervention group.

      Usual care will consist of a one-to-one 30 minute interview, conducted by the research team,
      delivering personalised diet and exercise advice.

      The intervention group will undergo the same initial interview and, in addition, will receive
      3 times weekly text messaging with education, advice, support and motivation. These messages
      will be personalised to individual targets set at the initial interview.

      Primary Outcome:Progression to Diabetes Secondary Outcomes will be based on Physical activity
      / Cardiovascular risk factors/and quality of life.

      The study programme is compatible with major initiatives in both the UK and India for the
      prevention of diabetes and cardiovascular disease (CVD).
