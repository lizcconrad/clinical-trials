      Objective of this pivotal study was to assess the bioequivalence between Test Product:
      Ondansetron Tablets USP 8 mg of M/s Ipca Laboratories Limited, India and the corresponding
      Reference Product: Zofran® (Ondansetron hydrochloride) 8 mg Tablets of M/s GlaxoSmithKline,
      under fasting condition in normal, healthy, adult, human subjects in a randomized crossover
      study.

      The study was conducted with 48 healthy adult subjects. In each study period, a single 8 mg
      dose of either test or reference was administered to the subjects as per the randomization
      schedule in each study period with about 240 mL of water at ambient temperature in sitting
      position.

      The duration of the clinical phase was approximately 11 days including washout period of at
      least 7 days between administrations of study drug in each study period.
