  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of the present investigator-initiated mono-center trial to be performed at the
      Department of Neurology of the University Hospital Zurich is a detailed characterization of
      the effects of prolonged-release fampridine on walking function of 50-70 patients with MS. In
      a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study with cross-over design, changes of
      essential gait elements such as stability, coordination, correct loading, posture or
      endurance in addition to walking speed after treatment with prolonged-release fampridine will
      be investigated using a comprehensive kinematic gait analysis protocol. This protocol
      comprises outcome parameters ranging from very specific and sensitive biomechanical measures
      to clinically meaningful indicators of improved ambulatory function. Kinematic, kinetic and
      electromyographic gait parameters will be assessed during treadmill walking (primary outcome
      parameters). Changes in overground walking capacity will be investigated by means of
      different functional walking tests (e.g. six minute walk test). Furthermore, the patient's
      perception of the effects of the treatment on walking function will be evaluated by a
      standardized questionnaire. Changes of global ambulatory activity will be assessed
      (Actimeter) indicating a successful translation of improved gait (sub-)functions due to
      prolonged-release fampridine treatment into everyday life. The study will last for a period
      of 18 weeks, excluding the screening period. Based on the mechanism of action, the
      investigators hypothesize that treatment with prolonged-release fampridine will not only
      improve walking speed, but also clinically more meaningful features of walking function in
      patients with MS.
