  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether acupuncture treatment(Individualized &amp;
      Standardized Acupuncture) is more effective than control (sham acupuncture or no treatment)
      and also whether individualized acupuncture is more effective than standardized acupuncture.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      To determine whether individualized acupuncture is more effective than standardized
      acupuncture, 276 Low Back Pain patients will be recruited and randomly assigned to 4 separate
      groups.

      Experimental groups(Individualized Acupuncture Group and Standardized Acupuncture Group) and
      Control groups (Sham acupuncture and waiting list)

      The change of pain and physical functions will be compared among the four groups.

      So the efficacy of acupuncture, and the best acupuncture treatment model will be determined.
      Also in addition, safety and abnormal reactions of acupuncture treatments will be evaluated.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>The change of 100mm pain Visual Analog Scale(VAS) after 6 weeks of treatment.</measure>
    <time_frame>at baseline and after 6 weeks of treatment.</time_frame>
    <description>Visual analog scale (VAS) is a tool used to measure pain. The patient is asked to indicate their perceived pain intensity along a 100 mm horizontal line, where '0' represents 'no pain' and '100', 'unbearable pain'. The change of pain will be reported by comparing the mean VAS before treatment and after the 6 week trearment period.</description>

    <measure>Roland - Morris Disability Questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>at 2nd(baseline), 8th(after 4 weeks of treatment), 13th(end of study) and 14th(follow up) visit</time_frame>
    <description>Roland - Morris Disability Questionnaire (RMDQ) is scored by adding up the number of items checked by the patients, among the 24 items concerning various disablilities caused by low back pain. The score can therefore vary from 0 to 24. Higher the scores represent worse disabilities.</description>

    <time_frame>at 2nd(baseline), 8th(after 4 weeks of treatment), 13th(end of study) and 14th(follow up) visit</time_frame>
    <description>The 36 questions yields an 8-scale health profile. It is useful in monitoring the change in health related quality of life.</description>

    <description>Any unpredicted symptoms were checked at each follow up visit and if any, the symptom, time of occurrence, and length of duration were recorded and reported.</description>
