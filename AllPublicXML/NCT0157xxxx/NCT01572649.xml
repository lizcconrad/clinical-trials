      Primary Objective:

      - To investigate the effects of two single subcutaneous lixisenatide doses (5 and 10 µg) as
      compared to placebo in reducing postprandial glucose (PPG) in type 2 diabetic paediatric
      population (10-17 years old) and adults as controls

      Secondary Objectives:

      - To evaluate in both paediatric and adult populations:

        -  the blood levels of lixisenatide (pharmacokinetic) parameters in plasma after single
           subcutaneous ascending doses

        -  the maximum post-prandial glucose excursion, and on the changes in insulin, C-peptide
           and glucagon plasma concentrations following a standardized breakfast

        -  safety and tolerability.

      The duration of the study for each patient is planned between 4 and 7 weeks including a
      screening period (25 to 30 days), 3 treatment periods 1-7 days apart, each period lasting
      only one day (Day 1) and an end-of-study visit between 1 to 7 days after the last dose
      administration.
