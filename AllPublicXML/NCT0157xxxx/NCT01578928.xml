  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the effect of renal impairment on the pharmacokinetics
      (PK) of pasireotide,the PK of pasireotide in subjects with different degrees of renal
      impairment.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase I, open-label, multicenter, single dose study to evaluate the PK and safety
      of pasireotide s.c. injection in subjects with varying degrees of renal impairment compared
      to healthy subjects with normal renal function. Subjects will be classified by their
      respective degree of renal functions (normal, mild, moderate, severe, and ESRD (End Stage
      Renal Disease) according to eGFR as determined at the screening visit.
