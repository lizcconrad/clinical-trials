      The purpose of this study is to test label comprehension and usability of the hair removal
      device in 60 male and female participants. The study population will represent the US
      demographic distribution of skin types and will include varying levels of literacy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This will be a single-visit study consisting of two phases: Phase I - assessing label
      comprehension and Phase II - usability. For Phase I, subjects will be asked to review the
      outer packaging of the mē device. Each subject will be taken through an interview which will
      evaluate messages on the external product labeling regarding product use and self-selection
      criteria. Subjects, who are not self-excluders and/or contraindicated for use of the device
      will continue with Phase II of the study. This usability phase will consist of watching the
      instructional DVD, reading the User Guide and then performing a skin sensitivity test.
      Subjects will be expected to self-administer the hair removal treatment in a simulated
      home-use environment under observation of the study personnel. The users will have a
      telephone in the room and may call a phone number and request assistance while performing the
      treatment, simulating the toll-free hotline that will be available to consumers in commercial
      use.

    <description>Label comprehension will be based on responses to a questionnaire. Questions will be based on a tiered system by level of importance in responding correctly according to the following:
Questions regarding safe use of the system.
Questions regarding correct use of the system(not related to safety).
In order to demonstrate how well the label instruction, as a whole, was understood by all subjects, the proportion of subjects who correctly understood the label as a whole was calculated by classifying each subject as either a &quot;responder&quot; or &quot;non-responder&quot; based on the following criteria regarding all questions:
A subject was considered a responder if he/she correctly answered 11/12 questions related to safety AND 5/6 low category questions not related to safety.
The study was considered a success if the response rate (i.e., the proportion of subjects correctly understanding the label based on the responder criteria) was at least 90%.</description>

      <desc>The label comprehension phase of the study did not involve a treatment with the device. Of the 63 participant of the label comprehension phase, 47 subjects who were not self-excluders continued to the usability phase that included a treatment. Therefore the number of &quot;at risk&quot; individuals is 47 and not the original 63.</desc>
