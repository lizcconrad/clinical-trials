  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators overall research hypothesis is that systemic chemotherapy induces
      structural changes in the white matter of the brain as demonstrated with Diffusion Tensor
      Imaging (DTI) and functional changes in well-defined cortical neural networks as demonstrated
      by resting-state functional connectivity MRI (rs-fcMRI). The investigators believe these
      structural and functional changes are responsible for the cognitive symptoms associated with
      chemotherapy-induced cognitive impairment (CICI).

      The Specific Aim for this study is:

      To assess the impact of chemotherapy on structural white matter as defined by DTI and
      functional cognitive networks as defined by rs-fcMRI by comparing a sample of breast cancer
      survivors with self-reported CICI to breast cancer survivors without CICI.

      Hypothesis: Post-chemotherapy breast cancer patients with self-reported CICI will have
      abnormal structural connections characterized by DTI-defined disruptions in fractional
      anisotropy (FA) and mean diffusivity (MD) and abnormal functional connectivity characterized
      by rs-fcMRI-defined disruptions in cognitive networks when compared to patients without
      self-reported CICI.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Chemotherapy has been linked to cognitive impairments among breast cancer patients,
      especially in the domains of executive function (planning and problem solving), attention,
      learning, and information processing. The etiology of these chemotherapy-associated
      impairments remains unknown, although recent neuroimaging studies suggest that disruption of
      white matter integrity may play a role. With continued use of chemotherapy in breast cancer
      patients, this study's novel use of functional neuroimaging will be significant to better
      inform practitioners and patients of potential consequences to anticipate and serve as a
      starting point in the development of therapeutic interventions.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Inclusion Criteria (Phase I and II):

               -  Participants must be females between 35 and 70 years of age.

               -  Participants must have been diagnosed with breast cancer and completed
                  chemotherapy,within the preceding 2 years.

               -  Participants must have completed their intended full course of chemotherapy
                  regimen at least 30 days prior to participation.

               -  Participants must have been diagnosed with invasive ductal or lobular BrCa Stages
                  I, II, or III (American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) staging manual, 7th
                  edition, 2010).

        Inclusion Criteria (Phase II)

          -  Participants must be able to read, write, and speak English fluently.

          -  Participants must be able to provide a valid informed consent.

          -  Participants must have a life expectancy of greater than 6 months at the time they are
