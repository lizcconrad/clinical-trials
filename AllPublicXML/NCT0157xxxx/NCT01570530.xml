      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of atorvastatin therapy (both
      during preoperative and postoperative period), as prophylaxis against postoperative atrial
      fibrillation after cardiac surgery, in a valve disease patient population (with or without
      associated coronary artery disease), with no previous history of atrial fibrillation and not
      receiving beta-blocking drugs.
