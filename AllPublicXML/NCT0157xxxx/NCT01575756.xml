    <measure>Ratio of Octafibrin/FIBRYGA® to Haemocomplettan® P/RiaSTAP(TM) for Fibrinogen Activity Normalized Area Under the Curve Unstandardized</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 8, 24, 48, 96, 144, 216, and 312 hours post-treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Fibrinogen activity was determined via a validated Clauss assay (fibrinogen activity) and fibrinogen-specific enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ie, fibrinogen antigen) using paired antibodies for fibrinogen antigen. All determinations were performed on frozen plasma samples in a central laboratory. The Clauss assay was modified and validated to achieve a limit of quantification of 0.2 g/L. The pharmacokinetic analysis was assessed individually using a non-compartmental model. Plasma levels were measured at Baseline, and at 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 8, 24, 48, 96, 144, 216, and 312 hours post-treatment. The mean ratio of normalized area under the curve was calculated as Octafibrin/FIBRYGA® over Haemocomplettan® P/RiaSTAP(TM)</description>

    <measure>Comparison of Maximum Clot Firmness Between Octafibrin/FIBRYGA® and Haemocomplettan® P/RiaSTAP(TM) at 1 hr Post Infusion</measure>
    <time_frame>1 hour post-treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Thromboelastometry (ROTEM®) was used to measure maximum clot firmness. Thromboelastometry is a method for the continuous measurement of clot formation. Maximum clot firmness is a functional parameter that depends on the activation of coagulation, the platelet and fibrinogen content of the blood sample, and the polymerisation and cross-linking of the fibrin network. In order to obtain comparable results from all study centres, maximum clot firmness data were assessed from frozen citrated plasma samples in a central laboratory. As these samples did not contain platelets that would be found in the whole blood assay, the fibrinogen content primarily defined the maximum clot firmness.</description>

        <title>Ratio of Octafibrin/FIBRYGA® to Haemocomplettan® P/RiaSTAP(TM) for Fibrinogen Activity Normalized Area Under the Curve Unstandardized</title>
        <description>Fibrinogen activity was determined via a validated Clauss assay (fibrinogen activity) and fibrinogen-specific enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ie, fibrinogen antigen) using paired antibodies for fibrinogen antigen. All determinations were performed on frozen plasma samples in a central laboratory. The Clauss assay was modified and validated to achieve a limit of quantification of 0.2 g/L. The pharmacokinetic analysis was assessed individually using a non-compartmental model. Plasma levels were measured at Baseline, and at 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 8, 24, 48, 96, 144, 216, and 312 hours post-treatment. The mean ratio of normalized area under the curve was calculated as Octafibrin/FIBRYGA® over Haemocomplettan® P/RiaSTAP(TM)</description>

        <title>Comparison of Maximum Clot Firmness Between Octafibrin/FIBRYGA® and Haemocomplettan® P/RiaSTAP(TM) at 1 hr Post Infusion</title>
        <description>Thromboelastometry (ROTEM®) was used to measure maximum clot firmness. Thromboelastometry is a method for the continuous measurement of clot formation. Maximum clot firmness is a functional parameter that depends on the activation of coagulation, the platelet and fibrinogen content of the blood sample, and the polymerisation and cross-linking of the fibrin network. In order to obtain comparable results from all study centres, maximum clot firmness data were assessed from frozen citrated plasma samples in a central laboratory. As these samples did not contain platelets that would be found in the whole blood assay, the fibrinogen content primarily defined the maximum clot firmness.</description>

        <description>Fibrinogen activity was determined via a validated Clauss assay (fibrinogen activity) and fibrinogen-specific enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ie, fibrinogen antigen) using paired antibodies for fibrinogen antigen. All determinations were performed on frozen plasma samples in a central laboratory. The Clauss assay was modified and validated to achieve a limit of quantification of 0.2 g/L. The pharmacokinetic analysis was assessed individually using a non-compartmental model. Plasma levels were measured at Baseline, and at 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 8, 24, 48, 96, 144, 216, and 312 hours post-treatment.</description>

All determinations were performed on frozen plasma samples in a central laboratory. The Clauss assay was modified and validated to achieve a limit of quantification of 0.2 g/L. The pharmacokinetic analysis was assessed individually using a non-compartmental model.
