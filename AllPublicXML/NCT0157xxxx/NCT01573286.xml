    <textblock>
      This protocol outlines a randomized,open label trial examining the safety, pharmacology and
      efficacy of Glucagon like peptide 2 (GLP-2) in infants and children with intestinal failure.
      The investigators hypothesize that GLP-2 given subcutaneously in these patients will be well
      tolerated, and have similar metabolism to what has been shown in adults. The investigators
      also expect to show an improvement in the tolerance of enteral nutrition, and a decreased
      requirement for intravenous feeding.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      GLP-2 (1-33) is a naturally occurring peptide which is important in controlling the function
      of the intestine. In previous studies our group has shown that serum levels of GLP-2
      correlate with intestinal function in human neonates. Low levels of GLP-2 are predictive of
      intestinal malabsorption and the development of the so called &quot;Short Bowel Syndrome&quot;. GLP-2
      has been shown to be specifically trophic for the GI tract, especially for the small
      intestine.

      This proposal outlines a Phase 1 and 2 trial using subcutaneous administration, twice daily
      of GLP-2 in human infants and children with Intestinal Failure, typically from Short Bowel
      Syndrome, using varying doses, assigned in a prospective, randomized protocol, with open
      label monitoring.

      The investigational plan is to begin with the Phase 1 trial, administering GLP 2 at varying
      doses (infants assigned to doses of 5,10, or 20 μg/kg/day, children greater than 1 year dosed
      at 20 μg/kg/day, given via twice daily subcutaneous injection).

      Eligible subjects will be infants (less than 12 months corrected gestational age) with either
      major resection (remaining small intestine less than 40% of predicted length for gestational
      age), or demonstrated intestinal failure after intestinal resection/abdominal
      surgery/gastroschisis (Requirement for parenteral nutrition greater than 50% of total
      calories, more than 45 days after the last surgery).

      Infants will be allocated sequentially to a group (n = 6 per group) treated with GLP-2 at
      5,10, or 20 μg/kg/day.

      Older children (greater than 1 year of age), requiring PN for &gt;30% calories&gt; one year post
      surgery will also be eligible; these patients will be dosed at 20 μg/kg/day (via twice daily
      subcutaneous injection) n= 7.

      Patients will be followed on the principle of intention to treat after initial randomization.
      The endpoints will be monitoring for safety, and recording of adverse events and a
      pharmacokinetic profile at 3 days.

      If the hormone is well tolerated these studies will be extended into a phase 2 study, for an
      additional 39 days; monitoring safety, patient tolerance of enteral nutrition, growth,
      citrulline levels, nutrient absorptive capacity, liver function and repeat pharmacokinetic
      studies.
