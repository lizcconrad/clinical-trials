  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect of food on aliskiren's efficacy,
      pharmacokinetics and safety following an oral dose of 300 mg, given once daily under light
      meal versus fasted conditions.

    <measure>Change From Baseline (Visit 3) to End of Study (Week 8) in Mean 24 Hour Ambulatory Systolic Blood Pressure (maSBP)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, week 8</time_frame>
    <description>24 hour ambulatory blood pressure measurement (ABPM) were taken twice, at baseline and at the end of 8 weeks. An Ambulatory Blood Pressure Monitoring device (ABPM) was attached to the non-dominant arm. The mean change of 24 hours maSBP from baseline to week 8 was estimated using an Analysis of Covariance (ANCOVA) model by using treatment, region as factors, and baseline as covariate.</description>

    <measure>Percentage of Patients Achieving Blood Pressure Control</measure>
    <time_frame>8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Patients achieving blood pressure control were patients who, at week 8, had a mean sitting systolic blood pressure (msSBP)/ mean sitting diastolic blood pressure (msDBP) &lt; 140/90 mmHg</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline (Visit 3) to End of Study (8 Weeks) in Mean Sitting Systolic Blood Pressure (msSBP) and Mean Sitting Diastolic Blood Pressure (msDBP)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 8</time_frame>
    <description>Sitting blood pressure (BP) was measured at trough (approximately 24 hours ± 3 hours post dose) and recorded at all study visits. At the first study visit, the BP was checked in both arms and the arm with higher systolic BP (SBP) was used for all subsequent readings throughout the study. At each study visit, after the patient had been sitting for five minutes, systolic and diastolic blood pressures (msSBP and msDBP) were measured four times using a standard mercury sphygmomanometer and appropriate size cuff. The repeat sitting measurements were made at 2 minute intervals and the mean of all four sitting blood pressure measurements was used as the average sitting office blood pressure for that visit. The analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model used treatment, region as factors, and baseline as covariate.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 8</time_frame>
    <description>Successful response in systolic blood pressure reduction at end of 8-week treatment was defined as msSBP &lt;140 mmHg or a reduction in msSBP ≥ 20 mmHg from baseline.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline (Visit 3) to End of Study (8 Weeks) in Mean Sitting Systolic Blood Pressure (msSBP) and Mean Sitting Diastolic Blood Pressure (msDBP)</title>
        <description>Sitting blood pressure (BP) was measured at trough (approximately 24 hours ± 3 hours post dose) and recorded at all study visits. At the first study visit, the BP was checked in both arms and the arm with higher systolic BP (SBP) was used for all subsequent readings throughout the study. At each study visit, after the patient had been sitting for five minutes, systolic and diastolic blood pressures (msSBP and msDBP) were measured four times using a standard mercury sphygmomanometer and appropriate size cuff. The repeat sitting measurements were made at 2 minute intervals and the mean of all four sitting blood pressure measurements was used as the average sitting office blood pressure for that visit. The analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model used treatment, region as factors, and baseline as covariate.</description>
