    <textblock>
      This study is a multisite, randomized clinical trial to determine the effectiveness of an
      8-week rehabilitative exercise regime performed by patients with swallowing problems, termed
      dysphagia, compared to a control group of patients with swallowing problems who do not
      exercise, but receive standard clinical care. One hundred male and female patients will take
      part in this study from eight participating facilities around the country.

    <measure>Change in Swallow Function</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 8 Weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Primary Outcome will be objectively measured from videofluoroscopic images. Improvement in swallowing is defined as a reduction in either the average Penetration/Aspiration scale score or the average Residue Scale score over the 11 swallows (3 3-ml thin liquid, 3 10-ml thin liquid, 3 3-ml semi-solid and 2 3-ml thin liquid effortful) combined with no increase in the other average score. If the series of swallows is terminated prematurely, the worst possible score (8 for Penetration/Aspiration Scale, 2 for residue) will be assigned for all uncompleted swallows.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Penetration/Aspiration Scale score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 8</time_frame>
    <description>An 8-point scale indicating occurrence, depth, clearance and patient response to material invading the laryngeal vestibule or trachea. The Penetration/Aspiration Scale score will be objectively measured from videofluoroscopic images.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Residue Scale score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 8</time_frame>
    <description>A 3-point scale to measure post-swallow barium residue on a videofluoroscopic image. The Residue Scale score will be objectively measured from videofluoroscopic images.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Quality of Life</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 8 Weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Each subject will complete a questionnaire detailing his/her quantity and variety of nutritional intake and also will complete a questionnaire (Swal-Qol) about the impact of dysphagia on his/her quality of life at baseline and week 8. It takes approximately 10 minutes to complete each questionnaire.</description>

    <description>Standard swallowing intervention is that which is identified by the SLP as appropriate to treat the patient's dysphagia and is in common clinical practice. Such treatment would consist of dietary or postural compensatory strategies (i.e., chin down posture while swallowing).</description>

    <arm_group_type>Experimental</arm_group_type>
    <description>Standard Clinical Care Plus 8-week Isometric Lingual Exercise Regimen. The isometric tongue exercises will be completed using the Madison Oral Strengthening Therapeutic (MOST) device. Baseline maximum lingual pressure will be obtained at the anterior and posterior sensors independently by gathering two sets of data (3 MOST device trials) at each site (anterior and posterior) that differ by less that 5%. During week one of the regimen, the target value of each repetition will be 60% of the maximum baseline pressure. For the remaining seven weeks of the program, the target value will be increased to 80% of the maximum. At weeks three, five, and seven, the baseline will be re-measured by phone and the 80% target value re-calculated.</description>

    <description>Tongue press exercises consist of pressing the tongue against the sensors. Isometric exercises will focus on the anterior and posterior sensor. Subjects will be given a target pressure value for both the anterior and posterior sensor locations for which to aim when doing the exercises. Visual feedback on the display will signal the subject that they have attained their target pressure goal.</description>
