  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to empower women to improve their health in two very important
      areas: breast and heart health. This twelve-month study will compare two methods of informing
      participants about potential health risks and ways to stay healthy.

      The EMPOWER Study has been designed for adult women who were treated for a childhood cancer
      with chest radiation.

    <measure>Moderating factors</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>By including interaction terms in the model, we will assess potential moderating factors such as age, race/ethnicity, health insurance, &amp; other sociodemographic variables. Moderating effects can be adequately addressed through interactions between the intervention &amp; the above mentioned covariates.124 An interaction with the treatment group indicator suggests differential effectiveness, and moderator variables with statistically significant interactions will remain in the model. Interactions will be estimated using crossproduct terms between the intervention indicator &amp; the mediating variable.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Mediating factors</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Based on results from the MPS &amp; breast ca screening intervention trials among women in the general pop or familial risk, we are a priori interested in mediating effect of 5 variable domains: knowledge of screening guidelines, breast ca health beliefs, decisional balance of the pros &amp; cons of mammography, self-efficacy, &amp; psychological factors. For each of these domains, a global or subscale score will be used as appropriate. For ex, from the BSI-18, a global score of psychological symptoms &amp; a subscale score for each group of symptoms can be estimated.</description>

    <description>The EMPOWER intervention trial is a 12-month study of 360 women from the Childhood Cancer Survivor Study who have previously been treated with chest radiation, are 25 to 49 years of age at the time of enrollment, are 8 years or more since their chest radiation, and have not had a mammogram or other breast imaging study in the preceding two years. Following a baseline questionnaire, participants will be randomized to the attention control group (N=120) or the intervention group (N=240).</description>
