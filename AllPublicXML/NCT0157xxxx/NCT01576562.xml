  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to test the function of a subjects implantable
      cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) function throughout the duration of their heart surgery. ICD
      function can be altered during some types of heart surgery such as those when a pump
      (ventricular assist device - VAD) is implanted. The investigators would like to study the
      mechanism of device and ICD malfunction.

    <textblock>
      ICD function is typically measured prior to and after surgery. For the study, the
      investigators will measure ICD lead function multiple times throughout the surgery as well,
      to determine if and when device malfunction occurs. ICD lead function is measured
      noninvasively through a specialized computer the same way it is checked in the clinic. In
      addition, the investigators will test ICD function as they usually do following surgery.
