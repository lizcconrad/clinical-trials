  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Self-expanding metallic stent placement is a safe and effective endoscopic procedure
      increasingly used to relieve colonic obstruction. Fully covered metal stents (FCSEMS) and
      plastic stents have been recently developed to reduce both hyperplastic (non tumoral) and
      tumoral tissue ingrowth. These fully covered metal or plastic stents have several advantages
      over non-covered stents, including the possibility of retrieval and limited local tissue
      reaction, while providing alleviation of obstruction at possibly lower costs. Only few
      reports of fully covered metal stent placement in patients with benign colorectal strictures
      are available in the literature. The aim of this study was to assess the effectiveness of
      FCSEMS in the management of the colonic benign strictures.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      It is a national multicentric retrospective study on the use of fully covered metal stent
      placement in patients with benign colorectal strictures.

      Consecutive patients above 18 years of age with a symptomatic benign colonic stricture
      despite optimal medical and/or endoscopic dilation therapy and which required the use of a
      FCSEMS were included. All strictures were confirmed to be benign by histology. All details
      concerning previous history, origins and treatment (medical or endoscopic) of the colonic
      stenosis were collected from the medical file.

      Senior endoscopists with an experience of more than 50 colonic stent placements performed the
      procedure under general propofol-induced anesthesia with the same technic (The stent was
      placed under fluoroscopic and videoendoscopic controls).

      Patients were required after the procedure to take oral osmotic laxatives regularly.
      Post-stenting complications were defined as immediate (during the procedure), early
      (occurring ≤ 30 days) and late (&gt; 30 days) after the procedure. Stent removal and routine
      follow up endoscopy were scheduled 4 to 6 weeks after placement in most patients or earlier
      if complications occurred.

      All patients were followed up at regular intervals based on their clinical situation. A
      retrospective chart review was performed to analyze the long-term outcome of the patients.
