  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Pregnancy and childbirth are known risk factors for development of female urinary
      incontinence (UI). Studies have found that Pelvic Floor Mucle Trainig (PFMT) is effective in
      preventing and reducing UI during pregnancy and after childbirth. However, in a recent study,
      no effect was found when PFMT were taught in a general fitness class without former palpation
      of the pelvic floor muscles (Bo y Haakstad, 2011).
