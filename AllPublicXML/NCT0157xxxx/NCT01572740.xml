    <textblock>
      This trial is conducted in Asia. The purpose of the trial is to investigate the efficacy and
      safety of liraglutide in combination with insulin therapy compared to insulin alone in
      Japanese subjects with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Subjects will remain on their pre-trial
      insulin therapy.

          <description>Liraglutide was administered subcutaneously (s.c., under the skin) once daily (OD) for 36 weeks combined with insulin therapy. The starting dose of the liraglutide was 0.3 mg (50 μL)/day; dose was escalated to 0.6 mg (100 μL)/day and 0.9 mg (150 μL)/day during first 2 weeks; dose was maintained at 0.9 mg (150 μL)/day for subsequent 34 weeks.
All subjects continued their pre-trial insulin therapy (basal: once daily [OD] or twice daily [BID], premixed: OD or BID or basal-bolus regimen [basal: OD or BID and bolus: three times a day]). Insulin dose was not changed for any subject for the first 16 weeks and for the subsequent 20 weeks, insulin dose was individually adjusted.</description>

The starting dose of the liraglutide was 0.3 mg (50 μL)/day; dose was escalated to 0.6 mg (100 μL)/day and 0.9 mg (150 μL)/day during first 2 weeks; dose was maintained at 0.9 mg (150 μL)/day for subsequent 34 weeks.
All subjects continued their pre-trial insulin therapy (basal: once daily [OD] or twice daily [BID], premixed: OD or BID or basal-bolus regimen [basal: OD or BID and bolus: three times a day]). Insulin dose was not changed for any subject for the first 16 weeks and for the subsequent 20 weeks, insulin dose was individually adjusted.</description>

The starting dose of the placebo was 50 μL/day; dose was escalated to100 μL/day and 150 μL/day during first 2 weeks; dose was maintained at 150 μL/day for subsequent 34 weeks.
All subjects continued their pre-trial insulin therapy (basal: once daily [OD] or twice daily [BID], premixed: OD or BID or basal-bolus regimen [basal: OD or BID and bolus: three times a day]). Insulin dose was not changed for any subject for the first 16 weeks and for the subsequent 20 weeks, insulin dose was individually adjusted.</description>
