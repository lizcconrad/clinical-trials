    <textblock>
      People who originate from the Indian subcontinent known as South Asians are the fastest
      growing group of non-white Canadians. They suffer an excess prevalence of abdominal obesity,
      type 2 diabetes and heart disease. They also develop these risk factors at significantly
      lower body weight and at younger ages compared to people of European origin. The purpose of
      SAHARA (South Asian HeArt Risk Assessment) Pilot, is to recruit 400 South Asians from
      Ontario, who use the internet, email and other multimedia devices. Among these participants
      the investigators will compare the effectiveness of a 6-month interactive multi-media health
      behaviour intervention to usual care in reducing cardiac risk factors. This intervention
      enables participants to set their health goals and provides health messaging and feedback
      designed to improve their smoking, dietary habits and physical activity. In addition, the
      investigators will test if knowledge of genetic risk for heart attack influences behaviour
      change and their heart health risk factor profile. The information generated from SAHARA will
      enable individuals, physicians, health professionals, and policy makers to develop risk
      factor modification programs to prevent cardiovascular disease in this high-risk group.

      Introduction: Coronary heart disease (CHD) remains the major cause of disease burden
      globally, and the rising prevalence of overweight, obesity and adult onset diabetes is
      predicted to potentiate the CHD epidemic in developing countries, and in high risk
      populations, including people who originate from the Indian subcontinent (South Asians). More
      than 1.2 million people of South Asian origin live in Canada and they are the fastest growing
      group of non-white Canadians. Our previous work among South Asians has shown that, compared
      to white Caucasians in Canada, they suffer from a 2.5 times excess prevalence of elevated
      glucose (dysglycemia), and CHD. They also develop abnormal glucose, lipids (elevated
      apolipoprotein B &amp; reduced apolipoprotein Al) and blood pressure at significantly lower body
      mass index values compared to white Caucasians (21 vs. 30). Successful interventions which
      prevent or improve myocardial infarction (MI) risk factors among South Asians are urgently
      needed.

      Objectives: Among South Asian men and women ≥ 30 years who live in Canada we propose:

        1. To test the effectiveness of a culturally-tailored multimedia intervention designed to
           improve health behaviours including dietary habits, sedentary behaviours, physical
           activity, and tobacco use, in order to improve their MI risk factor profile.

        2. To test if knowledge of genetic risk for MI as determined by the 9p21 variant genotype
           influences behaviour change and MI risk factor profile.

        3. To determine the change in the MI risk score and clinical events including MI, death,
           development of new diabetes, and development of new hypertension over the 6 months
           follow-up.

      Design &amp; Methods: People of South Asian ancestry defined as people whose ancestors originate
      from the Indian subcontinent (India, Pakistan, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka) ≥ 30 years age will
      be eligible for SAHARA. Subjects with no access to e-mail, text messaging or smart phones and
      who have suffered previous coronary heart disease will be excluded. 400 subjects will undergo
      a brief cardiac risk factor assessment including collection of data on questionnaire,
      physical measurement (i.e. weight, height, waist and hip circumference, and blood pressure),
      and a blood sample will be collected to measure apolipoproteins and glucose. All eligible and
      consenting subjects will be randomized 1:1 to intervention versus control. The intervention
      group will include goal setting, self monitoring and participants will receive regular health
      messaging using electronic media regarding smoking, dietary habits &amp; physical activity. The
      control group will receive usual advice and no regular health messaging. The intervention
      will last for 6 months after and the effectiveness of this intervention will be evaluated
      using the change in the cardiac risk score after 6 months.

      Summary: South Asians are the fastest growing group of Canadians. They suffer an excess
      prevalence of cardiac risk factors and MI at a younger age compared to people of European
      origin. The SAHARA project will enable us to use simple but validated tools to assess the MI
      risk profile among South Asian men and women from Ontario, and we will test a
      culturally-tailored multimedia intervention to determine if improvement in the MI risk factor
      profile can be achieved and sustained. If this intervention is successful it will be easily
      scalable, and has the potential to be delivered to a large proportion of the South Asian
      community in Canada.
