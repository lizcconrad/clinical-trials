  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is to primarily investigate whether Treximet® (Imitrex RT/naproxen sodium 500mg)
      taken at the first onset of menstrual migraine will both terminate the acute headache and
      assist in preventing headache recurrence and the need for repeat abortive therapy over the
      ensuing days of menses.
