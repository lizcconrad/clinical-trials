  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the impact of gender and hormones (estradiol,
      progesterone, testosterone and cortisol) on responses to stress and smoking cues presented in
      daily, &quot;real-world&quot; cue presentations compared to a final cue session in a lab. In addition,
      the study will examine the impact of a single dose of oxytocin (chemical produced in the
      body) versus placebo (inactive substance) on stress in males and females.

      This study involves a cue presentation technology known as &quot;CREMA&quot; (Cue Reactivity Ecologic
      Momentary Assessment) which delivers four daily cue presentations to you on a handheld device
      during your everyday routine. Additionally, the study involves daily collection of saliva
      samples for hormonal testing. These daily procedures will provide information about the role
      of cues and hormones in daily life.

    <textblock>
      Despite considerable advances in treatment development, cigarette smoking remains the leading
      cause of preventable death in the United States, and most smokers engaged in treatment are
      unsuccessful in quitting. The burden of illness is disproportionately borne by female
      smokers, who are less responsive to cessation interventions than males. The relationships
      between stress, craving, and smoking behavior are recognized as key factors underlying gender
      differences in nicotine dependence, but must be better understood and characterized to yield
      avenues for interventions addressing this critical health disparity.

      In prior and ongoing SCOR studies, our research team has demonstrated gender and menstrual
      cycle/sex hormone influences on reactivity to laboratory-presented cues. Building from these
      laboratory findings, we propose taking two important next steps: (1) evaluating the
      experience of craving in the &quot;real world&quot; natural environment of female and male smokers, and
      (2) examining the impact of a safe and novel pharmacological intervention (oxytocin) on
      stress reactivity in female and male smokers.

      If, as hypothesized, gender, sex hormones, and oxytocin administration influence the
      relationships between stress, craving, and smoking behavior, the findings could substantially
      address a key gender-related health disparity. Such knowledge could also inform the
      development of gender-specific interventions to enhance female smokers' response to cessation
      treatments. Therefore, the knowledge to be gained from the proposed study may yield
      significant public health benefits.
