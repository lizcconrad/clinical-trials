  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Vitamin D's ability to prevent colorectal cancer (CRC) has been suspected for nearly 30
      years, but has never been directly studied in humans. The biologically active version of
      vitamin D, 1,25(OH)2D3, cannot be readily used in humans because of its tendency to cause
      serum calcium levels to rise. In contrast, 25(OH)D3 (ie calcifediol) does not have this side
      effect. The investigators previous research suggests that the enzyme necessary to convert
      25(OH)D3 (calcifediol) into active 1,25(OH)D3 is present in cells lining the large intestine
      (colon).

      Aberrant crypt foci (ACF) are very small (ie microscopic) collections of abnormally shaped
      cells that are a commonly used marker of CRC risk. Screening colonoscopy at UIC routinely
      uses methods that allow ACF counting to be done as a part of standard practice. ACF's are not
      fixed, like polyps or cancers, but can disappear as a person's risk for developing CRC
      decreases.

      The investigators propose giving patient's with 10 or more ACF's 25(OH)D3 (calcifediol) or
      placebo, and determining if there is a drug-dependant decrease in ACF number. The primary
      objective is to determine whether 25(OH)D3 (calcifediol) supplementation, compared to
      placebo, causes significant reduction of ACF number from baseline levels. The primary
      endpoint will be change in ACF number.

      Patients will be offered participation in this study at the time of their regularly scheduled
      visit to the UIC Colorectal Cancer Screening Clinic. Those agreeing will have indicated their
      understanding that participation will be conditional upon their having 10+ ACF at the time of
      their screening colonoscopy. If at screening colonoscopy 10+ ACF are found patients will:

        -  undergo 3 endoscopic mucosal biopsies of the distal colon; and

        -  undergo a blood draw from an i.v. already in place for sedative-narcotic administration
           for serum 25(OH)D3 and serum ionized calcium; and

        -  be given either placebo or calcifediol and instructed to take daily for 6 months.

        -  provide urine for calcium/creatine spot ratio.

      At 7 and 14 days after the screening colonoscopy patients will be called on the telephone by
      the clinical research nurse assigned to this study to follow-up and note 25(OH)D3
      (calcifediol) toxicity, if any (note that toxicity has not been described except in the case
      of overdose). Signs specifically looked for will include: headache, increased urination,
      nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, weakness, constipation, and anorexia. If present, patient
      will be advised to present immediately to the UIC GCRC for physical and serological
      evaluation.

      At 30, 90 and 120 days the patient will have agreed to present to the GCRC clinic for:

        -  Capsule retrieval/count (80% compliance will be required to remain in study); and

        -  Detailed history and physical, focusing specifically on signs and symptoms of
           hypercalcemia.

        -  At day 90 only - provide urine for calcium/creatine spot ratio.

      Evidence on exam, or laboratory, of hypercalcemia will result in an adverse event reporting
      and immediate patient discharge from this study. Signs specifically looked for include:
      headache, increased urination, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, weakness, constipation, and
      anorexia.

      At 180 days the patient will have agreed to undergo:

        -  Repeat endoscopic exam limited to the recto-sigmoid colon, also known as a &quot;flexible
           sigmoidoscopy&quot;; and

        -  repeat blood draw for serum 25(OH)D3 and serum ionized calcium
