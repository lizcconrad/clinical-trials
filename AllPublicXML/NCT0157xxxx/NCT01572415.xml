  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective is to identify compare SCOUT DS to random capillary glucose for
      identification of at-risk subjects with dysglycemia defined by hemoglobin A1C ≥ 6.0%.

      The study will complete up to 400 subjects at the clinical site to evaluate the precision and
      accuracy of SCOUT DS and random capillary glucose for detecting pre-diabetes and undiagnosed
      type 2 diabetes in subjects at risk but not having a pre-existing diagnosis of type 2
      diabetes. A point of care A1c measurement will serve as the reference method for defining
      pre-diabetes (6.0% ≤ A1c ≤ 6.4%) and diabetes (A1c ≥ 6.5%).

      The study will require one visit by each subject to the clinical site. The visit does not
      require fasting and can be done any time of day. The study (not including the IRB process and
      recruiting) is expected to last 6 months.

      The target cohort for comprises persons at risk for pre-diabetes and/or type 2 diabetes.
