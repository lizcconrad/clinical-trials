      The trial was terminated early on April 12, 2013 due to an organizational decision, which was
      not based on safety or efficacy concerns. Subjects who were already enrolled into the study
      were followed.

        <description>Contrast sensitivity was measured using the Pelli-Robson chart at 1 meter.
