    <measure>Functional Independence Measure - Locomotor Score</measure>
    <time_frame>measured at admission and discharge from rehab estimated length of stay 14 days</time_frame>
    <description>The Functional Independence Measure (FIM)assesses level of disability and measures progress toward independence with rehabilitational intervention. The tool consists of 18 items. Only the the locomotor score was used to assess gait ability in this study. The locomotor score ranges from 1 - 7 with a higher score indicating a higher level of functional independence.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Timed Up and Go</measure>
    <time_frame>Measured at admission and discharge with estimated length of stay 14 days</time_frame>
    <description>The Timed Up and Go (TUG) is used to assess balance and gait, and to estimate fall risks in patients with deficits. The participant rises from a seated position in a chair, walks 3 meters, turns around, returns to the chair, and sits down. The test is measured in seconds, with a lower number indicating a higher level of independence and the least risk for falls.</description>

    <measure>Stroke Rehabilitation Assessment of Movement</measure>
    <time_frame>measured at admission and discharge with estimated length of stay 14 days</time_frame>
    <description>The Stroke Rehabilitation Assessment of Movement (STREAM)is designed to measure mobility and motor ability after stroke. There are three subscales with 10 items each assessing the upper extremity, lower extremity, and basic mobility. Only the lower extremity and basic mobility items were used in this study. The lower extremity scores ranged from 0 - 18 with higher scores indicating a higher level of motor control. The basic mobility scores ranged from 0 - 30 with high numbers indicating a higher level of functional mobility.</description>

The participant was blinded to the affected lower extremity with a mirror, and was looking at the image of the unaffected lower extremity superimposed on the affected lower extremity as he or she performed the activities.</description>

          <title>Functional Independence Measure - Locomotor Score</title>
          <description>The Functional Independence Measure (FIM)assesses level of disability and measures progress toward independence with rehabilitational intervention. The tool consists of 18 items. Only the the locomotor score was used to assess gait ability in this study. The locomotor score ranges from 1 - 7 with a higher score indicating a higher level of functional independence.</description>
          <population>Thirty-three participants enrolled in the study with 3 dropping out before completion. Two of these were due to medical issues, and one was discharged unexpectedly</population>

        <description>The Stroke Rehabilitation Assessment of Movement (STREAM)is designed to measure mobility and motor ability after stroke. There are three subscales with 10 items each assessing the upper extremity, lower extremity, and basic mobility. Only the lower extremity and basic mobility items were used in this study. The lower extremity scores ranged from 0 - 18 with higher scores indicating a higher level of motor control. The basic mobility scores ranged from 0 - 30 with high numbers indicating a higher level of functional mobility.</description>
