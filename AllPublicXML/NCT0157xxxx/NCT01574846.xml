  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this non-interventional (observational) study is to document, in collaboration
      with established urologists in Scandinavia, experience gained from routine use of Vantas® for
      the treatment of patients with advanced prostate cancer. In this observational study
      particular attention will be directed to treatment duration, quality of life and patient and
      physician acceptance of the medicinal product for long-term therapy. Patient-based
      measurement parameters such as quality of life and degree of satisfaction will allow
      registration of information that extends beyond the clinical parameters. The knowledge
      gathered will enable patient acceptance of long-term therapy to be evaluated. Clinical
      outcome will also be documented by measuring serum testosterone and prostate specific antigen
      (PSA) levels.
