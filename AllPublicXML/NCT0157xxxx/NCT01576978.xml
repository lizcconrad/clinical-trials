      The aim of this study is to identify evaluate the effectiveness of stretching exercises of
      Hatha Yoga method in pregnant women with back pain and posterior pelvic City Paulínia. -There
      will be a randomized clinical trial with 60 pregnant women with these symptoms. They will be
      randomly divided into 2 groups. The group A will perform the exercises of Hatha Yoga for ten
      weeks, once a week group B postural follow the guidelines recommended for the treatment of
      these pains, for ten weeks. Will be used as a technique for evaluating the Visual Analogue
      Scale to measure pain intensity and confirmation tests of the lumbar and posterior pelvic
      pain in order to differentiate them. A descriptive statistical analysis of univariate and
      bivariate distributions will be made through frequency and graphical representation. The
      association between the variables will be tested by statistical tests: [chi-square (X ²)],
      Fisher's exact test, Student's t test or Mann-Whitney, [Student's t test to compare means],
      ANOVA for the analysis of effects between the groups. [The significance level is
      predetermined to 5%]. The data will be analyzed in EPI-INFO 2000. SAS 9.0 and from the
      database created .

      OBJECTIVES

      General Purpose Identify the percentage of pregnant women with spinal postural pains in
      antenatal services in the city of Paulinia and evaluate the effectiveness of the Classical
      Yoga exercises for the lumbar and posterior pelvic pains in the group of women who will do
      the exercises, as well as developments pain intensity in patients with and without exercise.

      Specific Objectives

        -  Identify the percentage of pregnant women with postural pains in the spine.

        -  Measure the intensity of pain and at the beginning and end of intervention in both
           groups.

        -  Measure the intensity of pain and at the beginning and end of each exercise session.

        -  To compare the evolution of pain - lower back and posterior pelvic pain - in the group
           with and without exercise.

        -  To compare the evolution of pain - lower back and posterior pelvic pain - in the group
           with Yoga exercises.

      ASSUMPTIONS

        -  Half of pregnant women report symptoms of postural pains in the spine.

        -  A significantly higher percentage of pregnant women who will do the Yoga exercises
           during pregnancy report improvement in pain intensity - low back and / or posterior
           pelvic pain - compared with the control group.

        -  A significantly higher percentage of pregnant women present pain intensity increased at
           the beginning compared to the end of the session.

        -  A significantly higher percentage of pregnant women report a decrease in intensity of
           back pain and posterior pelvic pain when compared to the control group.

        -  A significantly higher percentage of pregnant women report improvement in low back pain
           over the posterior pelvic pain in the group with Yoga exercises.

      SUBJECTS AND METHODS:

      Design Identification of the percentage of pregnant women with postural pains in the spine in
      health units and clinical trial, prospective, randomized and controlled.

      Sample Size To calculate the sample size was calculated as the average change in pain
      intensity referred to the global active stretching group at the end of the first and eighth
      week of treatment. The mean and standard deviation of the intensity of pain at the end of the
      first week was 4.88 SD 3.056 and at the end of the eighth week 0.85 SD 1.875 (Martins &amp; PINTO
      E SILVA, 2005 b) The assumption is that the effect of treatment with yoga is similar to that
      found with the global active stretching.

      Considering a significance level of 5%, a test power of 80%, based on the mean difference
      reported and adopting the paired t-test, the smallest sample size required is n = 7 women in
      each group.

      However, for purposes of research and publication is suggested to adopt an &quot;n&quot; greater than
      30 women per group.

    <description>The women's group of Yoga will participate in ten week sessions of Yoga once a week for an hour. The sessions will be taught by instructor of Hatha Yoga. For the intervention were chosen 37 postures, three breathing exercises. The sessions were divided into three stages: quieting the mind , breathing rate and the heating of the main joints, postures and breathing exercises, meditation and relaxation. At the beginning and end of each session, we evaluated the pain intensity.Pregnant women in the control group Postural orientations will receive a booklet containing guidelines postural figures and explanatory text on some possible changes in the curvatures of the spine during pregnancy suggestions for positioning of the spine for daily activities, lying postures, sitting and standing. After ten weeks the two groups will be scheduled for the final collection of data.</description>
