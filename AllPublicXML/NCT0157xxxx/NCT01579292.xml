      The goals of the study are to:

        1. Assess effect sizes of our mDPP intervention on weight loss, physical activity, dietary
           intake, and fasting plasma glucose (FPG) levels from baseline to 5 months as compared to
           a control group.

        2. To explore the association between low heath-literacy levels at baseline and adherence
           to mobile phone usage.

        3. To conduct process evaluation to gain insights into patient compliance to the mobile
           intervention, including usage barriers and acceptability of our mDPP, at 1 and 5 months
           using a semi-structured interview method.

    <textblock>
      The prevalence of type 2 diabetes (T2DM) continues to rise at an alarming rate in the United
      States. A greater risk of diabetes is observed for ethnic/racial minority and lower
      socioeconomic status (SES)groups as compared to Caucasians of similar ages. Several clinical
      trials have tested intensive lifestyle interventions or pharmacologic agents in preventing or
      delaying T2DM in adults at risk. These trials (e.g.the Diabetes Prevention Program)
      consistently show impressive diabetes risk reductions using lifestyle interventions, such as
      relatively modest amounts of weight loss and exercise. However these programs have been
      expensive to implement and sustain over time in clinical settings or communities.

      Mobile technologies are ideal platforms to deliver and disseminate such lifestyle
      modification programs to a much broader ethnic/racial minority population, making them more
      cost effective. Today, 87% of adults in the U.S. own a mobile phone. In particular, usage of
      non-voice services (such as text messaging or mobile internet) in African-Americans and
      non-white Hispanics is significantly higher than their Caucasian counterparts. In contrast,
      ethnic /racial minority populations are much less likely to own a computer at home compared
      to their Caucasian counterparts. Given the rapid diffusion of mobile technologies in
      ethnic/racial minority populations, we need to understand how to apply mobile persuasive
      technologies to such lifestyle modification programs.
