  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to screen chemotherapy drugs currently used to treat lung cancer
      and determine the most effective treatment based on results of chemo sensitivity testing on
      the patients own cancer cells in the laboratory. The results of this screening will not
      influence the patients treatment.

      The chemosensitivity assay will be performed on tissue obtained during the diagnostic fine
      needle aspiration, core biopsy, or excisional biopsy of the lung lesion. Cancer cells (Bulk
      of tumor) and Cancer Stem Cells (CSCs) will be isolated and expanded in the laboratory.

      The drug screening assay will be used to evaluate the response of the CSCs and of the cancer
      cells to the various chemotherapy regimens.

    <description>Tumor response will be evaluated (progression/regression) by CT scan at 3 months from therapy start.
Clinical response to chemotherapy of lung cancer tumor cells versus lung cancer stem cells to standard of care chemo drugs will be evaluated and correlated to predicted drug by ex vivo assay.</description>
