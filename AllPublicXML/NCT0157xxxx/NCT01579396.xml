  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A high cut off dialyzer (septeX) is tested in patients after cardio-thoracic surgery with
      incidence of &quot;systemic inflammatory response syndrome&quot; (SIRS) and associated increased risk
      for acute kidney injury (AKI). Hypothesis: The high cut off dialyzer (septeX) can increase
      the postoperative IL-6/Il-10 ratio.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cardiac surgery associated systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) plays an important
      pathophysiological role in the development of AKI in patients after cardiothoracic surgery.

      Previous studies have shown that the elimination of inflammatory mediators can be either
      achieved by Continuous Venous Venous Hemodialysis(CVVHD) or Continuous Venous Venous
      Hemofiltration (CVVH) by using a high-cutoff (HCO) membrane with a cut-off 45kD. Data from
      patients treated with HCO-CVVHD during septic shock show a reduction in systemic cytokines
      and improved hemodynamics.

      No data about the effects of early HCO-CVVH in cardiac surgery patients with a high risk of
      Cardiac Surgery associated AKI and consequently a high rate of postoperative renal
      replacement therapy (RRT) are available.

      It is of note that patients with Euroscore &gt; 6 are on high risk to develop SIRS associated
      AKI.

      No pharmacological anti-inflammatory approach has convincingly shown to prevent renal
      dysfunction in these patients.
