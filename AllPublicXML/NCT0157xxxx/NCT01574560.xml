  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Smoking is widely accepted to cause an increase in an individual's likelihood of developing
      cancer and heart disease. The effects of tobacco smoke are not limited to smokers. Secondhand
      smoke inhaled by a non-smoker has also been associated with the development of several
      illnesses. This study focuses on learning how to make your home smoke-free.

      This study will be conducted in two phases. Phase 1 will be qualitative focus groups/pilot
      study with the purpose to develop a motivationally enhanced biomarker feedback counseling
      protocol and all printed materials to be used in Phase 2. After investigators develop a good
      working treatment protocol, an active intervention in smoking homes who live with a child in
      their home will be carried out.

      Those randomized to the Control Group will receive health education in the form of brochures
      detailing the health effects of secondhand smoke and how to make their home smoke free.
      Participants randomized to the Treatment Group will receive tobacco-specific biomarker
      feedback and personalized motivationally enhanced counseling.

    <measure>Comparison of Child Cotinine Levels in Urine</measure>
    <time_frame>From Baseline to Week 26 Follow-Up</time_frame>
    <description>Cotinine is an alkaloid found in tobacco and is also a metabolite of nicotine. Cotinine is used as a biomarker for exposure to tobacco smoke. Child (non-smoker) cotinine will be used as an objective measure of secondhand smoke exposure at baseline and again at end of study (week 26).</description>

Active participants receive 5 counseling sessions from a trained research counselor; 3 sessions in the home and 2 by phone. The counseling sessions focus on changing smoking behaviors and/or other behaviors that impact smoking.</description>
