  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to show that ViscoGel® is safe when administrated alone and as
      an adjuvant together with Act-HIB® vaccine in healthy volunteers and to evaluate the
      quantitative and qualitative effect on the immune response.

    <description>Phase A: 3 consecutive groups each of 10 subjects. Planned dose of ViscoGel® (provided that the data safety monitoring board deemed the previous dose level to be safe): 25mg, 50mg and 75mg.</description>
  </primary_outcome>

    <measure>Change in HIB antibody serum titer</measure>
    <time_frame>28 days post vaccination</time_frame>
    <description>Phase B: The ViscoGel® dose administrated will be chosen after evaluation of safety and tolerance in Phase A. 2 subjects from group 1 and 2 subjects from group 3 will initially receive ViscoGel® dose (from phase A) with Act-HIB non-randomized. The remaining subjects will be randomized to 5 different treatment arms. Group 1; ViscoGel® with 0.2µg Act-HIB, Group 2; 0.2µg Act-HIB, Group 3; ViscoGel® with 2µg Act-HIB, Group 4; 2µg Act-HIB and Group 5 10µg Act-HIB is given. Blood samples are obtained at baseline and post-injection for assessment of HIB antibody serum titer.</description>
