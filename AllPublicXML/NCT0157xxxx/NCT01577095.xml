      Aims: To evaluate the efficacy of rosiglitazone (TZD) and electroacupuncture (EA) combined
      therapy on patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). A randomized single-blind placebo
      controlled clinical trial was used.

      Methods: A total of 31 newly diagnostic type 2 diabetic patients, who fulfilled the
      eligibility criteria were recruited and received various allocated interventions. They were
      randomly assigned into two groups, the control group (TZD, N=15) and the experimental group
      (TZD + EA, N=16). Changes in their plasma free fatty acid (FFA), glucose and insulin levels
      together with their homeostasis model assessment (HOMA) indices were statistically assessed
      between before and after treatment. Hypoglycemic activity (%) was also compared between these
      two groups.

      Expecting Results: This study will compare the hypoglycemic activity and the ability of
      improving insulin resistance between the TZD and TZD+EA group. Also, the lowering effect of
      the plasma FFA concentration will be investigated.
