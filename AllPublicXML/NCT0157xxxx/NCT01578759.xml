    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the feasibility of performing a randomized clinical
      trial evaluating the effect of salpingectomy (removal of the fallopian tubes) during
      laparoscopic hysterectomy on ovarian function. The hypothesis is that removal of the tubes
      can prevent diseases of the fallopian tubes such as infection, hydrosalpinx (fluid-filled
      tubes)and additional invasive procedures such as further imaging work-ups and further surgery
      related to the tubes.
