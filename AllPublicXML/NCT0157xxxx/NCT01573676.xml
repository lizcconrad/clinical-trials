  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Obesity is a very important risk-factor in obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) and other sleep
      breathing disorders in patients with extreme BMI.

      Candidates for bariatric surgery have a high OSA prevalence, ranging from 60-83%. The
      characteristics of patients with sleep apnea that were evaluated for bariatric surgery and
      had a full overnight polysomnography (PSG) screening for OSA were described and it was found
      that a very high prevalence (77.2%) for OSA in all subjects evaluated, regardless of
      pre-operative risk for OSA. A post-bariatric surgery PSG was not a part of this study.

      The investigators would like to demonstrate the impact of bariatric surgery on OSA as a
      function of time.
