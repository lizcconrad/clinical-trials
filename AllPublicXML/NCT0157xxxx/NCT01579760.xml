      The purpose of this study is to assess the safety of intravitreal aflibercept injection - in
      the treatment of macular edema associated with retinopathy secondary to previous radiation
      therapy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Radiation retinopathy can cause decreased vision in patients who have received either
      external beam radiation or local plaque therapy to the eye. An early manifestation of
      radiation retinopathy is macular edema, which represents fluid within the retina that affects
      central vision. There is currently no approved treatment for this disease, although there
      have been anecdotal reports of benefit with laser photocoagulation, intravitreal anti-VEGF
      agents, or intravitreal steroid use. This is a phase 1 study to evaluate aflibercept for the
      treatment of macular edema associated with retinopathy secondary to previous radiation
      treatment.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Retinopathy associated with previous I-125 brachytherapy for uveal melanoma (85 Gy
             over 96 hours) at least 6 months prior to enrollment

          -  Ability to provide written informed consent and comply with study assessments for the
             full duration of the study

          -  Age &gt; 18 years

          -  Center involved macular edema &gt; 300µm in thickness on SD-OCT

          -  Best corrected visual acuity of 20/40- 20/400

          -  Birth control therapy for females of child-bearing age

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Pre-existing retinopathy due to other disorders

          -  Vision decrease is considered to be due to ischemic radiation retinopathy without
             macular edema or optic neuropathy

             contraceptives, barrier contraception with either a condom or diaphragm in conjunction
             with spermicidal gel, an IUD, or contraceptive hormone implant or patch.

          -  Prior enrollment in any study with intravitreal aflibercept injection
