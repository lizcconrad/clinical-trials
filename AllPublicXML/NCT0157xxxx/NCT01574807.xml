  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The inferior alveolar nerve block (shot) is the most frequently used injection technique for
      achieving local anesthesia (numbness) for the teeth in the lower jaw. However, this injection
      does not always result in successful pulpal (tooth) anesthesia (patient felt pain). No study
      has combined mepivacaine and lidocaine anesthetics (numbing solutions) for this type of
      injection (shot). The investigators propose to compare an injection of mepivacaine followed
      by lidocaine to an injection of lidocaine followed by lidocaine to determine if there is a
      difference in effectiveness.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      One hundred adult male and female subjects will randomly receive two sets of inferior
      alveolar block injections (shots) consisting of an injection of 1.8 mL of 3% mepivacaine
      followed by 1.8 mL of 2% lidocaine with 1:100,000 epinephrine, and an injection of 1.8 mL of
      2% lidocaine with 1:100,000 epinephrine followed by 1.8 mL of 2% lidocaine with 1:100,000
      epinephrine, at two separate appointments spaced at least two weeks apart, in a crossover
      design. Whether the subject receives the mepivacaine or the lidocaine for the first injection
      will be determined randomly. The doctor will not know whether the subject receives
      mepivacaine or lidocaine for the first injection. The subject will not know which anesthetics
      he/she receives. A pulp tester will be used to test the lower jaw teeth (molars, premolars,
      and incisors) for anesthesia (numbness) in 4-minute time cycles for 60 minutes. The pain of
      the IAN block injections will also be recorded. The data will be statistically analyzed.

    <description>A Heft-Parker Visual Analog Scale (VAS) will be used by subjects to rate the pain of injections received at three distinct times - during needle insertion, placement of the needle to target site, and deposition of the anesthetic solution at the target site. This will occur at each appointment during the anesthetic injection phase of treatment (first 3 minutes).</description>
