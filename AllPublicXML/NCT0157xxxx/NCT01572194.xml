  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic renal failure is a serious complication of lung transplantation especially in
      patients with cystic fibrosis. Their medical history prior to the Lung Transplantation has
      already exposed to kidney damage. Post-lung transplantation, these patients are subjected to
      renal toxicity anticalcineurins they receive large doses.

      The measurement of renal function of patients by formula to estimate GFR in routine use is
      unreliable and other markers seem indispensable.

      The purpose of this study is to evaluate two markers, PIIINP (Procollagen III aminoterminal
      peptide N), whose urinary levels was correlated to the intensity of fibrosis in different
      types of kidney disease.
