  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study the investigators aim to examine the effects of Transcranial Direct Current
      Stimulation (tDCS) on pain levels as well as the changes in cognitive (thought) processing in
      individuals with chronic pain of the cornea -- and also compared with healthy controls.

    <measure>Changes in pain scales</measure>
    <time_frame>Measured for approximately 2 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>We will measure changes in the visual analogue scale (VAS) for pain, and also measure pain threshold (using an algometer) before and after each stimulation session. We will compare the measurements from before stimulation to after stimulation, in each scheduled session, as this study is measuring the effects of a single session of tDCS.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes in EEG measurements</measure>
    <time_frame>Measured for approximately 2 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>We will measure changes in event related potentials (ex. P300, mismatch negativity) recorded via electroencephalography (EEG) before and after each stimulation session. We will compare the measurements from before stimulation to after stimulation, in each scheduled session, as this study is measuring the effects of a single session of tDCS.</description>
