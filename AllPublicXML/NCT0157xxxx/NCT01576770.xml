  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate if the Synera Patch (lidocaine/tetracaine patch),
      used to numb the skin before IV placement, is effective in reducing pain associated with
      propofol IV administration when inducing general anesthesia, compared to Gebauer's Ethyl
      Chloride topical anesthetic skin refrigerant.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Commonly, anesthesiologists inject Propofol, a sleeping medication, intravenously to induce
      general anesthesia. Propofol injection is associated with pain that can be severe.

      The investigators also place a lidocaine/tetracaine skin patch (Synera) to decrease pain
      associated with IV placement. Because the local anesthetics of the Synera patch diffuse deep
      underneath the skin, in this study the investigators would like to evaluate whether the
      application of Synera Patch can decrease the pain associated with propofol injection.

      Children will be randomized to receive either the patch or the Ethyl Chloride before the IV
      placement. A total of 33 patients will be enrolled in each group.

    <description>A blinded independent observer and a blinded anesthesiologist will rate pain on propofol injection according to a pain scale:
- no pain

    <description>Half of the patients will randomly be assigned to receive Gebauer's ethyl choride topical anesthetic vapo-coolant spray immediately prior to placing a 22 gauge intravenous catheter.
Pain in this group will be evaluated at the time of IV placement by an independent observer (unblinded) and the patient on a 0-10 scale. Pain will again be evaluated when propofol is injected at anesthesia induction by a blinded observer and the staff anesthesiologist (also blinded) on a scale of 1-4.
Blinding will occur following IV placement by draping and securing the hand and IV site with Coban self-adherent elastic wrap to cover any skin changes due to the ethyl chloride or the patch.</description>

    <description>The other half of the patients will randomly be assigned to receive Synera Patches, to be applied to the dorsum of both hands, at least 30 minutes before placing a 22 gauge intravenous catheter.
Pain in this group will be evaluated at the time of IV placement by an independent observer (unblinded) and the patient on a 0-10 scale. Pain will again be evaluated when propofol is injected at anesthesia induction by a blinded observer and the staff anesthesiologist (also blinded) on a scale of 1-4.
