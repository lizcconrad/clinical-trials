  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Thyroid-associated ophthalmopathy (TAO), also called Graves' ophthalmopathy or thyroid eye
      disease, is a common orbital disease in adults. Patients with TAO, especially in its active
      phase, often complain about symptoms of ocular surface discomfort, including excess tearing,
      gritty sensation, increased sensitivity to light and foreign-body sensation, which are
      similar to inflammatory ocular surface disorders such as dry-eye syndrome (DES). Incomplete
      blink, increased proptosis and greater palpebral fissure width in TAO accelerates tear
      evaporation, which increases the tear fluid's osmolarity, and results in ocular surface
      damage. The administration of intravenous glucocorticoids can be an effective treatment for
      TAO.

      The rationale of the present study is to assess the effect of intravenously administered
      glucocorticoids on the signs of DES in patients with TAO with new methods such as measurement
      of tear film thickness, tear film osmolarity and scattering of the tear film and well
      established methods for assessment of the severity of DES. Additionally, impression cytology
      and determination of tear cytokines/chemokines will be performed to obtain information about
      inflammatory processes on the ocular surface.
