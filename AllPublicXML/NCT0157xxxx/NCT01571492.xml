  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This prospective study is intended to compare the analgesic efficacy, preservation of lower
      extremity motor power and side-effect profile of L2 Paravertebral lumbar plexus approach
      compared to Posterior nerve stimulation guided lumbar plexus approach, continuous local
      anesthetic infusion postoperative analgesia of Total Hip Arthroplasty.

      The L2 Paravertebral technique of lumbar plexus block, as part of a multimodal pain
      treatment, could be a cost-effective alternative with a equal profile of analgesic efficacy
      and motor power sparing with greater promotion of early achievement of postoperative physical
      therapy goals.

      The nerve stimulator guided technique of continuous lumbar plexus block (LPB) is the accepted
      standard of care at University of Pittsburgh Medical Center (UPMC) for the management of
      postoperative analgesia after Total Hip Arthroplasty. Over 900 continuous lumbar plexus
      blocks were performed at UPMC Presbyterian Shadyside hospital within the last year alone.
      Continuous thoracic paravertebral block (TPVB) is also commonly performed at UPMC
      Presbyterian Shadyside . Over 2000 are performed annually for a wide variety of surgical
      procedures. Recently authors have suggested that a lumbar paravertebral block (LPVB) may
      represent an alternative approach to the lumbar plexus. Indeed the L2 paravertebral approach
      of the lumbar plexus has been described to provide adequate postoperative analgesia following
      hip arthroscopic surgery. However, to date, there is no prospective direct comparison between
      L2 Lumbar plexus approach and the posterior approach for postoperative analgesia after Total
      Hip Arthroplasty.

    <description>The timed get up and go test is a measurement of mobility. It includes a number of tasks such as standing from a seating position, walking, turning, stopping, and sitting down which are all important tasks needed for a person to be independently mobile.</description>

    <measure>Straight Leg Raise(SLR)</measure>
    <time_frame>24 hours postoperatively</time_frame>
    <description>In supine position with the extremity being tested and contralateral flexed LE with foot flat on surface. Patient is instructed to lift extremity to level of contralateral knee. Inability to lift entire LE off of the surface to the level of the contralateral knee would be indicative of hip flexor weakness. If the patient is able to lift LE off of the surface, however the knee flexes/unable to maintain full knee extension, this is indicative of quad weakness.</description>

    <time_frame>24 hours postoperatively</time_frame>
    <description>In sitting position at the edge of the bed or chair. Patient is asked to extend lower leg fully on side that is being tested. If able, this is indicative that quad function is intact. If unable to fully extend knee, would indicate quad weakness.</description>
