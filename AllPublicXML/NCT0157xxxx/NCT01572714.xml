  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to conduct a randomized controlled trial to examine the
      effectiveness of a telehealth intervention that supports individuals in managing fatigue and
      increasing physical activity (PA) behavior in individuals with multiple sclerosis (MS). The
      hypothesis is that a fatigue management plus physical activity intervention will
      significantly improve fatigue, quality of life, physical function, and community integration.

    <textblock>
      The long-term objective of this study is to use a telehealth intervention approach to reduce
      the devastating effects of the reciprocal relationship between fatigue and inactivity on
      quality of life and participation in life roles in people with multiple sclerosis (MS).
      Chronic fatigue and inactivity are common problems in persons with MS, and the reciprocal
      relationship between fatigue and inactivity may have negative synergistic effects on quality
      of life and participation in life roles. The proposed study is novel in that it represents a
      multi-disciplinary effort to merge two promising lines of MS research: fatigue management and
      PA promotion. The proposed fatigue management plus PA intervention (FM+) will consist of
      incorporating a modified teleconference version of Packer et al.'s empirically-tested Fatigue
      Management program with innovative, yet simple approaches to promote lifestyle PA by
      encouraging goal-setting and self-monitoring with a pedometer. Ambulatory individuals with MS
      will be recruited and randomized into one of three telehealth interventions: social support
      intervention, PA-only intervention, and FM+.
