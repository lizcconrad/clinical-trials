  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase IIb, multi-centre, randomised, double-blind, parallel-group,
      placebo-controlled study in children aged 5-11 years with persistent uncontrolled asthma.
      Subjects entering the run-in period will stop their current asthma medication and be given
      open label fluticasone propionate (FP) 100mcg twice daily via DISKUS/ACCUHALER and
      salbutamol/albuterol as required to use throughout the run-in and double-blind treatment
      period. At Visit 3 subjects meeting the randomization eligibility criteria will receive
      vilanterol (6.25mcg, 12.5mcg, or 25mcg,) or placebo via the Novel Dry Powder Inhaler (NDPI)
      once daily for 4 weeks in addition to open-label fluticasone propionate twice daily
      throughout the treatment period. Primary endpoints consist of change from baseline in clinic
      visit trough (pre-bronchodilator and pre-dose) PEF at the end of the 28-day treatment period
      in all subjects. Safety assessments include adverse events, oropharyngeal examinations,
      clinical chemistry, 12-lead ECG, and vital signs. Blood samples will be taken from all
      subjects for pharmacokinetic analysis to determine plasma concentrations of vilanterol at
      specific time intervals relative to the dose of study drug.

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Daily Pre-dose Evening (PM) Peak Expiratory Flow (PEF) From Participant Electronic Daily Diary Averaged Over the 4-week Treatment Period</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline; Week 1 up to Week 4</time_frame>
    <description>PEF is defined as the maximum airflow during a forced expiration beginning with the lungs fully inflated. PEF was measured by the participants using a hand-held electronic peak flow meter each evening prior to the dose of study medication and any rescue albuterol/salbutamol inhalation aerosol use each morning. The best of three measurements was recorded. Change from Baseline was calculated as the value of the averaged daily PM PEF over the 4-week Treatment Period minus the Baseline value. The Baseline PEF value is defined as the average of the last 7 days of the Run-in Phase. The analysis was performed using an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model with covariates of Baseline, region, sex, age, and treatment. Only those participants contributing data per the daily eDiary were analyzed.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Evening Clinic Visit Trough (Pre-bronchodilator and Pre-dose) Forced Expiratory Volume in One Second (FEV1) at the End of the 4-week Treatment Period in Children Who Could Perform the Maneuver</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline; Week 4</time_frame>
    <description>Pulmonary function was measured by FEV1, defined as the maximal amount of air that can be forcefully exhaled in one second. Trough FEV1 is defined as a pre-dose FEV1 measurement taken at a clinic visit while still on treatment. Change from Baseline in trough FEV1 at the end of the 4-week Treatment Period was defined using the pre-dose FEV1 measurement taken at the Week 4 clinic visit. Change from Baseline was calculated as the Week 4 trough FEV1 value minus the Baseline value. The Baseline FEV1 value is defined as the value at Visit 3 (randomization). The analysis was performed using an ANCOVA model with covariates of Baseline trough FEV1, region, sex, age, and treatment. The last observation carried forward (LOCF) method was used to impute missing data, in which the last non-missing post-Baseline on-treatment measurement at scheduled clinic visits was used to impute the missing measurements.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in the Percentage of Rescue-free 24-hour Periods During the 4-week Treatment Period</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline; Week 1 up to Week 4</time_frame>
    <description>The number of inhalations of rescue albuterol/salbutamol inhalation aerosol (medication used to relieve symptoms immediately) used during the day and night) was recorded by the participants in a daily diary. A 24-hour period in which a participant's responses to both the morning and evening assessments indicated no use of rescue medication was considered as rescue free. Participants who were rescue free for 24-hour periods during the 4-week Treatment Period were assessed. The Baseline value was derived from the last 7 days of the daily diary prior to the randomization of the participant. Change from Baseline is calculated as the average value during the 4-week Treatment Period minus the value at Baseline. The Baseline value is defined as the value at Visit 3 (randomization). Analysis was performed using ANCOVA with covariates of Baseline, region, sex, age, and treatment.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Daily Morning (AM) PEF Averaged Over the 4-week Treatment Period</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline; Week 1 up to Week 4</time_frame>
    <description>PEF is defined as the maximum airflow during a forced expiration beginning with the lungs fully inflated. PEF was measured by the participants using a hand-held electronic peak flow meter each morning prior to the dose of study medication and any rescue albuterol/salbutamol inhalation aerosol use. Change from Baseline was calculated as the value of the averaged daily AM PEF over the 4-week Treatment Period (at Week 4) minus the Baseline value. The Baseline value is defined as the value at Visit 3 (randomization). The analysis was performed using an ANCOVA model with covariates of Baseline, region, sex, age, and treatment group.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Evening (PM) PEF Over the Last 7 Days of the Treatment Period (Week 4)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline; Week 4</time_frame>
    <description>PEF is defined as the maximum airflow during a forced expiration beginning with the lungs fully inflated. PEF was measured by the participants using a hand-held electronic peak flow meter each evening prior to the dose of study medication and any rescue albuterol/salbutamol inhalation aerosol use. Change from Baseline is calculated as the value over the last 7 days of the Treatment Period minus the Baseline value. The Baseline value is defined as the value at Visit 3 (randomization). The analysis was performed using an ANCOVA model with covariates of Baseline, region, sex, age, and treatment group. The LOCF method was used to impute missing data, in which the last non-missing post-Baseline on-treatment measurement at scheduled clinic visits was used to impute the missing measurements.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in the Percentage of Symptom-free 24-hour Periods During the 4-week Treatment Period</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline; Week 1 up to Week 4</time_frame>
    <description>Asthma symptoms were recorded in a daily eDairy by the participants every day in the morning and evening before taking any rescue or study medication and before the PEF measurement. A 24-hour (hr) period in which a participant's responses to both the morning and evening assessments indicated no symptoms was considered to be symptom free. The Baseline symptom-free value is defined as the value at Visit 3 (randomization). Change from Baseline was calculated as the averaged value during the 4-week Treatment Period minus the Baseline value. The analysis was performed using an ANCOVA model with covariates of Baseline, region, sex, age, and treatment group.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Daily Pre-dose Evening (PM) Peak Expiratory Flow (PEF) From Participant Electronic Daily Diary Averaged Over the 4-week Treatment Period</title>
        <description>PEF is defined as the maximum airflow during a forced expiration beginning with the lungs fully inflated. PEF was measured by the participants using a hand-held electronic peak flow meter each evening prior to the dose of study medication and any rescue albuterol/salbutamol inhalation aerosol use each morning. The best of three measurements was recorded. Change from Baseline was calculated as the value of the averaged daily PM PEF over the 4-week Treatment Period minus the Baseline value. The Baseline PEF value is defined as the average of the last 7 days of the Run-in Phase. The analysis was performed using an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model with covariates of Baseline, region, sex, age, and treatment. Only those participants contributing data per the daily eDiary were analyzed.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Evening Clinic Visit Trough (Pre-bronchodilator and Pre-dose) Forced Expiratory Volume in One Second (FEV1) at the End of the 4-week Treatment Period in Children Who Could Perform the Maneuver</title>
        <description>Pulmonary function was measured by FEV1, defined as the maximal amount of air that can be forcefully exhaled in one second. Trough FEV1 is defined as a pre-dose FEV1 measurement taken at a clinic visit while still on treatment. Change from Baseline in trough FEV1 at the end of the 4-week Treatment Period was defined using the pre-dose FEV1 measurement taken at the Week 4 clinic visit. Change from Baseline was calculated as the Week 4 trough FEV1 value minus the Baseline value. The Baseline FEV1 value is defined as the value at Visit 3 (randomization). The analysis was performed using an ANCOVA model with covariates of Baseline trough FEV1, region, sex, age, and treatment. The last observation carried forward (LOCF) method was used to impute missing data, in which the last non-missing post-Baseline on-treatment measurement at scheduled clinic visits was used to impute the missing measurements.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in the Percentage of Rescue-free 24-hour Periods During the 4-week Treatment Period</title>
        <description>The number of inhalations of rescue albuterol/salbutamol inhalation aerosol (medication used to relieve symptoms immediately) used during the day and night) was recorded by the participants in a daily diary. A 24-hour period in which a participant’s responses to both the morning and evening assessments indicated no use of rescue medication was considered as rescue free. Participants who were rescue free for 24-hour periods during the 4-week Treatment Period were assessed. The Baseline value was derived from the last 7 days of the daily diary prior to the randomization of the participant. Change from Baseline is calculated as the average value during the 4-week Treatment Period minus the value at Baseline. The Baseline value is defined as the value at Visit 3 (randomization). Analysis was performed using ANCOVA with covariates of Baseline, region, sex, age, and treatment.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Evening (PM) PEF Over the Last 7 Days of the Treatment Period (Week 4)</title>
        <description>PEF is defined as the maximum airflow during a forced expiration beginning with the lungs fully inflated. PEF was measured by the participants using a hand-held electronic peak flow meter each evening prior to the dose of study medication and any rescue albuterol/salbutamol inhalation aerosol use. Change from Baseline is calculated as the value over the last 7 days of the Treatment Period minus the Baseline value. The Baseline value is defined as the value at Visit 3 (randomization). The analysis was performed using an ANCOVA model with covariates of Baseline, region, sex, age, and treatment group. The LOCF method was used to impute missing data, in which the last non-missing post-Baseline on-treatment measurement at scheduled clinic visits was used to impute the missing measurements.</description>
