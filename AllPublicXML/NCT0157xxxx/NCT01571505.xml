  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Oral polio and rotavirus vaccines are significantly less effective in children living in the
      developing world. Tropical enteropathy, which is associated with intestinal inflammation,
      decreased absorption and increased permeability, may contribute substantially to oral vaccine
      failure in developing country settings. Other possible causes of oral vaccine
      underperformance include malnutrition, interference with maternal or breast milk antibodies,
      changes in gut microbiota, and genetic susceptibility.The primary Objective of this study is
      to determine whether decreased vaccine responsiveness to oral poliovirus or rotavirus
      vaccines is associated with the presence of tropical enteropathy.

      Intervention of this study is to vaccinate oral poliovirus vaccine and oral rotavirus vaccine
      to the child with two group; with inactivated poliovirus vaccine and without inactivated
      poliovirus vaccine. Rotavirus vaccines give to the child at 10 weeks of age and 17 weeks of
      age.
