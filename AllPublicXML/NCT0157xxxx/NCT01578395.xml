      Trial with medicinal products

      Recent studies revealed that radiation-based procedures in patients may lead to DNA
      double-strand breaks in human blood lymphocytes. Additionally, ex vivo studies with human
      blood lymphocytes have shown a protective effect of antioxidant agents which have been
      described to decrease the number of DNA double-strand breaks.

      This study represents a prospective, double-blinded, randomized, single center, and
      placebo-controlled phase II clinical trial which analyzes the capability of antioxidant
      agents to decrease the number of DNA double-strand breaks in human blood lymphocytes in
      patients undergoing radiation-based cardiac examinations (30 patients with high-dose
      radiation exposure, 30 patients with low-dose radiation exposure, and 30 subjects without
      radiation exposure).

      A protective effect of antioxidant drugs in patients undergoing radiation-based examinations
      could therefore change patient management and would provide an important clinical impact.
