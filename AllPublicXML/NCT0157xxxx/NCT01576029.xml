      Primary Objective:

        -  To compare the continuation of treatment with docetaxel versus switching to cabazitaxel
           regarding the time to PSA (Prostatic Specific Antigen) progression (TTP-PSA), in
           patients with Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer (CRPC) that, after four cycles of
           docetaxel, have minor PSA response (defined as a reduction between 1% and 49%) or
           increase of up to 24% in PSA levels.

      Secondary Objectives:

        -  PSA response rate

        -  Overall survival (OS)

        -  Incidence of Adverse Events

        Inclusion criteria :

          -  Documentation of histological prostate cancer;

          -  Patients with metastatic CRPC (Castration-Resistant Metastatic Prostate Cancer) who
             progressed with hormone deprivation, including the withdrawal of antiandrogen-class
             drugs for at least 4 weeks, and 6 weeks for bicalutamide or if documented that PSA did
             not decrease during 3 months of this therapy;

          -  Documentation of metastasis by imaging (computerized tomography [CT], magnetic
             resonance imaging [MRI] or bone scan), in patients with PSA &lt; 20 ng/mL at the time of
             inclusion

          -  Provide minor PSA response (characterized by a reduction between 1% and 49%) or
             increase up to 24% in PSA levels, in relation to the value measured before starting
             docetaxel therapy, measured at least 7 days after the fourth cycle of docetaxel;

          -  Patient has received 4 cycles of docetaxel at a dose of 75 mg/m2 ;
