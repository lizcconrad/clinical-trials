  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether FAST (Fast muscle Activation and Stepping
      Training) exercises will improve walking balance in individuals after stroke to a greater
      extent than usual care.

      Hypothesis: The primary hypothesis is that improvements in walking balance will be larger
      following 12 sessions of FAST exercise retraining compared to usual care in persons in the
      sub-acute phase after stroke.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      It is estimated that 75-80% of individuals who have had a stroke will survive the acute event
      and be left with residual disability. Regaining independence in standing and walking is of
      utmost importance for patients recovering from stroke. Walking balance requires muscles in
      the legs and trunk to contract quickly if people lose their balance. Physical therapy plays a
      key role in the rehabilitation of walking balance in individuals after stroke. Given that
      maintaining one's balance requires fast muscle activity, rehabilitation post-stroke should
      focus on speed of movement. Thus we are proposing to compare a program that emphasizes speed
      of movement, Fast muscle Activation and Stepping Training versus an active control (usual
      care).
