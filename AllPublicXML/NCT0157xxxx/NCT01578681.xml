      The ELTGOL technique improves mucociliary clearance in adult patients with bronchiectasis.

      Primary objective:

      -To evaluate the efficacy of ELTGOL in stable state patients with bronchiectasis compared to
      placebo.

      Secondary objectives:

        -  To evaluate the level of knowledge of airway clearance techniques and adherence to them
           in patients with bronchiectasis.

        -  To assess the side effects during the procedure: oxygen desaturation, increased dyspnea
           and hemoptysis.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The incidence of bronchiectasis has increased in recent years resulting in greater costs,
      including periods of hospitalisation and the prescription of drugs.

      The mucociliary clearance mechanism is impaired in these patients, and chest physiotherapy
      has been recommended for patients with bronchiectasis and chronic productive cough and/or
      evidence of mucus plugging on HRCT.

      However, to date, there is insufficient evidence of benefits of chest physiotherapy through
      randomised controlled trials. Furthermore it rests unclear the most effective technique, the
      frequency and optimum duration of the RP and the most suitable variables to monitor.

      A multicenter clinical trial into the efficacy of one chest physiotherapy technique in airway
      clearance will fill this important &quot;gap&quot; in the scientific evidence.

    <description>Place the affected lung in infralateral, asks the patient to make an inspiration without being forced to medium volume, and then a slow expiration with the glottis open, down to residual volume. If the therapist is present place the abdominal caudal hand at putting pressure cranial head and hand is placed over the rib cage at a pressure of closing the rib cage. Otherwise, the patient self-administered intertwining arms and abdominal rib at top exerting the same pressure. In case you have two lungs affected the art will take place on one side and then the opposite.</description>
