    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to investigate the effect of consumption of a low-fat, no
      added sugar, dairy fermented product enriched with plant sterols and policosanols at two
      doses, on LDL-cholesterol concentration in hypercholesterolaemic adults after 3 weeks of
      product consumption versus active control product.
