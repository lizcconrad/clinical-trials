      This is a single dose study of radiolabelled LY2784544 in healthy male subjects to study the
      absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion of LY2784544. This study is for research
      purposes only and is not intended to treat any medical condition.

      This study is approximately 10 days long, (minimum 5 days, maximum 15 days) not including
      screening or follow up. Screening is required within 28 days prior to the first dose of study
      drug and follow up is required at least 7 days after discharge from the clinical research
      unit.
