  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      EUS-FNA is the standard of care for diagnosing pancreatic masses. According to the operator's
      preference, EUS-FNA with suction or without suction technique has been used. To date, little
      is known about optimal number of to-and-fro motion during each needle pass. As usual 10-15
      to-and-fro motions was used for EUS-FNA with suction technique. Theoretically, more number of
      to-and-fro motions may be required in EUS-FNA without suction. In this circumstance, the
      contamination of blood in specimen and possible adverse event may occur. To determine optimal
      number of to-and-fro motion in EUS-guided FNA for pancreatic masses in terms of with suction
      or without suction, this prospective single-blinded randomized trial was conducted.

      For this prospective single-blinded randomized trial, two 10cc syringes was prepared. Two
      syringe was provided as same performance. However, one syringe is falsely made as suction
      syringe (fake one). During EUS-FNA, two syringe is randomly assigned and loaded by a nurse.
      Thus, operator was blinded which syringe is with suction or without suction.

      First hypothesis: There is difference in the diagnostic accuracy of pancreatic masses
      according to EUS-FNA with suction or without suction/ different number of to-and-fro motion.

      Second hypothesis: There is difference in the amount of blood in samples obtained by EUS-FNA
      with suction or without suction/ different number of to-and-fro motion.
