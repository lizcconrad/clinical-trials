    <textblock>
      When considering occult infections during the diagnostic workup of inflammation in
      Hemodialysis (HD) patients, the urine-deprived bladder is frequently dismissed as potential
      site of infection. The urinary tract, even in end stage renal disease (ESRD) patients on
      hemodialysis may represent a significant reservoir for infection. Delayed diagnosis is a
      relevant issue because the urinary tract is often overlooked as a source of infection in
      dialysis patients, especially because of absence of urinary tract infection (UTI) symptoms in
      HD patients. Contributing factors to asymptomatic UTI in HD patients include the presence of
      low urine volume, bladder stasis, and the fact that UTI symptoms are mostly related to
      voiding, which is reduced or absent in these patients. Persistence of asymptomatic
      bacteriuria and UTI may be related to higher levels of inflammatory markers in HD population.
      In view of the association between cardiovascular disease and cardio-vascular and all-cause
      mortality with inflammation, as expressed by elevated CRP and/or IL-6 levels in HD patients,
      the investigators questioned whether presence of asymptomatic UTI could contribute to
      elevated levels of inflammatory markers in patients with ESRD on maintenance HD therapy. Such
      a finding would provide a potential link between a treatable infection and a potential
      cardiovascular risk factor in this population.
