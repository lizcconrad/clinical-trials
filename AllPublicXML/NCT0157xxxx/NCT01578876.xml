      This study was approved by the Institutional Review Board and Ethics Committee of 1st
      Hospital of Kunming Medical University, and all study subjects signed informed consent for
      participation in the study and all treatments performed. Subjects were patients who were
      hospitalized at Department of Cardiology of our hospital from December 2008 to December 2009.

      Patients were eligible to be included in the study if they met any of the following criteria:
      1) Coronary angiography (CA) or multi-slice CT coronary angiography (CTCA) suggestive of
      moderate to severe coronary artery stenosis. 2) Chest tightness, onset of shortness of
      breath, and poor exercise tolerance after receiving formal drug treatment (with or without
      stent or bypass graft). 3) Hospitalized more than 2 times within 1 year due to the
      aforementioned problems. 4) CCS angina grading higher than grade II, and NYHA functional
      classification of I-III. 5) More than 1 month after acute myocardial infarction (AMI) and
      more than 2 weeks after PCI surgery. The diagnosis and treatment in all the patients was in
      accordance with the related domestic and European guidelines developed in 2007

    <description>CSWT was performed with the MODULITH SLC SW therapy device (Storz Medical, Switzerland).Shock waves were triggered by the R-wave of the ECG when the instrument was activated. The shock wave energy was increased from an initial low level up 0.09 mJ/mm2 if the patient experienced no discomfort such as chest pain. Point-to-point combination treatment for the ischemic areas with 200 pulses delivered to each point was given.</description>
