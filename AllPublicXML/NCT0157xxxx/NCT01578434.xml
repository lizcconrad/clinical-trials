  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Rickets, a common nutritional disorder, is usually considered to be due to vitamin D
      deficiency. However, in the last few decades many studies have shown that in tropical
      countries, with abundance of sunshine, calcium deficiency may play a more important role in
      the causation of rickets. Studies from adults in India have also shown that calcium intake of
      our population is much below the recommended allowance. The calcium deficiency gets
      compounded by the high level of phytates in the conventional vegetarian diet consumed by the
      majority of the population. There are few studies on children in India / other Asian
      countries on assessment of dietary calcium intake.

      However, recent studies from many nations of the world have also shown a wide spread
      prevalence of vitamin D deficiency in adolescent and adult population. A study done at our
      own hospital has shown a high prevalence of vitamin D deficiency in lactating mothers and
      their infants.

      Since both Calcium and Vitamin D deficiency are likely to be present in children, it is not
      clear what plays a more important role in the etiology of rickets in India or other Asian
      countries.

      The present study is therefore planned with the following objectives:

        1. To study the dietary calcium intake, sun exposure and serum vitamin D levels in children
           with and without rickets.

        2. To compare the role of Calcium Carbonate, Vitamin D and a combination of the two in the
           treatment of nutritional rickets.
