    <textblock>
      Hypothesis: The use of parent education and medical play will be able to reduce patient
      discomfort with potential uncomfortable medical procedures.

      Children that have urinary tract infections and those diagnosed with vesicoureteral reflux
      undergo a procedure called a voiding cystourethrogram (VCUG) to identify and follow
      vesicoureteral reflux. For many children and parents this can lead to considerable distress.
      Pre-procedure preparation can potentially reduce anxiety and improve overall experience with
      the procedure.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Children that are evaluated medically and found to need a VCUG would be eligible for
      participation in this study. Children would be randomized to having play therapy or a
      parental education brochure. The study would have no impact on the child recieving the state
      of the art medical care.

      Play therapy involves having the child play through the process of the study with a child
      life therapist, in an effort to prepare the child for the procedure. Parents/patients will be
      given a pre and post procedure evaluation form to objectively categorize the parental/patient
      perception of the experience with the study.

    <description>Medical play therapy could potentially reduce parental and pateint anxiety when used for preparing children for medical procedures. This study is designed to identify if play therapy can lead to reduction in parental and pateint anxiety with voiding cystourethrogram - a commonly performed test for the evaluation of children with urinary tract infections.</description>
