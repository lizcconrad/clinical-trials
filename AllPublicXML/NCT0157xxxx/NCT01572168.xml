  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cancer-related fatigue occurs in both adult and pediatric patients undergoing chemotherapy
      and/or radiation. Recently, methods to measure fatigue have improved - however, no
      non-medication interventions have been studied. Ameliorating fatigue may result in an
      improved quality of life for patients. Acupuncture is a safe and well-tolerated procedure and
      has been used for many indications in pediatric patients. Adult studies have suggested
      improvement in cancer-related fatigue after acupuncture in adults. In this trial, we propose
      using acupuncture for the treatment in cancer-related fatigue in children and adolescents
      with central nervous system tumors.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients who are ≥ 8 year of age and ≤ 21 years of age who are undergoing chemotherapy
             and/or radiation therapy for the treatment of any primary or recurrent central nervous
             system tumor (regardless of diagnosis or disease stage, whether it is malignant or
             benign, and in any location) at Children's Memorial Hospital.

          -  Patients who recently completed therapy (within 60 days of enrollment) will also be
             eligible. Patients must have a minimum baseline fatigue score of 15 on the pedsFACIT-F
             scale (Range 0-44). This is not a standard assessment for required clinical care and
             will only be administered by a research assistant to any patient after consent has
             been obtained. The assessment will be done during a routine clinic visit.

          -  For patients receiving cytotoxic chemotherapy with a history of myelosuppression or
             radiation, a hemoglobin concentration of &gt;8 g/dL measured within 10 days of enrollment
             and a platelet count of &gt; 30,000 within 5 days of enrollment is required.

          -  Patients must also be able to read and understand English and read a computer screen.

          -  Patients with no known contraindications to acupuncture therapy.

          -  Patients who are able to attend all scheduled visits for acupuncture.

          -  Patients must have a Karnofsky Performance Score of ≥ 50% or a Lansky Performance
             Score of ≥ 50.

          -  Patients who have provided informed consent for the research study (parental consent
             for patients &lt; 18 years of age). Patients between 12 years and 18 years of age must
             provide assent in additional to parental consents.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with evidence of any cognitive dysfunction that would limit their abilities
             to report fatigue.

          -  Patients who have received acupuncture in the previous six weeks.

          -  Patients with a life expectancy &lt; 3 months.

          -  Patients who are pregnant or lactating.

          -  Patients with a past history of therapy or scheduled visits non-compliance, as
             determined by their treating physician.
