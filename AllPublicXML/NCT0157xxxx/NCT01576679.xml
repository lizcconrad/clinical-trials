  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to establish the efficacy of tPA when used in pediatric
      intra-abdominal abscesses immediately after percutaneous drainage, irrespective of the
      ultrasound appearance or consistency of the drained fluid.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The use of tPA in pediatric abdominal abscesses is poorly defined. The indications are
      somewhat subjective and the dosage guidelines vary between institutions. Some studies have
      suggested that it be administered at, or soon after, the time of drainage if the ultrasound
      appearance of the collection is complex and/or septated, or if the initial aspirated contents
      are thick and viscous. Both criteria are difficult to accurately define and implement. In
      many instances, when there is minimal ongoing drainage despite follow-up ultrasound
      appearances suggesting a significant residual collection, tPA is administered several days
      following the initial procedure.

      The purpose of this study is to establish the efficacy of tPA in the initial treatment of all
      pediatric intra-abdominal abcesses and a standardized manner in which it can be used. This
      may eventually lead to a change in practice in the management of this patient population.

    <description>The primary outcome is the length of time (in hours) the drain remains insitu.
For the primary outcome the individual abscess will be the unit of measurement; if there are multiple abscesses (up to a maximum of three) in the one patient each abscess will receive the same treatment. In the case of more than one drain being inserted in a single patient, the length of time that each drain remains in situ will be recorded individually.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. All patients under the age of 18 years with intra-abdominal bacterial abscesses
             requiring percutaneous drain insertion (including transrectal drains).

          2. Drain(s) must be inserted within the 23hrs prior to enrollment in the study.

          3. The underlying diagnosis of the condition will not affect the enrollment of the
             patient unless it is detailed within the exclusion criteria (section 4.1.2).

          4. Patients and parents must have signed informed consent to participate in the study.

        Exclusion Criteria:1.

          1. Pancreatic abscess (not bacterial in nature)

          2. Known coagulation impairment

          3. Known central nervous system tumor or abscesses

          4. Arteriovenous malformation

          5. Aneurysm or history of central nervous system bleeding

          6. Hypersensitivity to tPA

          7. Recent administration of an investigational drug (within previous 30 days)

          8. Pregnancy

          9. Breast-feeding

         10. Fulminant hepatic failure

         11. Proven fistula (as it will alter the drainage time) or any abscess secondary to
             Crohn's Disease (because fistula existence cannot be excluded)

         12. Necrotizing enterocolitis

         13. Children requiring 4 or more drains
