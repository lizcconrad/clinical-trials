      The purpose of this study is to see if treatment with sodium bicarbonate will lower urine
      levels of proteins that are indicators of kidney damage in people with diabetes who also have
      chronic kidney disease.

    <textblock>
      Diabetic chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a common problem in Veterans and progresses to
      end-stage renal disease in many people. It is important to identify treatment strategies that
      will help prevent the progression of CKD to overt kidney failure. The purpose of this study
      is to see if sodium bicarbonate reduces urinary markers of kidney damage in Veterans with
      diabetic CKD and normal serum bicarbonate levels.
