    <textblock>
      This is a sub-project of a larger NIDRR Grant. One promising form of robotic training that
      leverages the power of neuro-plasticity is error augmentation. In this paradigm the computer
      singles out and magnifies a stroke survivor's movement errors from a desired trajectory, thus
      forcing the subjects to strengthen their control. Using the VRROOM, a state-of-the-art system
      which uses haptics (robotic forces) and graphics (visual display) interfaces, a subject's
      desired trajectory can be determined and the movement errors can be amplified in real-time
      with dramatic results. This project evaluates a practical approach of error augmentation,
      using therapist-driven trajectories. The investigators intend to determine clinical efficacy
      of several types of therapist-assisted error augmentation on retraining the nervous system in
      functional activities. The investigators will test two experimental treatments in a crossover
      design. The investigators hypothesize that combined haptic and visual error augmentation will
      lead to the best functional recovery.
