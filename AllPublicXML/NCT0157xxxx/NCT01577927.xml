  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients at high complexity with severe chronic diseases can require several admission in
      intensive care units (ICU) to overcome acute exacerbations by the use of assisted
      ventilation. In the last 10 years, new technologies and beds in ICU evidenced a new group of
      patients often needing weaning procedures due to a long-lasting period of mechanical
      ventilation. These patients are often under chronic conditions with recurrent symptoms,
      reduced effort tolerance and depression.

      Weaning process is a frail step in the medical history of a patient who has survived an acute
      episode of respiratory failure and has spent a period of time under mechanical ventilation.
      Patients are followed for the duration of in-hospital stay, an expected average period of 4
      weeks.

      When discharged fron an Intensive Care Unit (ICU) or a weaning center, the patient is usually
      managed by GPs and by the hospital where he has been admitted to following re-exacerbations.
      The conventional approach is for sure inadequate for this type of patient whose clinical
      complexity, disability and frailty need for a continuity of care through a higher complex
      approach of management.

      A structured program of Home Rehabilitation could be a possible solution to this problem.
      Thus, the hypothesis of the study is to evaluate feasibility and sustainability and efficacy
      of a home rehabilitative network for prolonged weaned patients discharged from a weaning
      unit.

      Patients referred to the Fondazione Salvatore Maugeri for prolonged weaning are enrolled and
      trained in an individualised program of home care in order to recover their own autonomies.
      Home care compares 2 arms: usual care vs physiotherapist (PT)-assisted care. Usual care
      consists in supporting drug and oxygen therapy, mechanical ventilation, GP's assistance,
      periodical in-hospital visit. The PT-assisted home care is supported by PT at least 2
      times/month, autonomous 50 min physical activity/working day by the help of a DVD. The
      physical activity consists in cyclette, calisthenic exercises, and training of the
      respiratory muscles. Few brief educational lessons by PT preceded the training activity.
      Every two weeks, PT calls the patient by phone for an educational reinforcement.
