      This clinical trial will compare the effectiveness of the Healthy Outcomes through Patient
      Empowerment (HOPE) intervention to enhanced usual care (EUC) for diabetes and depression at 6
      and 12 month follow-up. The proposed study is a randomized controlled trial enrolling 242
      largely rural Veterans with uncontrolled diabetes and clinically-significant depressive
      symptoms. Both groups will receive screening, education, and notification of clinical
      findings along with follow-up in usual primary care. HOPE participants will also receive
      behavioral coaching telephone sessions over a six month period. Patients in the control group
      will be screened, and providers will be notified of high risk patients' status and need for
      intervention. Both groups will receive only usual primary care during the subsequent 6 month
      maintenance period. Study measurements using self-report questionnaires will also be
      collected at baseline, 6 and 12 months follow-up. The investigators will also conduct chart
      reviews to evaluate usual care blood tests for diabetes control. Changes in measurements from
      baseline will be compared between groups. This intervention will reach Veterans in rural
      setting where community-based primary care is needed, especially care that blends treatment
      strategies for physical and emotional health.

  <detailed_description>

      Project Background: The co-occurrence of diabetes and depressive symptoms is highly prevalent
      and has dramatic consequences on the quality of life and health of affected patients. Due to
      the complex interrelation between these conditions, patients often experience both
      psychological and physiological difficulties. Furthermore, Veterans with diabetes and
      depressive symptoms in rural settings have limited access to care. Interventions that reach
      Veterans in rural / community-based primary care are needed, especially those that blend
      treatment strategies for physical and emotional health.

      Project Objectives: Specific (Primary) Aim (1): Compare the effectiveness of the Healthy
      Outcomes through Patient Empowerment (HOPE) intervention to enhanced usual care (EUC) at 6
      and 12 month follow-up.

      Hypothesis 1a: After 6 months (active treatment phase), HOPE will produce greater
      improvements in diabetes control (measured by hemoglobin A1c levels) and depression (measured
      by PHQ-9 scores) than will EUC.

      Hypothesis 1b: At 12 months (6-month active phase plus 6-month maintenance phase), HOPE
      participants will continue to evidence significant greater improvements in HbA1c and PHQ-9
      compared with EUC participants.

      Exploratory Specific Aim (2): To examine the role of moderators and mediators on intervention
      effectiveness Exploratory Aim 2a. To evaluate factors that mediate or moderate effectiveness
      at 6 and 12 months for all enrolled patients (regardless of intervention group assignment).
      Potential mediating and moderating variables include patient-level (clinical factors-diabetes
      distress and self-efficacy and sociodemographics) and facility-level factors (availability of
      medical and mental health services by clinical site).

      Exploratory Aim 2b. To evaluate factors that mediate or moderate effectiveness at 6 and 12
      months for patients enrolled in the HOPE intervention arm. Intervention factors include
      adherence (e.g. session attendance), fidelity (ratings of coach effectiveness), and treatment
      implementation (e.g., goal setting quality and self-management behaviors) as well as any
      significant predictors obtained from Aim 1a.

      Exploratory Specific Aim (3): Evaluate the potential for embedding the HOPE intervention
      processes within a VA CBOC using the REAIM framework for evaluating effectiveness of
      behavioral interventions.

      Exploratory Aim 3a - Reach. Compare clinical and demographic characteristics of enrolled
      study participants with the characteristics of all potentially eligible patients at each
      CBOC.

      Exploratory Aim 3b - Adoption. Qualitatively elicit clinicians' perceptions of behavioral
      coaches, patients' use of action plans, and responses to coaches' recommendations in
      preparation for future implementation

      Project Methods: The proposed study is a randomized controlled trial enrolling 242 largely
      rural Veterans with uncontrolled diabetes and clinically-significant depressive symptoms.
      Both groups will receive screening, education, and notification of clinical findings along
      with follow-up in usual primary care. HOPE participants will also receive 6 behavioral
      coaching telephone sessions and 3 booster sessions over a six month period. Coaches will use
      a standardized, theory-based process for conducting the sessions with the aim of creating
      patient-centered and articulated goals and behavioral action plans. Participants' primary
      care providers will be notified about session discussions and the resultant goals and action
      plans. Both groups will receive only usual primary care during the subsequent 6 months
      maintenance period. Hemoglobin A1c and PHQ-9 measurements along with self-report
      questionnaires will also be collected at baseline, 6 and 12 months follow-up. Changes in
      measurements from baseline will be compared between groups. Analytic evaluations of
      intervention mediators/moderators and implementation will also be conducted at 6 and 12
      months follow-up.

             participant self-report of clinically significant depressive symptoms according to the
             PHQ-9, where a score of greater than/equal to 10 on the PHQ-9 will signify a
             clinically meaningful symptom burden.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  The investigators will exclude potential participants only for clinical factors that
             would render a telephone-based behavioral activation intervention inappropriate.

          -  Specific exclusion criteria are:

               -  lack of regular access to a telephone

               -  significant cognitive impairment (three or more errors) on an established
                  six-item screening exam

               -  presence of uncorrected hearing or vision impairment

               -  their medical chart recommends not titrating therapy due to prior history of
                  significant hypoglycemic events

               -  they live within 20 miles of the MEDVAMC.

          -  Patients will be secondarily excluded if their HbA1C level falls below 7.5% at
             baseline assessment, or if they report suicidal ideation on the PHQ-9 at baseline
             assessment.

          -  Patients receiving mental health services at the time of study recruitment will not be
             excluded.

          -  All mental health treatments and health service-use characteristics will be included
             in study analyses as covariates.

Participants are screened for diabetes self-management behaviors and control and for active depressive and anxiety symptoms. Primary care providers are alerted of the patients' status and given decision support to enhance care for these uncontrolled conditions.
Enhanced Usual Care: All participants receive usual VA primary care plus a dedicated screening for diabetes control and clinically significant depressive symptoms. Patients and primary care providers are notified of these results and given recommendations for usual care.</description>

Hemoglobin A1C is a blood test taken to assess average blood glucose levels in the body. Normal range of A1C level is below 5.7. Eligible participants had an A1C of 7.5 or higher. The higher the A1C the more a person's diabetes is uncontrolled.</description>
