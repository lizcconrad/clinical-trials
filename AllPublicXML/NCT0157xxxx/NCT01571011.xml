  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to determine whether a culturally tailored, low-cost, primary
      care/internet based depression prevention intervention (CURB) is superior to wait-list
      control for African American and Hispanic youth in terms of depression-related outcomes. It
      is hypothesized that compared to teens in the wait-list control condition, teens in the CURB
      program will exhibit lower levels of depressed mood and/or more rapid changes in mood during
      the follow-up time.

      Additional aims and hypotheses are provided here:

      Aim 2: To determine whether or not participants in the CURB primary care/Internet based
      depression prevention intervention will have a significantly lower cumulative incidence of
      any depressive episode at 3 months compared to adolescents in the usual care wait-list group.

      Hypothesis 2: Compared to youth in the wait-list control condition, youth in the CURB program
      will have a lower incidence of depressive episodes at 6 month follow-up.

      Aim 3: To determine whether CURB is sustainable in primary care from the perspective of
      health care professionals and primary care physicians in urban primary care settings.

      Hypothesis 3: We hypothesize that providers will rate the intervention (by component)
      feasibility, acceptability, willingness to perform intervention and sustainability &gt; 7 on a
      1-10 scale (1, not feasible, 10 very feasible).

    <description>The intervention is made up of 14 internet modules based on behavioral activation, cognitive behavioral therapy, and interpersonal psychotherapy as well as motivational interviews in the primary care setting (to enhance behavior change). It is suggested that an adolescent navigates through 2 modules a week. The motivational interviews with the physicians occur directly before and after the adolescent is exposed to the website (at baseline and 3 months) in the providers office. The parents of the enrolled adolescents are also invited to navigate through their own, 3 module, parent internet program.</description>
