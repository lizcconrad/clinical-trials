  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Post thrombotic syndrome (PTS) is a frequent and burdensome complication of proximal
      deep-vein thrombosis.Therapeutic options for PTS are limited and mainly rely on its
      prevention. Therapeutic trials evidenced that elastic compression stockings (ECS) applying
      30-40mmHg of pressure at the ankle reduced the rate of PTS by 50%. Although ECS are unlikely
      to cause harm, in clinical practice, compliance to this treatment appears to be low as ECS
      may be difficult to apply and to wear.

      ECS with a lighter compression strength (20-30mmHg) might be easier to apply and be more
      comfortable. This could favor a better compliance.

      CELEST is a randomized, multicentre, double-blind trial which aims to determine whether ECS
      applying 25mmHg of targeted pressure at the ankle are non inferior to ECS applying 35mmHg of
      targeted pressure at the ankle

      CELEST trial is a controlled, randomized, multicentre, non-inferiority double-blind trial
      which aims to determine whether ECS applying 25mmHg of targeted pressure at the ankle are non
      inferior to ECS applying 35mmHg of targeted pressure at the ankle. Patients with a first
      acute symptomatic proximal DVT will be randomized to wear for two years either ECS applying
      25mmHg of targeted pressure at the ankle or ECS applying 35mmHg of targeted pressure at the
      ankle. All patients will be prescribed anticoagulants for at least three months. The primary
      outcome will be the rate of PTS assessed with the Villalta scale in both arms of the study
      during the 2 years study period. Rate of compliance,severity of PTS and quality of life in
      both groups will constitute the main secondary outcomes.
