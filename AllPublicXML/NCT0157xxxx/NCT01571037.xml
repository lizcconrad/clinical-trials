  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Right ventricular (RV) failure occurs in an estimated 5-41% of cases involving left
      ventricular assist device (LVAD) implantation and has been shown to adversely affect
      peri-operative morbidity and mortality. Current therapies to improve RV dysfunction pre and
      post-operatively are limited. Inhaled milrinone has been shown in several small human studies
      to be safely tolerated and provide favorable effects on pulmonary hemodynamics.

      Study Hypothesis: Delivery of inhaled milrinone, a phosphodiesterase III inhibitor, may
      provide pulmonary artery vasodilation and therefore improved RV function in patients with end
      stage heart failure receiving HeartMate II LVAD as a bridge to cardiac transplantation or as
      destination therapy.

      Specifically, we aim to:

        -  demonstrate safety of inhaled milrinone in this patient cohort

        -  demonstrate efficacy of inhaled milrinone in this patient cohort

1 mg/ml milrinone (dissolved in dextrose) and diluted in 0.9% normal saline in a 1:1 ratio to final drug concentration of 0.5mg/ml will be delivered via an IV pump at a fixed dose of 12 ml/hour which will run into a vibrating mesh nebulizer reservoir, connected to the mechanical ventilator circuit. Inhaled milrinone will begin at time of resumption of mechanical ventilation when initiating wean from cardiopulmonary bypass after LVAD implantation in the operating room, and run continuously for a total maximum duration of 24 hours OR until the patient is extubated whichever occurs first. Plasma milrinone levels will be assessed to determine if systemic milrinone absorption occurs after prolonged milrinone inhalation.</description>
