    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the safety, efficacy and pharmacokinetics of OMS302
      (the study drug) for maintaining intraoperative mydriasis and preventing post operative pain
      in individuals undergoing Intraocular Lens Replacement (ILR) surgery.

    <measure>Mean Area Under the Curve Analysis of Change-from-Baseline in Pupil Diameter (mm) During Surgery</measure>
    <time_frame>From surgery baseline (pre-incision) through surgery end (time of cortical clean-up/wound closure)</time_frame>
    <description>The co-primary analysis of the change in pupil diameter based on the mean area under the curve (AUC) pupil diameter change from baseline. First, the AUC of the pupil diameter from surgical baseline to wound closure was calculated using the trapezoidal rule. Second, the mean AUC was obtained by dividing the AUC by the total time of surgery. Third, the mean AUC of change from baseline was calculated by subtracting the baseline pupil diameter from the mean AUC.</description>

    <measure>Mean Area Under the Curve Analysis of Ocular Pain VAS Score Within 12 Hours Postoperatively</measure>
    <time_frame>12 hours postoperatively</time_frame>
    <description>The co-primary analysis of the ocular pain VAS (where 0 = no pain and 100 = worst possible pain) based on the mean area under the curve (AUC). The AUC of the ocular pain VAS during 12 hours postoperatively was calculated by the trapezoidal rule in which the hour 11 was used to represent the time-point 10-12 hour. The mean AUC was defined as the AUC divided by the number of hours with ocular pain VAS results during the first 12 hours postoperatively.</description>

    <description>The number of subjects who report ocular pain-free status (VAS equal to 0) at all time points during 12 hours postoperatively summarized by treatment arm. Subjects with missing VAS scores during the 12 hours postoperatively were considered as not being pain-free.</description>

    <measure>Postoperative Ocular Inflammation - Mean Summed Ocular Inflammation Score (SOIS) on Day 1</measure>
    <time_frame>One day postoperatively</time_frame>
    <description>Postoperative inflammation as measured using the Summed Ocular Inflammation Score (SOIS), summarized by treatment arm and time point. Ocular inflammation was evaluated by measuring the anterior chamber cell count and flare using a slit lamp biomicroscope. SOIS was calculated by adding the average of subject's anterior chamber cells and flare grades. The minimum SOIS was 0 (indicating absence of inflammation), whereas the maximum SOIS was 8.
Grading was as follows:
Anterior Chamber Cells: Grade None = 0/no cells; Grade Mild = +1/1-5 cells; Grade Moderate = +2/6-15 cells; Grade Severe = +3/16-30 cells; Grade Very Severe = +4/&gt;30 cells.
Anterior Chamber Flare: Grade None = 0/no Tyndall effect; Grade Mild = +1/barely discernable Tyndall effect; Grade Moderate = +2/moderately intense Tyndall beam in anterior chamber; Grade Severe = +3/severely intense Tyndall beam; Grade Very Severe = +4/very severely intense Tyndall beam with a white and milky appearance to the aqueous</description>

    <measure>Postoperative Best Corrected Visual Acuity (BVCA) on Day 1</measure>
    <time_frame>One day postoperatively</time_frame>
    <description>Best Corrected Visual Acuity (BCVA) summarized by the Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) visual acuity log score. The reason for missing scores (e.g., subject could not read enough letters to obtain a score or refraction was not completed) was also summarized. For subjects without a score due to inability to read the ETDRS chart, the log score was imputed as 1.6 for the purpose of treatment comparisons. Subjects without a score because the manifest refraction was not completed were excluded from the analysis.</description>

    <measure>Systemic Pharmacokinetics (PK) of OMS302</measure>
    <time_frame>24 hours</time_frame>
    <description>Systemic pharmacokinetics (PK) of phenylephrine (PE) and ketorolac (KE) were performed in a subset of subjects. Descriptive summary statistics for area-under-the-serum-concentration-time curve (AUC), maximum concentration (Cmax), time to Cmax (Tmax), and terminal phase half-life (t1/2) were to be generated if measured plasma concentrations were adequate for analysis. Descriptive statistics for pharmacokinetics were not performed as detected concentrations were low and insufficient for analysis.</description>

First, the AUC of the pupil diameter from surgical baseline to wound closure was calculated using the trapezoidal rule.

Third, the mean AUC of change from baseline was calculated by subtracting the baseline pupil diameter from the mean AUC.</description>

        <title>Postoperative Ocular Inflammation - Mean Summed Ocular Inflammation Score (SOIS) on Day 1</title>
        <description>Postoperative inflammation as measured using the Summed Ocular Inflammation Score (SOIS), summarized by treatment arm and time point. Ocular inflammation was evaluated by measuring the anterior chamber cell count and flare using a slit lamp biomicroscope. SOIS was calculated by adding the average of subject’s anterior chamber cells and flare grades. The minimum SOIS was 0 (indicating absence of inflammation), whereas the maximum SOIS was 8.
Grading was as follows:
Anterior Chamber Cells: Grade None = 0/no cells; Grade Mild = +1/1-5 cells; Grade Moderate = +2/6-15 cells; Grade Severe = +3/16-30 cells; Grade Very Severe = +4/&gt;30 cells.
Anterior Chamber Flare: Grade None = 0/no Tyndall effect; Grade Mild = +1/barely discernable Tyndall effect; Grade Moderate = +2/moderately intense Tyndall beam in anterior chamber; Grade Severe = +3/severely intense Tyndall beam; Grade Very Severe = +4/very severely intense Tyndall beam with a white and milky appearance to the aqueous</description>

          <title>Systemic Pharmacokinetics (PK) of OMS302</title>
          <description>Systemic pharmacokinetics (PK) of phenylephrine (PE) and ketorolac (KE) were performed in a subset of subjects. Descriptive summary statistics for area-under-the-serum-concentration-time curve (AUC), maximum concentration (Cmax), time to Cmax (Tmax), and terminal phase half-life (t1/2) were to be generated if measured plasma concentrations were adequate for analysis. Descriptive statistics for pharmacokinetics were not performed as detected concentrations were low and insufficient for analysis.</description>

          <description>OMS302 diluted in Balanced Salt Solution and administered as irrigation solution during Intraocular Lens Replacement surgery.
OMS302: OMS302 drug product will be supplied as a sterile, clear colorless liquid, free from particulates of foreign matter. Each vial contains a nominal 4.5 mL of solution containing 60.75 mM phenylephrine HCl and 11.25 mM ketorolac tromethamine formulated in a 20 mM sodium citrate buffer (pH 6.3 +/- 0.5). For administration to patients, 4.4 mL of the drug product are added to a 500-mL bottle of commercially available BSS through a syringe filter, resulting in 4.0 mL of the drug product in the 500-mL bottle.</description>
