    <textblock>
      Human papillomavirus (HPV) infection is a worldwide problem strictly linked to the
      development of cervical cancer. Persistence of the infection is one of the main factors
      responsible for the invasive progression and women diagnosed with intraepithelial squamous
      lesions are referred for further assessment and surgical treatments which are prone to
      complications. Despite this, there are several reports on the spontaneous regression of the
      infection.

      In this study the investigators will evaluate the effectiveness of a long term
      polyhexamethylene biguanide (PHMB)-based local treatment in improve the viral clearance
      reducing the time exposure to the infection and avoiding the complications associated with
      the invasive treatments currently available.

      Women diagnosed with HPV infection were randomly assigned to receive six months of treatment
      with a PHMB-based gynaecological solution (Monogin®) or to remain untreated for the same
      period of time.

      The administration of Monogin® has been performed every three days for fifteen days and then
      every fifteen days for the subsequent six months.
