      Subjects were randomized to receive either tositumomab (Anti-B1 Antibody) and iodine I 131
      tositumomab (Arm A) or unlabeled tositumomab (Arm B). Subjects randomized to Arm B were
      allowed to cross over and receive I 131 tositumomab once their disease had progressed as long
      as they still fulfilled the protocol entry criteria (except for exclusion criterion 12, prior
      monoclonal antibody therapy) and were human anti-murine antibody (HAMA) negative. Study
      endpoint assessments of response were conducted by a Masked Independent Randomized
      Radiographic and Oncologic Review (MIRROR) panel and the Study Investigators' assessments of
      safety and survival. Subjects who completed at least two years of follow-up in Protocol
      BEX104515 (formerly Corixa Protocol RIT-II-002) were enrolled in long term follow-up Protocol
      BEX104526 (formerly Corixa Protocol CCBX001-051), an administrative protocol, for continued
      radiographic response evaluations and safety evaluations every 6 months for years 3 through 5
      post-treatment and annually for years 6 through 10 post-treatment. Subjects in BEX104526 were
      assessed for survival, disease status, subsequent therapy for NHL, and long-term safety,
      including the use of thyroid medication, development of hypothyroidism, human anti murine
      antibody (HAMA), myelodysplastic syndrome, acute myelogenous leukemia, and all other
      secondary malignancies. Additionally, subjects were followed for the development of any
      adverse event(s) deemed by the Principal Investigator as being possibly or probably related
      to a subject's previous treatment with Iodine I-131 tositumomab. Laboratory evaluations
      consisting of a thyroid stimulating hormone level and a complete blood cell count, with a
      differential and platelet count, were obtained annually through year 10 post-treatment.

      Dosimetric Dose: Subjects received 450 mg of tositumomab IV followed by 5.0 mCi of Iodine
      I-131 and 35 mg of tositumomab. Following the dosimetric dose, whole body dosimetry was
      performed on each subject using a total body gamma camera. Whole body anterior and posterior
      whole body images were obtained at the following timepoints.

        1. Within one hour of infusion of the dosimetric dose and prior to urination

        2. 2-4 days after infusion of the dosimetric dose, following urination

        3. 6-7 days after infusion of the dosimetric dose, following urination Therapeutic Dose:
           The total body residence time, derived from total body gamma camera counts obtained at
           the 3 time points, was used to calculate the iodine-131 activity (mCi) to be
           administered to deliver the therapeutic total body irradiation dose of 65 or 75 cGy. The
           therapeutic step was administered 7-14 days after the dosimetric step and consisted of
           tositumomab 450 mg followed by an activity (mCi) of iodine-131 calculated to deliver 75
           cGy or 65 cGy of total body irradiation, depending on platelet count, and 35 mg of
           tositumomab.

      For subjects with ≥150,000 platelets/mm3, the recommended dose was the activity of iodine-131
      calculated to deliver 75 cGy of total body irradiation; for subjects with NCI Grade 1
      thrombocytopenia (platelet counts ≥100,000 but &lt;150,000 platelets/mm3), the recommended dose
      was the activity of iodine-131 calculated to deliver 65 cGy of total body irradiation.

      This is a Phase II randomized, controlled, two-arm, open-label, multicenter study comparing
      the safety and efficacy of tositumomab and iodine I 131 tositumomab to tositumomab for the
      treatment of chemotherapy-relapsed or refractory low-grade or transformed low-grade B-cell
      NHL.

      Treatment Arm A: Subject will undergo 2 phases of study. In the first phase, termed
      &quot;dosimetric dose&quot;, subjects will receive tositumomab (450 mg) followed by tositumomab (35 mg)
      that has been trace labeled with 5mCi) Iodine-131 tositumomab. Whole body gamma camera scans
      will be obtained on day 0, day 2, 3, or 4, and day 6 or 7 following the dosimetric dose.
      Using the dosimetric data from three imaging time points, a subject-specific dose of iodine I
      131 tositumomab to deliver the desired total body dose of radiotherapy will be calculated. In
      the second phase of the study, termed &quot;therapeutic dose&quot;, subjects will receive unlabeled
      tositumomab (450mg) followed by iodine tositumomab (35mg) labeled with the subject-specific
      dose of iodine I-131 to deliver a whole body dose of 75 cGy to subjects. Subjects with
      platelet counts of 100,001 - 149,999 cells/mm3, will receive 65 cGy and subjects who are
      obese will be doses based on 137% of their lean body mass. Subjects will be treated with
      either saturated solution potassium iodide (SSKI), Lugol's solution, or potassium iodide
      tablets starting at least 24 hours prior to the first infusion of the Iodine-131 tositumomab
      (i.e., the dosimetric dose) and continuing for 14 days following the last infusion of
      radiolabeled tositumomab (i.e., the therapeutic dose).

      Treatment Arm B: Subjects will receive the same amount of unlabeled tositumomab (450 + 35 mg)
      administered over the same time-frame as Arm A on the study Days 0 and 7 (the day 7 dose may
      be delayed but no longer than 14 days after the first dose).

      Crossover treatment Arm B: Subjects in Arm B may crossover and receive Iodine-131 tositumomab
      following progression of their lymphoma if they still fulfill the protocol inclusion
      exclusion criteria (except exclusion criteria#12) and are HAMA-negative.

    <description>Tositumomab is a murine (mouse) antibody (immunoglobulin) of the IgG2a subclass. Participants in this study were evaluated to determine whether they developed an immune response to study treatment as evident by human anti-mouse antibodies (HAMA) after administration of tositumomab and iodine I 131 tositumomab. A positive HAMA value indicates that the participant developed human anti-mouse antibodies above the HAMA assay threshold, and a negative HAMA value indicates either the absence or below threshold level of human anti-mouse antibodies.</description>

        <description>An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a participant administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment. Causality of AEs was determined by the investigators as &quot;none,&quot; &quot;remote,&quot; &quot;possible,&quot; &quot;probable,&quot; or &quot;highly probable.&quot; AEs considered by the investigator as being at least remotely related to the study treatment were considered to be DR AEs. White blood cell (WBC) count and absolute neutrophil count (ANC) were measured as cells per millimeters cubed (mm^3); hemoglobin was measured in grams per deciliter (g/dL).</description>

        <title>Number of Participants With the Indicated Type of Infection</title>
        <description>An infection is the colonization of a host organism by a parasite species. Infecting parasites seek to use the host's resources to reproduce, often resulting in disease. Specimen samples of the body fluid are cultured for testing whether the infectious organism is present and grown in the culture media to assess the growth pattern of the organisms present in the specimen. The culture results could be positive or negative. The positive culture results indicate that the tested participant has the infection under investigation, in which case therapeutic treatment with anti-infective is required.</description>
        <time_frame>Participants were evaluated for up to two years in Study BEX104515 and for up to 11.9 years in Study BEX104526.</time_frame>

            <description>Participants received a dosimetric dose (DD) consisting of 450 milligrams (mg) of tositumomab (TST) intravenously (IV) followed by 5.0 millicurie (mCi) of Iodine I 131 and 35 mg of TST IV. The therapeutic dose (TD) consisting of 450 mg of TST IV, followed by a participant-specific dose of I 131 (75 centigray [cGy] or 65 cGy) and 35 mg of TST IV, was administered 7-14 days after the DD. Participants who had completed at least 2 years of follow-up after administration of TST/I 131 TST during the TD phase and had signed the informed consent to participate in the Long-Term Follow-Up (LTFU) study (BEX104526) were followed for up to 10 years.

        <title>Number of Participants With an Infection for Which Anti-infectives Were Administered</title>
        <description>Anti-infectives are capable of acting against infection, by inhibiting the spread of an infectious agent or by killing the infectious agent outright. Anti-infective is a general term that encompasses antibacterials, antibiotics, antifungals, antiprotozoans, and antivirals.</description>
        <time_frame>Participants were evaluated for up to two years in Study BEX104515 and for up to 11.9 years in Study BEX104526.</time_frame>
        <population>ITT-Exposed Population. Only those participants who had an infection during the study and during the follow-up period were analyzed.</population>

        <title>Number of Participants With the Indicated Serious Adverse Events (SAE) Related to Study Drug</title>
        <description>An SAE is any event occurring at any dose that results in any of the following: death, a life-threatening adverse drug experience (ADE; at immediate risk of death from the experience as it occurred), inpatient hospitalization/prolongation of existing hospitalization, a persistent/significant disability/incapacity, or a congenital anomaly/birth defect. Medical events that may not result in death, be life-threatening, or require hospitalization may be considered to be a serious ADEs when based upon appropriate medical judgment. Relatedness was based on the investigator's medical judgement.</description>
        <time_frame>Participants were evaluated for up to two years in Study BEX104515 and for up to 11.9 years in Study BEX104526.</time_frame>
        <population>ITT-Exposed Population. All participants who experienced any SAE were analyzed.</population>

            <title>TST and Iodine I 131 TST</title>
            <description>Participants received a dosimetric dose (DD) consisting of 450 milligrams (mg) of tositumomab (TST) intravenously (IV) followed by 5.0 millicurie (mCi) of Iodine I 131 and 35 mg of TST IV. The therapeutic dose (TD) consisting of 450 mg of TST IV, followed by a participant-specific dose of I 131 (75 centigray [cGy] or 65 cGy) and 35 mg of TST IV, was administered 7-14 days after the DD. Participants who had completed at least 2 years of follow-up after administration of TST/I 131 TST during the TD phase and had signed the informed consent to participate in the Long-Term Follow-Up (LTFU) study (BEX104526) were followed for up to 10 years. Participants did not receive any study medication during the LTFU study.</description>

            <description>Participants randomized to receive 450 mg and 35 mg of unlabelled TST IV during the DD and TD phase were allowed to crossover and receive I 131 TST using the same regimen used in the TST and Iodine I 131 TST treatment arm once their disease had progressed as long as they still fulfilled the protocol entry criteria. Participants who had completed at least 2 years of follow-up after administration of TST/I 131 TST during the TD phase and had signed the informed consent to participate in the LTFU study (BEX104526) were followed for up to 10 years.

        <title>Number of Participants With the Indicated Fatal SAEs Related to Study Drug</title>
        <description>An SAE is any event occurring at any dose that results in any of the following: death, a life-threatening adverse drug experience (ADE; at immediate risk of death from the experience as it occurred), inpatient hospitalization/prolongation of existing hospitalization, a persistent/significant disability/incapacity, or a congenital anomaly/birth defect. Medical events that may not result in death, be life-threatening, or require hospitalization may be considered to be a serious ADEs when based upon appropriate medical judgment. Relatedness was based on the investigator's medical judgement.</description>

        <title>Time to Human Anti-Murine Antibodies (HAMA) Positivity From the First Dosimetric Dose</title>
        <description>Tositumomab is a murine (mouse) antibody (immunoglobulin) of the IgG2a subclass. Participants in this study were evaluated to determine whether they developed an immune response to study treatment as evident by human anti-mouse antibodies (HAMA) after administration of tositumomab and iodine I 131 tositumomab. A positive HAMA value indicates that the participant developed human anti-mouse antibodies above the HAMA assay threshold, and a negative HAMA value indicates either the absence or below threshold level of human anti-mouse antibodies.</description>
        <time_frame>Participants were evaluated for up to two years in Study BEX104515 and for up to 11.9 years in Study BEX104526.</time_frame>
        <population>ITT-Exposed Population. Participants who converted from being negative for HAMA at Baseline to being positive for HAMA following treatment were evaluated.</population>

          <title>Time to Human Anti-Murine Antibodies (HAMA) Positivity From the First Dosimetric Dose</title>
          <description>Tositumomab is a murine (mouse) antibody (immunoglobulin) of the IgG2a subclass. Participants in this study were evaluated to determine whether they developed an immune response to study treatment as evident by human anti-mouse antibodies (HAMA) after administration of tositumomab and iodine I 131 tositumomab. A positive HAMA value indicates that the participant developed human anti-mouse antibodies above the HAMA assay threshold, and a negative HAMA value indicates either the absence or below threshold level of human anti-mouse antibodies.</description>
          <population>ITT-Exposed Population. Participants who converted from being negative for HAMA at Baseline to being positive for HAMA following treatment were evaluated.</population>

          <description>Participants received a dosimetric dose (DD) consisting of 450 milligrams (mg) of tositumomab (TST) intravenously (IV) followed by 5.0 millicurie (mCi) of Iodine I 131 and 35 mg of TST IV. The therapeutic dose (TD) consisting of 450 mg of TST IV, followed by a participant-specific dose of I 131 (75 centigray [cGy] or 65 cGy) and 35 mg of TST IV, was administered 7-14 days after the DD. Participants who had completed at least 2 years of follow-up after administration of TST/I 131 TST during the TD phase and had signed the informed consent to participate in the Long-Term Follow-Up (LTFU) study (BEX104526) were followed for up to 10 years.
