          1. Chronic hepatitis C infection, diagnosed by positive anti-HCV antibodies and detected
             HCV RNA at screening in addition to:

               -  positive anti-HCV antibodies or detected HCV RNA at least 6 months before
                  screening; or,

               -  liver biopsy consistent with chronic HCV infection.

          2. HCV genotype 1 infection confirmed by genotypic testing at screening

             response, breakthrough or relapse) with an approved dose of PegIFN alfa/RBV or IFN
             beta/RBV for at least 12 weeks and with an 8-week washout period before screening

          4. HCV RNA = 100,000 IU/mL at screening

             herpes simplex infection; or with oseltamivir or zanamivir for influenza A infection,
             may be screened,

         10. Received silymarin (milk thistle), glycyrrhizin (Stronger Neo-Minophagen C; SNMC), or
             Sho-saiko-to (SST) within 28 days prior to randomization (Visit 2) and throughout the
             treatment phase of this trial,

         11. (For Cohort 2 only) Patients who have been previously treated with at least one dose
             of any antiviral or immunomodulatory drug other than (pegylated) interferon alfa,
             interferon beta or ribavirin for acute or chronic HCV infection including and not

         13. Alpha fetoprotein value &gt;100 ng/mL at screening; if &gt;20 ng/mL and =100 ng/mL, patients
             may be included if there is no evidence of liver cancer in an appropriate imaging
             study (e.g., ultrasound, CT scan, or MRI) within last 6 months prior to randomization
