  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test the safety of study drug LDE225 at different dose
      levels. The investigators will be testing three different dose levels and the dose will
      depend on when the patients enters the study and which dose is being tested at that time. At
      the same time, the investigators will also be testing the safety of LDE225 in combination
      with etoposide and cisplatin.

      The investigators also want to learn more about how to manage side effects the patient may
      develop during chemotherapy. Cancer patients may develop side effects during treatment, such
      as nausea, pain, fatigue, diarrhea, constipation, or shortness of breath. These symptoms may
      be due to the cancer itself, or due to treatments. Doctors and nurses often ask patients
      about their symptoms, because an important part of cancer treatment is to make patients feel
      as well as possible. If patients do not feel well, the investigators may need to change the
      way they are treating the patients or prescribe therapies that will decrease their symptoms.

      The best way to find out how the patient is feeling is to ask them directly. The
      investigators are interested in developing new ways to ask patients about how they are
      feeling, using the Internet. A special new website called STAR (&quot;Symptom Tracking and
      Reporting for Patients&quot;) has been developed to help patients record this information, so that
      their doctors and nurses can review it during clinic appointments. This study is designed to
      help us see if STAR is a helpful way for us to keep track of information about patients'
      symptoms and quality of life. The information from STAR is going to be placed on a very
      secure Internet site. This will provide your doctor with all of the information needed to
      determine if this drug combination is safe enough for you and whether to continue it.

    <description>This is a single institution phase I trial of LDE225 combined with etoposide and cisplatin in patients with untreated, newly diagnosed extensive stage small cell lung cancer (ES-SCLC). LDE225 is an oral drug, which will be taken daily by patients. Patient self-reporting via STAR will be used in an evaluation of the extent to which patient-reported toxicity influences dose finding in phase I clinical trials. Specifically, STAR reports will be presented to clinicians in real-time at clinic visits, &amp; clinicians will have an opportunity to either agree or modify the patient self-assessments &amp; use this information in their grading &amp; attribution of toxicities.</description>

    <description>In a standard, 3 + 3 dose escalation phase, two successive cohorts of ES-SCLC patients will receive LDE225 with etoposide and cisplatin with a dose of 200 mg to be reserved for de-escalation until the MTD is determined. Cohorts of at least 3 evaluable patients will be treated at each dose level of LDE225 (400 mg daily and 800 mg daily). One additional dose (200 mg daily) will be reserved for de-escalation. A minimum of 6 evaluable patients must be treated at the dose declared to be the MTD. Each cohort will consist of newly enrolled patients. An estimated total of 6 to 12 patients may be necessary to establish the MTD. Actual accrual will depend on the dose levels tested and the DLT observed. Upon completion of a minimum of four and a maximum of six cycles of LDE225 with etoposide and cisplatin, patients in each cohort with at least stable disease will receive maintenance LDE225 until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.</description>
