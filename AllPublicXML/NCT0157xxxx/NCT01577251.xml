      The goal of this study is two-fold: to establish a tissue banking respository (defined as
      blood, urine, soft tissue, tumor specimen, and normal tissue from areas surrounding tumor
      specimens), and to prospectively assess health related quality of life (QOL) over time in
      patients with a pathologically confirmed diagnosis of neoplasia receiving radiotherapy or
      photodynamic therapy (PDT)
