  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of telaprevir in combination with
      Peg-IFN-alfa-2a and ribavirin in stable liver transplant patients with chronic hepatitis C
      virus (HCV) genotype 1.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label (all people know the identity of the intervention), multicenter study
      in genotype 1 chronic HCV infected liver transplant patients who will be treated for 12 weeks
      with telaprevir 750 mg every 8 hours given in combination with Peg-IFN-alfa-2a and ribavirin
      followed by 36 weeks of treatment with Peg-IFN-alfa-2a and ribavirin alone. The total
      treatment duration will be 48 weeks. Safety will be evaluated throughout the study and will
      include evaluations of adverse events, clinical laboratory tests, electrocardiogram, vital
      signs, and physical examination.
