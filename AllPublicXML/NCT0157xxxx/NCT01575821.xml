    <textblock>
      Cough is a common symptom in pediatric practice. It can be particularly troubling to children
      and their parents.It often results in discomfort to the child and loss of sleep to both the
      child and the parent. The objective of this trial was to compare the effects on nocturnal
      cough and the sleep difficulty associated with URIs of a single nocturnal dose of three
      different honey products compared to placebo

      Cough is a common symptom in pediatric practice.As a result, children miss daycare or school
      and parents miss a day of work. In an attempt to threat cough, caregivers frequently
      administer OTC medication to their children,with their attendant risks, kack of proven
      efficacy and the disapproval of professional organizations such as the AAP and the FDA. The
      WHO has noted honey as a potential treatment for cough and cold symptoms. Honey has
      antioxidant properties and increases cytokine release. The objective of this trial was to
      compare the effects on nocturnal cough and the sleep difficulty associated with URIs of a
      single nocturnal dose of three different honey products compared to placebo

    <time_frame>changes between two nights ( the night before treatment and the night with treatment)</time_frame>
    <description>Pre intervention study questionnaire:
The parents were asked to complete a five item questionnaire regarding parental subjective assessments of the child's cough and sleep difficulty on the previous night.Survey responses were graded on a seven point scale ranging from extremely (6 points) to not at all (0 points). On the day following the treatment,the parent completed the same questionnaire that had been answered before the intervention, this time regarding the previous evening when the child had received the treatment.</description>
