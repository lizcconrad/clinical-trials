  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      5-aza is a chemotherapy drug with activity in leukemia and myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS).
      Researchers hope that valproic acid (VPA) and all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA)will increase the
      effects of 5-aza. The goal of this clinical research study is to find the highest safe dose
      of valproic acid (VPA) that can be given in combination with 5-azacytidine (5-aza) and
      all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) in the treatment of AML and MDS. The safety and effectiveness
      of this combination therapy will also be studied.

      Participants receive 5-aza as an injection under the skin once a day for 7 days. This will be
      repeated every 3-8 weeks depending on blood counts and how well bone marrow is recovering.
      This is defined as 1 treatment cycle. Also during each cycle, participant will take VPA by
      mouth for 7 days and ATRA by mouth for 5 days. VPA will be given on the same days as 5-aza.
      ATRA will start on Day 3.

      In the Phase I portion of the study, the dose of VPA will be increased in each new group of
      participants until the highest safe dose is found. A minimum of 3 participants and a maximum
      of 10 will be treated at each dose level.

          -  Patients with refractory or relapsed: acute myelogenous leukemia (AML), and
             myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) (bone marrow blasts &gt; or = 10%) are eligible.
