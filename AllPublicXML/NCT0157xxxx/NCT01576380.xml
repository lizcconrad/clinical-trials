    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, open-label, single-arm, non-randomized, multi-center, phase II proof
      of concept (PoC) study with a two-stage design and Bayesian interim monitoring to evaluate
      efficacy and safety of single agent TKI258 in adult patients with scirrhous gastric carcinoma
      (SGC) that have progressed after one or two prior systemic treatments.
