      Background:

        -  Multiple myeloma is a blood cancer that affects the plasma cells. These cells help
           produce antibodies and fight infection. Smoldering multiple myeloma (SMM) is a related
           condition that may develop into multiple myeloma. The current standard of care for SMM
           is close follow-up without treatment until multiple myeloma develops. However,
           researchers are studying possible treatments for SMM itself. One possible treatment
           involves a combination of cancer treatment drugs.

        -  Lenalidomide is a drug that may help reduce or prevent the growth of cancer cells.
           Dexamethasone is a steroid that is often given with other anti-cancer drugs. These two
           drugs are an approved treatment for multiple myeloma that has not responded to at least
           one other treatment. Carfilzomib is an experimental drug that has been effective in
           treating multiple myeloma. Researchers want to combine these three drugs to see if they
           are a safe and effective treatment for SMM.

      Objectives:

      - To see if carfilzomib, lenalidomide, and dexamethasone are a safe and effective treatment
      for smoldering multiple myeloma.

      Eligibility:

      - Individuals at least 18 years of age who have SMM that is likely to progress to multiple
      myeloma.

      Design:

        -  Participants will be screened with a physical exam and medical history. They will also
           have blood and urine tests, and baseline bone marrow scans. Bone marrow samples will
           also be collected.

        -  Participants will have eight 28-day cycles of treatment with the three study drugs. The
           drugs will be given as tablets or as infusions. Treatment will be monitored with
           frequent blood tests and study visits.

        -  After the first four cycles, participants who are eligible for a stem cell transplant
           will have their stem cells collected and stored for future use.

        -  At the end of eight cycles, participants whose disease has not progressed will have up
           to 12 more cycles of treatment with lenalidomide tablets alone.

      BACKGROUND:

        -  SMM is a precursor condition to MM defined by the clinical parameters of M-protein
           greater than or equal to 3.0 g/dL or bone marrow plasma cells greater than or equal to
           10% and absence of end organ disease.

        -  Risk of progression of high risk SMM at 5 years is 72-75% with median time to
           progression &lt;2 years.1-2

        -  The current standard of care for SMM is close follow-up without treatment until
           symptomatic

      MM develops. However, IMWG states Preventive clinical trials need to be considered for
      patients with high risk smoldering myeloma .

      - Carfilzomib is a new proteasome inhibitor with potent anti-MM effects

      OBJECTIVES:

      - To assess the response rate of CRd in patients with high-risk SMM

      ELIGIBILITY:

        -  SMM according to the International Myeloma Working Group definition 3 i.e.:

             -  Serum M-protein greater than or equal to 3 g/dl and/or bone marrow plasma cells
                greater than or equal to 10 % and less than 60%,

             -  Absence of anemia: Hemoglobin &gt;10 g/dl

             -  Absence of renal failure: serum creatinine &lt; 2.0 mg/dL. Absence of hypercalcemia:
                Ca &lt;10.5 mg/dl or 2.65 mmol/L

             -  Absence of lytic bone lesion

             -  Involved/un-involved light chain ration must be less than 100

        -  Measurable disease

        -  High-risk SMM per Mayo Clinic, Spanish PETHEMA, or the Rajkumar, Landgren Mateos
           criteria

        -  Age greater than or equal to 18 years

        -  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status 0-2

        -  Adequate laboratory parameters as defined in the protocol

      DESIGN:

      - Single arm pilot trial of combination therapy (carfilzomib, lenalidomide, and

      dexamethasone) for high risk smoldering multiple myeloma

        -  Patients will receive 8 cycles of induction combination therapy of CRd

        -  Each cycle consists of 28-days

        -  After 4 cycles of therapy, transplant eligible patients may choose to undergo stem cell
           collection

        -  After 8 cycles of CRd, patients will receive lenalidomide extended dosing (phase I) for
           12 cycles. After 12 cycles, patients will have the option to continue extended dosing
           (phase II) for one additional year.

        -  Patients will have routine blood work with SPEP and free light chains monthly during the
           induction phase. Laboratory evaluations may be spread out to every 3 months during the
           maintenance and follow-up phases.

        -  Pre-treatment, post-treatment and follow-up bone marrow biopsies will be obtained for
           confirmation of diagnosis, response and correlative studies

        -  Patients will also undergo evaluation for minimal residual disease at regular interval
           time points, using multi-parametric flow cytometry and FDG PET-CT

        -  This single arm pilot study will plan on initially enrolling 12 evaluable patients to
           detect a VGPR from baseline. A replicate cohort of 16 evaluable patients will then be
           enrolled in order to more precisely define the response rate to the CRd regimen in this
           population.

             Cockcroft-Gault method is &lt;60 mL/min, patient will have a 24 hr urine collection to
             measure CrCl. The measured CrCl must also be greater than or equal to 60 ml/min.

        In addition to having SMM, patients must also be classified as high-risk SMM per Mayo
        Clinic or Spanish PETHEMA criteria

        Criteria set forward by Rajkumar, Landgren, Mateos may also be used to define high risk

        All study participants must be registered into the mandatory RevAssist program, and be
        willing and able to comply with the requirements of RevAssist.

        The effects of carfilzomib and lenalidomide on the developing human fetus are unknown. For
        this reason and because immunomodulatory agents as well as other therapeutic agents used in
        this trial are known to be teratogenic, women of childbearing potential and men must agree
        to use adequate contraception. Females of childbearing potential (FCBP) must have a
        negative serum or urine pregnancy test within 10 - 14 days and again within 24 hours prior
        to prescribing lenalidomide for Cycle 1 (prescriptions must be filled within 7 days) and
        must either commit to continued abstinence from heterosexual intercourse or begin TWO
        acceptable methods of birth control, one highly effective method and one additional
        effective method AT THE SAME TIME, at least 28 days before she starts taking lenalidomide.
        FCBP must also agree to ongoing pregnancy testing. Men must agree to use a latex condom
        during sexual contact with a FCBP even if they have had a successful vasectomy. All
        patients must be counseled at a minimum of every 28 days about pregnancy precautions and
        risks of fetal exposure. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while
        she or her partner is participating in this study, she should inform her treating physician
        immediately.

        Ability of subject to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent
        document.

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:

        Patients who are receiving any other investigational agents.

        Concurrent systemic treatment or prior therapy within 4 weeks for SMM

        - Treatment with corticosteroids for other indications is permitted

        Patients with a diagnosis of MM as defined by the 2014 IMWH diagnostic criteria.

        Contraindication to any concomitant medication, including antivirals, anticoagulation
        prophylaxis, tumor lysis prophylaxis, or hydration given prior to therapy

        History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic
        composition to carfilzomib or lenalidomide agents used in study, such as bortezomib or
        thalidomide.

        Uncontrolled hypertension or diabetes

        Pregnant or lactating females. Pregnant women are excluded from this study because
        Carfilzomib/Lenalidomide are agents with the potential for teratogenic or abortifacient
        effects. Because there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing
        infants secondary to treatment of the mother with Carfilzomib/Lenalidomide, breastfeeding
        should be discontinued if the mother is treated with Carfilzomib/Lenalidomide. These
        potential risks may also apply to other agents used in this study

        Significant cardiovascular disease with NYHA Class II, III or IV symptoms, or hypertrophic
        cardiomegaly, or restrictive cardiomegaly, or myocardial infarction within 3 months prior
        to enrollment, or unstable angina, or unstable arrhythmia

        Active hepatitis B or C infection

        Has refractory GI disease with refractory nausea/vomiting, inflammatory bowel disease, or
        bowel resection that would prevent absorption

        Significant neuropathy &gt;Grade 2 at the time of first dose or within 14 days of enrollment

        Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active
        infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac
        arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations within 2 weeks that would limit
        compliance with study requirements.

        History of other malignancy (apart from basal cell carcinoma of the skin, or in situ cervix
        carcinoma) except if the patient has been free of symptoms and without active therapy
        during at least 5years

        Major surgery within 1 month prior to enrollment
