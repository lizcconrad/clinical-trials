      <recruitment_details>A Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled, Randomized Withdrawal Study to Determine the Efficacy and Safety of ALO-02 Extended-Release Capsules in participants with Moderate to Severe Chronic Low Back Pain</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>A total of 410 participants were enrolled into the Open-Label Conversion and Titration Period and 281 participants were randomized into the Double-Blind Treatment Period, of which, 280 participants received study treatment.</pre_assignment_details>

        <group group_id="P1">
          <title>Open ALO-02</title>
          <description>Participants received AL0-02 extended-release capsules, orally (PO), twice daily (BID), at total daily doses of oxycodone from 20 to 160 milligrams (mg) in the Open-Label Conversion and Titration Period for 4 to 6 weeks; titration was at the discretion of the investigator.</description>

If a participant met protocol-defined treatment response criteria at the end of open-label Week 4, 5, or 6, the participant was randomized into the Double-Blind Treatment Period, underwent a double-blind gradual taper of ALO-02 to discontinue use over the first 2 weeks, and then received double-blind placebo capsules PO BID for 10 weeks.</description>

If a participant met protocol-defined treatment response criteria at the end of open-label Week 4, 5, or 6, the participant was randomized into the Double-Blind Treatment Period, received a dummy-taper but continued to receive double-blind ALO-02 capsules PO BID at a fixed dose (specifically the ALO-02 fixed dose that had not changed with the 7 consecutive days prior to randomization) for 12 weeks.</description>

        <description>BPI-sf is an 11-item self-report questionnaire that is designed to assess the severity and impact of pain on daily functions. BPI-sf includes 4 questions that assess pain intensity (worst, least, average, right now) and 7 questions that assess impact of pain on daily functions (general activity, mood, walking ability, normal work, relations with other people, sleep, enjoyment of life). BPI-sf scores range from 0=No pain to 10=Pain as bad as you can imagine; Higher scores indicate greater pain. Pain Severity Index is the mean of the 4 pain scores (worst, least, average, and right now) on the BPI-sf; range is 0=No pain to 10=Pain as bad as you can imagine; A higher score indicates greater pain severity. Pain Interference Index is the mean of the scores for the 7 items of the BPI-sf; range is 0=Does not interfere to 10=Completely interferes.</description>

        <description>The percentage of analgesic response is defined as: (rolling 7-day mean pain score during Titration Period minus (-) Screening Period pain intensity score) divided by Screening Period pain intensity score times 100. An event was defined as a participant with 20, 30, 40, or 50% analgesic response from Screening. If there was no event for a participant, time to the event was considered censored at Day 42 of the Titration Period or before Day 42 of the Titration Period at the time of the last diary pain score. The survival duration begins on the date of first dose of study drug in the Titration Period and is calculated as the [date of event or last diary pain score - date of first dose in Titration Period +1].</description>

        <title>Median Time to 20%, 30%, 40%, or 50% Analgesic Response From Screening Period to Randomization Baseline</title>
        <description>The percentage of analgesic response is defined as: (rolling 7-day mean pain score during Titration Period - Screening Period pain intensity score) divided by Screening Period pain intensity score times 100. If there was no event for a participant, time to the event was considered censored at Day 42 of the Titration Period or before Day 42 of the Titration Period at the time of the last diary pain score. The survival duration begins on the date of first dose of study drug in the Titration Period and is calculated as the [date of event or last diary pain score - date of first dose in Titration Period +1].</description>

          <title>COWS Total Score During the Double-Blind Treatment Period</title>
          <description>The COWS contains 11 common opiate withdrawal signs or symptoms rated by the investigator or designee who, for each item, checked the number that best described the participant’s signs or symptoms. The minimum total COWS score is 0, the maximum is 48. Higher scores indicate a worse outcome. The summed score of the 11 items was used to assess a participant's level of opiate withdrawal.</description>

The minimum total COWS score is 0, the maximum is 48. The summed score of the 11 items was used to assess a participant's level of opiate withdrawal. The scores are assessed as follows: 5-12 = mild; 13-24 = moderate; 25-36 = moderately severe; more than 36 = severe withdrawal.</description>

        <title>Percentage of Participants With Opiate Withdrawal During Post-Treatment by COWS Category</title>
        <description>The COWS contains 11 common opiate withdrawal signs or symptoms rated by the investigator or designee who, for each item, checked the number that best described the participant’s signs or symptoms. The minimum total COWS score is 0, the maximum is 48. The summed score of the 11 items was used to assess a participant's level of opiate withdrawal. The scores are assessed as follows: 5-12 = mild; 13-24 = moderate; 25-36 = moderately severe; more than 36 = severe withdrawal.</description>

If a participant met protocol-defined treatment response criteria at the end of open-label Week 4, 5, or 6, the participant was randomized into the Double-Blind Treatment Period, underwent a double-blind gradual taper of ALO-02 to discontinue use over the first 2 weeks, and then received double-blind placebo capsules PO BID for 10 weeks.</description>

        <description>The SOWS was completed daily by the participant during any of the 2-week tapers from study drug, as well as at each study visit, using an eDiary device, and contains 16 symptoms of opiate withdrawal rated by the participant (Scale of 0 to 4: 0 = not at all, 1 = a little, 2= moderately, 3= quite a bit, 4 = extremely). The sum of the scores on each item was the total SOWS score; the minimum possible SOWS score was 0, the maximum 64. Higher scores indicate a worse outcome.</description>

        <description>RMDQ is a 24-item questionnaire designed to measure self-rated disability due to back pain the same day the questionnaire is completed. An individual participant’s score could have ranged from 0 (no disability) to 24 (severe disability), with a lower score indicating better function.</description>

        <description>SF-36v2 Health Survey is a self-administered questionnaire consisting of 36 questions, measuring 8 health aspects; physical functioning, role limitations due to physical problems, social functioning, bodily pain, mental health, role limitations due to emotional problems, vitality, and general health perception. These domains also combine to form two component summary scores evaluating mental health and physical health. The minimum score is 0 and the maximum score is 100. A higher score indicate a better health state.</description>

        <description>SF-36v2 Health Survey is a self-administered questionnaire consisting of 36 questions, measuring 8 health aspects; physical functioning, role limitations due to physical problems, social functioning, bodily pain, mental health, role limitations due to emotional problems, vitality, and general health perception. These domains also combine to form two component summary scores evaluating mental health and physical health. The minimum score is 0 and the maximum score is 100. A higher score indicate a better health state.</description>

            <description>Participants received AL0-02 extended-release capsules PO BID at total daily doses of oxycodone from 20 to 160 mg in the Open-Label Conversion and Titration Period for 4 to 6 weeks; titration was at the discretion of the investigator. If a participant met protocol-defined treatment response criteria at the end of open-label Week 4, 5, or 6, the participant was randomized into the Double-Blind Treatment Period, underwent a double-blind gradual taper of ALO-02 to discontinue use over the first 2 weeks, and then received double-blind placebo capsules PO BID for 10 weeks.</description>

        <title>Change From Screening Period to End of Double-Blind Week 12 (or Final Visit) in SF-36v2 Health Survey</title>
        <description>SF-36v2 Health Survey is a self-administered questionnaire consisting of 36 questions, measuring 8 health aspects; physical functioning, role limitations due to physical problems, social functioning, bodily pain, mental health, role limitations due to emotional problems, vitality, and general health perception. These domains also combine to form two component summary scores evaluating mental health and physical health. The minimum score is 0 and the maximum score is 100. A higher score indicate a better health state.</description>

        <description>A self-reported measure of work productivity and impairment that yields 4 scores: Absenteeism (work time missed); Presenteeism (impairment at work/reduced on the job effectiveness); work productivity loss (overall work impairment /absenteeism+presenteeism); and activity impairment.
work time missed - a measure of absenteeism, calculated as work time missed due to health problem (question 2) as a proportion of hours actually worked (question 4).
impairment while working - a measure of presenteeism, the degree to which health problem impacted work (question 5).
overall work impairment - a measure of overall work productivity loss due to health problem (absenteeism+presenteeism).
activity impairment - a measure of the degree to which health problem has affected ability to do regular activities other than work at a job (question 6). Each score is expressed as a percentage (0-100%) with higher numbers indicating greater impairment and less productivity.</description>

        <title>Change From Screening Period to End of Double-Blind Weeks 4, 8, and 12 (or Final Visit) in WPAI:SHP Percent Activity Impairment Due to Low Back Pain</title>
        <description>A self-reported measure of work productivity and impairment that yields 4 scores: Absenteeism (work time missed); Presenteeism (impairment at work/reduced on the job effectiveness); work productivity loss (overall work impairment/absenteeism+presenteeism); and activity impairment.
% activity impairment - a measure of the degree to which health problem has affected ability to do regular activities other than work at a job (question 6). Each score is expressed as a percentage (0-100%) with higher numbers indicating greater impairment and less productivity.</description>
        <time_frame>Screening, Weeks 4, 8, and 12</time_frame>
        <population>ITT Population; imputation by the LOCF method was used for Week 12 (or Final Visit) only; Weeks 4 and 8 were based on observed cases. n=number of participants analyzed for the given parameter at the specified timepoint.</population>

If a participant met protocol-defined treatment response criteria at the end of open-label Week 4, 5, or 6, the participant was randomized into the Double-Blind Treatment Period, underwent a double-blind gradual taper of ALO-02 to discontinue use over the first 2 weeks, and then received double-blind placebo capsules PO BID for 10 weeks.</description>

If a participant met protocol-defined treatment response criteria at the end of open-label Week 4, 5, or 6, the participant was randomized into the Double-Blind Treatment Period, underwent a double-blind gradual taper of ALO-02 to discontinue use over the first 2 weeks, and then received double-blind placebo capsules PO BID for 10 weeks.</description>
