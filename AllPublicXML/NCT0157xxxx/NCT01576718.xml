    <measure>Change From Baseline In Trough (Morning Predose And Pre-Rescue Bronchodilator) Forced Expiratory Volume In 1 Second (FEV1) Over The 12-Week Treatment Period</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Day 1 pre-dose), Weeks 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 10 and 12</time_frame>
    <description>Trough FEV1 was measured electronically by spirometry at morning (AM) investigational site visits, before administration of the AM dose of study drug, and before albuterol/salbutamol administration. The highest FEV1 value from 3 acceptable and 2 reproducible maneuvers was used. All FEV1 data were submitted to a central reading center for evaluation.
The p-values for the treatment comparisons to placebo are from an MMRM model excluding FLOVENT DISKUS data: change from baseline = baseline FEV1 + sex + age + treatment + visit + treatment*visit with an unstructured covariance matrix assumed.</description>

    <measure>The Kaplan-Meier Estimate Of The Probability Of Remaining In The Study At Week 12</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1 to Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>The analysis of probability of remaining in the study at Week 12 used the time to patient withdrawal for worsening asthma. Worsening asthma was defined as:
clinic visit FEV1 below the FEV1 stability limit value calculated on Day 1.
any 7-day run-in or treatment window (using information from the patient diary) during which the subject experienced:
3 or more days in which the highest PEF has fallen below the PEF stability limit calculated on Day 1
3 or more days in which ≥12 inhalations/day of albuterol/salbutamol was used
2 or more days in which the subject experienced a nighttime asthma symptom score of &gt;2
clinical asthma exacerbation, defined as worsening asthma requiring any treatment other than study drug or rescue albuterol/salbutamol including the use of systemic corticosteroids and/or ER visit or hospitalization.
Patients who had withdrawn due to reasons other than worsening asthma were right-censored at the date of last assessment.</description>

    <measure>Patients With Treatment-Emergent Adverse Experiences (TEAE) During the Treatment Period</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1 to Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>An adverse event was defined as any untoward medical occurrence that develops or worsens in severity during the conduct of a clinical study and does not necessarily have a causal relationship to the study drug. Severity was rated by the investigator on a scale of mild, moderate and severe, with severe= an AE which prevents normal daily activities. Relationship of AE to treatment was determined by the investigator. Serious AEs include death, a life-threatening adverse event, inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, persistent or significant disability or incapacity, a congenital anomaly or birth defect, OR an important medical event that jeopardized the patient and required medical intervention to prevent the previously listed serious outcomes.</description>

             800 mcg/day, or Mometasone furoate/formoterol MDI ≥ 800 mcg/day or subjects on a
             qualifying ICS dose plus a long-acting β2-agonists (LABA) administered via separate
             inhalers, may be switched to a qualifying dose of fluticasone propionate provided the
             subjects will not participate in the PK portion of the study.

             Exception 2: Subjects on a qualifying dose of fluticasone propionate who wish to
             participate in the PK portion of the study and who provide consent may have their
             fluticasone propionate switched to a different qualifying ICS (non-fluticasone
             propionate) at a pre-screening visit. The subject will be required to return to the
             clinic to complete the Screening Visit following a 1-week washout period.

          8. Short-Acting β2-Agonists: All subjects must be able to replace their current

             chronic bronchitis, emphysema, bronchiectasis with the need for treatment, cystic
             fibrosis, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease).
             Significant is defined as any disease that, in the opinion of the investigator, would
             put the safety of the subject at risk through participation, or which could affect the
             efficacy or safety analysis if the disease/condition exacerbated during the study.

If subjects failed to demonstrate an increase in FEV1 ≥12% then subjects were not eligible for the study; however, based on investigator judgment, they were allowed to retest once within 7 days. Reversibility values of 11.50 through 11.99% were rounded to 12%. Documented historical reversibility of ≥12 % within 1 year was accepted.</description>

        <description>Peak expiratory flow was determined in the AM and in the PM, before administration of study or rescue medications using a handheld electronic peak flow meter. The highest value of triplicate measurements obtained was recorded by the subject’s diary device.
On mornings for which a treatment visit was scheduled (TV1 through TV9), the PEF was measured and recorded at the investigational site visit.
Baseline trough AM PEF was defined as the average of recorded (non-missing) trough AM PEF assessments over the 7 days directly preceding first study drug intake.
The p-values for the treatment comparisons to placebo are from an MMRM model excluding FLOVENT DISKUS data: change from baseline = baseline PEF + sex + age + treatment + visit + treatment*visit with an unstructured covariance matrix assumed.</description>

          <title>Change From Baseline In Weekly Average Of Daily Trough (Predose And Pre-Rescue Bronchodilator) Morning Peak Expiratory Flow (PEF) Over The 12-Week Treatment Period</title>
          <description>Peak expiratory flow was determined in the AM and in the PM, before administration of study or rescue medications using a handheld electronic peak flow meter. The highest value of triplicate measurements obtained was recorded by the subject’s diary device.
On mornings for which a treatment visit was scheduled (TV1 through TV9), the PEF was measured and recorded at the investigational site visit.
Baseline trough AM PEF was defined as the average of recorded (non-missing) trough AM PEF assessments over the 7 days directly preceding first study drug intake.
The p-values for the treatment comparisons to placebo are from an MMRM model excluding FLOVENT DISKUS data: change from baseline = baseline PEF + sex + age + treatment + visit + treatment*visit with an unstructured covariance matrix assumed.</description>
          <population>Full analysis set, including participants who contributed at least once to the analysis. Based on blinded data review, data from one site are excluded due to good clinical practice (GCP) concerns. Flovent Diskus data was used for confirmatory and exploratory endpoints; morning PEF data for Flovent Diskus is reported in outcome #13.</population>

        <title>The Kaplan-Meier Estimate Of The Probability Of Remaining In The Study At Week 12</title>
        <description>The analysis of probability of remaining in the study at Week 12 used the time to patient withdrawal for worsening asthma. Worsening asthma was defined as:
clinic visit FEV1 below the FEV1 stability limit value calculated on Day 1.
any 7-day run-in or treatment window (using information from the patient diary) during which the subject experienced:
3 or more days in which the highest PEF has fallen below the PEF stability limit calculated on Day 1
3 or more days in which ≥12 inhalations/day of albuterol/salbutamol was used
2 or more days in which the subject experienced a nighttime asthma symptom score of &gt;2
clinical asthma exacerbation, defined as worsening asthma requiring any treatment other than study drug or rescue albuterol/salbutamol including the use of systemic corticosteroids and/or ER visit or hospitalization.
Patients who had withdrawn due to reasons other than worsening asthma were right-censored at the date of last assessment.</description>

        <description>An adverse event was defined as any untoward medical occurrence that develops or worsens in severity during the conduct of a clinical study and does not necessarily have a causal relationship to the study drug. Severity was rated by the investigator on a scale of mild, moderate and severe, with severe= an AE which prevents normal daily activities. Relationship of AE to treatment was determined by the investigator. Serious AEs include death, a life-threatening adverse event, inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, persistent or significant disability or incapacity, a congenital anomaly or birth defect, OR an important medical event that jeopardized the patient and required medical intervention to prevent the previously listed serious outcomes.</description>

        <title>24-Hour Urinary Cortisol Excretion at Baseline, Week 12 and Endpoint</title>
        <description>24-hour urinary cortisol excretion was determined from 24-hour pooled-urine samples; urine was refrigerated until return to the investigational site after each 24-hour collection period. Urine was collected within 7 days of Day 1 and within 7 days of Week 12. Urine cortisol sample collection was not required at endpoint visit for subjects who terminated early from the study.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline In Trough (Morning Predose And Pre-Rescue Bronchodilator) Forced Expiratory Volume In 1 Second (FEV1) Over The 12-Week Treatment Period (Including the Flovent Diskus Treatment Arm)</title>
        <description>Peak expiratory flow was determined in the AM and in the PM, before administration of study or rescue medications using a handheld electronic peak flow meter. The highest value of triplicate measurements obtained was recorded by the subject’s diary device.
On mornings for which a treatment visit was scheduled (TV1 through TV9), the PEF was measured and recorded at the investigational site visit.
Baseline trough AM PEF was defined as the average of recorded (nonmissing) trough AM PEF assessments over the 7 days directly preceding first study drug intake.
The p-values for the treatment comparisons to Flovent Diskus are from an MMRM model which includes data from all treatments: change from baseline = baseline PEF + sex + age + treatment + visit + treatment*visit with an unstructured covariance matrix assumed.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline In Weekly Average Of Daily Trough (Predose And Pre-Rescue Bronchodilator) Morning Peak Expiratory Flow (PEF) Over The 12-Week Treatment Period (Including the Flovent Diskus Treatment Arm)</title>
        <description>Peak expiratory flow was determined in the AM and in the PM, before administration of study or rescue medications using a handheld electronic peak flow meter. The highest value of triplicate measurements obtained was recorded by the subject’s diary device.
On mornings for which a treatment visit was scheduled (TV1 through TV9), the PEF was measured and recorded at the investigational site visit.
Baseline trough AM PEF was defined as the average of recorded (nonmissing) trough AM PEF assessments over the 7 days directly preceding first study drug intake.
The p-values for the treatment comparisons to Flovent Diskus are from an MMRM model that included data for all treatments: change from baseline = baseline PEF + sex + age + treatment + visit + treatment*visit with an unstructured covariance matrix assumed.</description>
