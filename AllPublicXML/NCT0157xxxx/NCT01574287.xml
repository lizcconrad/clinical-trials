  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hyperparathyroidism (excessive production of parathyroid hormone (PTH) usually caused by a
      small growth called an adenoma in the parathyroid glands) is an increasingly significant
      medical and public health condition.

      Surgery is the only effective management for primary hyperparathyroidism. However; it is
      sometimes difficult to pinpoint the adenoma, in part because current methods of imaging often
      fail to identify the parathyroid adenoma in as many as 30% of patients. In reoperative
      parathyroidectomy for persistent or recurrent hyperparathyroidism, localization plays an even
      greater role. Unfortunately current multiple imaging methods fail to localize 10-15% these of
      tumors.

      SPECT/CT with the radiotracer 99mTc sestamibi has become the standard method for pinpointing
      the tumor. This, however, is a challenge because the parathyroid glands usually are located
      close to the thyroid and the radiotracer 99mTc sestamibi concentrates both in thyroid and
      parathyroid tissue. Hence there is a need for a tracer/imaging tool that concentrates in the
      parathyroid but not in the thyroid.

      A more sensitive and specific radiotracer/tracking agent would markedly improve the
      investigators ability to identify parathyroid tumors preoperatively, and thus offer more
      patients a minimally invasive parathyroidectomy.

      anti-3-[18F]FACBC is an amino acid based PET radiotracer which has shown utility in detecting
      a variety of tumors. In cell culture experiments, anti-3-[18F]FACBC has shown uptake in
      parathyroid cells greater than thyroid cells. Therefore, the investigators think that this
      radiotracer may be able to help us identify parathyroid adenomas better than 99mTc sestamibi.

      The primary aim of this study is to determine if anti-3-[18F]FACBC PET-CT demonstrates uptake
      within parathyroid adenomas. 12 patients with a diagnosis of primary hyperparathyroidism will
      undergo PET-CT using anti-3-[18F]FACBC in addition to the standard 99mTc sestamibi scanning
      and other imaging as clinically appropriate such as ultrasound, MRI, and/or contrast enhanced
      CT scanning. Since all these patients undergo surgery routinely, the investigators will then
      compare findings at surgery to those of the anti-3-[18F]FACBC PET-CT to determine if this
      radiotracer is worthy of further study in a more comprehensive experiment.
