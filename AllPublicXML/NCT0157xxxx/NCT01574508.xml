  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The current study will compare the different efficacy of two transient intensive insulin
      treatment strategies: Continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII) and multiple daily
      insulin injections (MDI) in patients who are not well controlled with oral hypoglycaemic
      agents.
