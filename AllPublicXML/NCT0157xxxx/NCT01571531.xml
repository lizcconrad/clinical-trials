  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Today there is accumulating evidence from animal experiments that regeneration can be induced
      after a spinal cord injury (SCI). Consequently in the near future, new therapeutic approaches
      to induce some regeneration will be included in the treatment of patients with SCI. The aim
      of this proposal is to provide the required clinical basis for the implementation of novel
      interventional therapies. The establishment of combined clinical, functional and
      neurophysiological measures for a qualitative and quantitative assessment of spinal cord
      function in patients with SCI at different stages during rehabilitation represents a basic
      requirement to monitor any significant effect of a new treatment. Therefore, several European
      Paraplegic Centres involved in the rehabilitation of acute traumatic SCI patients build up a
      close collaboration for standardised assessment. The aim is to get knowledge about the
      natural recovery after spinal cord lesion in a larger population of patients in the sense of
      a historical control group and to bring new standardised assessment tools to the clinical
      setting.
