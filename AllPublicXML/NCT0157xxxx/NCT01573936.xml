      The purposes of this study were to evaluate the influence of an interdisciplinary
      rehabilitation program in the improvement of the health-related quality of life among adult
      neurological patients and to identify the sociodemographic and clinical associated
      characteristics. Subjects with spinal cord injury, acquired brain injury and poliomyelitis
      survivors participated in the study. All participants underwent a rehabilitation program (RP)
      from January 2008 through July 2010, which consists of 40-minutes of many therapies for 1-2
      days a week. The WHOQOL-BREF was applied at the initial and discharge assessments.

    <description>The brief version of the World Health Organization Quality of Life (WHOQOL-BREF) is a sound, cross-culturally valid assessment of health-related quality of life in adults populations. Its assessment shows good to excellent internal consistency, test-retest reliability, discriminant validity, content validity, and construct validity in the healthy population and in different patient groups.</description>
