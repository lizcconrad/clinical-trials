  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators are doing this study to find out if they can use electroencephalographic
      (EEG) recordings, which measure brain waves, to predict response to antidepressant
      treatments, as well as to distinguish patients who have depression from those who do not. In
      particular the investigators want to test the usefulness of a new type of analysis of EEG
      recordings called brain network activation or BNA. BNA allows to identify patterns of
      activation in brain networks and to track their changes over time.

    <description>The investogators will make a comparison of Functional networks of brain activity (BNA™) in subjects with MDD and healthy individuals measured using analysis of EEG Event Related Potential (ERP) data [ Time Frame: Baseline, 1 week after the first dose of antidepressant treatment, end of the treatment phase].</description>

    <description>The investigators will examine the agreement between clinical diagnoses and the change of Brain Network Activation (BNA™)Scores in MDD subjects and healthy controls.
Subjects will undergo clinical diagnostic interviews and a comprehensive neuropsychological and cognitive assessment, and then complete 1 EEG scan of approximately 1 hour. The results of the BNA will be compared to the results of the clinical diagnostic interviews and tests.</description>
