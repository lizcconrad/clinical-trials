    <textblock>
      HepQuant tests are new liver tests that are being developed to accurately measure liver
      function with sensitivity and specificity while being safe and non-invasive. The primary goal
      of this study is to define the intra-individual reproducibility of the HepQuant tests, that
      is, to see if a person is given the tests several times that the test results are essentially
      the same each time. Subjects for this study will include healthy controls and patients with
      chronic liver diseases. The chronic liver diseases will include hepatitis C virus (HCV)
      infection and a serious form of fatty liver disease, known as non-alcoholic steatohepatitis
      (NASH). The HCV and NASH patients will include men and women, and those with early stage and
      late stage liver disease as defined by the amount of fibrosis observed in their liver
      biopsies. Once a subject has been enrolled in the study they will be given the HepQuant tests
      on three separate days within the span of one month. The hypothesis of this study is that
      HepQuant tests will reproducibly report liver function in healthy controls and patients with
      all stages of chronic HCV and NASH liver disease and that liver function will decrease as the
      amount of liver fibrosis increases in the chronic liver disease patients.

    <measure>Cholate Shunt Test</measure>
    <time_frame>9 months</time_frame>
    <description>The Cholate Shunt Test result is defined as the ratio of the IV Cholate Clearance Test result to the Oral Cholate Clearance Test result and is expressed as a percentage. The IV Cholate Clearance Test result = (dose cholate-24-13C/AUC cholate-24-13C)/subject weight and is expressed as mL/min/kg. The Oral Cholate Clearance Test result = (dose cholate-2,2,4,4-d4/AUC cholate-2,2,4,4-d4)/subject weight and is expressed as mL/min/kg. The AUC cholate-24-13C and AUC cholate-2,2,4,4-d4 are calculated from LCMS analysis of serum samples collected at 0, 5, 20, 45, 60, 90 minutes post-dose.</description>

    <measure>Intra-individual Reproducibility of the Cholate Tests</measure>
    <time_frame>9 months</time_frame>
    <description>The intra-individual reproducibility of each cholate test, the IV Cholate Clearance Test, the Oral Cholate Clearance Test, and the Cholate Shunt Test, will be defined by its average Coefficient of Variation (CV) and its Intra-Class Correlation (ICC). Each subject will be tested at baseline and then twice more on separate days within the span of one month. The CV of each subject's three replicate tests will be used to calculate the average CV for each type of test. All test results for each type of test will be used to calculate its ICC.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Correlation of Cholate Tests with Histological Fibrosis Stage</measure>
    <time_frame>9 months</time_frame>
    <description>The correlation of each of the cholate test results with the histological fibrosis stage in chronic HCV patients will be determined by Pearson correlations and expressed by p values and r2 values. The correlation of the cholate test results with the histological fibrosis stage in NASH patients will be determined in the same manner.</description>

    <description>The FDA has indicated that liver function diagnostic testing with stable isotope labeled cholates would be considered a drug/device combination product. The drugs administered at each test visit will be:
20 mg Cholate-24-13C, IV (in the vein), dissolved in NaHCO3 and mixed with albumin.
40 mg Cholate-2,2,4,4-d4, oral, dissolved in NaHCO3 and mixed with juice.
The 3 test visits will be on separate days within a span of 30 days</description>
