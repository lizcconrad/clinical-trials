  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The hypothesis proposed in this study is that the 2011-2012 Seasonal Influenza Vaccine
      (including H3N2 and H1N1 subtypes of serotype A strain over the serotype B) administered to
      15ug (without adjuvant) via intramuscular in pregnant women will be safe and immunogenic.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Despite the fact that influenza vaccination of pregnant women is amply recommended, coverage
      of influenza vaccination is low. In general, there are few studies on safety of the vaccine
      to this group, particularly during the first three months of pregnancy or evaluating
      trivalent vaccines containing inactivated pandemic 2009 H1N1 virus. Studies are controversial
      regarding passage of maternal antibodies and protection to the newborn. The investigators
      propose to evaluate safety and immunogenicity of 2011-2012 seasonal trivalent influenza
      vaccine (Northern hemisphere)(containing an A/California/7/2009 (H1N1)-like virus; an
      A/Perth/16/2009 (H3N2)-like virus; a B/Brisbane/60/2008-like virus) produced by Sanofi
      Pasteur. Study design is a Phase II/III, two arm, non-randomized clinical trial. The
      investigators will recruit 120 pregnant women, 18 to 39 years of age, 14 to 34 week pregnant
      and 120 non-pregnant women. Trivalent influenza vaccine (0.5ml) will be administered IM in
      the deltoid zone. Participants will be observed for 30 min post-vaccination for acute adverse
      reactions and periodically during the 60 days post-vaccination for reactogenicity, adverse
      effects and severe adverse effects. Baseline and 28 day influenza antibodies will be measured
      by hemagglutination and microneutralization. Umbilical cord blood (10ml) will be drawn during
      delivery. Newborns will be followed monthly for growth and morbidity up to six months of age.
      If necessary, they will be referred for appropriate clinical care. Main outcome will be
      seroconversion and seroresponse at 28 days post vaccination. Results will be adjusted by
      study group and other relevant covariables.Safety will be analyzed according to type,
      severity and study group.

    <description>The results of this analysis will determine whether the vaccine provides protection based on the immunogenicity provided by the vaccine. They identify specific antibodies against influenza virus A (H1N1), will carry out the serological techniques by hemagglutination inhibition and microneutralization. The immunogenicity analysis will be measured by seroconversion and seroresponse</description>

    <description>Monitoring of pregnant women will be at monthly intervals until the time of the birth.
Pregnant women and nonpregnant are going to be monitored for 30 min after vaccination to monitor immediate clinical reactions, and at 28 days after completing a self-registration of possible events associated with vaccination, as well as follow-up home visits on days 1, 3, 5, 7, 11, 15, 21, and 28.
At day 28, will be made a complete clinical evaluation and blood sampling for assessment of immunogenicity.</description>

It is recommended that vaccines for use in the 2012-2013 influenza season (northern hemisphere winter) contain the following:
an A/California/7/2009 (H1N1)pdm09-like virus;
an A/Victoria/361/2011 (H3N2)-like virus;
a B/Wisconsin/1/2010-like virus.</description>
