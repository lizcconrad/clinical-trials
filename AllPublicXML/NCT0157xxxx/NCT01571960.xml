      This study will test the safety and immune responses of a prime-boost regimen of two HIV
      vaccines— a DNA vaccine followed by a modified vaccinia Ankara (MVA) vaccine— in healthy,
      HIV-uninfected, vaccinia-naive adults.

    <textblock>
      Although multiple candidate HIV vaccines are being studied, there is not yet an effective
      preventive HIV vaccine. This study will test the safety and immune responses of prime-boost
      regimens of two HIV vaccines: two injections of GEO-D03 DNA priming vaccine followed by
      either two or three boosting injections of MVA/HIV62B (MVA62B) vaccine.

      This study will enroll 48 healthy, HIV-1-uninfected, vaccinia-naive adults into 1 of 3
      groups. Participants within each group will be randomly assigned to receive either the study
      vaccine regimen (40 total participants) or placebo vaccine regimen (8 total participants).

      The total study duration will be approximately 45 months. Participants in Group 1 will attend
      clinic visits for 14 months followed by annual health contacts, for a total of 3 years after
      initial study injection. Participants in Group 2 will attend clinic visits for 22 months
      followed by annual health contacts, for a total of 3 years after initial study injection.
      Participants in Group 3 will attend clinic visits for 20 months followed by annual health
      contacts, for a total of 3 years after initial study injection. Participants in Group 1 will
      have 17 study visits, participants in Group 2 will have 23 visits, and participants in Group
      3 will have 21 visits.

      At the screening visit, participants will give a medical history and undergo a complete
      physical exam, electrocardiogram (ECG), urine collection, blood collection, interview, HIV
      test, and pregnancy test (for participants who were born female). Participants will receive
      an intramuscular (IM) vaccination (study vaccine or placebo) into the deltoid on the schedule
      assigned to their group. The vaccination schedule is as follows: Group 1 participants will
      receive an injection on Days 0, 56, 112, 168, and 224; Group 2 participants will receive an
      injection on Days 0, 56, 112, 168, and 303; Group 3 participants will receive an injection on
      Days 0, 56, 112, and 224. On vaccination visits, participants will also undergo an
      abbreviated physical exam, a pregnancy test (for participants who were born female),
      risk-reduction counseling, and blood collection. Immediately following vaccination,
      participants will remain in the clinic for observation for 30 minutes; participants will be
      given a post-vaccination symptom log and instructed on how to complete it. Follow-up visits
      will consist of a brief physical exam, blood collection, and interview; some follow-up visits
      may also consist of a urine collection, HIV test, or ECG.

      The last clinic visit will be at Day 425 for participants in Group 1, Day 667 for
      participants in Group 2, and Day 607 for participants in Group 3; after this visit,
      participants will be contacted for annual health follow-up consisting of confirming vital
      status, collecting safety information, and reporting a new HIV diagnosis or a pregnancy. A
      clinic visit will only be required if HIV confirmatory testing is necessary.

             experimental vaccine trial, the HVTN 094 PSRT will determine eligibility on a
             case-by-case basis. For potential participants who have received an experimental
             vaccine(s) greater than 5 years ago, eligibility for enrollment will be determined by

                  screening or previously, exclude for blood pressure that is not well controlled.
                  Well-controlled blood pressure is defined as consistently less than or equal to
                  140 mm mercury (Hg) systolic and less than or equal to 90 mm Hg diastolic, with
                  or without medication, with only isolated, brief instances of higher readings
                  that must be less than or equal to 150 mm Hg systolic and less than or equal to
                  100 mm Hg diastolic. For these participants, blood pressure must be less than or
                  equal to 140 mm Hg systolic and less than or equal to 90 mm Hg diastolic at
                  enrollment.

               -  If a person has NOT been found to have elevated blood pressure or hypertension
                  during screening or previously, exclude for systolic blood pressure greater than
                  or equal to 150 mm Hg at enrollment or diastolic blood pressure greater than or
                  equal to 100 mm Hg at enrollment

          -  Body mass index (BMI) greater than or equal to 40 or BMI greater than or equal to 35
             with two or more of the following: age greater than 45, systolic blood pressure
             greater than 140 mm Hg, diastolic blood pressure greater than 90 mm Hg, current
             smoker, or known hyperlipidemia

          -  Bleeding disorder diagnosed by a doctor (e.g., factor deficiency, coagulopathy, or
             platelet disorder requiring special precautions)

          -  Malignancy (not excluded: a participant with a surgical excision and subsequent
             observation period that in the investigator's estimation has a reasonable assurance of
             sustained cure or is unlikely to recur during the period of the study)

          -  Seizure disorder (not excluded: a participant with a history of seizures who has not
             required medications or had a seizure within the past 3 years)

          -  Asplenia: any condition resulting in the absence of a functional spleen

          -  Psychiatric condition that precludes compliance with the protocol. Specifically
             excluded are participants with psychoses within the past 3 years, ongoing risk of
             suicide, or history of suicide attempt or gesture within the past 3 years.
