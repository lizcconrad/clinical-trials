      This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase III study involving 160 patients
      designed to assess the efficacy of the high potency probiotic preparation VSL#3® versus
      placebo in increasing the pathological major response rate in patients undergoing concurrent
      CT and pelvic RT.
