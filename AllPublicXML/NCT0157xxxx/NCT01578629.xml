  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A natural form of vitamin E called tocotrienol (TCT), found in many common foods such as
      barley, decreases stroke size in animal models. Vitamin E has blood-thinning properties and
      lowers cholesterol, which make it a potential therapy for stroke prevention, though these
      effects are less well characterized for TCT. We plan to conduct two trials (I &amp; IIA) to
      determine the effects of orally supplemented TCT on platelet function and cholesterol.

      A natural form of vitamin E called tocotrienol (TCT), found in many common foods such as
      barley, decreases stroke size in animal models. Vitamin E has blood-thinning properties and
      lowers cholesterol, which make it a potential therapy for stroke prevention, though these
      effects are less well characterized for TCT. We plan to conduct two trials (I &amp; IIA) to
      determine the effects of orally supplemented TCT on platelet function and cholesterol. Phase
      I subjects will be healthy volunteers, recruited by an advertisement. Phase IIA subjects will
      be hyperlipidemic (having high cholesterol), and will be referred to us by their Wound Care
      Center Physicians. Patients will be randomized to receive placebo pills, (400 or 800 mg) TCT
      pills, low-dose 81 mg aspirin (commonly used for secondary prevention of stroke), or TCT and
      aspirin together. Potential subjects for Phase-I who meet study criteria and agree to
      participate will be in the study for 6 months and have the following study related
      procedures, blood draw total 4 times, tape stripping (non-invasive procedure), BMI, and blood
      pressure measurement at each visit (every month). Participants in Phase-IIA will have blood
      drawn a total of 6 times, tape stripping, BMI and blood pressure measurement and participants
      will be in the study for 13 months.
