  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Unintentional hypothermia of a patient is a common adverse effect during surgical procedures.
      The aim of this prospective, randomised, controlled study is to determine whether the use of
      thermal suit could prevent surgical patient from experiencing thermal loss than conventional
      measures.

      Hypothesis: The investigators assume that a difference of 0.5Â°C in body temperature between
      the groups is clinically relevant.

      The aim of this study was to compare a thermal suit (T-Balance) and conventional warming
      methods to maintain a constant body temperature in patients undergoing robotic laparoscopic
      radical prostatectomy under general anesthesia.

      A sample size calculation was made using a power analysis. Patients were randomly allocated
      into two groups.

      Patients in the intervention group were put on the T-Balance 1 hour before anesthesia
      induction. Patients in the control group got conventional cotton clothes. Intra-operatively
      same warming methods were used in both groups. The measuring points of the temperature were
      esophagus (core temperature), left axilla, dorsal surface of the left middle finger and back
      of the left foot.

      Anesthesia was induced via target-controlled infusion. All temperature data of the patients
      were collected and recorded electrically and continuously.
