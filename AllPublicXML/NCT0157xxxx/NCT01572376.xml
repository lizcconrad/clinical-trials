    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to determine the safety and feasibility of an autologous mononuclear
      stem cells infusion in pressure ulcers of paraplegic patients; and moreover, to evaluate the
      efficacy of the treatment.

    <textblock>
      Taking into account the encouraging results obtained in the treatment of non-healing chronic
      wounds using bone marrow cells Given that treatment strategies for pressure ulcers can be
      both costly and complex, in this study we examine the possibility of improving pressure ulcer
      healing using stem cell therapy.

    <description>The proposed trial will involve the recruitment of a total of 30 patients. The cells will be collected via bone marrow sampling. The aspirate will centrifuged on a Ficoll density gradient to isolate mononuclear cells, wich will be resuspended in heparinized isotonic saline for infusion into the area of the wound. Assessment of adverse events will be by wound examination and laboratory (microbiological)parameters</description>
