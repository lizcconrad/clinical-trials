  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is focused on the effects of HEPA filtration to reduce exposures to
      combustion-derived air pollution (CDAP). Specifically, the study will evaluate the health
      benefits of HEPA filters and compare the cardiovascular toxicity of two major sources of
      CDAP, specifically traffic and residential wood combustion.

      Specifically, the purpose of this study is to evaluate the ability of portable high
      efficiency particle air (HEPA) filters to reduce exposures to PM2.5 and air pollution indoors
      and to improve subclinical indicators of microvascular function and systemic inflammation
      among healthy adult participants.

      The investigators hypothesize that HEPA filter use will help decrease indoor concentrations
      of CDAP thereby helping to mitigate the associated cardiovascular risks.

      To address knowledge gaps about health risks of specific pollution sources and to provide new
      evidence on the health benefits of air pollution interventions, the objectives of this study
      are: 1) quantify the relationship between low-level exposures to combustion-derived PM air
      pollution and subclinical indicators of cardiovascular disease risk; and 2) compare the
      relative impact of HEPA filtration for two major PM sources (traffic and residential wood
      combustion) on these indicators.

      The use of HEPA filters may help to mitigate cardiovascular risks factors caused by
      combustion-derived air pollution (CDAP), (specifically woodstove and traffic emissions). We
      hypothesize that HEPA filter use and improved woodstove technology will help decrease indoor
      occurrences of CDAP. This project will help address knowledge gaps in CDAP-related health
      risks and benefits of interventions. Specific objectives include establishing a relationship
      between exposure to CDAP and biomarkers of cardiovascular risk and evaluating the impact of
      HEPA filter use towards improved indoor air quality and health indicators.
