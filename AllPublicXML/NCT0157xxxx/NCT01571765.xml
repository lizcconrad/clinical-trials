  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators will assess whether in Bushenyi District in southwestern Uganda, a two year
      intervention providing comprehensive MNCH programming will:

        -  Reduce morbidity and mortality for children under five years old and;

        -  Improve access to maternal health services Compared to a control community without MNCH
           intervention?

      Hypothesis:

      Comprehensive maternal, newborn and child health programming in Bushenyi Distrcit can have a
      positive impact on morbidity and mortality for children under five years and will improve
      access for women to maternal health services which may lead, in the longer term, to decreased
      maternal mortality.

      A detailed impact assessment will be carried out for the duration of the MNCH training and
      support initiative in Bushenyi District, using mixed methods. The study will assess 8 of the
      11 key core MNCH indicators as identified by CIDA as a priority. Other information to be
      collected such as demographics and patterns of health care use, and prevalence of disease
      will help health planners in the districts, and will be helpful in sub analysis and
      interpretation of findings. The main study will use household surveys in both districts at
      baseline, midline and endline. Other tools will include pre and post qualitative surveys
      (FGDs, KII) and analysis of operational data.

      The main study group will be representative communities and health centres within Bushenyi
      District who will receive intervention between 2012 and 2014; Rubirizi District will serve as
      a control area for this study but will received selected MNCH services starting in 2013 after
      midline data are collected.
