      The aim of the study was to evaluate if acupuncture may reduce intraoperative ULTIVA
      (remifentanil) consumption and post operative pain measured with VAS, italian version Mc Gill
      Questionnaire Pain and drug consumption (acetaminophen daily consumption). The study involve
      patients who underwent thyroid surgery randomised in two groups. A group patients treated
      with drugs and B group patients treated with drugs and acupuncture.Acupuncture related risk
      are pain, faint and haematoma.The study will be done in Padova University Hospital (Endocrine
      Unit.Primary end point will be VAS pain and secondary end points ULTIVA consumption, post
      operative pain measured with italian version of Mc Gill Questionnaire Pain and acetaminophen
      daily intake
