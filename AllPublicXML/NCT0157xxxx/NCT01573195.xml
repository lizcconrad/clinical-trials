      The purpose of this study is to pilot the use of best practices to enhance an antimicrobial
      stewardship program using the electronic medical record, EPIC. Screening information
      technology tools via SETNET/Safety SUrveyor(Premier) and the electronic anti-infective order
      form would allow for sufficient medical record review to create best practices alerts for the
      purpose of appropriate de-escalation of anti-invectives.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of best practice alerts(BPA) that were completely accepted, partially accepted, or rejected within 72 hours of issuing the BPA</measure>
    <time_frame>One Year</time_frame>
    <description>after issuing the BPA for deescalation, the responding healthcare provider will respond in one of the manners above</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>The number and type of antiinfectives that were administered before and after(11days) the best practice alert is issued.</measure>
    <time_frame>One year</time_frame>
    <description>The antiinfective use before and after the BPA will be analyzed in detail. The number of antibiotics, percentage decrease(or less likely increase) in antiinfectives in the 3 days before BPA , and 11 days after the BPA will be analyzed. A cost analysis will be performed. Patient outcomes will not be assessed.</description>
