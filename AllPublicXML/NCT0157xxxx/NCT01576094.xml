  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Congenital heart defects are the most prevalent group of congenital malformations in
      newborns. Surgery-related low cardiac output syndrome (LCOS) could be one of the reason for
      the unfavourable outcome of this population. The early use of inodilators (INDs),
      specifically milrinone (MR), is proposed to reduce afterload and increase inotropism. Studies
      in the paediatric population appear to support a clinical usefulness of MR similar to that
      observed in adults. Levosimendan (LEVO) is a novel class IND developed for the treatment of
      heart failure. Experience with LEVO in paediatric patients is scarce. The purpose of this
      study was to systematically test the efficacy and safety of milrinone (MR) and levosimendan
      (LEVO) in newborns undergoing cardiovascular surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB). Given
      the uncertainty about LEVO pharmacokinetics in neonates, the study was designed as a pilot,
      phase I feasibility study.

    <textblock>
      Surgical repair is the primary therapy for congenital heart defects in the newborn. The
      neonatal cardiovascular system is at particular risk to develop the surgery-related low
      cardiac output syndrome (LCOS), thus vasoactive agents are routinely used in the
      postoperative management. Systematic research on the efficacy of these drugs is scarce in the
      newborn. As LCOS pathophysiology joints impaired myocardial contractility and the peripheral
      effects of ischemia/reperfusion injury on the endothelium, early use of inodilators (IND) are
      strongly recommended to reduce afterload and improve contractility. This study aims to test
      the equivalence in dose-dependent hemodynamic effects of 2 IND, Milrinone and Levosimendan,
      used early without loading dose in the preoperative period to prevent LCOS. By means of
      non-invasive technology the investigators will assess cardiac function (serial structural and
      functional echocardiography), the cerebral and peripheral perfusion and oxygenation
      (continuous near-infrared monitoring), cerebral function (continuous amplitude integrated EEG
      monitoring), will rule out CNS acquired lesions (serial transfontanelar echo-Doppler
      studies), and will follow up different biochemical markers of myocardial stress and
      apoptosis. Pharmacokinetic studies will be also performed.
