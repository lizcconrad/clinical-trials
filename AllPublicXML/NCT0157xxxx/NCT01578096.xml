  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary aims of this study are to:

        1. Tailor a diabetes stress management intervention for delivery by community health
           workers (CHWs) serving an urban Latino population.

        2. Investigate the efficacy of the stress management intervention on glycemic control.

           Secondary aims of this study are to:

        3. Investigate the efficacy of the stress management intervention on stress hormones,
           psychosocial functioning, and stress-glucose reactivity.

      Study hypothesis:

      A CHW-led group-based diabetes education model enhanced with stress management education will
      improve glycemic control more than CHW-led group-based diabetes education alone.
