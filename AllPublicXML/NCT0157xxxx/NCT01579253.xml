  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with recurrent glioblastoma who are planned to receive a second course of radiation
      are to be included into this monocentric cohort trial. Due to multiple pre-treatments
      simultaneous combined positron emission tomography (PET) with
      O-(2-[18F]fluoroethyl)-l-tyrosine (FET) as well as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is used
      for treatment planning and follow-up imaging as it allows for a better distinction between
      treatment-related changes and viable tumor tissue.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      For glioblastoma (GBM) patients it has been proven that a [18F]FET-PET scan is very helpful
      especially in target volume definition and after the treatment, in turn, the combination of
      MRI and [18F]FET-PET is diagnostically most useful to distinguish between radiation necrosis
      and a real progressive disease.

      The response to therapy is based on the newly formulated Revised Assessment in Neuro-Oncology
      (RANO) criteria. Kinetic and static [18F]FET-PET scans are useful to supplement this modality
      and its own prognostic value concerning relapsing patients will be examined.

      The special feature of this study is the use of both modalities in parallel, allowing
      simultaneous acquisition of morphological changes, functional and molecular imaging.

      Secondary methodological issues are dealt with, such as the relationship between contrast
      uptake, perfusion and [18F]FET uptake. In this regard, the hybrid imaging may serve for
      hypothesis generation, as in parallel in a unique way of contrast enhancement and tracer
      kinetics can be investigated (simultaneous contrast-enhanced analysis and tracer
      application).

      In particular, FET kinetics are examined in more detail (for example, differences between
      increasing and decreasing kinetics) to find ways of how to use certain MRI sequences for
      better visualization of viable tumor tissue and vice versa .
