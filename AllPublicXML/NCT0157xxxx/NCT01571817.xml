    <textblock>
      The overall objective of this pilot project is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the
      gastric submucosal space as a novel site for clinical islet transplantation. The site has
      several physiologic attributes that may improve the outcomes of islet transplantation
      compared with the conventional intraportal transplant site.

          3. One or more of the following signs or symptoms despite intensive efforts made in close
             cooperation with their diabetic care team:

               -  Metabolic lability/instability characterized by hypoglycemia or ketoacidosis (&gt;2
                  hospital admissions in the previous year), erratic glucose profiles (MAGE&gt;120

               -  Reduced awareness of hypoglycemia or &gt;1 episode in the last 1.5 years of severe
                  hypoglycemia

               -  Persistently poor glucose control (as defined by HgbA1c&gt;10% at the end of six
                  months of Intensive management efforts with the diabetes care team)

               -  Progressive secondary complications as defined by (i) a new proliferative
                  retinopathy or clinically significant macular edema or therapy with
                  photocoagulation during the last year; or (ii) symptomatic autonomic neuropathy
                  (as defined by postural hypotension or neuropathic bladder)

          4. Age 18 and older

          5. Patients who have a renal transplant must have received their transplant at least 3
