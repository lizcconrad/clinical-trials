  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to evaluate whether tailored print material can promote
      physical activity and exercise, and subsequently improve quality of life and fitness levels
      among people with multiple sclerosis (MS). Research suggests that routine physical activity
      is beneficial in people with mild to moderate MS. However, people with MS may face many
      barriers for engaging in regular physical activity. Prescribing a home exercise program and
      receiving tailored motivational print material may help people engage in physical activity.
      Thus, the investigators hope to figure out whether tailored print material can be used as
      strategy to promote physical activity and improve physical function in people with MS.

      The objective of the proposed study is to further our understanding of methods to promote
      physical activity (PA) in people with multiple sclerosis (MS). The investigators will
      evaluate the efficacy of a print-based multifaceted intervention that consists of prescribing
      an exercise program and teaching self-management strategies.

    <measure>Changes From Baseline in Physical Activity Behavior</measure>
    <time_frame>Each subject will be given the questionnaire at 3 points during the study, at baseline, interim test (an average of 12 weeks from baseline) and at posttest (an average of 24 weeks from baseline).</time_frame>
    <description>Physical activity behavior will be measured with the Godin Leisure-Time Exercise Questionnaire. The Godin Leisure-Time Exercise Questionnaire calculates total weekly leisure activity by summing the products of separate intensities. Weekly leisure activity score = (9 x time/week) + (5 x times/week) + (3 x times/week) for strenuous, moderate and light activities, respectively. The scale is summed to equal the Total Units Mean.
With this scale, higher numbers are considered to be the better outcome as it indicates more physical activity.</description>

    <measure>Changes From Baseline in Physical Fitness</measure>
    <time_frame>Each patient will be given the assessment at 3 points during the study, at baseline, interim test (an average of 12 weeks from baseline) and at posttest (an average of 24 weeks from baseline).</time_frame>
    <description>The physical assessment will include measuring the 6-minute walk test. The units reported are in meters for distance traveled by each participant during the six minutes. For this scale, the higher number is the better score as it is a direct measure of distance traveled.</description>

    <description>The Multiple Sclerosis Impact Scale will be administered. The total score is a sum of individual question scores, ranging from 29 (best possible outcome) to 145 (worst possible outcome). Therefore, the lower the number, the better the outcome.</description>

          <title>Changes From Baseline in Physical Activity Behavior</title>
          <description>Physical activity behavior will be measured with the Godin Leisure-Time Exercise Questionnaire. The Godin Leisure-Time Exercise Questionnaire calculates total weekly leisure activity by summing the products of separate intensities. Weekly leisure activity score = (9 x time/week) + (5 x times/week) + (3 x times/week) for strenuous, moderate and light activities, respectively. The scale is summed to equal the Total Units Mean.
With this scale, higher numbers are considered to be the better outcome as it indicates more physical activity.</description>
