    <textblock>
      Delirium is common complications in postoperative critically ill patients. However the
      mechanism of postoperative delirium is not well understood.The investigators designed a
      prospective observational study to investigate the association of perioperative plasma
      melatonin levels with postoperative delirium and general anesthesia. The investigators
      included 33 patients required intensive care more than 48 hours after sevoflurane anesthesia
      in an academic tertiary care hospital. The investigators measured plasma melatonin levels 4
      times and assessed postoperative delirium using Confusion Assessment Method for the intensive
      care unit (CAM-ICU).

      Delirium is common complications in postoperative critically ill patients. Although the
      mechanism of postoperative delirium is not well understood, there are several studies to
      report alternation of plasma melatonin levels after general anesthesia and suggest the link
      between delirium and abnormal tryptophan-serotonin-melatonin metabolism. However, there are
      few studies to assess the association of perioperative plasma melatonin levels with
      postoperative delirium and/or general anesthetics.

      The investigators designed a prospective observational study to investigate the association
      of perioperative plasma melatonin levels with postoperative delirium and general anesthesia.
      The investigators included 33 patients required intensive care more than 48 hours after
      sevoflurane anesthesia in an academic tertiary care hospital. The investigators measured
      plasma melatonin levels and assessed postoperative delirium using Confusion Assessment Method
      for the intensive care unit (CAM-ICU). The investigators compared perioperative plasma
      melatonin levels between patients with and without delirium, and assessed associations of
      patients' demographics and anesthesia with plasma melatonin levels.

    <description>We collected blood samples for the measurement of plasma melatonin levels at 1) 8 AM before operation, 2) 1 hour after operation, 3) 8 AM of postoperative day 1 and 4) 8 AM of postoperative day 2.Plasma was separated by centrifugation and the plasma was stored at least -30 degrees Celsius in a polypropylene tube until the time of assay. Plasma melatonin levels were measured with a melatonin radioimmunoassay kit (Buhlmann Laboratories AG, Allschwil, Switzerland).</description>
