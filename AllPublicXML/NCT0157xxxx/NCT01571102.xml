  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study we investigate whether physiotherapy offers added value in rehabilitation after
      meniscectomy compared with no therapy or a home program. The population consists of 180
      post-operative meniscus injury patients, operated at UZ Gent, the first 60 patients received
      no therapy, the next 60 patients were offered a treatment by their home physiotherapist
      according to our established protocol and the last 60 patients we have prepared a home
      program .

      The physiotherapeutic treatment has been prepared based on scientific literature and own
      experience from the program at Ghent University and internships. It includes exercises to
      promote mobility, strength and stability and exercises to reduce pain and swelling depending
      on the phase of tissue repair and evolution of the patient. This schedule will be given to
      the patient along with the questionnaires at registration of the operation and will serve as
      a guideline for the physiotherapist for the rehabilitation of the patient after surgery.
      Monitoring of the evolution will take place by calling the physiotherapist on regular basis.

      The home program is prepared on the basis of commonly used home exercises after arthroscopy
      and also includes exercises to promote mobility, strength and stability and exercises to
      reduce pain and swelling. The difference with the physiotherapeutic treatment is that there
      is no control and supervision of a physiotherapist and that the treatment is more limited.
      This program is given with the patient along with the questionnaires at registration of the
      operation.

      Pre-operatively and 4 weeks, 3 months, 6 months and 12 months post-operatively, an evaluation
      of the current condition of the patient will happen on the basis of standardized
      questionnaires. Based on the results of these questionnaires, collected at different times,
      we can determine which treatment provides the best rehabilitation after meniscectomy. The
      first (preoperative) questionnaire, given at registration of the operation, is completed and
      given to the nurse of the day hospital on the day of surgery, the other (postoperative)
      questionnaires are sent electronically to the patient's email address and need to be
      returned, after filling up.

      This study spends specific attention to the speed of resumption of work / sports and daily
      activities and the presence or absence of complaints.
