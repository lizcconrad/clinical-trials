  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The risk of dental fluorosis development is related to the systemic exposure to fluoride
      during enamel formation. Currently, diet and fluoride toothpastes are the main sources of
      fluoride to children at the age-risk for fluorosis development. However, when estimating the
      risk of fluorosis from toothpaste inadvertently ingested, it has not been considered the
      systemic fluoride bioavailability. Since some toothpaste formulations may contain part of
      fluoride as insoluble salts, the hypothesis behind this study is that only soluble fluoride
      in toothpastes would be absorbed when they are inadvertently ingested. To test that, adult
      volunteers will ingest a standardized dose of total fluoride from commercially available
      toothpastes, which present different concentrations of soluble fluoride. Fluoride systemic
      bioavailability will be assessed by the release of fluoride in saliva up to 3 hours after
      ingestion (as an indicator of blood fluoride) and by urinary fluoride excretion.

    <description>Saliva will be collected before and up to 3 hours after ingestion of the toothpastes or negative control. Collections (during 3 min) will be made at 0 (immediately before ingestion), 15, 30, 45, 60, 120 and 180 min after ingestion.</description>

    <measure>Maximum concentration of fluoride in saliva after toothpaste ingestion</measure>
    <time_frame>3 hours</time_frame>
    <description>Saliva collected up to 3 hours after the ingestion of toothpastes or negative control will be analyzed for fluoride concentration and the maximum concentration during this period will be recorded.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Urinary fluoride excretion (24-h) after toothpaste ingestion</measure>
    <time_frame>48 hours</time_frame>
    <description>Urine will be collected for the 24 hours preceeding the ingestion of the toothpastes or negative control and for the 24 hours after the ingestion. The difference in the amount of fluoride excreted in 24h urine samples, after or before the treatments, will be calculated.</description>
