    <textblock>
      Preoperative administration of pregabalin would reduce the end tidal concentration of
      sevoflurane during laparoscopic cholecystectomy with added beneficial improving of the
      quality of postoperative analgesia.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      laparoscopic cholecystectomy is a painful and stressful surgical procedure. Pregabalin is a
      lipophilic structural analogue of the inhibitory Î³-aminobutyric acid by binding to the
      presynaptic voltage-gated calcium channels that are widely distributed throughout the central
      and peripheral nervous system. Pregabalin has anticonvulsant, anxiolytic, sleep-modulating,
      anti-hyperalgesic, opioid-sparing6 and anti-allodynic properties through inhibition of the
      release of excitatory neurotransmitters such as glutamate, norepinephrine, serotonin,
      dopamine and substance P. These unique characteristics make pregabalin as a useful
      therapeutic for treating neuropathic pain and acute postoperative pain in several models of
      incisional injury and inflammatory conditions including laparoscopic cholecystectomy.

    <description>The quality of tracheal extubation was evaluated using a 5 - points rating scale: 1, no coughing or straining; 2, very smooth, minimal coughing; 3, moderate coughing; 4, marked coughing or straining; and 5, poor extubation, very uncomfortable</description>

    <description>The patients were asked about intraoperative awareness and recall on the second postoperative day by asking three simple questions using standard interview &quot;What was the last thing you remembered happening before you went to sleep? What is the first thing you remember happening on waking? Did you dream or have any other experiences whilst you were asleep?&quot;</description>
