    <textblock>
      Patients who have scheduled a gastric bypass (RYGB) in UZ Leuven, will be questioned
      preoperatively and one, three, six and twelve months after gastric bypass surgery. The
      purpose of this study is to explore current practice regarding the use of medication and
      medication counseling after RYGB and to examine the changes in dietary pattern before and
      after RYGB.

      Target group: patients who have scheduled a gastric bypass in UZ Leuven. Patients will be
      questioned preoperatively and one, three, six and twelve months after gastric bypass surgery.
      Each assessment will be performed during a routine consultation.

      The following aspects will be investigated:

        -  Medication The investigators have composed a questionnaire to examine which drugs the
           patients use, adherence, information received about medication and from whom,…

        -  Clinical parameters Every consultation, concentrations of hemoglobin, iron, hepcidin,
           vitamin B12,…. and a 24h urine collection to determine calcium excretion will be
           collected.

        -  Dietary intake The investigators will ask patients to keep a food record during two
           non-consecutive days preceding each consultation. In this food record patients have to
           note all consumed foods and beverages with the right/estimated amounts. This makes it
           possible to see the changes of the composition of the meals before and after RYGB.
