      This study will test the activity of single-agent EC145 and the combination of EC145 plus
      docetaxel against the current standard docetaxel in second line Non Small Cell Lung Cancer
      (NSCLC) (adenocarcinoma, squamous, adenosquamous or adenocarcinoma with other NSCLC variants
      of the lung) in participants with all target lesions expressing the folate receptor [FR(++)].

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In a phase 2 study of single-agent EC145 in heavily pretreated non-small cell lung cancer
      (NSCLC) patients (median of 3 prior chemotherapy regimens), the subgroup with all target
      lesions expressing the folate receptor [FR(++)] had a promising prolonged progression free
      survival of 7.1 months and overall survival of 10.9 months. Furthermore, in-vitro and in-vivo
      studies in KB models showed good synergism between EC145 and docetaxel.

      This study will clinically assess for the first time the combination of EC145+docetaxel (Arm
      B) in participants with NSCLC (Stage IIIB or IV). This is an international, multicenter,
      centrally randomized, open-label, phase 2 study comparing single-agent EC145, EC145+docetaxel
      combination therapy, and single-agent docetaxel in participants with NSCLC who have failed
      one prior chemotherapy and who have all target lesions expressing the folate receptor
      [FR(++)]. Eligible participants will be randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio into either Arm A
      (single-agent EC145), Arm B (EC145+docetaxel combination therapy), or Arm C (single-agent
      docetaxel) and will receive treatment until either disease progression or intolerable
      toxicity.

      This study is intended to investigate if there is a sufficiently strong efficacy signal in
      order to proceed with phase 3 testing with either EC145 single-agent and/or the combination
      of EC145+docetaxel against the standard-of-care docetaxel in second-line NSCLC.

      This study will clinically assess for the first time the combination of EC145+docetaxel (Arm
      B) in participants with NSCLC (Stage IIIB or IV). Therefore, an interim safety analysis will
      be done by the DSMB after 5 participants in Arm B have completed 1 cycle of therapy, and the
      second analysis after 15 participants in Arm B have completed 1 cycle of therapy.

      If the majority of the enrolled participants (more than 70%) require a dose reduction of one
      level (to 60 mg/m2), the dose will be reduced for the remainder of the study. If the majority
      of the participants (more than 70%) require 2 dose reductions (to 40 mg/m2), the sponsor will
      consider discontinuing the combination arm.

             free for more than 3 years are eligible.

          5. Serious cardiac illness or medical conditions such as unstable angina, pulmonary
             embolism, or uncontrolled hypertension.
