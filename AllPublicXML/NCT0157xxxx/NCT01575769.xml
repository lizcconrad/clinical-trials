  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This long-term, interventional, open-label extension study will evaluate the safety and
      efficacy of RoActemra/Actemra (tocilizumab) in patients from Poland and Russia with
      polyarticular-course juvenile idiopathic arthritis who completed the WA19977 study. Patients
      will receive RoActemra/Actemra 8 mg/kg every 4 weeks. The anticipated time on study treatment
      is 104 weeks.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <overall_status>Terminated</overall_status>
  <why_stopped>
    The study was terminated prior to the planned final on-treatment efficacy assessments due to
    commercial availability of tocilizumab in Russia and Poland.

    <time_frame>Baseline to 12 weeks after last actual study medication (up to 101 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>AE: unfavorable and unintended sign, symptom, or disease associated with use of treatment, regardless of treatment relation. Pre-existing conditions that worsened and laboratory or clinical tests that resulted in change in treatment or discontinuation from treatment were reported as AEs. Serious AE: resulted in death, life-threatening, required in-patient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, resulted in persistent or significant disability/incapacity, was congenital anomaly/birth defect or was medically significant. Severe AE: AE that caused inability to work or perform normal daily activity. AEs of special interest: Serious infections (including opportunistic infections), Myocardial infarction/Acute coronary syndrome, Gastrointestinal perforations and related AE, Malignant neoplasms, Anaphylaxis event, Demyelination-related events, Stroke, Spontaneous or serious bleeding, Serious/medically significant hepatic events. Any AE included serious and non-serious AE.</description>

    <description>The CHAQ-DI, as a measure of functional ability, consists of 30 questions in 8 domains: Dressing/grooming, arising, eating, walking, hygiene, reach, grip, and activities. There are 4 possible responses to each question (0=without any difficulty, 1=with some difficulty, 2=with much difficulty, 3=unable to do). A domain score is the highest score in that domain. To calculate the overall score, the participant must have a domain score in at least 6 of the 8 domains. The CHAQ-DI score is the sum of the domain scores divided by the number of domains that have a non-missing score and ranges from 0 (best) to 3 (worst). A higher score indicates less ability.</description>

        <description>JIA ACR50 response was defined as 3 of any 6 core outcome variables improved by at least 50% of the baseline assessments, with no more than 1 of the remaining variables worsened by more than 30%. Six core variables were: PGA of disease activity using VAS from left end of line 0 (inactive arthritis) to right end of line 100 (very active arthritis); PtGA of overall well-being using a VAS from left end of line 0 (very well) to right end of line 100 (very poor); Number of joints with active arthritis (joints with swelling not due to deformity or joints with limitation of motion and with pain, tenderness or both); Number of joints with limitation of movement; Health Assessment Questionnaire: 20 questions in 8 areas (dressing/grooming, arising, eating, walking, hygiene, reach, grip and activities) answered on a scale of 0=without difficulty to 3=unable to do; and ESR.</description>

        <description>Clinical remission: inactive disease for minimum of 6 continuous months while on medication (Level 1); off oral corticosteroid medications but still on tocilizumab (Level 2); off both methotrexate and oral corticosteroids but still on tocilizumab (Level 3); or off all anti-arthritis medications-oral corticosteroids, methotrexate, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs but still on tocilizumab (Level 4). Inactive disease: No joints with active arthritis (joints with swelling not due to deformity or joints with limitation of motion and with pain, tenderness or both); No fever, rash, serositis, splenomegaly, hepatomegaly (by physical exam) or generalized lymphadenopathy attributable to sJIA; Normal ESR (&lt;20 mm/hour); PGA of disease activity indicated no disease activity (score ≤10 mm on a 100 mm VAS where 0 [inactive arthritis] and 100 [very active arthritis]).

        <description>The CHAQ-DI, as a measure of functional ability, consists of 30 questions in 8 domains: Dressing/grooming, arising, eating, walking, hygiene, reach, grip, and activities. There are 4 possible responses to each question (0=without any difficulty, 1=with some difficulty, 2=with much difficulty, 3=unable to do). A domain score is the highest score in that domain. To calculate the overall score, the participant must have a domain score in at least 6 of the 8 domains. The CHAQ-DI score is the sum of the domain scores divided by the number of domains that have a non-missing score and ranges from 0 (best) to 3 (worst). A higher score indicates less ability.</description>
