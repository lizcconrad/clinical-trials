  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Surgical trauma triggers a massive inflammatory response. Over time, both the innate and
      adaptive branches of the immune system are affected by surgical trauma. The purpose of this
      study to characterize the cellular and molecular mechanisms immune response to surgical
      trauma. Additionally, detailed information about patients' recovery profile will be recorded
      over a period of 6 weeks, with the eventual goal of linking immune responses to recovery
      profiles.
