  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an observational trial in Rheumatoid Arthritis and Crohn's Disease patients treated
      with Cimzia aiming to evaluate the risk and incidence of Tuberculosis.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective non interventional study. Patients enrolled in this study will receive
      Cimzia on prescription according to the instructions for use approved in Russia and within
      the frame of current standard clinical practices. The patient is evaluated at the Screening
      Visit for enrollment. A Baseline Visit is to be scheduled no more than 28 days after the
      Screening Visit. Subsequent evaluations are done routinely every 6 months.

    <description>The incidence of Tuberculosis (TB) infection or reactivation is assessed by routine TB diagnostic tests (Chest X-ray, skin test, Interferon-γ-release assays recognizing antigens representing 2 Mycobacterium tuberculosis proteins (preferably both blood and skin tests), ESAT-6 and CFP-10)</description>

    <description>An Adverse Event (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation patient administered a pharmaceutical product which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal (investigational) product, whether or not related to the medicinal (investigational) product.</description>
