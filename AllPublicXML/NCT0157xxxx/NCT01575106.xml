      This study will use using fMRI (functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging) to elucidate how
      contextual learning/expectation relieves or aggravates pain experience in the same cohort of
      subjects and the same study session.

    <measure>Subjective Response to Pain (0-20 Visual Analogue Scale)</measure>
    <time_frame>Weeks 1-3</time_frame>
    <description>Subjects received heat pain before and after the application of a neutral cream (told one application of neutral cream was lidocaine, one was capsaicin, and one was neutral) and rated pain intensity on a 0-20 Visual Analogue Scale (0-no pain, 20-intolerable pain). We only measure this outcome measure in session 3. The pain intensity for each cream was averaged amongst all participants for both the pre and post treatment in session 3. Subjects have up to 3 weeks to complete the 3 sessions.</description>

    <measure>fMRI Signal Changes in the Dorsal Anterior Cingulate Cortex</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 4</time_frame>
    <description>We used fMRI to investigate the signal changes associated with administration of identical pain stimuli before (pre) and after the treatment (post) with different creams in session 3. It is important to note that the subjects had multiple weeks to complete the study, but this measure was only taken during one session. The change was calculated from two time points as the value at the later time point (post treatment) minus the value at the earlier time point (pre treatment).</description>
