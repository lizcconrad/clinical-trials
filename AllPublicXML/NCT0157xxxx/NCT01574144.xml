  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this observational study is to collect and characterize multiple physiologic
      data from a broad subset of subjects with acute heart failure (HF)

      Changes in physiologic data are expected to correlate with 30-day readmission rates in this
      population

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a multi-center, non-randomized feasibility study aimed at obtaining data from
      systolic and diastolic HF subjects in the hospital, with continued monitoring using an
      external wearable monitor for up to 4 weeks post-hospital-discharge. Data will be collected
      during the hospital stay and at in office follow-up visits at 1 week and 1 month
      post-hospital discharge

      The data will help generate hypotheses and aid in determining whether development of a
      detection algorithm for acute heart failure decompensation is feasible. Due to the
      feasibility nature of this study there is no minimum required sample size but it is
      anticipated that the study will enroll up to 100 subjects from seven (7) study sites in the
      United States and one (1) study site in Australia

      The study objectives are:

        -  Collect and characterize physiologic data from subjects with acute decompensated heart
           failure.

        -  Characterization of data related to health care utilizations within 30-days
           Post-discharge

        -  Correlation between patch monitor collected data and inpatient clinical data

        -  Correlation between patch monitor data and other clinical data collected after patient
           discharge (30-60 days)
