  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      After Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) meal induced GLP-1 secretion is dramatically increased,
      while beta-cell function is increased in type 2 diabetic (T2D) subjects. The aim of this
      study is to establish causality between the two observations. By meal testing 10 T2D subjects
      with infusion of saline or exendin (9-39), a GLP-1R specific blocker, before and 1 week and 3
      months after RYGB we hope to demonstrate the role of GLP-1 in improveing beta-cell function
      and maintaing glucose tolerance after RYGB in T2D subjects. Furthermore, effects of GLP-1 rec
      blockade before and after RYGB on ad libitum energy intake is examined

    <description>On two separate experimental days before, 1 wk, and 3 months after RYGB, subjects are given a liquid meal test during Exendin 9-39 (900 pmol/min/kg)or saline infusion. The order of the infusions is randomized. At end of study day an ad libitum meal is served.</description>
