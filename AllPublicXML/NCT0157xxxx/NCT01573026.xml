      The purpose of this research study is to document the use if the Keystone Dental Genesis
      Dental Implant System in standard clinical use and to provide 5 year survival data.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The technology behind dental implants is well established and the Genesis Dental Implant
      System has been cleared for marketing by the FDA. It is Keystone Dental's choice to collect
      post-market data within the framework of a clinical trial in order to assess the clinical
      performance of this device.

      The risks of the Genesis Dental Implant System are no different than other comparable dental
      implant systems currently in use. Keystone Dental expects the clinical performance of this
      device to be equal to that of comparable implant systems.

      The purpose of this research study is to assess the 5 year survival rate of the Genesis
      Dental Implant System, as well as assess the safety and effectiveness endpoints, which
      include incidence of adverse effects, change in bone height and soft tissue aesthetic
      outcomes.
