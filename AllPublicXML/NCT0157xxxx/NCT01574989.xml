  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study the investigators aim to investigate the effects of two different types of
      non-invasive brain stimulation techniques -- repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation
      (rTMS) and transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) on motor function in stroke. This
      is a cross-over study where subjects will receive 5 sessions of stimulation (each separated
      by 1 week) -- with either active tDCS and sham rTMS, sham tDCS and active rTMS or both sham
      tDCS and rTMS.

    <measure>Changes in cortical excitability measures</measure>
    <time_frame>Measured for approximately 6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>We will measure cortical excitability using single- and paired-pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) before and after each stimulation session. We will compare the measurements from before stimulation to after stimulation, in each scheduled session, as this study is measuring the effects of a single session of tDCS/rTMS.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes in motor function</measure>
    <time_frame>Measured for approximately 6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>We will measure motor function using behavioral tasks (ex. purdue pegboard, jebsen taylor test, range of motion) both before and after the stimulation sessions. We will compare the measurements from before stimulation to after stimulation, in each scheduled session, as this study is measuring the effects of a single session of tDCS/rTMS.</description>
