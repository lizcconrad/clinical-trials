  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      During a five years period the participating transfusion medicine establishments will report
      all their non-trivial adverse events (AE) occurring during preparative hemaphereses.
      Complications may be related to the blood donors, the blood products, the disposables or the
      apheresis devices. The study hypothesis regarding each participating center is that their
      procedure-related AE rate is not higher than the respective rate of all other centers in
      total.

      In the scope of this study the participating transfusion medicine establishments obligate
      themselves to record all significant Adverse Events (AE) related to preparative hemaphereses
      of healthy donors. All complications (phlebotomy and circulation problems, citrate toxicity,
      donor compliance, and technical complications) shall be assessed with respect to plasma-,
      platelet-, leukocyte- (stem cells, granulocytes, monocytes), and red cell aphereses as well
      as multicomponent aphereses. Study data are recorded by means of an Internet-based
      hemapheresis vigilance system. Study results will be evaluated according to the advanced
      standards of the International Haemovigilance Network (IHN). The study contributes to the
      quality assurance of each single center as it enables the comparison to other transfusion
      medicine establishments.
