      Primary:

      The purpose of this study is to assess the clinical implications of continuous distal CO2
      monitoring when used for clinical decisions

      Sub Study:

      â€¢ Evaluate the average life time (duration) of Standard Carinal VitaLine set in comparison to
      the Carinal VitaLine set that its sampling tubing is made of PEBAX (dehumidifying material).

      Description of Study Design:

      Patients will be randomized at the baseline evaluation visit into one of the following
      groups:

        -  Masked group: Data derived from the Capnostream20p will be recorded; however the medical
           staff will be masked from it and hence will not use it.

        -  Open group: Data derived from the Capnostream20p and displayed to the medical team. It
           will allow the treating physician and the nursing team to review the real time data and
           make clinical decisions based upon it if felt necessary.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Intubated neonates with double-lumen ETT (Uncuffed Tracheal Tube, Mallinckrodt Inc.,
             Chih, Mexico) that their respiratory condition requires conventional ventilation.

          -  Obtaining signed Informed Consent Form by the parents or legal guardian

          -  Intubated neonates that are expected to provide at least 3 pairs of blood samples and
             ETCO2 measurements during ventilation period

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Intubated neonates with single-lumen ETTs

          -  Neonates who are ventilated with HFV

          -  Any significant medical condition which, at the investigator's discretion, may
             interfere with the study.
