      This study serves as a comparison study between the EPIC ClearView and a predicate device.

    <textblock>
      The EPIC ClearView is a galvanic skin response (GSR) measurement system that is intended to
      be used to determine autonomic response as psychological indicators by measuring the
      electrical resistance of the skin. The EPIC ClearView is a non-invasive digital
      bioelectrography instrument that is used to assess the electrophysiology of humans. The
      measurements are digital photographs taken in a brief exposure to an electric field. These
      measurements are quantified to produce a standardized Response Scale.

    <description>The primary objective of this study is to perform a point-to-point comparison of the EPIC ClearViewâ„¢ galvanic skin response hand measurements (on a 0-25 scale) to those of a predicate device (on a 0-100 scale). We hypothesize that there will be a statistically significant correlation between the galvanic skin response measurements made by the two devices.</description>
