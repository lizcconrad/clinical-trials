      The purpose of this study is to investigate the benefit of Closed-loop System for Oxygen
      Delivery (FreeO2) as compared with fixed oxygen flow during endurance shuttle walking test in
      patients with Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), oxygen therapy and hypercapnia.

      The study was designed to test the following hypotheses:

      As compared with fixed oxygen flow, the FreeO2 Oxygen Delivery system leads to higher
      exercise tolerance (distance during ESWT) and lower desaturation events without increase in
      hypercapnia in patients with COPD, oxygen therapy and hypercapnia.

      As compared with fixed oxygen flow, the FreeO2 Oxygen Delivery system leads to lower dyspnea
      and leg fatigue scores at a given endurance time during the shuttle walking test in patients
      with COPD, oxygen therapy and hypercapnia.

      As compared with fixed oxygen flow, the FreeO2 Oxygen Delivery system leads to lower cardiac
      and respiratory frequencies at a given endurance time during the shuttle walking test in
      patients with COPD, oxygen therapy and hypercapnia.

      Background:

      In spite of oxygen therapy, desaturations frequently occur during exercise in COPD patients.
      Although current recommendations are to add 1 L/min to the baseline oxygen flow during
      exertion, a new closed-loop system (FreeO2) automatically and continuously adjusts the oxygen
      flow to the patient's needs based on the oxygen saturation by pulse oximetry (SpO2),
      end-tidal CO2 (EtCO2) and respiratory rate. A preliminary study showed significant
      improvement in exercise tolerance in COPD patients not needing oxygen therapy. Although
      oxygen flow could be two fold increased during exercise, a worsening hypercapnia is plausible
      in severe COPD.

      Aim of this study is to evaluate this system during endurance shuttle walking test in COPD
      patients with oxygen therapy and hypercapnia.

      Methods: The investigators proposed to conduct a controlled, randomized cross-over study
      comparing the efficacy of a Closed-loop System for Oxygen Delivery (FreeO2) as compared with
      fixed oxygen flow during an endurance shuttle walking test in patients with COPD, oxygen
      therapy and hypercapnia.
