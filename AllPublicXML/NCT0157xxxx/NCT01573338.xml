  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is the first study where BAY1000394 is given in combination with chemotherapy: cisplatin
      / etoposide or carboplatin / etoposide. Patients with small cell lung cancer will be treated.
      Every patient will receive drug treatment, there is no placebo group. Different groups of
      patients will receive different dosages of BAY1000394 to determine the safety and maximum
      tolerated dose (MTD) of BAY1000394 in combination with chemotherapy. The dose of chemotherapy
      is the standard dose usually administered and will not change.

      The study will also assess how the drug is metabolized by the body and changes in tumor size.

      BAY1000394 will be given per mouth, twice a day for three days every week. Treatment will
      stop if the tumor continues to grow, if side effects occur which the patient can not tolerate
      or if the patients decides to exit treatment.
