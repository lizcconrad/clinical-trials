      The purpose of this study was to determine the effect of soluble corn fiber on calcium
      absorption and retention and gut microflora in adolescent boys and girls.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In a previous study, soluble corn fiber (SCF) was found to greatly enhance calcium
      utilization and bone properties in a growing rat model. Because factors that enhance bone
      density and mineral content can potentially result in a skeleton that will resist fracture
      later in life, it is important to investigate this potential in adolescents. Therefore, the
      objective of this study was to determine the effect of SCF on calcium absorption and
      retention in adolescent boys and girls. A second objective of this study was to assess
      whether additional dietary fiber leads to changes in gut microflora which may influence
      calcium absorption. During this two-phase metabolic camp participants consumed packages of
      fruit snacks supplemented with either 0 or 6 grams of soluble corn fiber twice a day during
      the first phase of the study, and switch to the opposite treatment during the second phase,
      with a 2-week washout period in between. Subjects collected all excreta during both phases
      and calcium absorption, gut microbiota, height, weight, and bone density were evaluated
      throughout the 6-week period of the study.
