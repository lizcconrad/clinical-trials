  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Controlling secondary hyperparathyroidism (sHPT) in maintenance hemodialysis (MHD) patients
      is cumbersome, partly due to patient's non-adherence to prescribed drugs.

      The main objective of this study was to assess whether an integrated care (IC) approach, in
      which adherence data are integrated in the decisional process, led to improved therapeutic
      control of secondary hyperparathyroidsm and higher percentages of bone metabolism targets as
      compared to a usual care (UC) approach, in which biological values represent the main stem of
      the decisional process.

      The predefined hypothesis was that patients of the IC group should reach the iPTH targets
      using 25% less doses of cinacalcet at 6 months than those of the UC group.
