      The purpose of this study is to validate the efficacy of Noxipoint(TM) therapy on chronic
      pain, and compare it with standard physical therapy using electrical stimulation on patients
      with chronic pain.

      Invented by Dr. Charlie Koo at Stanford University, Noxipoint Therapy is a specific procedure
      with precise location, duration and intensity of TENS stimulation within the general FDA
      guidelines. The therapy substantially relieves general muscular/tendon pain and persistently
      restores the muscle and tendon function. The surface locations of nociceptors at the free
      nerve ending (i.e., &quot;Noxipoints&quot;) are focused on in the stimulation therapy. Multiple
      clinical uses of Noxipoint Therapy confirmed the consistent efficacy of such stimulation at
      Noxipoints. An observational study of Noxipoint therapy within the FDA-approved use of TENS
      demonstrated an encouraging 93% success rate in eliminating the chronic pain, such as frozen
      shoulder pain, within 2-3 sessions. It is an order-of-magnitude improvement over the
      non-specific application of TENS and any other modalities in pain treatment. A unique
      neuro-immuno-signaling pathway that implicates the activation of adult stem cells, such as
      satellite cells in muscles, is implicated based on such a high success rate.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Brief Pain Inventory (BPI) Severity of the Pain at Its Worst</measure>
    <time_frame>One year</time_frame>
    <description>BPI will be evaluated as the score change from the baseline. As a supplemental measure, the baseline of individual patients will also be normalized to 100%, with the change being a percentile of the baseline.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>BPI Severity of the pain in the other three occasions</measure>
    <time_frame>One year</time_frame>
    <description>Besides the Severity of the Pain at Its Worst, there are three other pain measures in BPI. This measure will be used as a supporting measure fo the Primary Measure.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>BPI Interference of Function</measure>
    <time_frame>One year</time_frame>
    <description>This measure is used to indicate the impact of the subject's quality of life. However, the standard questions include the therapy's functional impact on walking, which is not likely to be influenced by neck/shoulder pains in any case and thus may not be relevant. Thus, a supplemental measure excluding the impact on walking will be provided as a supplemental observation.</description>

    <description>Patients will be treated with a TENS device, following Noxipoint Therapy guidelines:
Find the cause of the pain via Noxipoint: For each injured muscle/tissue, it is discovered that there are always a pair of points at the skin surface locations of its nociceptors that are painful at light press (named &quot;Noxipoints&quot;).
Stimulate the corresponding pair of Nocipoints following a narrowly defined combination of intensity/ frequency (inducing the C-fiber response) and duration (about 1.5-3 minutes) of TENS at the two targeted Noxipoints.
Repeat (a) to (b) above for each identified injured muscle group until all pain areas are eliminated or when the session time is up.
Instruct the subject not to use the newly recovered muscle/tissue too much an estimated rest period depending on his/her age.</description>

    <description>The 1.5-hour physical therapy in the control arm are provided both as standard of care and sham device comparison to Nocipoint Therapy, following these guidelines:
TENS stimulation (45 minutes):
â€¢ Electrodes will be placed around the patient-identified general pain area on the neck /shoulder for TENS. Rotate the electrode pads around the pain area and stimulate again.
Other modalities of PT per the therapist's choice:
Infrared treatment on the pain areas (about 15 minutes)
Manual therapy to cervical and/or rotator cuff areas (about 15 minutes).
Exercise and training:
Neck exercises: Range of motion exercises to include foraminal opening for about 15 minutes, and/or
Shoulder exercise: Range of motion exercises to include walking the arm on the wall, rotation of the upper arm for about 15 minutes
Hot/cold pack to the pain area for about 15 minutes</description>
