    <textblock>
      The methodology of this clinical trial is based on the realisation of a group intervention
      with children who lost a parent. Interviews preintervention and postintervention with
      participants will be done as well. The purpose of this study is to answer the following
      question: &quot;What are the benefits for children who are in the process of bereaving a parent to
      participate in a group work intervention based on the mutual aid model ?&quot;. The aim of the
      research is to explore the benefits for grieving children to participate in an group work
      intervention based on the mutual aid model. To do so, the research has three distinct
      objectives : 1) to develop and apply a program of group work interventions for grieving
      children based on the mutual aid model ; 2) to explore the extent to which participation in
      the group facilitates changes in the children's discourse about death and the loss of their
      parents, and 3) to examine, from the children's own perceptive, the possible impact that
      their participation in the group have on their experience of bereavement.
