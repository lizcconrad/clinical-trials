  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multi-center, prospective, randomized, single-blind, investigator initiated,
      pharmacodynamic study of parallel design, performed at 3 institutions (Patras University
      Hospital; Evangelismos Athens General Hospital; Gennimatas Athens General Hospital).

      Patients with ST elevation myocardial infarction (symptom onset &lt; 12 hours), undergoing
      primary percutaneous coronary intervention, who are antiplatelet naïve (Group A) or present
      high residual PR (defined as PRU ≥ 208) immediately before primary percutaneous coronary
      intervention, will be randomized after informed consent, in a 1:1 ratio to either:

      Ticagrelor 180mg loading dose (LD), followed by a 90mg x2 maintenance dose (MD )starting 12±6
      hours post LD Or Ticagrelor 360mg loading dose (LD), followed by a 90mg x2 maintenance dose
      (MD) starting 12±6 hours post LD Platelet reactivity assessment will be performed at
      randomization (Hour 0) and at 0.5, 1, 2, 4 hours after randomization, using the VerifyNow
      assay, in platelet reactivity units (PRU).

      Documentation of major adverse cardiac events (death, myocardial infarction, stroke, urgent
      revascularization procedure with PCI or CABG) and bleeding (according to Bleeding Academic
      Research Consortium criteria) will be performed until patient's discharge.
