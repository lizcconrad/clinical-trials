  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Ranibizumab has been proven to be effective in large multicentre studies. However, the
      injections have to be repeated monthly. A combined therapy with the established photodynamic
      therapy might even be more effective, less intravitreal injections might be necessary due to
      a synergistic effect.

      The study will be conducted to explore whether intravitreal ranibizumab in monotherapy or in
      combination with verteporfin photodynamic therapy under a new time regime is an effective,
      safe and convenient treatment for patients with subfoveal Choroidal Neovascularisation (CNV)
      secondary to Age-Related Macular Degeneration (AMD).

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  BCVA letter score in the study eye between 73-24 (approximately 20/40 to 20/320) using
             an ETDRS chart measured at 4 meters or Snellen equivalent

          -  CNV lesion of any type in the study eye which meets all the following characteristics
             as determined by fluorescein angiography:

               -  Evidence that CNV extends under the geometric center of the foveal avascular
                  zone.

               -  The area of the CNV must occupy at least 50% of the total lesion.

               -  The lesion must be ≤ 5400 microns in greatest linear dimension (GLD)

          -  For occult with no classic CNV, additionally recent disease progression as assessed by
             the Investigator is required defined as having at least one of the following criteria:

               -  Blood associated with the lesion at baseline

               -  Loss of VA in the previous 3 months defined as either ≥ 5 letters (ETDRS
                  equivalent) as determined by protocol refraction and protocol measurements, or 2
                  or more lines using a Snellen or equivalent chart by standard examinations. ≥ 10%
                  increase in the greatest diameter of the lesion in the previous 3 months as
                  assessed by fluorescein angiography

          -  Willing to return for scheduled visits for a 12 month period

          -  Only one eye will be assessed in the study. If both eyes are eligible, the one with

             medical reasons, the investigator deems the other eye the more appropriate candidate

             -8 diopters of myopia

          -  Presence of a retinal pigment epithelial tear involving the macula in the study eye
