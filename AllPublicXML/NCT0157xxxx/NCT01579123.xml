    <textblock>
      The reason the investigators are doing this study is to compare the results of laser
      atherectomy versus angioplasty with or without the placement of a stent in the artery. A
      stent is a metal tube used to open up narrow arteries in the body.

      People with peripheral artery disease that has severely reduced blood flow in their lower leg
      are usually treated with surgical bypass. This condition is known as Critical Limb Ischemia
      or CLI. Over the last decade, advances in techniques and tools have allowed surgeons to more
      aggressively treat complex cases. Studies have shown successful treatment of CLI with
      endovascular techniques (less invasive surgical procedures through a small incision for the
      treatment of vascular disease), including laser atherectomy and angioplasty. Surgical
      guidelines are not clear as to the best procedure to use for CLI. To the best of our
      knowledge, a study comparing laser atherectomy and angioplasty has not been done. Laser
      atherectomy works by releasing ultraviolet light which is absorbed by the plaque in the
      arteries. This will then get rid of the plaque. Angioplasty is a procedure used to open
      blocked or narrowed arteries. Currently, it is not known if laser atherectomy has better
      results than angioplasty.

    <description>With angioplasty, a catheter is guided to the portion of the artery that is narrowed or blocked off. A balloon that is attached to the end of the catheter will be inflated which dilates or expands the artery in the area where the narrowing or blockage is located. Based on the angiogram and extent of disease, the physician may place a stent (small mesh tube that is used to treat narrow or weak arteries in the body) during the angioplasty.</description>

    <description>Laser atherectomy uses a catheter that emits high energy light (laser) to unblock the artery. The catheter is moved through the artery until it reaches the blockage. Laser energy is used to essentially vaporize the blockage inside the vessel.</description>
