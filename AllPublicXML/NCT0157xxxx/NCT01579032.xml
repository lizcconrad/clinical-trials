      The aims of the presented study are as follows:

        1. To evaluate the endothelial function and arterial stiffness in a large cohort of
           prevalent CKD patients by means of non-invasive applantion tonometry.

        2. To evaluate the association between the serum levels of the representatives of the
           various classes of uremic toxins and markers of endothelial function and arterial
           stiffness.

        3. To evaluate the association between markers of inflammation and oxidative stress and
           markers of endothelial function and arterial stiffness.

        4. To evaluate the association between echocardiographic parameters and markers of arterial
           stiffness
