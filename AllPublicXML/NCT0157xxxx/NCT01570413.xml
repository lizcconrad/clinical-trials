      This study is designed to determine whether the pelvic examination (including bimanual and
      speculum examination) is necessary in patients with first trimester vaginal bleeding/ lower
      abdominal pain when an intra-uterine pregnancy (IUP) is seen on ultrasound. Patients with the
      chief complaint of vaginal bleeding or lower abdominal pain less than 16 weeks and positive
      HCG will be considered for this non-inferiority-designed clinical trial. All patients who
      present to the BMC Emergency Department (ED) Mon - Fri from 8am to 11pm and have had serum or
      urine HCG testing and a formal ultrasound by a credentialed emergency physician or radiology
      technician as part of standard of care will be screened for further eligibility. Those
      patients with intra-uterine pregnancies &lt; 16 weeks gestation seen on ultrasound and meet
      inclusion criteria will then be asked to provide informed consent to participate in the
      study. Randomization will occur after consent has been obtained. Half of the patients will be
      randomized to receive pelvic examinations and the other half will not. Further care will be
      determined by the treating attending physician. The primary outcome will be a composite
      morbidity endpoint at 30 days, including return visits to the ED, emergency surgery, need for
      transfusion, infection, or other missed source of bleeding/ pain. Secondary outcomes of
      interest include ED throughput time, and patient satisfaction.
