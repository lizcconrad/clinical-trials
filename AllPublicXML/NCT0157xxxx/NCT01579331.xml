  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Study wants to test reliability Dynamic Contour Tonometry (DCT) in measuring intraocular
      pressure (IOP) and Ocular Pulse Amplitude (OPA). IOP values obtained with DCT will then be
      compared with IOP values obtained with Goldmann Applanation Tonometry (GAT), actually the
      gold standard technique.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Healthy volunteers recruited among subjects who underwent a routine ophthalmologic evaluation
      or among students and workers both at our clinic, will undergo a series of 5 DCT to evaluate
      eventual differences among the measurements.

      A diurnal IOP curve performed though GAT, composed of 3 measurements (9am, noon, 4pm) will be
      taken 1 to 7 days before the DCT.

      At the end of the DCT measurements a last GAT will be taken to control eventual IOP changes
      versus previous GAT values obtained through the diurnal curve.

      After 3 weeks observers will contact patients to record eventual adverse events. If examiners
      consider it as necessary, a safety ophthalmological evaluation will then be performed.
