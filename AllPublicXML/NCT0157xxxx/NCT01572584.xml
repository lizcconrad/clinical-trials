      Background

        -  Assessment of the percentage of lung collapse is crucial in the therapeutic
           decision-making of pneumothorax.

        -  The methods normally used to this purpose are radiological. Computerized tomography scan
           (CT) is highly accurate because it allows the exact evaluation of the volume of the air
           layer. However, in clinical practice assessment of the volume of pneumothorax mainly
           relies on the measurement of the inter-pleural distance at conventional chest
           radiography (CXR). This latter method is inaccurate.

        -  Lung ultrasound is a new method highly accurate in the first diagnosis of pneumothorax,
           with a sensitivity superior to CXR and similar to CT in case of traumatic pneumothorax.

        -  The scientific community is actually debating about the usefulness of lung ultrasound in
           the quantification of pneumothorax []. Lung ultrasound can assess the superficial
           extension of the pneumothorax, but cannot evaluate its volume.

      Aim

        -  Main purpose of the study is to compare measurement of the superficial extension of
           pneumothorax on the chest wall obtained by lung ultrasound, to the evaluation of the air
           volume performed by CT in patients with pneumothorax.

        -  The main hypothesis of the study is that the cut-off between small (&lt;11% of lung
           collapse) and large (&gt;11% of lung collapse) pneumothorax can be identified by a lung
           ultrasound evaluation of the superficial extension of pneumothorax.

        -  Second purpose of the study is to compare the accuracies of lung ultrasound and CXR in
           predicting the volume of pneumothorax assessed by CT.

        -  Secondary hypothesis is that lung ultrasound demonstrates greater accuracy in the
           prediction of volume of pneumothorax and percentage of lung collapse.

      Methods

        -  Patients with a diagnosis of pneumothorax confirmed at CT are prospectively enrolled and
           submitted to lung ultrasound within 20 min from the CT study.

        -  Different locations of the sonographic &quot;lung point&quot; on the chest wall (i.e. the point on
           the chest wall where the sonographic pattern of the normally aerated lung alternates
           with the pathologic sonographic pattern of pneumothorax) are compared with different
           volumes of pneumothorax measured by CT.
