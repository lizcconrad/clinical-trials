      Patients in the ICU whose infection is resolving will be randomized to standard duration of
      antibiotics compared to duration determined by a combination of a procalcitonin value and a
      simple evaluation of clinical status.

    <description>In the experimental arm, antibiotics will be stopped based upon the PCT-guided algorithm. This PCT algorithm also incorporates clinical parameters to ensure utmost safety for the patients. These clinical parameters are; resolution of fever (temperature less than 38.3 and greater than 36.0), shock (on no vasopressors), and leukocytosis (&lt;12,000 and &gt;4,000).</description>
