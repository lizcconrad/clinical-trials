      The purpose of this study is to determine the influence of FAI abnormalities on hip joint
      biomechanics.

      The purpose of this study is to quantify hip biomechanics of subjects with and without FAI.

      The results of this study will advance our understanding of how the FAI alters the
      biomechanics of the hip joint, improving diagnosis and directing treatment strategies.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients who present with hip pain subsequently diagnosed as femoroacetabular
             impingement

          -  Subjects who meet the following radiographic criterion of cam or pincer FAI, will be
             given the opportunity to volunteer in this study.

          -  Subjects that demonstrate a cross-over-sign or a lateral center edge angle (LCEA)
             without an alpha angle, will be classified as having pincer FAI.

          -  Subjects with an alpha angle, without a cross-over sign or LCEA, will be categorized
             as having cam type FAI.

          -  Finally, with at least one cam (alpha angle) and pincer sign &quot;cross-over-sign or a
             lateral center edge angle (LCEA)&quot; will be classified as mixed FAI.

        Control Population Inclusion Criteria:

          -  12 controls will consist of volunteers in the same age range as the subject groups
             (18-35 years).

          -  Control hips will be screened with a standard AP radiograph. Normal volunteers who
             have radiographic evidence of FAI, dysplasia or other joint deformities will be
             excluded.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects who have radiographic evidence of osteoarthritis (Tonnis Grade III or IV)
             will be excluded as this study focuses on the mechanics of hips before prominent
             cartilage damage.

          -  Subjects who have had prior procedures to correct FAI or other hip conditions will be
             excluded (exploratory procedures will be included).

          -  Minors (under age 18), mentally disabled, persons incarcerated, on parole, probation
             awaiting trial, or pregnant women are excluded from this study.

          -  A human Chorionic Gondaotropin (hCG) urine pregnancy test will be performed on all
             women prior to the study.

          -  To limit the annual radiation exposure to any participating volunteers, we will
             exclude anyone who has had a CT scan or participated in a research study involving
             ionizing radiation in the past 12 months.

        Motion Capture Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects who are unwilling or unable to perform the proposed activities of daily
             living or undergo the clinical exams will be dismissed.

          -  Subjects with a BMI less than 30 (www.nhlbisupport.com/bmi/) or those with dense hip
             musculature/wide hips (maximum of 42 cm of circumferential hip length) will be
             excluded.

        CT Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects who are unwilling or unable to remain still.

          -  Subjects who are allergic to contrast agent and/or lidocaine will be dismissed.
