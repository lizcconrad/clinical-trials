  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to understand if there is any difference in the effects
      of tasimelteon when it is taken alone or in combination with alcohol. This research study is
      also being done to understand if there is any difference in the amount of tasimelteon (and
      its breakdown products) or alcohol in the blood when taken alone or together. Finally, the
      study will also look at the safety and tolerability (how acceptable it is) of tasimelteon.

    <textblock>
      Alcohol is a drug that gets absorbed into the bloodstream quickly. The blood carries the
      alcohol to the brain where it slows down the messages in the brain (alcohol is a depressant).
      Alcohol affects a person's memory, behaviour, concentration, alertness (your thought process
      is slower), and coordination (your movements become clumsy). The intended effect of
      tasimelteon is to cause sleepiness. Sleepiness may result in similar effects on memory,
      concentration, alertness, and coordination as alcohol. There is the possibility taking
      tasimelteon and alcohol together can make these effects stronger or worse.

             chloramphenicol or tamoxifen) during the 60 day preceding the Screening visit;

         16. Participation in a previous BMS-214778/VEC-162 trial;
