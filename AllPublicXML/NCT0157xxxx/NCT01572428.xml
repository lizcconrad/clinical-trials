  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a study to determine if using Narrow-Band Imaging of the colon, rather than the usual
      white light on the colon, will improve the detection of a type of polyp called serrated. The
      polyps are called serrated because of their appearance under the microscope after they have
      been removed. They tend to be located up high in the colon, far away from the rectum. They
      have been definitely shown to be a type of precancerous polyp and it is possible that using
      Narrow-Band Imaging will make it easier to see them, as they can be quite difficult to see
      with standard white light.

    <textblock>
      This is a randomized controlled trial comparing the use of Narrow-Band Imaging (illumination
      of the colon in blue light)versus standard white light for the detection of serrated lesions
      in the proximal colon (the colon proximal to the splenic flexure). Recent studies have
      indicated that colonoscopy is more effective in preventing cancer in the left side of the
      colon than the right side of the colon. The reasons for this difference may be partly
      biologic, in that a special group of polyps known as serrated polyps, particularly sessile
      serrated adenomas, are located primarily proximal to the splenic flexure. These lesions share
      molecular features with a group of cancers that occur primarily in the proximal colon. These
      molecular features include CpG island methylator phenotype (CIMP) and microsatellite
      instability. These lesions are endoscopically subtle in that they are often flat, have the
      same color as the surrounding mucosa, and are hard to differentiate from normal mucosa.
      Narrow-Band Imaging has anecdotally been used to highlight the appearance of these lesions.
      This study will test whether Narrow-Band Imaging increases the detection of serrated lesions
      in a randomized controlled trial.
