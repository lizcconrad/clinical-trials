  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      About 18 patients will take part in the phase 1 portion of the trial. In the beginning of the
      study, 3 patients will be treated with a low dose of ganetespib (STA-9090) and the standard
      dose of crizotinib. If this dose does not cause significant side effects, it will be
      increased as new patients take part in the study. The study will only be open at Memorial
      Sloan Kettering Cancer Center.

    <description>A standard 3+3 design will be used to find the maximum tolerated dose (MTD). Patients who withdraw before completing a full cycle will be replaced. There will be three set dose levels, using the approved dose of crizotinib, with 50%, 75% and 100% of the ganetespib (STA-9090) maximum tolerated dose of 200 mg/m2.</description>

             adenocarcinoma that is locally advanced or metastatic (stage III/IV).

          -  Positive for translocation or inversion events involving the ALK gene locus as
             determined standard methods (including but not limited to by FISH and IHC testing).

             chemotherapy.

          -  Age ≥ 18 years.

          -  Measurable (RECIST 1.1) indicator lesion not previously irradiated.

          -  Patients with hepatic metastases may have ALT/AST ≤ 5x ULN.

          -  Patients with hepatic and/or bone metastases may have an AP ≤ 5x ULN.

             fungal, bacterial, viral or other infection (defined as exhibiting ongoing

             anti-infective medications or other treatment).

          -  Patients with clinically active brain metastasis (requiring therapy with steroids or
             radiation therapy). Patients with clinically stable brain metastases (previously
             treated or untreated) for two weeks are eligible.

          -  Significant cardiac disease (e.g. New York Heart Association (NYHA) Class 3 or 4;
