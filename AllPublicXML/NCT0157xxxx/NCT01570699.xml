  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main objective is to compare the genotypes of the COMT Val158Met polymorphism between
      opiate-users and opiate-dependent subjects. The secondary objective is to constitute a sample
      of opiate-users without any lifetime opiate dependence.

      The COMT enzyme enables the degradation of brain monoamines such as Dopamine and is encoded
      by a single gene for which several polymorphisms are known, including the Val158Met
      polymorphism which has been widely studied in various psychiatric disorders, including
      addictions, as well as in impulsivity. In most studies it is the Val allele which is found to
      be associated with addictive behaviors. The study METHADOSE, which began in 2009, includes
      opiate-dependent patients substituted by methadone. The preliminary analysis of this study
      shows a genotype distribution different from that of general population samples, with a
      greater prevalence of Val / Val and Val / Met genotypes. Will be included in the COM ON study
      subjects who have consumed illicit opiates (heroin, methadone, buprenorphine or morphine)
      more than 10 times in their life, without ever having the DSM-IV criteria for opiate
      dependence or abuse. The study will compare, by means of saliva samples, Val / Val and Val /
      Met genotypes between the subjects recruited in COM ON and those recruited in METHADOSE. Will
      also be included auto-questionnaires to identify psychological factors that may constitute
      risk or protective factors vis-à-vis the development of dependence.
