  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a safety / feasibility trial evaluating the combination of a humanized anti-GD2
      antibody (HU14.18K322A) manufactured at the Children's GMP, LLC at St. Jude with allogeneic
      natural killer (NK) cells and standard chemotherapy in children with relapsed or refractory
      neuroblastoma.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Eligible participants will receive chemotherapy combined with Hu14.18K322A antibody daily for
      four consecutive days. Those participants who go on to receive the second course of
      chemotherapy with Hu14.18K322A will receive an infusion of allogeneic NK cells after the 4th
      dose of Hu14.18K322A antibody. A maximum of six courses will be given.

      Primary Objective:

        -  To observe and describe the toxicities associated with humanized anti-GD2 antibody
           (hu14.18K322A) with and without allogeneic NK cells when given with repeated cycles of
           chemotherapy to children with refractory/relapsed neuroblastoma.

      Secondary Objective:

        -  To describe response, time to progression, event-free and overall survival.

        -  To evaluate the feasibility of administering NK cells from a suitable donor after
           completion of the last dose of hu14.18K322A in three repeated cycles of chemotherapy

    <description>The mechanism of action of the CliniMACS Cell Selection System is based on magnetic-activated cell sorting (MACS). The CliniMACS device is a powerful tool for the isolation of many cell types from heterogeneous cell mixtures, (e.g. apheresis products). These can then be separated in a magnetic field using an immunomagnetic label specific for the cell type of interest, such as CD3+ human T cells.</description>
