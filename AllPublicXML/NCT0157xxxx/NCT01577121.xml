  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To demonstrate if indomethacin associated to conventional treatment for preterm labor is
      useful to delay delivery and to improve neonatal morbimortality in women with preterm labor
      with high risk of intraamniotic inflammation
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Randomised patients would be assigned to receive indomethacin either placebo oral use(50 mg
      every 6 hours during 5 days) to evaluate the efficacy of indomethacin as complementary
      treatment to increase the gestational age at delivery in women admitted with preterm labor
      and intact membranes with high risk of intraamniotic inflammation, defined as a gestational
      age at admission less than 28.0 weeks or those women from 28-32.0 weeks with a sonographic
      cervical length less than 15 mm
