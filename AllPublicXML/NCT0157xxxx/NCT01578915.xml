  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Both population based surveys and more focused research studies indicate that increased
      numbers of sexual partners and partner concurrency contribute to increased risk for
      acquisition of sexually transmitted infection (STI), including HIV infection. However, unlike
      for men, both national and sub-population-based studies consistently find that the great
      majority of women with or without STIs report only 1-2 sex partners in the preceding year and
      that a minority of women acknowledge &gt; 3 sex partners over the same period, suggesting that
      this relatively small proportion of women with higher numbers of sex partners play a
      disproportionate role in sustaining community STI rates. Despite these observations,
      surprisingly little is known about women with increased numbers of sexual partners, the
      factors which contribute to increased partner number, and the potential for those factors to
      be intervened upon to reduce risk for STI. The implications of these facts for STI/HIV
      prevention efforts are profound. For instance, interventions that include the implication
      that target audiences have multiple sex partners might be dismissed as irrelevant by those
      with single partners. Conversely, interventions targeting women with multiple sex partners
      may be based on assumptions derived from data which, while representative of the general
      target audience, may not reflect relevant circumstances for the subset of women with higher
      numbers of partners.

      This study will begin to generate data that will provide critical information on this topic
      and help inform future development of STI/HIV interventions tailored to womens' individual
      circumstances and contexts. The investigators hypothesize that women with 4 or more sexual
      partners during the past year will report higher rates of depression and substance abuse
      (alcohol and drugs), higher rates of intimate partner violence, less social support, more
      non-vaginal sex, more same-sex contacts, and higher rates of STIs than women reporting only
      one sexual partner during the past year.

      The objectives of this protocol are: (1) To delineate factors that are important modifiable
      predictors of sexually transmitted infection (STI) risk in the context of increased numbers
      of sexual partners, comparing those participants with one sexual partner to those with 4 or
      more sexual partners during the past year. (2) To define the prevalence of infection with
      Chlamydia, gonorrhea, trichomoniasis, syphilis, genital herpes, and HIV in women reporting
      one sexual partner in the past year compared to women reporting 4 or more sexual partners
      during the past year.
