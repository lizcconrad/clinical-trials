      The investigators will study the efficacy of a novel cellular phone messaging system to
      communicate health information and facilitate early return to clinic after abnormal
      laboratory results in rural Uganda.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Among the challenges that complicate optimal health care delivery in rural settings is lack
      of communication between care providers and patients. Communication of abnormal laboratory
      results represents a particular challenge. Laboratory and other test results are often not
      reported until repeat visits weeks to months later. In the case of treatment failure, severe
      treatment complications, or evidence of opportunistic infection, such reporting delays likely
      result in adverse outcomes and potentially compromise future treatment options. The
      investigators propose to evaluate a novel strategy of communication using SMS text messaging
      to facilitate patient return to an HIV clinic in Uganda after critical laboratory results.

      The investigators will consent and enroll participants at the time of laboratory testing for
      cluster of differentiation 4 (CD4) count, viral loads, acid fast bacteria smears of sputum,
      among others. Those with abnormal results will be randomized to various messaging formats and
      receive text messages requesting a prompt return to clinic. For outcomes, the investigators
      will measure successful receipt and comprehension of messages, as well as proportion
      returning within 14 days of the abnormal laboratory test.

    <intervention_model_description>This is a quasi-experimental design study with two periods of study. The pre-intervention period serves as the control group. During the intervention period, participants received one of three message types to be informed of their test results: 1) a standard message informing their abnormal result, 2) the standard message protected by a PIN number code, and 3) a coded texted message &quot;ABCDEFG.&quot;
For our a priori hypotheses about the effect of receiving an SMS message on outcomes, we compared results for participants in the pre-intervention period with all those in the post-intervention period. This was a non-randomized intervention.
For our primary outcome (time to ART initiation) we assessed all participants with abnormal CD4 count results who were ART-naive at study enrollment. For our secondary outcome (time to clinic return) we looked at all study participants with abnormal CD4 counts.</intervention_model_description>

          <description>Eligible participants from a pre-intervention period (January-August 2012) prior to their receiving SMS messages about their laboratory test results. During the pre-intervention stage, clinicians completed eligibility forms for each participant, including confirmation of access to a cellular phone, district of residence, and selection of the abnormal result threshold for the cluster of differentiation 4 (CD4) test, which would prompt a request for an early return to clinic. Standard clinical forms were completed to collect data on sociodemographic and clinical characteristics. We also collected data on the laboratory result and result date, time from laboratory result to clinic return, and for antiretroviral therapy (ART) naive participants, time to ART initiation.</description>

For our a priori hypothesis, we aimed to test whether clinical outcomes, i.e. time to clinic return and time to ART initiation, were different in the pre-intervention and intervention period. This was a non-randomized allocation.
During the intervention period, clinicians used eligibility criteria identical to those used during the pre-intervention period, including selection of an abnormal cluster of differentiation 4 (CD4) count threshold to trigger the SMS and transportation reimbursement intervention.</description>

During the pre-intervention stage, clinicians completed eligibility forms for each participant, including confirmation of access to a cellular phone, district of residence, and selection of the abnormal result threshold for the cluster of differentiation 4 (CD4) test, which would prompt a request for an early return to clinic. Standard clinical forms were completed to collect data on sociodemographic and clinical characteristics. We also collected data on the laboratory result and result date, time from laboratory result to clinic return, and for antiretroviral therapy (ART) naive participants, time to ART initiation.</description>

For our a priori hypothesis, we aimed to test whether clinical outcomes, i.e. time to clinic return and time to ART initiation, were different in the pre-intervention and intervention period. This was a non-randomized allocation.
During the intervention period, clinicians used eligibility criteria identical to those used during the pre-intervention period, including selection of an abnormal cluster of differentiation 4 (CD4) count threshold to trigger the SMS and transportation reimbursement intervention.</description>
