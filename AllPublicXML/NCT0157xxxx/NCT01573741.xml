        Inclusion Criteria:Male patients, ages 18 to 65 years with a diagnosis of MDD, currently
        depressed or in a current major depressive episode of BD without psychotic features will be
        recruited into this substudy.

        Current or past history of lack of response to one adequate antidepressant trial,
        operationally defined using the Antidepressant Treatment History Form (ATHF); a failed
        adequate trial of ECT would count as an adequate antidepressant trial.

        Exclusion Criteria:Subjects with a history of DSM-IV drug or alcohol dependency or abuse
        (except for caffeine or nicotine dependence) within the preceding 3 months. In addition,
        subjects who currently are using oher antidepressant drugs in the 2 weeks prior to screen
        and must have a negative alcohol and drug urine test (except for prescribed
        benzodiazepines) urine test at screening.

        Serious, unstable illnesses including hepatic, renal, gastroenterologic, respiratory,
        cardiovascular (including ischemic heart disease), endocrinologic, neurologic, immunologic,
        or hematologic disease.

        Presence of any medical illness likely to alter brain morphology and/or physiology (e.g.,
        hypertension, diabetes) even if controlled by medications.

        Clinically significant abnormal laboratory tests.

        Subjects with clinical hypothyroidism or hyperthyroidism.

        Subjects with one or more seizures without a clear and resolved etiology.

        Presence of metallic (ferromagnetic) implants (e.g, heart pacemaker, aneurysm clip).

        Subjects who, in the investigator's judgment, pose a current serious suicidal or homicidal
        risk, or who have a MADRS item 10 score
