      This is a first-time-in-human, Phase 1, multicenter, open-label, single-arm, dose-escalation
      (3+3) study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, antitumor activity, PK, and immunogenicity
      of MEDI0639 in adult subjects with advanced solid tumors refractory to standard therapy or
      for which no standard therapy exist. Up to 63 subjects will be enrolled at approximately 3 to

    <measure>Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) of MEDI0639</measure>
    <time_frame>From the first dose of MEDI0639 to 21 days after the first dose</time_frame>
    <description>The MTD evaluation was based on the dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) evaluable population. DLT is defined as any Grade 3 or higher treatment-related toxicity that occurred during the DLT evaluation period (defined as the time from the first dose of MEDI0639 to 21 days after the first dose), except for National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) Grade 3 hypertension that could be controlled within 96 hours; Grade 3 symptomatic hypertension of greater than (&gt;) 180 millimetre of mercury (mm Hg) systolic or &gt;120 mm Hg diastolic or asymptomatic hypertension of &gt;200 mm Hg systolic or &gt;120 mm Hg diastolic was considered a DLT.</description>

    <description>An adverse event (AE) is any unfavourable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a study drug, whether or not considered related to the study drug. Treatment-emergent AEs (TEAEs) were events present at baseline that worsened in intensity after administration of study drug or events absent at baseline that emerged after administration of study drug, for the period extending to 90 days after the last dose of study drug. The AEs were summarized using Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) version 18.1.</description>

    <time_frame>From the first dose of MEDI0639 until the end of participation in the study. Maximum time frame across participants was 4 years.</time_frame>
    <description>A serious AE (SAE) is any AE that results in death (refers to an event, which risk of death at the time of the event; it does not refer to an event that may have led to death), is immediately life threatening, require (or prolong) inpatient hospitalization, results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity, is a congenital anomaly or birth defect, or is an important medical event that may jeopardize the participant or may require medical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above. Treatment-emergent SAEs defined as SAEs present at baseline that worsened in intensity after administration of study drug or SAEs absent at baseline that emerged after administration of study drug. The SAEs were summarized using MedDRA version 18.1.</description>
