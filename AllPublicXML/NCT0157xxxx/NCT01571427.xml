  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Past epidemiological studies have demonstrated that larger social networks, or more frequent
      social interactions, could have potential protective effects on the incidence of Alzheimer's
      Disease (AD). However, in those studies, indicators of social interactions were often broad,
      and included distinct elements that affected cognition and overall health. the investigators
      will examine whether conversation-based cognitive stimulations have positive effects on
      general, and domain-specific cognitive functions among the elderly. Face-to-face
      communication will be conducted through the use of personal computers, webcams, and
      user-friendly simple interactive Internet programs to allow participants to have social
      engagement while staying at their home and also for the cost effective execution of the
      study.
