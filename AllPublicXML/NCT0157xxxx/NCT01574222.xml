  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the dose that the vaccine can be given safely to
      patients when injected directly into the lung tumor, without any serious side effects.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Primary

      - to determine the safety, toxicity, and Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) of autologous dendritic
      cell-adenovirus chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 21 (CCL21) vaccine administered as an
      intratumoral injection in treating patients with stage IIIB, IV, or recurrent non-small cell
      lung cancer

      Secondary

        -  to determine the biologic and clinical responses to therapy

        -  to determine treatment-related toxicity using the NCI Common Toxicity Criteria

        -  to identify the maximum tolerated dose (MTD)

        -  to monitor patients for evidence of autologous dendritic cell-adenovirus CCL21
           vaccine-induced cytokines and antigen-specific immune responses

        -  to detect immune responses to tumor-associated antigens and vector

        -  to assess patients for objective signs of tumor regression (RECIST criteria)
