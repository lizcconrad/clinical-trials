    <textblock>
      The purpose of this protocol is to test the effects of the non opioid nefopam on experimental
      dyspnea and on the counterirritation (ie inhibition of one pain by another pain) induced by
      dyspnea in healthy subjects.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Dyspnea and pain share many features. One of them is the counterirritation phenomenon:
      defined in pain research as the attenuation of one pain by another pain. Dyspnea induced with
      inspiratory threshold loading (increased sense of work/effort ) has been shown to attenuate
      electrical pain as shown through nociceptive flexion reflex inhibition, or thermal pain, as
      measured with cortical evoked responses (laser evoked potentials-LEP).

      The investigators will study whether nefopam modulates the counterirritation of laboratory
      induced dyspnea in healthy subjects. The effect of nefopam on experimental dyspnea will be
      measured with a visual analog scale (VAS) and a validated multidimensional dyspnea profile
      (MDP). The effect of treatment on counterirritation will be measured by recording LEP
      obtained using a CO2 laser system. The amplitude of the N2-P2 component of the LEP is the
      main study outcome.
