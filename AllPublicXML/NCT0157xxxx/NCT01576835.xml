      This study will compare the results of a clinically ordered abdominal CT angiography to a
      research non-contrast MR angiogram (MRA). CTA is a &quot;gold-standard&quot; for identifying blockages
      in the kidney arteries or other blood vessel problems. CTA requires radiation and contrast to
      obtain useful images. Conversely, the MR abdomen technique being used for the study uses no
      radiation or contrast and is felt to be a safer option for individuals who have kidney
      problems. there is benefit to establishing non-contrast MRA as a clinically accurate test.

      REACT is a prospective, minimal-risk, and multi-center international trial. The purpose of
      the study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of non-contrast magnetic resonance
      angiography (MRA) for the diagnosis of renal artery stenosis (RAS).

      The current &quot;gold standards&quot; for diagnosing RAS are non-invasive 3D angiography with
      contrast-enhanced CTA/MRA or invasive X-ray angiography. All of these techniques require the
      use of an intravenous injection of either iodinated contrast material or gadolinium based
      agents.

      Iodinated contrast agents are contraindicated in patients with renal dysfunction and have
      increased risk of allergic reaction. Contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance angiography (MRA)
      with gadolinium has fewer risks associated with it, however, is currently contraindicated in
      patients with severe renal insufficiency because of concerns about developing a rare but
      often fatal condition termed nephrogenic systemic fibrosis (NSF).

      Non-contrast MRA techniques are felt to provide an avenue for safer, effective vascular
      imaging in patients both with and without kidney dysfunction. In this trial we propose to
      validate the contrast-free MRA technique, T-SLIP (time-spatial labeling inversion pulse), for
      diagnosing RAS. This study will compare T-SLIP to the reference standard of contrast-enhanced
      CTA and is designed to test its efficacy, reproducibility, reliability, and safety.
