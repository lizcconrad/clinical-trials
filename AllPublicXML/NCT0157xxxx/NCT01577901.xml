      Female volunteers, requiring to conduct a personal pregnancy test will use Clearblue Advanced
      Pregnancy test, following the instructions for use. The test will be conducted following both
      the instructions for the in stream method of sampling and the method of testing when a sample
      is collected into a container. The results will be compared to those achieved by the study
      technician.

      The study will compare the performance of the Clearblue Advanced Pregnancy Test, when used by
      consumers according to the instructions for use leaflet (IFUL), and by trained coordinators.
      Consumer testing will include both sampling in the urine stream and the testing method for
      urine collected into a container.

      In addition, the performance of the Clearblue Advanced Pregnancy Test will be compared to
      that of the currently marketed Clearblue Digital Pregnancy Test for the detection of
      pregnancy. In this comparison, both tests will be performed by a trained coordinator using
      the testing method for urine collected into a container on each volunteer's urine sample.

      The study will involve the recruitment of a cross-section of the target pregnancy test users
      in the United Kingdom, that is, women aged 18-45 who are seeking a pregnancy test. The study
      will aim to recruit at least 100 volunteers, a minimum of 30 (30%) of whom will be pregnant.

      Volunteers will use the Clearblue Advanced Pregnancy Test device using the urine stream
      method of sampling according to the product instructions. In addition volunteers will be
      asked to collect a urine sample from the same void and conduct a second Clearblue Advanced
      Pregnancy Test, using the testing method for urine collected in a container. The volunteer
      will then complete a study questionnaire on ease of use and leaflet comprehension. The
      questionnaire, urine sample and used devices will be retained by SPD for evaluation Agreement
      between the volunteer Pregnancy Test result and study coordinator Pregnancy Test result will
      be reported.
