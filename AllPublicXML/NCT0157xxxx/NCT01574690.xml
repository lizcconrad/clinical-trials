  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to establish the accuracy of a non-invasive device that uses
      near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) to estimate central venous pressure (CVP) comparing it to
      physical exam and invasive hemodynamic measurement via right heart catheterization (RHC).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Estimation of volume status is crucial when making treatment decisions for heart failure
      patients. Volume status is often assessed clinically by estimating the CVP, which is an
      estimate of right atrial filling pressure, by assessing the level of jugular venous
      distention. This method is quick and non-invasive but can be prone erroneous measurement due
      to human error and limitations secondary to body habitus and anatomical variation.

      RHC is a procedure used for invasive hemodynamic measurement commonly used in heart failure
      patients. CVP can be measured directly via RHC using a pulmonary artery catheter. It is
      considered the gold standard for measuring intra-cardiac filling pressures and calculation of
      cardiac output and pulmonary and systemic vascular resistance. The obvious downside of RHC is
      that is invasive, time consuming, and has many potential serious risks including vascular
      complication, pneumothorax, infection, arrhythmia, valvular damage, etc.

      A non-invasive, quick, and accurate way to estimate central venous pressure and oximetry
      could benefit patient care. NIRS is an optical imaging technology that has been proposed to
      estimate central venous pressure non-invasively. Our intent is to determine the accuracy of
      NIRS in assessment of CVP using the Mespere Venus device.
