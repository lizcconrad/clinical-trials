      This phase II trial studies how well tivantinib works in treating patients with recurrent or
      metastatic breast cancer. Tivantinib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of
      the enzymes needed for cell growth.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the activity of tivantinib (ARQ-197) as defined by 6-month progression-free
      survival (PFS) of participants with triple-negative metastatic breast cancer.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate objective response based on Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors
      (RECIST) 1.1 criteria.

      II. To evaluate c-Met and phospho c-Met expression in archival tumor tissue. (Exploratory)
      III. To evaluate the incidence of c-Met-positive circulating tumor cells at baseline.
      (Exploratory) IV. To evaluate the effect of ARQ-197 on serum markers relevant to c-Met
      pathway (hepatocyte growth factor [HGF] and vascular endothelial growth factor [VEGF]).
      (Exploratory) V. To evaluate phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) loss and PI3K mutations in
      archival tumor tissue. (Exploratory) VI. To evaluate proportion of participants with
      basal-like breast cancer. (Exploratory)

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive tivantinib orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on days 1-21. Courses repeat every
      21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients undergo
      blood sample collection at baseline and periodically during study for c-Met expression,
      relevant markers (HGF and VEGF), PTEN loss, and PI3K mutation analysis by fluorescent in situ
      hybridization (FISH) and immunohistochemistry (IHC). Archived tumor tissue samples are also
      analyzed.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 6 months.
