      In this study the investigators aimed at verifying whether consumption of a sheep cheese,
      naturally enriched in alpha-lipoic acid (ALA), conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) and vaccenic
      acid (VA), would modify the plasma lipid and endocannabinoid profiles in mild
      hypercholesterolemic subjects.

    <description>This study was a 3-week, randomized, single blind, controlled, cross over clinical trial. The subjects were randomly assigned to eat 90g/d of the control or enriched cheese for 3 weeks, with a cross over after 3 weeks of washout. The study included 5 visits: 2 screening/baseline visits at weeks −1 and 0, 1 end of intake of 90 g/d of cheese visit at week 3, 1 end of the first wash out visit at week 6, and 1 end of treatment after crossing over visit at week 9.
