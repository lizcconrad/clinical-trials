  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background. Preoperative anxiety is a common problem for patients who undergo surgical
      operations, being often associated with a number of negative behaviours during and after the
      surgical experience. Since drug treatments alone have frequently proved to be inadequate to
      reduce stress and anxiety in surgical contexts, in the last decades there has been an
      increased interest in non invasive complementary and alternative medical therapies (CAM),
      including music, relaxation, guided imagery, hypnosis, etc. that reduce pain and tension
      during pre and post operative phases. Virtual reality can be considered an innovative form of
      e-health-based CAM therapy having gained recognition as a means of attenuating pain during
      medical procedures. VR reduces distress and pain perception by providing a particularly
      intense form of immersive distraction that taxes the patient's limited attention capacity,
      resulting in the withdrawal of attention from the real, noxious, external stimulus with a
      subsequent reduction in pain and stress.

      Objective. The aim of this study is to test the efficacy of a small, portable and immersive
      virtual reality system to reduce anxiety in a sample of patients who underwent ambulatory
      surgical operations under local or regional anaesthesia.

    <description>The Green Valley, a non interactive, relaxing environment showing a mountain landscape around a calm lake is presented to the patient together with the relaxing music and soft sounds (birds' songs, the water flowing, etc). Having the impression of walking around the lake, patients can observe the nature and virtually seat on a comfortable deck chair, in order to become easily relaxed.
Patients were exposed to the virtual environment for the entire length of the operation.</description>
