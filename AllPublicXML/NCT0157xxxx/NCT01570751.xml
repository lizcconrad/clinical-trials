  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This trial is conducted in the United States of America (USA). The aim of the trial is to
      confirm the efficacy of IDeg (insulin degludec) versus IGlar (insulin glargine) in
      controlling glycaemia. Subjects are to continue their pre-trial metformin treatment.

    <measure>Change in Patient Reported Outcome (PRO) Scores From Baseline to the End of Each 16 Week Treatment Period</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 0, week 16 of each treatment period.</time_frame>
    <description>Changes in subjects quality of life and insulin device satisfaction were evaluated using the following PROs: the Short-Form 36 Health Survey version 2 (SF-36) and the Treatment Related Impact Measure-Diabetes Device (TRIM-DD). PRO total scores were measured from baseline to the end of each 16-week treatment period. Responses were measured on a scale of 0 to 100, where higher scores indicated a better quality of life and higher insulin device satisfaction on the SF-36 and TRIM-DD questionnaires, respectively.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in PRO Scores From the End of Treatment Period A Until After 4 Weeks of Treatment in Treatment Period B</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 16, week 20</time_frame>
    <description>SF-36 and TRIM-DD total scores were measured at the end of treatment A (week 16) and 4 weeks into treatment B (week 20). Responses were measured on a scale of 0 to 100, where higher scores indicated a better quality of life and higher insulin device satisfaction on the SF-36 and TRIM-DD questionnaires, respectively.</description>

    <description>Number of treatment emergent adverse events (TEAEs) from week 0 to week 16 of the randomised treatment periods. A TEAE was defined as an event that had onset date on or after the first day of exposure to randomised treatment and no later than 7 days after the last day of randomised treatment. TEAEs were attributed to the treatment given in the period in which the event occurred.</description>

      <pre_assignment_details>All subjects were on insulin glargine (IGlar, ≥ 65 U and ≤ 100 U/mL in 10 mL vials) treatment once daily (OD) administered subcutaneously at any time of day preferred by the subject for 16 week run-in period along with the daily pre-trial metformin dose.</pre_assignment_details>

Subjects were crossed over to IGlar without a wash-out period between the two treatment sequences. Subjects continued on metformin (pre-trial dose) throughout the trial.

        <description>Changes in subjects quality of life and insulin device satisfaction were evaluated using the following PROs: the Short-Form 36 Health Survey version 2 (SF-36) and the Treatment Related Impact Measure–Diabetes Device (TRIM-DD). PRO total scores were measured from baseline to the end of each 16-week treatment period. Responses were measured on a scale of 0 to 100, where higher scores indicated a better quality of life and higher insulin device satisfaction on the SF-36 and TRIM-DD questionnaires, respectively.</description>

          <description>Number of treatment emergent adverse events (TEAEs) from week 0 to week 16 of the randomised treatment periods. A TEAE was defined as an event that had onset date on or after the first day of exposure to randomised treatment and no later than 7 days after the last day of randomised treatment. TEAEs were attributed to the treatment given in the period in which the event occurred.</description>
