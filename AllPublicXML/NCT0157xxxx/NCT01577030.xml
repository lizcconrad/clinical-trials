  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Elevated systolic blood pressure is by far the largest single contributor to cardiovascular
      risks in middle-aged and older adults. Lifestyle modifications, including dietary
      modifications, are the first line approach for treating and preventing hypertension. The
      general aim of the proposed study is to address the efficacy of conventional dairy products
      as part of the normal routine diet for lowing arterial blood pressure in middle-aged and
      older adults with elevated blood pressure. The investigators hypothesize that the dietary
      intervention including dairy products will induce significant decreases in arterial blood
      pressure in this population. A secondary aim will be to test the hypothesis that these
      reductions in systolic blood pressure will be associated with increases in arterial
      stiffness/compliance and endothelial vasodilatory function.
