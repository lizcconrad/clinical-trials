  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main interest in this study is to investigate if it is possible to use strategies from
      Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT) to increase effectiveness of ordinary Cognitive Behavioral
      Therapy (CBT) for patients with anxiety disorders. For the patients included in this study,
      previous exposure-based treatment should have been unsuccessful (drop-out, relapse or lack of
      positive results after treatment).
