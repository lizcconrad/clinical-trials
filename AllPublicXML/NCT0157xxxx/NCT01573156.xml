  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Vascular Targeted Photodynamic therapy (VTP) with the Vascular Occluding Agent (VOA) WST11,
      may offer an alternative, providing tumour destruction via a minimally invasive approach. In
      this investigation, the investigators plan to use the WST11 VTP procedure to treat a
      predetermined small renal tumour targets. Patients will be given a general anaesthetic, to
      ensure immobility, and prevent discomfort during treatment sessions. Treated patients will
      then undergo surgical resection of their tumours, and the accuracy and reliability of tissue
      death with VTP will be assessed histologically. The aim of this proof of concept study is to
      demonstrate whether this modality has potential for a clinical role in the treatment of
      oncological kidney disease, either as an alternative to surgery, or where surgery is not
      feasible.

    <description>WST11-mediated VTP will consist of the combination of a single IV administration of WST11 at doses of 2 mg/kg, or 4mg/kg using 753 nm laser light at a fixed power (150 mW/cm) and energy (200 J/cm) delivered through percutaneous optical fibres. The fibres are introduced into transparent needles that are positioned in the areas of interest under CT image guidance. After a minimum of 3 patients at each drug dosage (2 &amp; 4 mg/kg) has been treated with a light energy of 200 J/cm, the general and local safety will be assessed. The safety results of the first 3 patients treated in each drug dose/number of fibres combination will be reviewed by the investigators prior to escalation to a higher drug dose/number of fibres combination.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Participant is willing and able to give informed consent for participation in the
             study.

          -  Male or post-menopausal female, aged 60 years or above.

          -  Lesions suspicious for renal cell carcinoma on triple phase CT that are &lt; 4cm in
             maximum diameter and suitable for surgical resection

          -  Participant must be in sufficiently good health to be suitable for general anaesthesia
             for both VTP treatment and subsequent surgical resection of tumour

          -  Subjects must have ≥ 1 evaluable tumours which can be visualized on diagnostic
             ultrasound. If more than one tumour exists, an index tumour will be nominated and
             treated (uncommon)

          -  Previous chemotherapy and / or biological therapy for cancer are permitted, but the
             subject should have recovered fully from the effects of these and any prior surgery
             (minimum of 28 days).

          -  Patients should not have received radiotherapy to the target area within the preceding
             12 months.
