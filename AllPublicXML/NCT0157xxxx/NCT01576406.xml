    <textblock>
      This study is designed to evaluate the potential effect of hepatic impairment on the
      pharmacokinetics and safety of crizotinib in advanced cancer patients. Advanced cancer
      patients with mild, moderate or severe liver dysfunction as well as patients with normal
      liver function will be enrolled in this study.

               1. The presence of at least one lesion, measuring ≥ 2 cm, with characteristic
                  arterial enhancement and venous washout in the setting of liver cirrhosis and/or
                  hepatitis B or C infection.

             first dose of crizotinib, and the liver function has stabilized as defined by 2
             measurements at least 5 days apart that put the patient in the same hepatic
             dysfunction stratum as defined in Section 3.

          -  Presence of gliomas and brain metastases only if neurologically stable and treated
             without ongoing requirement for corticosteroids for at least 2 weeks.

             determined by the local requirement, whichever is longer), or at least 5 half lives
             for drugs with half lives of 6 days or longer prior to initiation of crizotinib
             treatment. Any prior radiation (except palliative) or minor surgeries/procedures must
             have been completed at least 2 weeks prior to the initiation of crizotinib treatment.

             such as chronic diarrhea or ulcer disease) or psychiatric conditions, or laboratory
             abnormalities that may increase the risk associated with study participation or study
             drug administration or may interfere with the interpretation of the study results and,
             in the judgment of the investigator, would make the patient inappropriate for study
             entry.

          -  Patients who had prior major gastrointestinal surgery removing part of
