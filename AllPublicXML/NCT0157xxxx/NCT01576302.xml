  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Rumination is an upper gastrointestinal (GI) disorder characterized by the frequent
      regurgitation of recently ingested food. Very little is understood about the nature and
      treatment of this disorder. The act of regurgitation in rumination involves the opening of
      the upper esophageal sphincter and the muscular contraction of the abdomins rectus.
      Behavioral treatment of these symptoms is the clinical intervention of choice; however, only
      uncontrolled case documentation exists to support its effectiveness. However, an effective
      behavioral mechanism may be relaxation of the muscles. From a behavioral standpoint, muscular
      relaxation is incompatible with the necessary muscular contraction for rumination.

      To date, single case documentation and few designed single case studies have examined the
      clinical effectiveness of behavioral interventions for GI rumination. In the current study,
      the investigators seek to examine the effectiveness of two behavioral relaxation
      interventions for GI rumination through a treatment as usual paradigm (proposed N = 20). Our
      primary goals are to examine the clinical effectiveness of these interventions in symptom
      reduction at 1- and 3-month follow-up.
