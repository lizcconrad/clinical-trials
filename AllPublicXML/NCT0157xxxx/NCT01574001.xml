    <textblock>
      The primary objective of the present randomized controlled trial is to compare the
      effectiveness of three anti-smoking interventions of different intensities. It has been
      hypothesised that early follow-up visits facilitate post-stroke smoking cessation in patients
      hospitalized because of first-ever ischemic stroke.

      BACKGROUND: It is well known, that continued smoking after stroke increases the risk of death
      and stroke recurrence within a few years after the first stroke. Searching for more efficient
      methods of antismoking interventions is therefore justified.

      OBJECTIVES: The primary objective of the present study is to compare the effectiveness of
      three anti-smoking interventions of different intensities.

      DESIGN: Randomized, controlled trial.

      METHODS: Study participants will be recruited among patients of neurological clinics of
      Institute of Psychiatry and Neurology, hospitalized because of their first in a lifetime
      ischemic stroke. All stroke patients will be screened regarding their smoking status. The
      subjects will be patients smoking cigarettes immediately before their first-ever stroke, able
      to understand the research protocol procedures and able to cooperate during the
      investigation.

      Antismoking interventions will be based on the &quot;5A's&quot; method. Study participants will be
      randomized to one of three interventions differing in follow-up intensity.
