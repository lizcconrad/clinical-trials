  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main objective of this study is to identify and characterize subpopulations of cells with
      invasive capacity in colorectal cancer from primary tumor, blood and metastatic samples.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Secondary objectives include:

        -  Determine the intrinsic properties essential for the dissemination and chemoresistance
           of these cells capable of initiating tumors

        -  Identify a &quot;molecular signature&quot; for potential invasiveness and chemoresistance of cells
           initiating metastases.

        -  Describe the evolution of patients during 24 months of follow up and correlations with
           observed cellular profiles.

        -  Enrich the tumor bank of the institution.

          -  stage IV at diagnosis, surgical resection of the primary tumor and possibly of
             metastases proposed.

          -  Stage IV who have already undergone surgical excision of the primary tumor, and for
             whom metastasectomy is now proposed.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  The patient is participating in another study

          -  The patient is in an exclusion period determined by a previous study

          -  The patient is under judicial protection, under tutorship or curatorship

          -  The patient refuses to sign the consent

          -  It is impossible to correctly inform the patient

          -  Patients for whom surgical resection of the primary tumor is not considered as an
             option

          -  PStage IV at diagnosis, but metastasectomy is not considered as an option

          -  Patients with positive HIV, Hepatitis B or Hepatitis C serology
