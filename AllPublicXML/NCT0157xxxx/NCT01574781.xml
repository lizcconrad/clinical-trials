    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of this study is to collect maternal blood samples from pregnant women to
      develop a non-invasive prenatal diagnostic test based on fetal DNA isolated from maternal
      blood.

    <textblock>
      The investigators will seek to enroll subjects to collect the following types of samples:

        -  Up to 2,000 maternal blood samples along with their corresponding paternal blood, buccal
           or saliva samples (1,000 required for final analysis).

        -  Up to 200 maternal blood samples from carrying a fetus with a confirmed chromosomal
           abnormality or genetic disorder, along with their corresponding paternal blood, buccal
           or saliva samples (50 required for final analysis). For women who opted for termination,
           a genetic sample of the fetus may also be collected.

        -  Up to 1,000 buccal or saliva samples from paternal grandfathers and/or the biological
           father's brothers.

        -  Up to 1,000 cord, buccal or saliva samples from the born children.

        -  Up to 40 blood samples (20 non-pregnant females and 20 males) from healthy volunteers
           (20 required for final analysis)

        -  Up to 400 blood samples from women undergoing D&amp;C procedure following a miscarriage
           along with corresponding paternal blood (or buccal or saliva samples) (200 required for
           final analysis).

    <measure>Fetal chromosome abnormality from a maternal plasma sample</measure>
    <time_frame>From date of initial blood draw until the date of pregnancy end (miscarriage/termination) or time of birth, whichever came first, assessed up to 10 months</time_frame>
    <description>Maternal plasma will be drawn at the time at which they present while pregnant as long as they are at least 6 weeks along. Additional samples (for confirmation of chromosome makeup) may also be drawn on that fetus when fetal sampling is possible (termination, miscarriage) or on the child at or shortly after birth.</description>
