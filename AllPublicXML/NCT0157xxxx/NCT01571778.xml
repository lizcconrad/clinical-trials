  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The importance of healthcare worker hand hygiene in decreasing bacterial transmission between
      patients is well documented. Healthcare workers may don non-sterile gloves in routine care of
      patients, particularly for those patients known or suspected to harbor epidemiologically
      important microorganisms. Governing bodies currently recommend performing hand hygiene prior
      to donning gloves and after glove removal. The importance of hand hygiene post glove removal
      is well shown, however few studies exist to show utility of hand hygiene prior to donning
      gloves. In fact, data suggests that glove use is an impediment to hand hygiene and may reduce
      compliance with hand washing. In light of this and the fact that no evidence exists that
      washing hands BEFORE glove use is important, the aim of the study is to asses the utility of
      routine hand hygiene prior to donning non-sterile gloves before a patient contact.

    <description>In the &quot;No Intervention&quot; arm, healthcare workers will be assigned to first perform hand hygiene before donning non-sterile gloves prior to patient contact (usual practice). Samples will be obtained from hands prior to donning gloves and from the gloves after donning to determine total aerobic colony counts and to identify important hospital pathogens
In the Experimental arm, they will be instructed to don gloves without washing their hands as described.</description>
