      Is waist to hip ratio (WHR), waist circumference (WC), (as markers of visceral adiposity)
      associated with an increase in acidic and non acidic reflux as well as systemic inflammation
      involving esophageal mucosa, thereby increasing esophageal injury and predisposing to
      subsequent development of Barrett's esophagus (BE)?

  <detailed_description>

      The investigators will study 100 adult subjects over the age of 18 from the esophageal
      motility lab who are undergoing clinically indicated 24 hour acidity or basicity (pH)
      impedance and/or pH studies off acid suppressing medication.. These subjects will not have a
      prior history of esophageal surgery, or diagnosis of BE. The investigators will obtain
      consent for taking anthropometric measurements (Waist and hip circumference), and the results
      of their study. Only those subjects that successfully complete the 24 hour pH impedance
      studies will be included. Subjects will also undergo clinically indicated endoscopy. The
      investigators will consent these subjects to obtain 4 biopsies (bx) from the gastroesophageal
      (GE) junction and 4 bx from 5 cm above the GE junction. These bio-specimens will be stored
      for assessment of tissue injury (PGE2) and tissue immune-histochemistry of BE precursors
      (CDX1 and CDX2) at a later date.
