  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The EndoStim LES Stimulation System is an investigational device intended to improve the LES
      pressure and restore Lower Esophageal Sphincter (LES) function in individuals suffering from
      Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease (GERD).

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      EndoStim has developed an investigational medical device specifically designed to deliver
      electrical stimulation to the LES and has completed two clinical feasibility studies using an
      external version of the EndoStim stimulation system in fifteen subjects. In these two
      short-term studies, electrical stimulation resulted in significant increases in LES pressure.

      This study will further evaluate the safety of the procedure and its feasibility for use in
      this group of patients.

    <description>The EndoStim LES Stimulation System comprises three components: an electrical stimulation lead, an implantable pulse generator (IPG) and an external programmer.
The IPG and stimulation lead are to be implanted within the subject's body using conventional laparoscopy. The device programmer is to be used by the study investigator and/or a company technical representative.</description>
