    <textblock>
      The investigators objectives were developing mini dose five-drug cocktail regimen to evaluate
      potential drug-drug interactions associated with use of a cocktail of caffeine, losartan,
      omeprazole, dextromethorphan, and midazolam for simultaneous assessment of CYP1A2, CYP2C9,
      CYP2C19, CYP2D6, and CYP3A activities.
