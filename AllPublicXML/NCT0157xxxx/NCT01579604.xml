  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The cervical spine is most commonly injured, accounting for 53.4% of spinal injuries. More
      than 40% of all spinal injuries occur at either C4, C5 or C6 levels leading to variable loss
      of function in the upper extremities.

      Traditionally, patients sustaining a cervical spine injury were followed for 2 years to
      ensure that recovery had stabilized before offering upper extremity reconstruction. This type
      of reconstruction includes active muscle transfer, tendon transfer and joint fusion.

      Patients are most commonly assessed immediately at the time of injury. Muscle testing is
      commonly performed using Medical Research Grading System (MRC).

      Although complete neurologic stabilization may not be complete until 2 years post-injury, in
      the group with initial grade 0 muscle strength after the acute phase of injury, expectations
      of improved muscle strength to or beyond grade 3 after 4-6 months is minimal. And grade 3
      muscle strength is felt to be the minimum useful functional strength in a muscle group.

      The investigators propose an early nerve reconstruction approach to the tetraplegic patient
      with dysfunction of the upper extremity to augment the available tendon transfers.

      A comparative pilot study is proposed to determine the effectiveness of supinator branch to
      posterior interosseous nerve (PIN) transfer in 5 patients with cervical spine injury. Patient
      who fits inclusion criteria will be offered the opportunity to be involved in the study and
      reviewed at 6 months from injury. If the patient still has not regained Grade 3 power in
      finger or thumb extension, they will be randomized to be in a surgical group or non-surgical
      group.

      If informed consent is obtained, then surgery will be completed between 6-9 months from the
      patient's original cervical spine injury. The patient will be followed at regular intervals
      post-operatively with expectation of 18-24 month follow-up.

      Measures will be used pre and post-operatively for comparison. Measures will include MRC
      muscle grade (EDC), range of motion, Disability of the Arm, Shoulder, and Hand Questionnaire
      (DASH), and The Graded Redefined Assessment of Strength Sensibility and Prehension (GRASSP)
      (Kalsi-Ryan, 2011).

      There is currently no published data showing the effect of early nerve transfer on hand
      function recovery of the subset of tetraplegic patients, who have initial grade 0 muscle
      strength immediately after their injuries. We are interested in conducting a pilot study
      comparing the surgical group to the non-surgical group. A larger trial will be planned if the
      preliminary results show positive improvement in hand function recovery.

    <description>Under general anesthetic, the surgeon will make a cut on the back (dorsal) part of the forearm. The radial nerve will be identified and specifically the branches which control the supinator muscle and the remainder of the radial nerve (Posterior interosseous nerve or PIN). . The PIN branch will be stimulated to ensure that it is non-functional. Then, the supinator branch will be stimulated to ensure it is functioning and is appropriate for transfer. If appropriate, the supinator branch will be severed and connected to the EDC branch under the operating room microscope. After the surgery, the patient will be placed into a splint including the forearm and hand for 2-3 weeks.</description>
