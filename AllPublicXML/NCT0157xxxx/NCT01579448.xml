  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Data demonstrates that Shanchol™ (killed bivalent oral cholera vaccine) provides protection
      over 3 years and data regarding the protective efficacy over five years is anticipated for
      2012. Regardless at the end of five years, it may still be necessary to provide a booster
      dose or reimmunize with two doses to maintain protection in previously immunized populations.
      This study examines the immune protection and safety of providing a one and two dose boosting
      regimen of Shanchol™ given five years after the initial dose.

    <description>To confirm the safety of one and two dose boosting regimens Shanchol™ in healthy, non-pregnant subjects stratified by age within 28 days following dosing in each intervention group. Screening for number of adverse events (AEs)and severe adverse events (SAEs) will done on all study visits. Adverse events screened for include: diarrhea, fever, vomiting, abdominal pain, itching, rash, nausea, weakness, cough, vertigo, and dryness of mouth. SAEs are those which are incapacitating, preventing normal activities, including death and hospitalization.</description>

    <intervention_name>Shanchol™, oral cholera vaccine</intervention_name>
    <description>This killed, whole cell, bivalent vaccine will be presented as a creamish white suspension. Upon storage, a white sediment and clear supernatant may be observed. The recommended dose (1.5ml) of the vaccine must be administered orally. The primary vaccination schedule consists of two doses given at an interval of two weeks. After vigorous shaking of the vial, 1.5 ml should be poured into the mouth of the recipient, followed by water ad libitum. The vaccine can alternatively be administered with a disposable syringe (without needle) after removing the contents from the vial and squirted into the mouth of the recipient.
Vaccine is administered in 1.5 mL vials by mouth in 2 doses, given 2 weeks apart. The vaccine appears as a creamy white suspension.</description>
