  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Osteoprotegerin (OPG) is membrane bound in the immune system but can also be produced and
      secreted almost everywhere in the organism, so that it is mainly available in soluble form.
      So far, the OPG/RANKL/RANK system has been most intensively studied in bone. The binding of
      RANKL on its receptor RANK, which is expressed by osteoclasts, activates a number of
      osteoclastic cell functions. OPG also has a key function in the vascular system. Patients
      with coronary heart disease (CAD) have elevated OPG serum levels, probably as a sign of
      ischemic or inflammatory endothelial damage. Elevated OPG levels were also found in patients
      with advanced heart failure, whereby OPG correlated with pro BNP (brain natriuretic peptide)
      and was a predictor for cardiovascular morbidity and mortality.

      Our prospective cohort study will include 150 men (75 patients requiring surgery for CAD and
      a control group without coronary heart disease). The primary endpoints are the differences
      between the two groups in serum levels of OPG and RANKL, markers of bone metabolism
      (osteocalcin [OC], crosslaps [CTX], tartrate resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP5b), 25(OH)
      vitamin D [Vit D], 1.25(OH) vitamin D, parathormone [iPTH], endocrine parameters related to
      vascular damage (e.g. aldosterone, renin and cortisol) and bone mineral density. Metabolomic
      based biomarkers will be evaluated to explore the mechanisms behind OPG-RANKL linked CVD
      damage. In the patients further studies of the mRNA expression of OPG, RANKL, TRAP5b,
      arginine:glycine amidinotransferase (AGAT) and osteocalcin in bone (sternum sliver) and
      vascular wall (aorta, internal thoracic artery and the great saphenous vein) will be
      performed.

      A further study endpoint is the analysis of a causal coincidence between osteoporosis and CAD
      and the discrimination of possible key factors in the two entities. These will be determined
      by the correlation between the above-mentioned markers in serum and the expression in
      different vessels and in bone tissue.

      In addition to analysis of the degree of vascular sclerosis, the mineral content of the bone
      will also be analyzed in a subpopulation with quantitative backscattered electron imaging
      (qBEI) related to the degree of vascular sclerosis and bone mineral density. The ultimate
      goal of the analysis is the discrimination of the most sensitive predictive marker(s) for
      diagnosis and outcome of patients with CAD for the purpose of early diagnosis and primary
      prevention of the disease.

      CAD and osteoporosis are increasingly prevalent diseases that overlap. In both entities, OPG
      plays a role not only in pathogenesis but also as an outcome predictor. We aim to study the
      relevance of OPG concentration in serum but also in the vessel wall and the bone.
