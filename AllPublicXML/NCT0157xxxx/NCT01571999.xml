      This study will assess the safety and pharmacokinetics of inhaled GSK573719 and
      GSK573719/vilanterol combination in healthy subjects and in subjects with severe renal
      impairment. The results of the study will provide guidance on the use of this product in
      subjects with severe renal impairment.

      GSK573719 monotherapy and GSK573719/vilanterol combination are currently under development
      for the treatment of COPD. This study will assess the pharmacokinetics and safety of inhaled
      GSK573719 and GSK573719/vilanterol (VI) in healthy subjects and in subjects with severe renal
      impairment. Nine subjects with severe renal impairment (as defined by a Clcr&lt;30mL/min) will
      be recruited along with healthy control subjects (as defined by a Clcr&gt;80mL/min matched to
      the severe renal impairment subjects based on gender, ethnicity, body mass index (±15%) and
      age (±5 years)). The results from this study will provide guidance on the use of GSK573719
      and GSK573719/VI in severe renally impaired patients.

             grapefruit juice and/or pummelos, exotic citrus fruits, grapefruit hybrids or fruit

             vitamins, herbal and dietary supplements (including St John's Wort) within 7 days (or
             14 days if the drug is a potential enzyme inducer) or 5 half-lives (whichever is
             longer) prior to the first dose of study medication, unless in the opinion of the
             Investigator and GSK Medical Monitor the medication will not interfere with the study
             procedures or compromise subject safety.

        Renally Impaired Subjects:

          -  Life expectancy less than 3 months

             counter, which may in the opinion of the Investigator, interfere in any way with the
             study procedure or be a safety concern. In particular subjects taking medications that
             significantly inhibit P450 CYP3A4 (e.g. ketaconazole) must not be included in this
             study

          -  If in the opinion of an examining physician an unstable cardiovascular, pulmonary or
             hepatic condition is present, or any other medical condition which the investigator
             considers sufficiently serious to interfere with the conduct, completion, or results
             of this trial or constitutes an unacceptable risk to the subject
