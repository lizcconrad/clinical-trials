  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main objective of this study is to predict cartilage contact pressures in the hip after
      periacetabular osteotomy (PAO).
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      PAO was designed as a joint preserving surgical procedure to compensate for a shallow
      acetabulum by re-orienting the acetabulum into a position that provides better coverage of
      the femoral head. Although the overall theory that increasing load bearing area (improving
      coverage of the femoral head) results in reduced joint stress is intuitive, the complex bony
      surface may not behave in this manner. It is possible that joint stress may increase when the
      acetabulum is reoriented into a position that increases load bearing area if post-operative
      joint congruency is worse than pre-operative.
