  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patient with liver failure waiting for liver transplantation are often hospitalized and
      commonly supported in an intensive care unit prior to surgery. These patients are sick, and
      in addition to the complications of a failing liver, other organs such as the kidneys often
      fail as well. As a consequence, these patients are at an increased risk for complications
      related to their kidney failure during their liver transplantation procedure. One potential
      method to diminish the risk of these complications is to provide dialysis support to these
      patients during their liver transplantation in the operating theater in the form of
      continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT). While this is increasingly being performed and
      is theoretically appealing, there is very little information to support this practice. In
      addition, the use of CRRT during surgery is not entirely without risk. The investigators have
      performed two preliminary studies on the use of CRRT during liver transplantation and our
      data would strongly support the need to conduct further higher-quality studies to better
      evaluate its feasibility, safety and usefulness. Our proposed study is for a randomized trial
      comparing the use of CRRT during surgery with standard supportive care in sick patients with
      liver failure scheduled to receive a liver transplantation.
