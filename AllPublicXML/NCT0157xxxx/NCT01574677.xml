    <textblock>
      Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the second leading cause of cancer death in the United States and
      affects men and women almost equally. The United States Preventative Services Task Force
      (USPSTF) currently recommends screening with any of three options, which include fecal
      testing, flexible sigmoidoscopy, or colonoscopy.

      Screening for CRC with fecal occult blood testing (using a guaiac-based test) done annually
      or biennially has been shown to decrease mortality 15-33% primarily through detection of
      early stage cancer. Guaiac fecal occult blood testing (gFOBT) has a known positive balance of
      benefit and risk in screening populations, is the least expensive, and is the preferred
      method of screening in 30-55% of patients. The fecal immunochemical test (FIT) offers
      significant improvements over the gFOBT, most notably that it is easier to use (requires
      fewer samples and no dietary or medication restrictions) and is more sensitive than the gFOBT
      with respect to detecting both CRC and precancerous adenomas. As a result of improved test
      performance and usability, in 2008 multiple professional societies endorsed the use of four
      types of FITs for colorectal cancer screening. Kaiser Permanente currently uses the OC-Micro
      FIT as the fecal screening test in all regions.

      In recent years, intensive efforts have been undertaken to identify blood-based markers that
      may provide a promising alternative or supplement to fecal testing for non-invasive CRC
      screening. One method under development is to identify aberrantly methylated genes in cancer
      tissue through a blood test. Prior studies have explored those specific colorectal cancer
      genes that show the highest differences in methylation between the cancer and background
      genetic expression. Of these, methylation of the Septin 9 gene through a qPCR assay is
      relatively well studied.

      The proposed study aims to evaluate whether the Septin 9 biomarker may be used to supplement
      the OC-Micro FIT for colorectal cancer screening in such a way as to safely reduce unneeded
      colonoscopies. The population of interest for this study—those with a positive screening
      OC-Micro fecal immunochemical test—has a CRC prevalence of approximately 5%. Knowing how well
      Septin 9 can identify those without cancer prior to colonoscopy is important largely because
      colonoscopy, even when done diagnostically (e.g., after a positive FIT result), can cause
      serious complications.

        Eligible subjects will be identified at Kaiser Permanente Northwest (KPNW) and Kaiser
        Permanente Georgia (KPGA). KPNW is a nonprofit group-model HMO with membership of about
        485,000 in SW Washington and NW Oregon. KPNW includes 797 physician s and 395 allied
        clinicians (265 primary care providers). The member population base is similar to the local
        insured community in terms of age, gender, race, and ethnicity. About 19% of members are
        racial and ethnic minorities. Membership of KPGA has a racial and socioeconomic
        distribution similar to metropolitan Atlanta: ~ 50% Caucasian, 45% African American, 4%
        Hispanic, and 1% other races. 90 percent of the KPGA membership receives primary care at 12
        medical offices owned and operated by KPGA and through contracts with 125 community
        practices.
