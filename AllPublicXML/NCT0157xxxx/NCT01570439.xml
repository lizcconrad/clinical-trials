      Aim: To identify HLA-A1101-restricted peptide epitopes derived from novel Oncoantigens
      (URLC10, KIF20A, and CDCA1) applicable for Cancer Vaccine in Singapore.

      Methods: The panel of candidate peptides are synthesized and tested for their ability to
      induce peptide-specific CTL responses, in order to screen the peptide epitopes applicable for
      the cancer vaccination. Briefly, peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBLs) derived from
      HLA-A1101(+) healthy donors are taken and cultured in the presence of the each candidate
      peptide with recombinant IL-2 for 2 weeks, and then, re-stimulated with dendritic cell pulsed
      with the peptide following another 2 week culture. Thereafter, CD8(+) T lymphocytes were
      negatively selected with CD4-magnetic beads from cultured lymphocytes and tested for their
      peptide specificity employing enzyme-linked immunospot (ELISPOT) assay. These conditions are
      completely performed in in-vitro system. Importance in medicine: If one could identify the
      peptide epitopes from novel Oncoantigens, it is applicable for clinical trials of cancer
      vaccination.

      Benefits &amp; Risks : There is no risk except for the matter of venipuncture in each
      individuals.

      The ideal target molecules for cancer vaccination are thought to be selectively expressed in
      tumor cells, but not in the normal cells, with high frequent and homogenous expression within
      tumor. We have proved that novel Oncoantigens, URLC10, KIF20A and CDCA1, have these
      characters as ideal target molecules for the cancer vaccination and are highly expressed in a
      variety of tumor type such as gastric, lung, and pancreas cancer. Since HLA-A1101 haplotype
      is most frequent in Singaporean, it is essential to indentify the HLA-A1101-restriced
      peptides derived from these Oncoantigens to develop cancer vaccination.
