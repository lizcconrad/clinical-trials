      Volumetry is essential for the diagnosis and follow-up of patients with limb edema. The
      objective of this project is the validation of real-time reconstruction and calculation of
      limb volume using a 3D laser scanner.

      Water - displacement volumetry (water-filled boot) is the reference method with known
      accuracy and reproducibility, but is not commonly used in clinical practice because it is
      cumbersome, difficult, and time-consuming. The most commonly used method remains segmental
      limb perimetry with a tape measure, followed by volume calculation using the truncated cones
      formula, thus excluding de facts extremities (hands and feet) which can neither be likened to
      cones nor easily measured.

      Quantification limb volume and volume changes is essential for the diagnosis and follow-up of
      patients with chronic venous insufficiency or lymphedema, two very common pathological
      conditions. It is mandatory for the evaluation of therapeutic approaches.

      The present study will use an innovative technology of volume acquisition by freehand laser
      scanning with a hand-held camera with Quantification limb volume and volume changes is
      essential for the diagnosis and follow-up of patients with chronic venous insufficiency or
      lymphedema, two very common pathological conditions. It is mandatory for the evaluation of
      therapeutic approaches.

      The present study will use an innovative technology of volume acquisition by freehand laser
      scanning with a hand-held camera with real-time 3D reconstruction.

      Its advantages are non-contact, accurate and detailed quantification of edema, including
      extremities, allowing to assess the magnitude and topography of physiological, pathological,
      or treatment - induced volume changes. This approach will ultimately provide data that will
      used for designing personalized limb compression ortheses.

      In each subject and patient, limb volume will be measured once by water - displacement (WD)
      and twice by 3D laser scanning (3D), by 2 independent operators, in random order. In a
      subgroup of patients, measurements will be repeated in the morning and evening, twice a year
      (during winter and during summer) to estimate the nycthemeral and seasonal effects.

      Measurements will be performed in healthy subjects and in patients with chronic venous
      insufficiency or lymphedema.
