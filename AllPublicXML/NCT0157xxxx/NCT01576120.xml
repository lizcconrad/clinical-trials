      The proposed study is designed to evaluate Pillcam regimen in Crohn's disease patients, using
      the PillCam Colon system.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      1. Primary Scientific Objective Evaluate the effectiveness of the PillCam COLON 2 Prep
           Regimen in CD patients.

           Secondary Objective To evaluate safety of the PillCam™ COLON 2 procedure in CD patients

        2. Study Hypothesis Crohn's Disease may be pan-enteric in nature and can affect the small
           bowel, the colon or both. PillCam COLON 2 may be used for visualization of both SB and
           colon mucosa in Crohn's Disease patients. However, bowel prep is required in order to
           evacuate all fecal matter prior to the exam and in order to propel the capsule and
           complete its traverse through the entire GI track within examination time.

        3. The study is designed to evaluate the effectiveness of the prep regimen in terms of
           transit, excretion and cleansing in CD patients

      All end points will be evaluated within 4 months from end of enrollment.
