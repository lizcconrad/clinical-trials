    <textblock>
      This study aims to evaluate the safety and reactogenicity of a booster dose of
      Infanrix-IPV+Hib™ when administered to healthy Vietnamese toddlers at 12 to 24 months of age
      who were vaccinated previously against diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis diseases within
      their first six months of lives.
