  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overarching goal of this prospective cohort study is to test the hypotheses that greater
      severity of hyposmia is associated with increased risk of cognitive decline in PD and that
      worsening hyposmia parallels progressive cholinergic limbic denervation. To achieve the goals
      of this project, patients with PD without dementia or at-risk of dementia or with dementia
      will undergo longitudinal olfactory, cognitive and clinical testing for 2-4 years. AChE
      [11C]PMP or VAchT (vesicular acetylcholine transporter) [F18]-FEOBV PET will be performed
      both at study entry and at 2-years (± 6 months) follow-up. Brain MRI scans will also be
      performed at study entry and at 2-years (± 6 months) follow-up. Brain Beta-amyloid PET will
      be performed at study entry or at 2 years (± 6 months). Annual olfactory testing will be
      performed to better understand dynamic changes underlying the clinical and PET outcome
      measures.

      Smell functions will be assessed using a test battery of odor identification, odor memory,
      and odor discrimination tests.
