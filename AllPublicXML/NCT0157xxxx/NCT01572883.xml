  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether concomitant radiotherapy and trastuzumab
      (patients treated for early breast cancer) is really safe for the heart even years after
      treatment and if the investigators should use these two treatments concomitantly without
      additional harm.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators know from the studies, that were already published, that for HER2 positive
      early breast cancer patients in adjuvant treatment concomitant radiotherapy and trastuzumab
      is safe during the treatment. But there is no study with long term results of cardial
      function, especially combination of Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) and NT-proBNP.

    <measure>difference in LVEF (Left Ventricular Ejection Fraction)</measure>
    <time_frame>from one to six years from adjuvant radiotherapy for early breast cancer</time_frame>
    <description>we will compare LVEF (LVEF 1) measured before treatment with adjuvant Trastuzumab and concomitant Radiotherapy of breast/thoracic wall with LVEF (LVEF 2) measured at follow up (after adjuvant treatment) outpatient examination. We will then compare the difference in LVEF (LVEF 2-LVEF 1) measured in patients treated for left breast cancer with the difference in LVEF (LVEF 2-LVEF 1) measured in patients treated for right breast cancer</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>occurrence of cardiovascular events over time in both groups (RT for left/right breast)</measure>
    <time_frame>from 6 months to five years after adjuvant therapy with trastuzumab</time_frame>
    <description>occurrence of cardiovascular events over time in both groups (irradiated left / right breast) will be showed by the method of Kaplan-Meier. Groups will be compared with the log rank test.</description>
