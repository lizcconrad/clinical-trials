  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to learn about bowel preparation (cleansing) before laparoscopic
      hysterectomy and/or sacrocolpopexy. We are most interested in the ability of the surgeon to
      view necessary anatomy for the surgery, which will be assessed by a questionnaire completed
      at the end of your operation by the surgeon. We hypothesize that bowel preparation before
      laparoscopic hysterectomy will result in improved ability of the surgeon to view necessary
      anatomy for the surgery.

    <description>Half of the subjects will be randomized to a group that does mechanical bowel preparation with sodium phosphate enema. Those assigned to the mechanical bowel prep group will be asked to administer a single sodium phosphate enema rectally before going to bed the night before surgery. If stool is not clear in the morning, mechanical bowel prep subjects will administer one additional enema the morning of surgery. All subjects will be instructed to restrict their diet to clear liquids the day prior to their surgery and to continue this diet after midnight, save a small sip of water for medications in the morning.</description>
