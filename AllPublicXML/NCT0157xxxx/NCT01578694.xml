  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has proven to be one of the best ways to image articular
      cartilage. A tremendous amount of research has focused on cartilage imaging with an emphasis
      of early-osteoarthritis (OA) characterization. One of the techniques which has shown great
      promise is the imaging technique called T1ρ . The advantage of this pulse sequence is that it
      is sensitive to proteoglycans (PG), a major macromolecule degraded in OA. The study objective
      is to determine if T1ρ can acutely assess PG content in femoroacetabular impingement (FAI)
      which may allow physicians to differentiate between normal and early-OA cartilage states in
      FAI patients.

      Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is one of the best ways to image articular cartilage. One of
      the techniques which has shown great promise is the imaging technique called T1ρ (T1-rho).
      T1ρ is a modified pulse sequence from the standard T1 sequence used in the clinical MRI.
      Because the initial phases of arthritis occur at the molecular level, the main advantage of
      the T1ρ pulse sequence is that it is sensitive to proteoglycan. Proteoglycan is a molecule
      that is important to cartilage structure, and is lost as osteoarthritis develops. If we can
      show that this non-invasive tool can accurately assess cartilage damage and levels of
      proteoglycan, the clinical applications are numerous. The results can potentially help
      determine optimal surgical techniques and timing of surgical intervention to halt or slow the
      progression of arthritis, and will assist in the study of the effects of FAI and the success
      of the surgery performed to correct FAI.
