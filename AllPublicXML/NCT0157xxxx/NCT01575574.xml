      This is a study to evaluate the primovist as a new contrast agent useful to diagnostic of
      hepatocellular carcinoma

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators plan to define the imaging patterns of hepatocellular carcinoma in
      cirrhotic patients when studied with gadoxetic acid magnetic resonance imaging including the
      dynamic phase and the hepatobiliary phase at 10 and 20 minutes after contrast injection and
      to evaluate the usefulness of liver magnetic resonance imaging with gadoxetic acid in the
      differentiation between benign and malignant nodules in the cirrhotic liver. To determine the
      diagnosis and clinical significance of the infracentimetric additional nodules detected in
      the hepatobiliary phase

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  more than 18 years old

          -  patient with diagnosis of liver cirrhosis Child Pugh A-B

          -  Patients without previous hepatocellular carcinoma in whom ultrasound detects a
             suspicious hepatic lesion; solitary solid and well-defined nodule between 10 and 20mm

          -  patients in whom diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma is a clinical need prior to
             treatment indication

          -  patient that agree to participate signing informed consent form

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with poor liver function who would have undergone transplantation even
             without hepatocellular carcinoma diagnosis (Child-Pugh C)

          -  patients with previous diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma

          -  patients with significant comorbidities that could prevent the optimum therapeutic
             decision in case of positive diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma

          -  patients with severe clotting alterations that contraindicate the fine-needle biopsy
             -Patients with chronic kidney disease or glomerular filtration rate &lt; 30 ml/min
