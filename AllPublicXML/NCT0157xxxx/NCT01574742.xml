    <textblock>
      A single center, open label study assessing the feasibility, safety and therapeutic effect of
      Minocycline in adult patients with diagnosis of unipolar depression. Up to 30 patients
      diagnosed with unipolar depression that are in a current depressive episode. The patients
      will be of all racial, ethnic and gender categories, ranging from 18 to 68 years of age, and
      have HDRS-21≥20. All subjects will continue to take their treatment with antidepressant
      medications for the duration of the study. All subjects are prescribed minocycline 200 mg/day
      orally (2X100 mg) for the first 3 days. than, all subjects are prescribed minocycline 400
      mg/day orally (2X200 mg) from day 4 until termination visit (day 35). The primary objective
      of this study is to assess the therapeutic effect of Minocycline in unipolar depression.

      The secondary objectives of this study are to assess the therapeutic effect, the feasibility
      and safety of Minocycline in unipolar depression.
