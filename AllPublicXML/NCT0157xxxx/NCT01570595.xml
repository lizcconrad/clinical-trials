  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the first web-based cessation program developed
      expressly for people living with HIV who smoke tobacco. Main study goals are (1) to evaluate
      the website's feasibility (i.e., recruitment, adherence, retention, and satisfaction) and (2)
      to complete a prospective, randomized controlled trial comparing the efficacy of the online
      program to standard care with a primary outcome of 3 month point-prevalence abstinence.

      Positively Smoke Free on the Web is the first web-based cessation program developed expressly
      for people living with HIV (PLWH) who smoke tobacco. It is a resource that is ready for
      clinical use, but its feasibility and efficacy have yet to be studied. Main study goals are
      (1) to evaluate the website's feasibility (i.e., recruitment, adherence, retention, and
      satisfaction) in a cohort of 69 PLWH smokers, and (2) to complete a prospective, randomized
      controlled trial comparing the efficacy of the online program to standard care (total N =
      138) with a primary outcome of 3 month point-prevalence abstinence.

    <measure>24-hour Point-prevalence tobacco abstinence</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>The proportion of each group achieving 24-hour point prevalence abstinence at Visit 3 (i.e., abstinence on or around Day 121 - 3 months post-Quit Day in the Intervention condition) by exhaled carbon monoxide, an accepted method for biochemical validation of abstinence.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Degree of Participation in Intervention (Feasibility)</measure>
    <time_frame>3 Months (duration of intervention)</time_frame>
    <description>Intervention feasibility will be assessed using variables such as total # of logins, # of sessions viewed, # of web pages viewed, # of mouse clicks on interactive features, total time logged on to the site (automatic logoff occurs after 30 minutes of inactivity), proportion completing the final study visit, program satisfaction survey results, and total # of reminder phone calls/texts placed by clinic staff.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Knowledge and Behavior Change</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 0, 42, 121</time_frame>
    <description>Validated measures will be used to collect data on continuous abstinence, number of quit attempts, and current daily cigarette consumption. Composite quit indices will be analyzed, especially the combination of 3 month continuous abstinence with expired carbon monoxide (ECO) confirmation. We will also analyze results of validated measures that have known associations with cessation outcomes (tobacco knowledge, depression, anxiety, motivation to quit, self-concept, perceived risks/benefits, self-efficacy, and decisional balance).</description>

    <description>This group will be asked to participate in the online quit smoking program. At their first visit, they will be given an ID number to log in to the quit smoking program, and they will complete their first log in with the research assistant. The online program is made up of 8 separate online sessions that are supposed to be completed approximately once per week. Each sessions is written to take an average reader 15-30 minutes to complete. The entire program is meant to be completed in 7 weeks. At the first visit, participants are asked to provide an email address and/or cell phone number so reminders can be sent, by email or text message, to complete the sessions. If participants are late completing a session, they may receive call from clinic staff as a reminder.</description>
