  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cardiovascular disease continues to be the principal cause of death in the world. At present,
      the risk factors for cardiovascular disease continue to appear at an earlier age permitting
      prevention activities and the promotion of healthy habits to focus on children. Numerous
      studies have shown that these factors can be controlled in children through school-based
      interventions. At the same time, data shows that there is a persistence of unhealthy
      lifestyles (ie sedentary lifestyles, the use of tobacco, etc…) that begin in childhood and
      are perpetuated until adulthood. Therefore, the acquisition of healthy lifestyles should
      begin as early as possible. The SI Program for Preschool Education is an intervention that is
      both school and home based designed to improve the habits, knowledge and attitudes in four
      key areas: Food (diet), Physical Activity, Knowledge of the Body and Managing Emotions. This
      intervention will be implemented in children from three to five years of age, in their
      parents and in their teachers. To evaluate the efficacy of this intervention, the principal
      aim of the phase of evaluations is to quantify the behavior changes in the three
      groups/populations mentioned. The evaluation has been designed according to the controlled
      intervention model, in which twenty-four schools from the Community of Madrid will be
      randomized to implement the Program si! for Preschool Education or to function as control
      schools.
