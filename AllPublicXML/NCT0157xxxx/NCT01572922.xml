    <textblock>
      Iron overload is a severe complication of multiple blood transfusions. As the body has no
      physiologic mechanism for clearing iron, repeated transfusions cause iron accumulation in
      organs and lead to iron toxicity. Accurate assessment of iron overload is paramount to
      quantify excessive iron accumulation and to monitor response to iron chelation therapy.
      Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) methods have been used to noninvasively measure hepatic iron
      concentration (HIC). Although MRI-based measurements of transverse relaxation rates (R2 and
      R2*) accurately predict biopsy-proven HICs below 15 mg Fe/g, previous studies have shown that
      their precision is limited for HICs above 15 mg Fe/g and inaccurate above 25 mg Fe/g. Current
      R2* gradient-echo (GRE) MR techniques fail occasionally for very high iron overloads (HIC ~
      15-25 mg Fe/g) and always for massive iron overloads (HIC &gt; 25 mg Fe/g) because R2* is so
      high that the MR signal decays before it can be measured accurately.

      Overall accrual: 235 (200 patients, 35 healthy volunteers)

      Purpose: To determine if a new MRI (UTE) can measure the amount of iron in the liver of
      people with large amounts of iron and compare the results with the same patient's liver bx.
      Estimated patient accrual is 200. It is estimated that 41 of these patients will have
      clinical indication for liver biopsy.

      Volunteer purpose: To test the UTE MRI to ensure it runs correctly before testing in
      patients, collect data of normal values of iron in the liver in people without iron overload
      using the UTE MRI and to compare the current MRI (GRE) with the UTE. The UTE MRI will give an
      accurate value of liver iron in patients with large iron deposits in the liver, therefore
      providing an accurate means to diagnose, monitor, and provide treatments for participants.
      This new technology will impact the care of many different populations with iron overload,
      such as patients with sickle cell disease and thalassemia. Estimated accrual for healthy
      volunteers is 35.

      The MIDAS study is a prospective and non-therapeutic study that will test a new MRI technique
      for the assessment of iron overload in the liver: the newly developed ultra short echo time
      (UTE), R2*-UTE. The R2*-UTE technique, developed by St. Jude investigators from the
      Department of Radiological Sciences, will be first tested in healthy volunteers for
      feasibility and implementation of the technique. The technique will then be tested in
      research participants, who will have both the R2*-GRE and the R2*-UTE techniques performed,
      in addition to a liver biopsy for liver iron quantitation if clinically indicated.
      Quantitation of liver tissue iron will be done at Mayo Clinic Laboratory in Rochester,
      Minnesota. Healthy volunteers will not have a liver biopsy performed but only the two types
      of R2*-MRI techniques will be performed and compared.

      Primary Objective:

        -  To test the association of hepatic iron content (HIC) measured with the newly developed
           1.5T R2*-UTE technique and HIC quantified by liver biopsy in subjects with iron
           overload.

      Secondary Objectives:

        -  To explore the relationship between 1.5T R2*-UTE and 1.5T R2*-GRE measurements in
           healthy volunteers and in subjects with iron overload.

        -  To explore the relationship between 1.5T R2*-UTE measurements with iron studies (serum
           iron and transferrin saturation) in subjects with iron overload.

    <description>The liver biopsies will be obtained as indicated by good clinical management practice, and it is expected that most research participants who will receive the liver biopsy will have an inconclusive result by the R2*-GRE method. The iron quantification assessed in liver biopsies will be correlated with the R2*-UTE signals. If the correlation is sufficiently high, then a statistical model relating HIC by R2*-UTE and liver biopsy values will be established, as was done for R2*-GRE.32</description>

    <description>Ultra short echo time (UTE) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Study participants will undergo an MRI examination of the liver on a 1.5T MRI and a 3T MRI scanner each. Because liver biopsy metal needle fragments could interfere with the MRI measurements, the MRI exams will always precede liver biopsy. Multi-echo GRE sequences will be used to acquire images with increasing TEs. Images of the liver will be obtained in transversal slice orientation through the center of the liver at the level of the origin of the main portal vein. At equivalent slice locations R2*-UTE scans will be performed.</description>

    <description>Indications for liver biopsy include, but are not limited, to the need to quantify liver tissue iron and the need to obtain histopathological information of the liver tissue. Liver biopsies will only be performed if clinically indicated and will be done only once per patient. The technique to be used is coaxial percutaneous (transcapsular) technique; however, a coaxial transjugular technique may be performed in subjects with increased bleeding diathesis, since it is associated with less hemorrhagic risk. Healthy volunteers will not undergo liver biopsy.</description>
