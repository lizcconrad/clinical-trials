      After successfully quitting smoking, smokers with schizophrenia are vulnerable to relapse
      shortly after discontinuation of treatment. The purpose of this study was to assess the
      feasibility and effectiveness of a 12-month relapse prevention intervention in recently
      abstinent smokers with schizophrenia. Subjects participated in a 12-week smoking cessation
      phase, where they received nicotine replacement therapy, bupropion SR 150mg bid, and
      cognitive behavioral therapy. If, at the end of the 12 weeks, they were able to demonstrate 1
      week of abstinence, they continued in the relapse prevention phase of the study, where they
      continued to receive nicotine replacement therapy, bupropion SR 150mg bid, and cognitive
      behavioral therapy.
