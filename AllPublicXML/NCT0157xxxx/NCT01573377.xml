  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is one of the most common endocrinopathies in
      reproductive-age women, and it affects 5-7% of this group. It is characterized by disturbed
      menstrual cycle, ovulatory dysfunction and hyperandrogenism. Over 40% of PCOS women might
      become the patients with impaired glucose tolerance or type 2 diabetes. It has been confirmed
      that insulin resistance (IR) is a common feature in PCOS and adipokines might play roles in
      the pathogenesis of IR and PCOS, because these adipokines have wide-ranging effects on
      carbohydrate and lipid metabolism.

      The present clinical trial intends to compare the effects of metformin and oral
      contraceptives on PCOS patients, focusing on the insulin sensitivity, ovulation, and
      menstrual cycle etc. The investigators also aim to study the effects of metformin on serum
      adipokine levels(such as pigment epithelium-derived factor, progranulin etc.)in PCOS
      patients.
