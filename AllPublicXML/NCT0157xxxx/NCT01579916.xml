  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This prospective annual release study was designed to assess the safety of a trivalent
      influenza virus vaccine using two new strains recommended for the 2012-2013 influenza season
      not previously contained in the trivalent intranasal FluMist vaccine.

      Three hundred healthy adults will receive a single dose of vaccine or placebo and will be
      followed for 180 days after study vaccination.

    <textblock>
      This prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled release study will enroll
      approximately 300 healthy adults 18 to 49 years of age. Eligible subjects will be randomly
      assigned in a 4:1 fashion to receive a single dose of trivalent vaccine or placebo by
      intranasal spray. Randomization will be stratified by site.

      This study will be conducted at 3 sites in the United States of America. Each subject will
      receive one dose of investigational product on Study Day 1. The duration of study
      participation for each subject is the time from study vaccination through 180 days after
      study vaccination.
