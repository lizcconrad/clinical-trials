  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study drug, GSK356278, is a possible new medicine for the treatment of Huntington's
      disease. Huntington's disease, which is often called HD, is caused by a faulty gene that is
      passed down through families. HD causes damage to nerve cells in the brain which causes them
      to waste away. As the damage progresses patients develop symptoms that affect every aspect of
      life. HD reduces people's ability to walk, talk, think, communicate and causes uncontrolled
      movements. GSK356278 may slow down the progression of damage to nerve cells in people with HD
      and help with their ability to think.

      GSK356278 was well tolerated when it was given as a single dose to healthy people. In this
      study we want to see what effects, both good and bad, GSK356278 has in people when it is
      taken every day. During the study we will look at about 3 different doses of GSK356278 in
      about 36 healthy people. The study will also look at how GSK356278 tablets behave in the body
      after it is swallowed (this is called pharmacokinetics). The study will also look at effects
      of GSK356278 on the body (this is called pharmacodynamics). The study will help to design
      future clinical studies with GSK356278.

             supplements (including St John's Wort) within 7 days (or 14 days if the drug is a
             potential enzyme inducer) or 5 half-lives (whichever is longer) prior to the first
             dose of study medication, unless in the opinion of the Investigator and GSK Medical
             Monitor the medication will not interfere with the study procedures or compromise
             subject safety.

          -  History of sensitivity to any of the study medications, or components thereof or a
             history of drug or other allergy that, in the opinion of the investigator or GSK
             Medical Monitor, contraindicates their participation.

          -  Where participation in the study would result in donation of blood or blood products
             in excess of 500 mL within a 30 day period.

          -  Unwillingness or inability to follow the procedures outlined in the protocol.
