      Objectives: The purpose of this study is to find out if a new program can help kidney cancer
      survivors (KCS) increase their physical activity (PA) and improve their quality of life
      (QoL).

      Methods: Fifty KCS will be recruited from a previous study using the Alberta Cancer Registry.
      Participants will undergo submaximal exercise testing, a physical function test and measures
      of height and weight, which will be completed at baseline and the end of the physical
      activity program (at 12 weeks). Participants will also complete questionnaires on PA and QoL
      at the baseline, after the supervised portion of the program (at 4 weeks), and at the end of
      the entire program (at 12 weeks). Following baseline assessments, participants will be
      randomly assigned to either: (1) supervised physical activity plus traditional exercise
      counseling or (2) supervised physical activity plus behavioural counseling. Participants will
      be asked to attend six individual supervised exercise and counseling sessions over a 4-week
      period with a PA specialist that eventually tapers to a home-based program by the end of the
      program.

      Implications: The investigators hope that this PA intervention for KCS is feasible and
      results in meaningful improvements in health outcomes that can be translated to public health
      practice.

  <detailed_description>

      Background: Despite the reported benefits of physical activity (PA), the majority of cancer
      survivors are not meeting public health PA guidelines. Most PA intervention studies have used
      supervised exercise and demonstrated benefits. However, these studies have also found that PA
      declines significantly after the supervised intervention is completed. Consequently,
      interventions are needed to ensure longer term adherence after short term supervised exercise
      interventions. Although several of behaviour change interventions have supported positive
      increases in PA, no study to date has examined the effects of adding behavioural counseling
      to a standard supervised exercise program and no study has focused on kidney cancer survivors
      (KCS).

      Objectives: The primary purpose of the Trying Activity in Kidney Cancer Survivors (TRACKS)
      Trial is to compare the effects of a supervised physical activity program plus traditional
      exercise counseling (SPA) versus a supervised physical activity plus motivationally-enhanced
      behavioural counseling (SPA+BC) on change in self-reported moderate/vigorous PA between
      baseline, post-intervention, and 12-week follow-up among KCS. The secondary outcomes are
      changes in self-reported quality of life (QoL), body composition (anthropometric measures),
      cardiorespiratory fitness, physical function, and motivational constructs from the Theory of
      Planned Behaviour (TPB) constructs.

      Methods: The study will pilot a two-armed, randomized controlled trial of 50 KCS. KCS will be
      recruited from a previous study using the Alberta Cancer Registry. Eligibility will include:
      a) between 18-80 years of age, b) diagnosed with Stage I-IIIa kidney cancer, and g)
      interested in increasing their physical activity. Following the screening procedure and prior
      to randomization, participants will undergo submaximal exercise testing on a treadmill to
      ensure that they are able to exercise safely at a moderate-to-vigorous intensity.
      Randomization will occur after all baseline measurements have been completed. The goal of the
      intervention, based on current public health recommendations, will be to gradually increase
      all participants by at least 60 minutes of moderate intensity PA or 30 minutes of vigorous
      intensity PA to a minimum of 150 minutes of moderate intensity PA or 75 minutes of vigorous
      intensity PA per week. Participants in both arms will be provided with six individual
      supervised exercise sessions with a physical activity specialist that will taper to an
      unsupervised program by the end of the intervention. Participants assigned to the SPA group
      will be given an individualized prescription at a moderate-to-vigorous intensity. They will
      also receive traditional exercise counseling to teach proper PA technique, how to monitor
      intensity, and to progress PA safely and effectively to achieve the public health PA
      guidelines. For the SPA+BC group, participants will receive the same supervised PA sessions
      with the addition of six individual &quot;face-to-face&quot; behavioural counseling sessions with a
      physical activity specialist. These behaviour counseling sessions will include training in
      behavioural strategies to promote the adoption and long-term maintenance of PA. Measurements
      for the primary and secondary endpoints will be assessed at baseline (pre-intervention), 4
      weeks (post-intervention), and 12 weeks follow-up.

      Conclusion: The study results can be used to determine if a behavior change intervention for
      KCS based on the TPB results in potentially meaningful improvements in PA and selected health
      outcomes.

    <description>A modified version of the validated Leisure Score Index (LSI) from the Godin Leisure-Time Exercise Questionnaire (GLTEQ), that has been extensively validated, will be used to assess PA behavior. Participants will be asked to recall their average weekly frequency and duration of light (minimal effort, no perspiration), moderate (not exhausting, light perspiration), and vigorous (heart beats rapidly, sweating) PA that lasted at least 10 minutes and was done during free time in the past month.</description>

    <description>Participants will be provided with six individual supervised exercise sessions with a physical activity specialist that will taper to an unsupervised program by the end of the intervention. Over the 4-week period, this group will be required to attend two sessions per week for weeks 1-2, and one session per week for weeks 3-4 at fitness centre. In order to achieve the physical activity guidelines established by the current public health recommendations, additional unsupervised sessions will be prescribed.

    <description>In addition to the same supervised PA sessions as the SPA group, participants in this group will receive six individual &quot;face-to-face&quot; behavioural counselling sessions with a physical activity specialist. These counselling sessions will be combined with the supervised PA sessions, and will be provided directly following the supervised PA session. Counselling strategies will be based on the TPB and will target the unique benefits of PA for kidney cancer survivors, strategies for making PA enjoyable, for overcoming barriers, for including social support from family and friends, time management, self-monitoring, goal setting, and planning.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

        Screening evaluations will be conducted on interested participants and eligibility criteria
        include the following: a) between the ages of 18 to 80 years of age, histologically
        confirmed kidney cancer (Stage I-IIIa); b) ability and willingness to effectively
        communicate with the study coordinator and complete all questionnaires involved in the
        study in English; c) able to attend the supervised PA sessions and not planning to be away
        for three consecutive days for the duration of the program; and d) interested in increasing
        their PA by at least 60 minutes of moderate PA or 30 minutes of vigorous PA. Following the
        screening procedure and prior to randomization, consenting participants that are deemed
        eligible will undergo submaximal exercise testing to ensure that they are able to exercise
        safely at a moderate-to-vigorous intensity. Two stages of the treadmill test must be
        successfully completed with acceptable heart rate and blood pressure responses before any
        remaining baseline tests will be conducted including a physical function test,
        anthropometric testing, and PA behaviour, quality of life, and determinants questionnaire.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        The researchers can remove the participants from the study early for reasons such as a
        cancer recurrence, doctor feels that the participant is unable to participate in a physical
        activity program and/or participate in the follow up fitness testing, and/or two stages of
        the treadmill test cannot be completed.
