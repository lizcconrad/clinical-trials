  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare the levels of Substance P in saliva, in patients with
      severe chronic low back pain and in subjects without it. In addition, to explore a possible
      cutoff point, in order to define normal and pathological levels of Substance P in saliva. The
      ultimate objective would be to design a measurement method for use in routine clinical
      practice.

    <description>After taking the sample, the saliva will be transferred via a pipette to a clean tube which will be labeled with the subject's name, the date and the hour. Once a month the tubes will be sent to the collaborating laboratory for analysis.</description>

    <criteria>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients referred to the Kovacs Back Pain Unit in Palma de Mallorca for chronic low
             back pain

          -  A pain level of 6 or greater on the PI-NRS scale (0=no pain, 10= worst pain possible)

          -  Seen at the Unit between 9 and 13 hours (due to the circadian rhythm of Substance P in
             saliva and to avoid great variability in the results)

        For healthy subjects:

          -  Volunteers with no pain (anywhere)

          -  That in the past year have had no more than 40 days with pain, and no episode of more
             than 7 days of continuous pain.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects with pain that is additional to or different from chronic low back pain
