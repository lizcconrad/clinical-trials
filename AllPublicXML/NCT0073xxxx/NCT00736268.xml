  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is an NIH-funded clinical trial conducted at Duke University Medical Center and
      Ohio State University. The purpose of this study is to examine the effects of a
      telephone-based, care-giver assisted, coping skills training (CST) program in patients with
      Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) and their caregivers. This may help COPD
      patients and their caregivers to deal better with the stress of lung disease. This study will
      test 3 primary hypotheses: 1) That enhanced CST will be more effective in improving quality
      of life compared to a Usual Medical Care plus COPD education and symptom management control
      group; 2) That enhanced CST will be associated with better medical outcomes (i.e., greater
      survival and fewer COPD-related physician visits or hospitalizations) compared to Controls
      over a follow-up period of up to 4 years; and 3) That improvements in quality of life and
      survival will be mediated by increased functional capacity and better coping.

      This proposed study builds upon our prior research by: a) adapting and refining our CST
      protocol, which was effective in improving psychosocial adjustment in patients awaiting lung
      transplantation, to a broader population of patients with COPD who are not immediate
      candidates for lung transplantation; b) enhancing our intervention to improve functional
      capacity, reduce somatic symptoms, and improve survival; c) examining the impact of CST on
      medical expenditures; and d) including caregivers in an enhanced CST intervention.

      Overall, 746 participants (patients and caregivers) were consented for participation into
      this study from both Duke University Medical Center and Ohio State University. Of these, 326
      patients were randomized and participated in the study intervention along with 252 consented
      participants who acted as a caregiver; in total 578 participants (patients and caregivers)
      were involved with the study intervention.

    <description>Telephone-based Enhanced Coping Skills Training (CST) intervention will systematically train participants (and caregivers) in the use of coping skills for symptom management (i.e. activity pacing, pleasant activity scheduling, communications, relaxation, goal setting, imagery, calming self-statements, problem solving, and preventing and dealing with setbacks). Participants in the CST condition will receive 12 weekly 30 minute telephone sessions followed by 2 bi-weekly booster sessions for training in symptom management strategies. Participants and caregivers will be evaluated at baseline, at the conclusion of 4 months of treatment, and at annual follow-up intervals for up to 4 years.</description>

    <description>COPD usual care plus education and symptom monitoring control condition will participate in a weekly 15 minute phone call followed by 2 bi-weekly phone calls, assessing their health status and providing them with support and COPD education. COPD Education topics include types of lung disease, oxygen use, medication management, preventing infection, managing daily activities, and nutrition. Participants and caregivers will be evaluated at baseline, at the conclusion of 4 months of treatment, and at annual follow-up intervals for up to 4 years.</description>
