  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a three-arm randomized controlled trial to implement and evaluate the relative
      effects of: 1) clinic-focused intervention; 2) combined patient- and clinic-focused
      intervention, and 3) usual care on the provision of colorectal cancer (CRC) screening in
      primary care clinics. The study will also examine the relative effects of the intervention
      conditions on secondary behavioral outcomes (e.g., clinician-patient discussions about CRC
      screening) and on intermediate outcome measures of attitudes, beliefs, opinions, and social
      influence surrounding CRC screening among patients, clinicians, and clinical staff. The
      target population includes average-risk patients aged 50-75 years, clinicians, and clinical
      staff within the primary care setting. The intervention will be implemented within primary
      care clinics in two managed care organizations (MCOs). The intervention targets the following
      CRC screening modalities: fecal occult blood test (FOBT), flexible sigmoidoscopy,
      colonoscopy, and double contrast barium enema.

    <description>Clinic-focused intervention: The clinicians and clinical staff in each of the clinics will be scheduled for training sessions. The provider trainings will be designed for clinicians and clinical staff and will be conducted in at least two separate sessions of approximately 3 hours total duration. The sessions will be scheduled to accommodate the clinic schedule, but will be held with no more than 1 month between them. Participants in clinic training sessions will receive continuing education credit.</description>

    <description>Clinic-focused and patient focused intervention: The clinic focused-intervention as described in Arm 2 will be combined with a patient-focused intervention.
Patient focused intervention: CRC education packets, based upon previously developed CDC CRC patient education materials, have been adapted for each study site. These CRC educational packets will be mailed to average-risk patients aged 50-80 years who are due for CRC screening (based on electronic records) and who schedule a non-acute ambulatory care visit in clinics assigned to the patient-focused intervention. A cover letter signed by the patient's physician will be included with each packet. The packets will be mailed approximately 1 week before the medical appointment.</description>

    <description>The clinic-focused intervention consists of CRC screening training sessions for clinicians and clinical staff. The provider training sessions will include the presentation of CRC screening statistics and information, and will be heavily interactive and skills-based. The provider training sessions will also focus on the provision of tools for improving clinical staff- and clinician-patient interactions about CRC screening and for office system changes/improvements to identify eligible patients and to track screening.</description>

    <description>This arm will combine the clinic-focused intervention and the patient-focused intervention. The clinic-focused intervention consists of CRC screening training sessions for clinicians and clinical staff as described in Arm 2. The patient-focused intervention includes sending a CRC screening education packet (CDC-developed educational text tailored for use within the study sites), accompanied by a letter from the patient's physician, to patients meeting study inclusion criteria.</description>
