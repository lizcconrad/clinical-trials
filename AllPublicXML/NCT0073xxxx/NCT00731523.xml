    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare the pharmacokinetics of FTY720 and its metabolites in
      patients with severe renal insufficiency and in matched, healthy volunteers. This study will
      allow a better understanding of the effects of renal insufficiency on the disposition of
      FTY720.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        Healthy Subjects:

          -  Subjects must have a calculated glomerular filtration rate (GFR) by Cockcroft-Gault
             Equation â‰¥80 mL/min.

        Severe Renal Impaired Patients:

          -  Patients not on dialysis with severe renal failure with a creatinine clearance &lt; 30
             mL/min as determined by Cockcroft-Gault Equation.

          -  Renal function should have been stable within the 3 months prior to study start.

          -  Patients with diabetes and/or hypertension who are in otherwise in good health may be
             included. However patients with diabetes must not have clinical evidence of
             gastropathy or enteropathy.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        All Subjects/Patients:

          -  History of multiple and recurring allergies or allergy to the investigational
             compound/compound class being used in this study

          -  History of retinal macular edema.

          -  History of any significant cardiovascular events such as myocardia infarction,
             valvular disease, angina, ischemic heart disease, dilated cardiomyopathy, dysrhythmia.

          -  History of immunocompromise, including a positive HIV (ELISA and Western blot) test
             result.

        Severe Renal Impaired Patients:

          -  Use of any highly potent CYP3A4 inhibitor (e.g. erythromycin, ketoconazole,
             itraconazole) within 2 weeks prior to dosing.

          -  Use of beta blocker therapy within two (2) weeks prior to dosing.
