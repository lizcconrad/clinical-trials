        Patients who present to the investigator's clinic, who meet the inclusion criteria will be

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patient age &lt; 21 years

          -  Male or female

          -  Diagnosis of classical Scheuermann's Kyphosis (3 successive vertebrae wedged 5 degrees
             or more, +/- end plate deformities) or idiopathic structural Kyphosis (rigid
             structural kyphosis without classic Scheuermann's Kyphosis findings).

          -  for which surgical treatment is recommended to prevent progression of the curvature or
             to correct trunk deformity (unacceptable cosmesis) - any deformity magnitude.

        OR

          -  for which surgical treatment is not being undertaken (and alternate treatment, i.e.
             bracing, or observation) is being pursued for any curve magnitude of clinical concerns
             of Scheuermann's Kyphosis.

          -  Inclusion Criteria for Anterior Release (for those surgeons performing anterior
             release surgery): Deformity magnitude = any degree and any other criteria defined by
             the individual surgeon.

          -  Posterior disc herniation is not an exclusion criteria from being in the study, only
             from being in the Posterior surgery group - these patients will be defaulted to
             Ant/Post Surgery.

          -  Only patients that have had a pre-op MRI performed as a part of their routine care,
             should be included in this study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Previous operated Kyphosis, Scoliosis or Spondylolisthesis

          -  Neuromuscular co-morbidity

          -  Post laminectomy kyphosis
