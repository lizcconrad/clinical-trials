  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This trial is a pivotal trial to validate the use of a 13 C labeled substrate called
      methacetin and the BreathID automatic breath testing system, for determination of cirrhosis
      in patients with chronic liver disease.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with chronic liver disease who have a recent biopsy will be offered a breath test.
      Correlation will be shown between histology and breath test in determining cirrhosis.

    <measure>Number of Subjects With Likelihood of Cirrhosis Based on &quot;Hepatic Impairment Score&quot; (HIS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Study day 1 after a 1 hour test</time_frame>
    <description>&quot;Hepatic Impairment Score&quot; (HIS) is a score based on breath test parameters and demographic parameters of the subject being tested. A HIS value greater than 0.14 would mean that the subject is likely to be cirrhotic (based on biopsy result as the gold standard). The HIS is a probability score,i.e. ranges from 0 to 1, where 0 would mean the lowest probability of having liver cirrhosis and 1 would be the highest probability of having liver cirrhosis. This would be compared to the actual biopsy result of cirrhosis detection as the gold standard.</description>

    <measure>AUC of ROC (Area Under Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve)</measure>
    <time_frame>At study day 1 after 1 hour test</time_frame>
    <description>The AUC represents a summary measure of the ROC curve and is the accuracy of the HIS in detecting cirrhosis compared to the gold standard of biopsy.</description>

        <title>Number of Subjects With Likelihood of Cirrhosis Based on &quot;Hepatic Impairment Score&quot; (HIS)</title>
        <description>&quot;Hepatic Impairment Score&quot; (HIS) is a score based on breath test parameters and demographic parameters of the subject being tested. A HIS value greater than 0.14 would mean that the subject is likely to be cirrhotic (based on biopsy result as the gold standard). The HIS is a probability score,i.e. ranges from 0 to 1, where 0 would mean the lowest probability of having liver cirrhosis and 1 would be the highest probability of having liver cirrhosis. This would be compared to the actual biopsy result of cirrhosis detection as the gold standard.</description>
