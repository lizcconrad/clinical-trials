  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Knee Osteoarthritis (OA) is one of the most frequent causes of physical disability and pain
      among adults. Recent evidence suggests that shorter exercise programs that incorporate
      kinesthesia, balance and agility (KBA) techniques may result in more rapid symptom relief and
      functional improvements in comparison to traditional therapeutic exercise. KBA techniques are
      designed to improve dynamic joint stability by using a series of activities which challenge
      balance and coordination. To determine the independent effects of KBA training on functional
      abilities, it is necessary to test it as a training program unto itself. The proposed
      clinical trial is designed to do this by using three training groups: KBA only; lower
      extremity strength training only; and a combination of the two. The total exercise time and
      intensity of each condition will be approximately equal. A non-exercise group will control
      for any effects related to the testing procedures and the passage of time. Community
      volunteer men and women age 50 and over with physician diagnosed symptomatic knee OA will
      participate.
