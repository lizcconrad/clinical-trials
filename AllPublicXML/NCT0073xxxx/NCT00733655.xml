    <textblock>
      Hereditary Haemorrhagic Telangiectasia (HHT, also known as Osler-Weber-Rendu Syndrome) is an
      disease that leads to the development of dilated and fragile blood vessels. We propose to
      obtain small skin samples from patients with HHT in order to analyze the samples using
      histological methods, and study the properties of vascular endothelial cells derived from
      patients. We hypothesize that these cells will show altered growth, migration, and protein
      synthetic differences when compared to normal endothelial cells, which may be confirmed in
      single time point analyses in histological samples. We anticipate that that these findings
      may help to explain aspects of the HHT disease phenotype.
