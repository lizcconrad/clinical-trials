  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a study involving a 2 week run-in phase followed by an 8 week double blind treatment
      phase. During the run-in phase, subjects receive Flixotide®. In the treatment phase subjects
      will be randomised to one of the four treatment groups and will receive either high dose
      FlutiForm® and Foradil® plus Flixotide® placebo or low dose FlutiForm® plus Foradil® and
      Flixotide® placebo or Foradil® plus Flixotide® and FlutiForm® placebo or Flixotide® and
      FlutiForm® plus Foradil® placebo. Efficacy will be assessed by lung function tests, asthma
      symptoms, sleep disturbance due to asthma and rescue medication use. Safety will be assessed
      by adverse events, lab tests, ECGs and vital signs.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion criteria:

          1. Male or female subjects at least 18 years old.

          2. Females less than one year post-menopausal must have a negative urine pregnancy test
             recorded at the screening visit prior to the first dose of study medication, be
             non-lactating, and willing to use adequate and highly effective methods of
             contraception throughout the study. A highly effective method of birth control is
             defined as those which result in a low failure rate (i.e., less than 1% per year) when
             used consistently and correctly such as sterilisation, implants, injectables, combined
             oral contraceptives, some IUDs (Intrauterine Device, hormonal), sexual abstinence or
             vasectomised partner.

          3. Known history of severe persistent, reversible asthma for ≥ 6 months prior to the
             Screening Visit characterised by treatment with ICS at a dose of ≥ 500µg fluticasone
             or equivalent.

          4. Demonstrated a FEV1 of ≥ 40% to ≤ 80% for predicted normal values (Quanjer et al.,
             1993) during the Screening Visit (Visit 1) and Randomisation Visit (Visit 3) following
             appropriate withholding of asthma medications (if applicable).

               -  No β2-agonist use on day of screening.

               -  No use of inhaled combination asthma therapy on day of screening.

               -  Inhaled corticosteroids are allowed on day of screening.

          5. Documented reversibility of ≥ 15% in FEV1 in the screening phase.

          6. Demonstrated satisfactory technique in the use of the study medication.

          7. Willing and able to enter information in the electronic diary and attend all study
             visits.

          8. Willing and able to substitute study medication for their pre study prescribed asthma
             medication for the duration of the study.

          9. Written informed consent obtained.

             Inclusion criteria required following run-in:

         10. Subject has used rescue medication for at least 3 days AND had at least one night with
             sleep disturbance (i.e., sleep disturbance score of ≥ 1) OR at least 3 days with
             asthma symptoms (i.e., a symptom score of ≥ 1) during the last 7 days of the run-in
             period.

        Exclusion criteria:

          1. Near fatal or life-threatening (including intubation) asthma within the past year.

          2. Hospitalisation or an emergency visit for asthma within the 4 weeks before the
             screening visit.

          3. Known history of systemic (injectable or oral) corticosteroid medication within 1
             month of the Screening Visit.

          4. Known history of omalizumab use within the past 6 months.

          5. Current evidence or known history of any clinically significant disease or abnormality
             including uncontrolled coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure, myocardial
             infarction, or cardiac dysrhythmia. 'Clinically significant' is defined as any disease
             that, in the opinion of the Investigator, would put the subject at risk through study
             participation, or which would affect the outcome of the study.

          6. In the investigator's opinion a clinically significant upper or lower respiratory
             infection within 4 weeks prior to the Screening Visit.

             inhibitors, astemizole (Hismanal), quinidine type antiarrhythmics, or potent CYP 3A4
             inhibitors such as ketoconazole within the past week.

         13. Current use of medications other than those allowed in the protocol that will have an
             effect on bronchospasm and/or pulmonary function.

         14. Current evidence or known history of hypersensitivity or idiosyncratic reaction to
             test medications or components.

         15. Subject has recieved an investigational drug within 30 days of the Screening Visit (12
