      RATIONALE: Opioids lessen pain caused by cancer. It is not yet known whether opioids are more
      effective when given together with or without olanzapine in treating cancer pain.

      PURPOSE: This randomized clinical trial is studying opioids to see how well they work when
      given together with or without olanzapine in treating patients with moderate to severe cancer
      pain.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  To assess the analgesic effect of olanzapine when administered in combination with
           opioids in patients with cancer pain.

        -  To assess the opiod-sparing effect of olanzapine vs placebo.

        -  To assess the effect of olanzapine on opioid adverse effects.

      OUTLINE: Patients undergo opioid titration with a step 3 opioid to maintain a less than 4/10
      level of pain (on a 0-10 numeric pain rating scale) to establish a opioid starting dose. When
      the pain rating increases, patients are randomized to 1 of 3 treatment arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients receive oral opioid and oral placebo once daily for 4 weeks.

        -  Arm II: Patients receive oral opioid and 2.5 mg oral olanzapine once daily for 4 weeks.

        -  Arm III: Patients receive oral opioid and 5 mg oral olanzapine once daily for 4 weeks.

      Patients undergo quality of life assessments at baseline and three times weekly by
      questionnaires using a scale from 0-3 and pain assessments periodically by Brief Pain
      Inventory, Edmonton Symptom Assessment Scale, Linear Analogue Scale Assessments, and
      Mini-Mental State Examination.
