  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hyperglycaemia has been repeatedly associated with risk of mortality and morbidity in the
      intensive care unit (ICU). The evidence currently available is in favour of a 'normal â‰¤ 6.1
      mmol/l' level for blood glucose control in ICUs according to two large randomized control
      trials of Van den Berghe G and is not supportive of J. Miles's viewpoint in this debate. In
      this study, the investigators would like to evaluate that the target of blood glucose level,
      whether is a normal level (80-110 mg/dL) or another level (140-160 mg/dL), should be set for
      the reduction of perioperative mortality and complications.

    <textblock>
      Our previous prospective randomized clinical trial suggested that the postoperative
      morbidities were reduced by tight glycemic control of a normal level for blood glucose using
      artificial pancreas. However, the most feared one is hypoglycaemia, which, when severe and
      prolonged, may cause convulsions, coma and brain damage, as well as cardiac arrhythmias.
      Recently, Ven den Berghe G report that the development of accurate, continuous blood glucose
      monitoring devices, and preferably closed-loop systems for computer-assisted blood glucose
      control in the ICU, will help to avoid hypoglycaemia. In our study, no hypoglycemia showed in
      more than 100 patients who performed perioperative tight glycemic control by artificial
      pancreas.
