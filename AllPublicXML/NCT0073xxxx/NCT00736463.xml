      Summary:

      Background: There is a lot of interest in the function and role of HDL to prevent and
      mitigate atherosclerosis in patients who are at or near LDLc targets. Statins have variable
      effects on HDLc which are accentuated in patients with a low baseline HDLc. Higher doses of
      statins are being used more commonly in practice based on newer outcomes studies which find
      greater benefits of the higher doses compared to lower or standard doses. This study is
      testing FDA approved dosages of two commonly used statin medications.

      Design: The study is designed to examine the effects of 80mg simvastatin and 80mg
      atorvastatin on HDLc concentrations. Serum will be saved for a hopeful collaborative effort
      with investigators at the U. of Washington who are able to do more advanced testing of HDL
      particle functionality. Based on the first 13 patients studied at Indiana University, the
      effects of these statins on HDLc concentrations vary greatly. It is unknown what impact these
      concentration changes have on the functionality of the particles however. A meta-analysis of
      4 prospective trials published in JAMA in 2006 found that increasing HDLc with statins was
      independently associated with regression of atherosclerosis as measured by intravascular
      ultrasound.

      Patients: Patients with low HDLc will be the primary population recruited. Exclusion criteria
      include interacting medications, pregnancy, baseline hepatic disease or other illnesses which
      would put patients at increased risk of statin side effects.

      The subject will be asked to come in for all study visits in a fasting state (only water for
      past 12 hours). Both blood pressure and pulse will be checked at the screening visit as well
      as all study visits. The baseline (screening) visit will include the consenting process and
      completion of the first section of the Data Collection Sheet to further screen for
      appropriate inclusion and exclusion criteria. Subjects who are on a statin will need to have
      an 8-week wash out period prior to beginning the trial. The subject and their primary
      provider must agree to the washout.

      At the screening visit for subjects not taking a statin drug, 13 ml of blood will be drawn.
      The blood will be processed by the OCTRI Core Laboratory staff. All of the lipid parameters
      (complete lipid profile, apoB, apoA1, hs-CRP) will be tested at the OHSU lipid core lab. Some
      of the blood collected will be sent to the OHSU core lab for testing of ALT as well as for
      obtaining the long-term storage sample. Blood samples will be frozen and stored on the 14th
      floor of the CHH building in the laboratory of the Oregon State University School of
      Pharmacy. Samples will be batched for processing (see sample processing below). The lipid
      profile and ALT from the screening visit will be processed within approximately one week. If
      necessary laboratory parameters meet inclusion and exclusion criteria, the subject will be
      scheduled for the first study visit. Encapsulated placebo will be given to the subject to
      take in between the screening and first study visit.

      At the screening visit for subjects taking a statin drug, the study will be described and
      consent to enroll will be obtained but no bloodwork will be performed. Subjects will be given
      an encapsulated placebo to take for an 8 week washout period. At the second screening visit,
      blood will be drawn to ascertain baseline laboratory values as described above for subjects
      not on a statin drug. The subject will then be scheduled for their first study visit 2 weeks
      later.

      The other laboratory parameters (hs-CRP, apoA1 and apoB) and all future bloodwork which is
      not necessary for the ongoing conduct of the trial may be batched and processed periodically.
      The ALT from the second study visit (after first course of study medication) will be
      processed prior to the third study visit to confirm that ALT remains less than 3 times ULR.
      If ALT is elevated (&gt;105 IU/L) at the second study visit, the subject will be discontinued
      from the study and the subjects primary physician notified. Additionally, if the subject
      complains of myopathy which is felt to be consistent with possible drug-induced myositis, a
      creatine phospho-kinase (CPK) test will be ordered. Consistent with the product package
      insert (PI) for both atorvastatin and simvastatin, therapy will be stopped and the subject
      discontinued from the study if CPK is greater than 10X the ULR.

      At the first study visit, the subject will be randomized by the OHSU Research Pharmacy to
      receive either 6 weeks of 80mg atorvastatin or 6 weeks of 80mg of simvastatin. The subject
      will be scheduled for follow-up 6 weeks from the trial entry date and asked to bring the
      investigational drug vial back at the next visit. The subjects will also be given a diary to
      record their daily dose of medication taken. A urine pregnancy test will be done at the first
      and third study visit in all women who are not post-menopausal as defined as at least 6
      months without menstruation over the age of 50. Women who do not meet the post-menopausal
      criteria, are sexually active and not on any form of birth control will be counseled to begin
      and remain on birth control for the duration of the trial. Inability or unwillingness to
      comply with chosen birth control measures will result in exclusion from the trial. Women of
      child bearing potential not on birth control at the time of the screening visit who are
      willing to begin birth control will be scheduled for their first study visit not sooner than
      6 weeks after their screening visit to allow time for implementation of chosen birth control.
      Subjects who are on hormone replacement therapy (HRT) will be allowed to enroll provided that
      their regimen is stable and not expected to change during the study period. Subjects will be
      informed that if their regimen does change during the study, they will need to be removed
      from the study.

      At the second visit, the appropriate section of the Data Collection Sheet will be completed,
      a pill count of remaining drug doses will be done and 13 ml of blood will be drawn and
      processed as previously outlined. The subject will then be scheduled for follow-up in 6 weeks
      and leave without any study medicine.

      At the third visit, the appropriate section of the Data Collection Sheet will be completed
      and 13 ml of blood will be drawn and processed as previously outlined. The subject will be
      given a 6 week supply of the second medication (as previously determined by first
      randomization scheme) and scheduled for follow-up in 6 weeks.

      At the fourth and final visit, the appropriate section of the data collection sheet will be
      completed and 13 ml of blood will be drawn and processed as previously outlined.

      In between study visits, the study staff will contact subjects by phone to remind them of
      their next appointment and ask about any adverse effects or other problems that the subject
      may be experiencing. In the event that the phone number of record becomes inactive, a letter
      will be sent to the address of record.
