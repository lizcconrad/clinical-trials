    <textblock>
      An investigation will be made of the combined impact of insecticide-treated nets and
      intermittent preventive treatment with amodiaquine + sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine on malaria
      morbidity in children in Burkina Faso and Mali.Three rounds of treatment will be given during
      the malaria season in one year and the follow-up will be extended into the second year by
      passive surveillance.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The trial will be conducted in 6000 children in Burkina Faso and Mali in 2008 and 2009. Each
      site will enroll 3,000 children. All children will be allocated a long lasting
      insecticide-treated net and randomized to receive to treatment (amodiaquine +
      sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (AQ+SP)) or placebo (AQ-placebo + SP-placebo. Treatment will be
      administered over 3 rounds during the high malaria transmission season, with one month
      interval between rounds. Full course treatment of AQ and SP will be administered on each
      occasion. Treatment will not be given in the second year. Passive surveillance of malaria
      will be implemented for the monitoring of malaria morbidity and to assess whether children
      who received intermittent preventive treatment (IPT) are at increased risk of malaria.
      Adverse events will be monitored during each round of IPT administration. To assess the
      effect of IPTc on the prevalence of malaria infection, a random sample of 150 children will
      be visited every week during the high malaria transmission period. This number will be
      increased to 300 during the low transmission season, but the survey will be reduced to
      monthly visits. Baseline prevalence of genetic markers of resistance to SP and AQ will be
      estimated. A second cross-sectional survey will be conducted at the end of the malaria
      transmission season to assess the effect of IPT on the prevalence of genetic markers of
      resistance to SP and AQ, on the prevalence of anaemia and on nutritional indicators.
