  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Nexagon™ is a novel compound that promotes wound healing by temporarily disrupting cellular
      communication at the wound site, thereby promoting accelerated healing, reducing inflammation
      and pain. This randomized double-blind study will assess the safety, tolerability and
      clinical effect of Nexagon™ when applied to skin wounds created by punch biopsy in healthy
      volunteers. 43 healthy, fair-skinned males and females between ages 18-40 will be enrolled.
      Subjects will be reviewed again at 3 months and 9 months for follow-up safety assessments and
      wound appearance evaluation.

             study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Subjects who have pigmented skin due to an increased susceptibility to hypertrophic
             and keloid scarring (Fitzpatrick Classification Level IV - VI).

          2. Subjects who are known hypertrophic or keloid scar formers.

          6. Subjects with any other skin lesion sites or a chronic or currently active skin
             disorder, which would adversely affect the healing of the acute wounds or which
             involve the areas to be examined in this study.

          7. Subjects taking or who have taken prescribed drugs in the 30 days prior to Day 0, in
             particular, topical or systemic steroids, anti-inflammatories, anti-coagulants,
