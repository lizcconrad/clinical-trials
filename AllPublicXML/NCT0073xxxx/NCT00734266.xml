  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The hypotheses of this study are that:

        -  Production and release of inflammatory substances called leukotrienes are increased
           during heart surgery with use of a heart-lung machine in humans;

        -  The increase in these leukotrienes levels after heart surgery is higher in patients with
           bronchitis and/or emphysema than in patients without previous history of lung disease;

        -  Levels of leukotrienes are directly correlated with worsening of lung function during
           and after heart surgery.

      In this project, we will test the hypothesis that cys-leukotrienes are released and
      correlated with the impairment of the lung function after cardiac surgery in patients with
      COPD. If such hypothesis is substantiated in the study, it would allow us to propose the use
      of leukotriene inhibitors in the peri-operative period to improve pulmonary function and to
      decrease complications after cardiac surgery in COPD patients.
