    <time_frame>From Baseline (screening visit), Month 2, and Month 5</time_frame>
    <description>Change from Baseline in BCVA is the value at indicated time point minus the Baseline value. BCVA at screening visit was used as statistical Baseline. Only data before post-dose intravitreal injection of Avastin/ Lucentis (IVT) has been presented. Arithmetic mean was presented as data values; however statistical analysis is based on means of observed case (OC) data. The screening was used as a Baseline visit that was within or at 14 days of Day 1. Screening visit BCVA values were used to perform statistical comparison at month 2 and 5.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline (Screening Visit) in Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) Central Subfield Over 5 Months</measure>
    <time_frame>From Baseline (Screening visit) and up to 5 months</time_frame>
    <description>The OCT effect is a pharmacodynamics (PD) measure of daily repeated dosing of Pazopanib. The anatomic effects of pazopanib treatment were limited to investigator determined assessment of OCT central subfield retinal thickness due to heterogeneity of participant population and the low likelihood of utility of central reading center determination. The OCT equipment used was approved by central OTC reading center. OCT scans were collected at indicated time points and were evaluated by Investigator. Thus, grading of further secondary objectives was not performed as per the study team. Change from Baseline is the value at indicated time point minus the Baseline value. The screening was used as a Baseline visit that was within or at 14 days of Day 1. Screening visit BCVA values were used to perform statistical comparison at month 2 and 5.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Neo-vascular Size and Lesion Size Over Period</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The analysis was planned to be performed up to 6 months; however, due to heterogeneity of the population and the low likelihood of the utility of the data, the anatomic effects of the pazopanib treatment in this treatment were limited to investigator determined assessment of OCT central subfield retinal thickness. Thus, the study team decided not to have DARC (central reading center) perform the grading for the secondary PD outcomes like lesion size and change with respect to time were not analyzed. Thus, data was not collected for this outcome measure.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline (Day 1) in Systolic Blood Pressure (SBP) and Diastolic Blood Pressure (DBP) Over Period</title>
        <description>Change from Baseline is the value at indicated time point minus the Baseline value. Baseline measurement was recorded at Day 1. SBP and DBP were recorded from Baseline up to 6 months. At screening and Baseline, if the single measured value of blood pressure was above 150 millimeters of mercury (mm Hg) systolic or 95 mm Hg diastolic, then blood pressure measurement could not be repeated. If, the SBP was &lt;80 or &gt;140 mm Hg and DBP was &lt;40 or &gt;90 mm Hg, then measurement of BP was repeated. Three consecutive blood pressure readings that were less than 150 mmHg systolic and 95 mmHg diastolic were taken with each measurement separated by at least 1 hour.</description>

          <title>Change From Baseline (Day 1) in Systolic Blood Pressure (SBP) and Diastolic Blood Pressure (DBP) Over Period</title>
          <description>Change from Baseline is the value at indicated time point minus the Baseline value. Baseline measurement was recorded at Day 1. SBP and DBP were recorded from Baseline up to 6 months. At screening and Baseline, if the single measured value of blood pressure was above 150 millimeters of mercury (mm Hg) systolic or 95 mm Hg diastolic, then blood pressure measurement could not be repeated. If, the SBP was &lt;80 or &gt;140 mm Hg and DBP was &lt;40 or &gt;90 mm Hg, then measurement of BP was repeated. Three consecutive blood pressure readings that were less than 150 mmHg systolic and 95 mmHg diastolic were taken with each measurement separated by at least 1 hour.</description>

        <title>Number of Participants With Adverse Events (AEs)and Serious Adverse Events (SAEs)</title>
        <description>Number of participants with ocular and non-ocular AEs and SAEs were separately recorded. An AE is an unfavorable change in the health of a participant, including abnormal laboratory findings, that happens during a clinical study or within a certain time period after the study has ended. This change may or may not be caused by the intervention being studied. An SAE is an adverse event that results in death, is life-threatening, requires inpatient hospitalization or extends a current hospital stay, results in an ongoing or significant incapacity or interferes substantially with normal life functions, or causes a congenital anomaly or birth defect. Medical events that do not result in death, are not life-threatening, or do not require hospitalization may be considered serious adverse events if they put the participant in danger or require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the results listed above.</description>

        <description>Visual acuity was measured over 5 months and also during follow-up period. Visual acuity was measured using standardized early treatment of diabetic retinopathy study (ETDRS) visual acuity charts. Visual acuity measurement was performed by an examiner that had been appropriately trained. Screening, Month 2 and Month 5 data were considered as Best Corrected Visual Acuity (BCVA) data. A loss of greater than or equal to 15 letters in BCVA from Baseline was considered of PCI. Data for number of participants who met the criteria for PCI have been presented.</description>

          <description>Dilation of fundus was examined post dosing up to 6 months. Number of participants with abnormal change from Baseline indicating dilation of fundus of eye was reported. Change from Baseline was the value at indicated time point minus the Baseline value. The abnormalities were posterior vitreous separation, pale optic nerve, fluid in the posterior pole, drusen, thick arterio-venous changes, pigment changes, cystoids, macular edema, drying of posterior fluid or sub-retinal fluid, underlying central atrophy, and retinal pigment epithelial changes etc. Refraction measurement were determined at the screening and 2 month/5 month visits in order to determine BCVA.</description>

        <description>Change from Baseline in BCVA is the value at indicated time point minus the Baseline value. BCVA at screening visit was used as statistical Baseline. Only data before post-dose intravitreal injection of Avastin/ Lucentis (IVT) has been presented. Arithmetic mean was presented as data values; however statistical analysis is based on means of observed case (OC) data. The screening was used as a Baseline visit that was within or at 14 days of Day 1. Screening visit BCVA values were used to perform statistical comparison at month 2 and 5.</description>

        <description>The OCT effect is a pharmacodynamics (PD) measure of daily repeated dosing of Pazopanib. The anatomic effects of pazopanib treatment were limited to investigator determined assessment of OCT central subfield retinal thickness due to heterogeneity of participant population and the low likelihood of utility of central reading center determination. The OCT equipment used was approved by central OTC reading center. OCT scans were collected at indicated time points and were evaluated by Investigator. Thus, grading of further secondary objectives was not performed as per the study team. Change from Baseline is the value at indicated time point minus the Baseline value. The screening was used as a Baseline visit that was within or at 14 days of Day 1. Screening visit BCVA values were used to perform statistical comparison at month 2 and 5.</description>

        <description>The analysis was planned to be performed up to 6 months; however, due to heterogeneity of the population and the low likelihood of the utility of the data, the anatomic effects of the pazopanib treatment in this treatment were limited to investigator determined assessment of OCT central subfield retinal thickness. Thus, the study team decided not to have DARC (central reading center) perform the grading for the secondary PD outcomes like lesion size and change with respect to time were not analyzed. Thus, data was not collected for this outcome measure.</description>
