  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This single-arm study will assess the efficacy and safety of monthly administration of SC
      Mircera for the maintenance of hemoglobin levels in participants with chronic kidney disease
      on peritoneal dialysis. Participants currently receiving maintenance treatment with SC
      erythropoietin stimulating agents (ESAs) will receive monthly SC injections of Mircera, with
      the starting dose derived from the last weekly ESA they had been receiving.

    <measure>Percentage of Participants Who Maintained Average Hb Value Within Target Range During the EEP</measure>
    <time_frame>Weeks 16 to 24</time_frame>
    <description>Participants provided pre-dose blood samples for Hb monitoring while on treatment with Mircera/CERA. The average Hb during the EEP (Weeks 16 to 24) was calculated per participant and assessed against the target range. The percentage of participants who had average Hb during the EEP in the target range (10 to 12 g/dL) was determined as the primary endpoint. The 95 percent (%) confidence interval (CI) was calculated using the Pearson-Clopper method for exact confidence bounds.</description>

    <measure>Change in Hb Value From Baseline to the EEP</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Weeks 16 to 24</time_frame>
    <description>Reference Hb was determined individually per participant as the average of all Hb values during a pre-treatment screening period (Weeks -4 to 0). Participants provided pre-dose blood samples for Hb monitoring while on treatment with Mircera/CERA. The average Hb during the EEP (Weeks 16 to 24) was calculated per participant and assessed against the reference value. The mean change in Hb value between reference (i.e., &quot;Baseline&quot;) Hb and the EEP average Hb was calculated and expressed in g/dL.</description>

          <description>Participants with CKD-related anemia undergoing peritoneal dialysis and who were previously treated with erythropoiesis-stimulating agent (ESA) therapy received subcutaneous (SC) methoxy polyethylene glycol-epoetin beta (Mircera), also known as continuous erythropoietin receptor activator (CERA), every 4 weeks in this single-arm study. The first dose of 120 or 200 micrograms (mcg) during Week 0 was based upon the dose of ESA received during the initial 4-week screening period, while subsequent doses were adjusted from Weeks 4 to 12 during the dose adaptation period (DAP) to maintain target hemoglobin (Hb) concentrations within 10 to 12 grams per deciliter (g/dL). Treatment continued during a designated efficacy evaluation period (EEP) from Weeks 16 to 24 and an additional follow-up period from Weeks 28 to 48.</description>

        <title>Change in Hb Value From Baseline to the EEP</title>
        <description>Reference Hb was determined individually per participant as the average of all Hb values during a pre-treatment screening period (Weeks -4 to 0). Participants provided pre-dose blood samples for Hb monitoring while on treatment with Mircera/CERA. The average Hb during the EEP (Weeks 16 to 24) was calculated per participant and assessed against the reference value. The mean change in Hb value between reference (i.e., &quot;Baseline&quot;) Hb and the EEP average Hb was calculated and expressed in g/dL.</description>

        <description>Study drug administration occurred monthly during treatment (Weeks 0 to 48), which began with a pre-specified dose of Mircera/CERA according to the dose of ESA administered during the initial 4-week screening period. Subsequent doses could be adjusted on the basis of Hb levels or other modification criteria. The percent difference in dose from the previous week was calculated at each visit as [(current dose minus previous week dose) divided by previous week dose] multiplied by 100, and averaged among all participants.</description>

            <description>Participants with CKD-related anemia undergoing peritoneal dialysis and who were previously treated with ESA therapy received SC Mircera/CERA every 4 weeks in this single-arm study. The first dose of 120 or 200 mcg during Week 0 was based upon the dose of ESA received during the initial 4-week screening period, while subsequent doses were adjusted from Weeks 4 to 12 during the DAP to maintain target Hb concentrations within 10 to 12 g/dL. Treatment continued during a designated EEP from Weeks 16 to 24 and an additional follow-up period from Weeks 28 to 48.</description>

The first dose of 120 or 200 mcg during Week 0 was based upon the dose of ESA received during the initial 4-week screening period, while subsequent doses were adjusted from Weeks 4 to 12 during the DAP to maintain target Hb concentrations within 10 to 12 g/dL. Treatment continued during a designated EEP from Weeks 16 to 24 and an additional follow-up period from Weeks 28 to 48.</description>
