      Comparative study between surgical and non surgical treatment of anismus in patients with
      symptoms of obstructed defecation.

      Anismus is a significant cause of chronic constipation. This study came to compare the
      results of BFB training , BTX-A injection and PDPR in the treatment of anismus patients.
      Patients and methods: Seventy two anismus patients fulfilled Rome II criteria for functional
      constipation were included in this study. All patients underwent anorectal manometry, balloon
      expulsion test, defecography, and electromyography activity of the EAS. All patients had non
      relaxing puborectalis muscle.. The patients were randomized into three groups. Group I
      patients received biofeedback therapy, two times per week for about 1 month. Group II
      patients were injected with BTX- A. Group 111 partial division of puborectalis was done.
      Follow up was conducted weekly in the first month then monthly for about 1 year.

    <description>A 2-3 cm curved incision is made on either side of the anal canal along its posterolateral aspect, each about 2.5 cm distance from the anal verge Fig(2). After that dissection in ischiorectal fossa was done till reaching the puborectalis sling from outside i.e. extrasphincteric approach . Using a right angle forceps the puborectalis sling is lifted up, guided by the contralateral index finger in the anal canal Fig(3). Nearly the inner half of puborectalis sling was divided on each side by using a scalpel NO. 11 Fig(4). Complete haemostasis was followed by skin closure without drain</description>
