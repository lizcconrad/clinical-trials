  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase IV, prospective, randomized, multi-center study to find risk factors of OAB
      symptoms relapse in patients who showed therapeutic benefits after 1, 3, or 6 months of
      treatment with Tolterodine SR and who then discontinued these antimuscarinics for 3 month.

      Patients who have OAB symptoms for 6 or more than 6 months and who show successful treatment
      response to 1 month of treatment with Tolterodine SR 4mg will be enrolled and randomized to
      1, 3 or 6 months of treatment group. After completion of the treatment, subjects will be
      evaluated for changes in OAB symptoms and retreatment rate will be assessed.

      Primary Objective:

        -  To investigate the risk factors of OAB symptom relapse and retreatment in patients who
           showed therapeutic benefits after 1, 3 or 6 months of treatment with Tolterodine SR and
           who then discontinued these antimuscarinics for 3 month.

      Secondary Objective:

        -  To investigate the change of the patient perception and quality of life after
           antimuscarinic discontinuation

        -  To find the rate of patients who have OAB symptom relapse.

        -  To find the risk factors of patients who want retreatment.

        -  To find the rate of patients who want retreatment.
