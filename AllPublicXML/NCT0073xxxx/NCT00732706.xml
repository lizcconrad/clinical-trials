  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Nerve blocks are an effective way to control pain after surgery. There are two major nerves
      that provide sensation to the knee: the femoral nerve provides sensation to the front of the
      knee and sciatic nerve provides sensation to the back of the knee. The femoral nerve has two
      branches. To locate the nerve, we use a machine called (Nerve stimulator) which is attached
      to the needle used for nerve block. Use of a nerve stimulator is standard practice for this
      procedure. Ultrasound is being increasingly used to locate nerves but is not used
      universally. We will use the nerve stimulator and ultrasound to locate the femoral nerve but
      patients will randomly be selected to enter a group looking at the stimulation of one or the
      other branches of the femoral nerve. The two branches when stimulated produce different
      muscle contractions in the thigh. We do not know from research which is the optimal
      contraction to position the needle to get the best block. After the knee replacement patients
      will still have the same analgesic medication available as patients would have received if
      they were not in the study.

      To determine if needle insertion at the inguinal crease with stimulation of sartorius muscle
      (anterior branch) causes an equivalent block to the classical method with stimulation of the
      quadriceps femoris muscle (posterior branch), for femoral nerve blockade. To test this
      hypothesis, we plan to conduct a randomised controlled double-blind study comparing success
      of femoral never block (motor and sensory) using sartorius twitch versus quadriceps femoris
      twitch as an end point.

      We will also evaluate the local anesthetic distribution under the facia iliaca sheath using
      ultrasound imaging.

      Methods: Following institutional ethical approval and obtaining written informed consent, we
      plan to recruit 60 patients aged 18-80, ASA I-III scheduled to undergo unilateral total knee
      arthroplastly in this prospective, randomised, double blinded controlled trial.
