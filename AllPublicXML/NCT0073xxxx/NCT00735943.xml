    <textblock>
      The objective of this observational study is to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of
      Macugen for treatment of wet age-related macular degeneration (AMD) in Indian
      patients.Prospective, Observational, Non-interventional Study. The period of observation for
      the study will be 1 year

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      To be eligible for enrollment in this study, patients must receive the first injection of
      Macugen intravitreal in at least one eye for treatment of wet age-related macular
      degeneration (AMD). The decision to prescribe Macugen will necessarily precede and will be
      independent of the decision to enroll patient into the study.

      If both eyes of a patient receive injection Macugen, only one eye will be included in the
      study. If both eyes receive first injection Macugen after initiation of the study, only the
      first treated eye will be included in the analysis. If one eye has already received Macugen
      when the study starts and the second eye receives injection after the study initiation, the
      second eye will be included in the analysis.

      The study was prematurely discontinued due to delay in meeting pre-defined protocol
      recruitment milestones on August 30, 2010. There were no safety concerns regarding the study
      in the decision to terminate the trial.

    <measure>Percentage of Participants Showing Stabilization, Improvement or Deterioration of Visual Acuity (VA)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline through 12 months or last follow-up visit before study termination</time_frame>
    <description>VA was measured using ETDRS (Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study) chart at 4 meter distance, at 1 meter distance (if participant's VA was poor) or verifying if the participant was able only to count fingers, to perceive hand motion or light. VA was assessed as the number of ETDRS letters correctly read. VA statuses were defined as: Stabilization: loss of less than 15 letters in the best corrected VA (BCVA); Improvement: gain of more than or equal to 15 letters in the BCVA; Deterioration: loss of more than or equal to 15 letters in the BCVA.</description>

    <measure>Average Number of Injections to Achieve Stabilization of VA</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months or last follow-up visit before study termination</time_frame>
    <description>Stabilization of VA was defined as loss of less than 15 letters in the BCVA. For each participant, number of injections before reaching the first &quot;stabilization in VA&quot; (considered as an event) was counted. For participant having no event, the time to the number of injections to reach an event was unobserved at the number of injections before the last follow up.</description>

    <measure>Median Number of Injections to Achieve Stabilization of VA</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months or last follow-up visit before study termination</time_frame>
    <description>Stabilization of VA was defined as loss of less than 15 letters in the BCVA. Median number of injections to achieve stabilization of VA was estimated via the Kaplan Meier method. For each participant, number of injections before reaching the first &quot;stabilization in VA&quot; (considered as an event) was counted. For participant having no event, the time to the number of injections to reach an event was unobserved at the number of injections before the last follow up.</description>

    <measure>Percentage of Participants Receiving Macugen Monotherapy Versus Those Receiving a Combination Therapy</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months or last follow-up visit before study termination</time_frame>
    <description>Macugen monotherapy: referred to participants receiving Macugen in the study eye during the study that is (i.e.) participants without any concomitant drug treatment or nondrug treatment for the study eye during the study. Combination therapy: referred to participants receiving combination therapy in the study eye (during the study) i.e. participants with any concomitant drug treatment or nondrug treatment for the study eye during the study.</description>

    <measure>Percentage of Participants Showing Improvement in Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) Parameters</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months or last follow-up visit before study termination</time_frame>
    <description>OCT, a noninvasive, noncontact, transpupillary imaging technology, was utilized to image retinal structures in vivo with a resolution of 10 to 17 microns. The anatomic layers within the retina, retinal thickness could be measured. Improvement in OCT parameters was defined as a reduction of more than or equal to 100 microns in the central macular thickness (Center subfield).</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of Participants Showing Improvement in Fundus Fluorescein Angiography (FFA) Parameters</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months or last follow-up visit before study termination</time_frame>
    <description>A fluorescein angiogram provides information about the condition of the retina. Improvement in FFA parameters was defined as absence of progression of the lesion or decrease in the size of the lesion and absence of new lesions on FFA i.e. change in lesion size from baseline must be less than or equal to 0 disc area(DA) and no new lesions.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of Participants With Early Lesions Showing Stabilization and Improvement of VA</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months or last follow-up visit before study termination</time_frame>
    <description>Early lesions were defined by any 2 of the following criteria: occult lesion diagnosed on FFA; baseline VA of more than or equal to 54 ETDRS letters; lesion size of less than 2DA on FFA. Stabilization of VA was defined as loss of less than 15 letters in the BCVA. Improvement in the VA was defined as gain of more than or equal to 15 letters in the BCVA.</description>

          <title>Percentage of Participants Showing Stabilization, Improvement or Deterioration of Visual Acuity (VA)</title>
          <description>VA was measured using ETDRS (Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study) chart at 4 meter distance, at 1 meter distance (if participant's VA was poor) or verifying if the participant was able only to count fingers, to perceive hand motion or light. VA was assessed as the number of ETDRS letters correctly read. VA statuses were defined as: Stabilization: loss of less than 15 letters in the best corrected VA (BCVA); Improvement: gain of more than or equal to 15 letters in the BCVA; Deterioration: loss of more than or equal to 15 letters in the BCVA.</description>
          <population>Full Analysis Set (FAS) included all participants who received at least 1 injection of the study treatment in the study eye during the study. Missing values were imputed by Last Observation Carried Forward (LOCF) technique.</population>
