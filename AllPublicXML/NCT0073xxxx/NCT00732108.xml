      Migraine is a common disorder, often associated with dizziness symptoms. In many cases,
      dizziness is one of the only manifestations of migraine headaches. Various classes of drugs
      have been advocated as treatment for migraine-associated dizziness, though none has been
      shown to be superior over the others.

      Topiramate is a drug approved for migraine prophylaxis. This study is designed to assess if
      there are significant changes in dizziness frequency and severity in patients diagnosed with
      migraine-associated dizziness treated with topiramate. Demonstrating benefit of topiramate
      with a placebo-controlled study to alleviate symptoms of dizziness would serve to clarify
      effective treatment options for patients with migraine-associated dizziness.
