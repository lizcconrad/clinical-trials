      cell lymphoma who have relapsed, progressed or are refractory to bortezomib.

      Follow up phase will continue until either 100% of the patients have died, are lost to follow
      up or have withdrawn consent or a maximum of 4 years from the last patient enrolled,
      whichever comes first. All other efficacy and safety endpoints will be updated at this time.
      In the unlikely event that the study will be closed and patients are still responding to
      treatment at this time, Celgene will discuss with the treating physicians options to provide
      further treatment to the patient after study closure in line with local regulation.

      Follow up for second primary malignancies and OS will continue until 100% of the patients
      have died, are lost to follow up, have withdrawn consent, or a maximum of 5 years from the
      last patient enrolled, whichever comes first.

      10 October 2017: In regard to the last subject last visit date/study completion date, the
      prolongation of timelines is due to the bridging of a treatment gap for a patient responding
      to study medication until non-study medication is available.

    <time_frame>Up to 6 cycles (+/- 1 month) or discontinued before completing 6 cycles; data cut-off 02 July 2012; Median duration on study was 44.3 weeks and ranged from 0.6 to 175.1 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Overall Response Rate (ORR) was defined as the percentage of participants whose best response was Complete Response (CR), Complete Response unconfirmed (CRu) or Partial Response (PR). Participants who had discontinued before any response has been observed, or changed to other anti-lymphoma treatments before response had been observed, were considered as non-responders. Tumor Response was assessed by a modification of the International Lymphoma Workshop Response Criteria, IWRC, Cheson, 1999); CR is defined as the disappearance of all clinical and radiographic evidence of disease; CRu is defined as a CR, with a 1) residual lymph node mass &gt;1.5 cm that has decreased by 75% in the sum of the product of the diameters (SPD). Individual nodes previously confluent decreased by more than 75% in the SPD compared with original mass; 2) indeterminate bone marrow; PR = is defined ≥50% decrease in 6 largest nodes or nodal masses</description>

    <description>The percentage of participants whose best response was CR or CRu. Participants who had discontinued before CR/CRu was observed, or changed to other antilymphoma treatments before a CR/CRu response had been observed, were considered as non-responders. CR is defined as the disappearance of all clinical and radiographic evidence of disease; CRu is defined as a CR, with a 1) residual lymph node mass &gt;1.5 cm that has decreased by 75% in the sum of the product of the diameters (SPD). Individual nodes previously confluent decreased by more than 75% in the SPD compared with original mass; 2) indeterminate bone marrow; Non-responders are participants who discontinue before any post-baseline efficacy assessments.</description>

    <description>Kaplan Meier estimates for the duration of CR/CRu was calculated from the date of the first occurrence of CR/CRu to the date of documented disease progression or death (without documented progression) for participants who obtained a CR/CRu; participants who had not progressed (or died) were censored at the last valid assessment.</description>

    <description>Kaplan Meier estimate of time to progression was calculated as time from the start of the study drug therapy to the first observation of disease progression.

Lenalidomide: 10mg or 25 mg oral capsules on days 1 to 21 of each 28 day cycle and dependent on renal function; Participants with normal renal function (defined as Creatinine Clearance(CrCl)) of ≥ 60 mL/min in this study) received 25 mg of lenalidomide daily, and those with moderate renal insufficiency (CrCl) ≥ 30 mL/min but &lt; 60 mL/min) were started at a 10-mg dose. Participants could continue to receive treatment until disease progression, development of unacceptable AEs, or voluntary withdrawal.</description>

Participants who had discontinued before any response has been observed, or changed to other anti-lymphoma treatments before response had been observed, were considered as non-responders. Tumor Response was assessed by a modification of the International Lymphoma Workshop Response Criteria, IWRC, Cheson, 1999); CR is defined as the disappearance of all clinical and radiographic evidence of disease; CRu is defined as a CR, with a 1) residual lymph node mass &gt;1.5 cm that has decreased by 75% in the sum of the product of the diameters (SPD). Individual nodes previously confluent decreased by more than 75% in the SPD compared with original mass; 2) indeterminate bone marrow; PR = is defined ≥50% decrease in 6 largest nodes or nodal masses</description>

A TEAE is defined as any AE occurring or worsening on or after the first dose of study drug and within 28 days after the last dose of study drug.</description>
