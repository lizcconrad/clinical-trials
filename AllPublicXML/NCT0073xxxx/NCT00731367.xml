  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase IIIb, randomized, comparative, multi-center study is designed to evaluate two
      AQUACEL Ag protocols of care for the management of split-thickness donor sites. Both
      protocols of care will utilize AQUACEL Ag as the primary dressing. As per the randomization
      assignment, one protocol of care will have the AQUACEL Ag initially covered with a gauze
      dressing to create an adherent state and in the other protocol of care the AQUACEL Ag will be
      covered with a transparent film to maintain a gelled state.

      The primary objective of the study will be to quantify the proportion of subjects healed at
      14 days. Secondary objectives will include: time to healing, degree of pain at dressing
      change and while wearing the dressing, simplicity of use, resources used in treatment and
      safety. Approximately 68 subjects will be enrolled from 10 centers from within the US and
      Canada.

    <description>AQUACEL Ag is produced by changing a small fraction of the sodium ions present in AQUACEL for silver ions and then stabilizing the complex formed by adding chloride. This produces a characteristic silver gray product. There are no counter ions (such as nitrate or sulphadiazine ions) present: these compounds, found in many silver containing products, are known to retard wound healing. AQUACEL Ag maintains a moist wound-healing environment while, at the same time, killing wound pathogens that are immobilized within the dressing. It also reduces bioburden at the wound-dressing surface, thus minimizing the risk of wound infection and facilitating wound healing.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subject or legally authorized representative must provide written informed consent.

          -  Subject who is younger than legal consenting age must have a legally authorized
             representative who will provide written informed consent.

          -  The subject is scheduled to undergo a split-thickness skin graft (autograft)

          -  Harvesting of the donor site must be limited to the location and size of the anterior
             thigh

          -  The selected anterior thigh must be a first - time harvesting.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects with known skin sensitivity to any of the dressing components.

          -  Subjects who require a full thickness graft.

          -  The subject with a poor prognosis, which would make it unlikely that he/she would
             survive the 21 day study period.

          -  Subjects who have been previously randomized into the study, or who are presently
             participating in another clinical trial.
