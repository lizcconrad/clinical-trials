    <textblock>
      High concentrations of anti-oxidants in pomegranate seeds present a potential strategy to
      delay clinical prostate cancer progression and prolong the interval from primary treatment
      failure to hormonal ablation. This is a 48 month extension to the double-blind GUP-0205-1
      study, to compare the effects of daily consumption of pomegranate liquid extract versus
      placebo on the absolute prostate-specific antigen (PSA) doubling time at the end of 12, 24,
      36 and 48 months in male subjects who rolled-over from the GUP-0205-1 study.

      The primary objectives are to compare the effects of daily consumption of pomegranate liquid
      extract versus placebo on the absolute prostate-specific antigen (PSA) doubling time at the
      end of 12,24, 36 and 48 months in male subjects who rolled-over from the GUP-0205-1 study.
      Secondary objectives are to determine the effect of the pomegranate treatment on the change
      in PSA doubling time from baseline to each 12-month visit, to determine the time to tumor
      recurrence, to assess the tolerability and toxicity of the pomegranate treatment and to
      determine the effect of the pomegranate treatment on response rates for positive PSA doubling
      times and for declining post-treatment PSA levels (negative doubling times).

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  No evidence of disease progression while on any of the three GUP-0205 study products
             (disease progression defined as &gt; 100% increase in serum PSA [with a minimum value of
             1.0 ng/mL]).

          -  Willingness and ability to sign an informed consent document.

          -  Agreement with complete abstinence from other commercially available pomegranate
             products during the course of the study.

          -  Use of dietary/herbal supplements (e.g., saw palmetto, selenium, etc) is acceptable
             provided the dose has been stable during the course of the GUP-0205- 1 study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Significant concomitant medical or psychiatric condition that, in the opinion of the
             Principal Investigator, would put the subject at risk or compromise the protocol.

          -  Hormonal therapy, with the exception of neoadjuvant androgen deprivation therapy (ADT)
             prior to or concurrent with primary therapy. Subjects who underwent neoadjuvant ADT
             cannot have a serum testosterone of â‰¤150 ng/mL at study entry.

          -  Concomitant or antecedent hormonal therapy for rising serum PSA after initial therapy
             of prostate cancer.

          -  Subjects unable or unwilling to comply with protocol requirements.

          -  Prior treatment with experimental drugs, high dose steroids, or with any other cancer
             treatment within 4 weeks prior to the first dose of study product and for the duration
             of the study.

          -  Serum PSA &gt;7.0 ng/mL (assessed at termination of the double-blind study; at any PSA
             level, the subject will be excluded if determined by the Principal Investigator that
             the subject's continued participation would not be in their best interest).

          -  Serum PSA doubling time &lt;13 weeks (assessed at termination of the double-blind study).

          -  Evidence of metastatic disease on physical examination or on CT or bone scan.

          -  Use of finasteride, dutasteride at any point since primary therapy or during the
             study.

          -  Clinically significant abnormal laboratory value greater than 2 times the upper limit
             of normal (&gt;2XULN).
