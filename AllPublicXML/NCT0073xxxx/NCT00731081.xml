        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Male or Female ≥ 18 years of age;

          -  The patient and/or patient's legal representative has given their informed consent in
             writing before any study procedure is initiated;

          -  Pompe disease confirmed by documented deficit in endogenous acid alpha-glucosidase
             (GAA) activity;

          -  A severe form of the disease as defined as follows: a. Moderate to severe limb girdle
             muscle weakness requiring help for walking around (sticks, crutches, walking frame or
             wheelchair); and b. Symptoms of diaphragmatic dysfunction defined by at least 2 out of
             the 3 following criteria: orthopnea, vital capacity &lt; 50%, paradoxical respiration
             detected in measurement of transdiaphragmatic pressure; and c. Use of invasive
             ventilation (defined by need for tracheotomy) or noninvasive ventilation (defined by
             utilization of assisted ventilation using a nasal or facial mask)day and night
             prescribed ≥ 12 hours/day;

          -  Treated for ≥6 months with Myozyme;

          -  Followed-up in a reference center according to the CETP recommendations.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  The patient presents with a major congenital anomaly;

          -  The patient presents with a clinically important organic disease (except for symptoms
             related to Pompe disease) such as cardiovascular, hepatic, pulmonary, neurological or
             renal disease or any other medical condition, serious disease or particular
             circumstances that in the investigator's opinion, should preclude the patient's
             participation.
