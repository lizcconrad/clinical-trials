          -  Age &gt; 18 and &lt; 70.

          -  Karnofsky performance status &gt; 70% upon inclusion in the study.

          -  Life expectancy of more than 3 months.

          -  Histologically confirmed diagnosis of squamous cell carcinoma or adenocarcinoma of the
             oesophagus or the gastroesophageal junction. The disease must be confined to the
             oesophagus or gastroesophageal junction and the perioesophageal region. There must be
             no tumor extension beyond 2 cm into the stomach.

          -  Stages II or III. The patients must have a T1N1M0 or T2-4; any N; M0. The only
             exception would be patients with stage IVA: an oesophageal carcinoma of the upper
             thoracic region with metastasis in cervical lymph nodes (M1a) and an oesophageal
             carcinoma of the lower thoracic region with metastasis in the celiac lymph nodes
             (M1a), providing the disease remains within the radiotherapy fields.

          -  Presence of a unidimensionally measurable and/or assessable lesion

          -  Neutrophils &gt;1500/mm3, platelet count &gt;150,000/mm3 and haemoglobin &gt;10 g/dl.

          -  Adequate renal function: serum creatinine &lt; 120 micromol/l (1.4 mg/dl); if the values
             are &gt;120 micromol/l (1.4 mg/dl) creatinine clearance must be &gt; 65 ml/min.

             eligible.

          -  Serum calcium &lt;1.25 x normal upper limit (NUL).

          -  Adequate nutritional status: weight loss &lt; 20% of regular weight and albumin &gt; 35 g/l.

             EGFR-targeted treatment.

          -  Evidence of another cancer, with the exception of a carcinoma in situ of the uterine
             cervix and/or a basal cell carcinoma of the skin.
