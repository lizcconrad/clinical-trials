  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Diabetes affects almost 21 million people in the United States. In this study we will test a
      drug called Pramlintide(Symlin), and see how it works to lower blood sugar and fat levels
      after a meal. Lowering high sugar levels and fat levels after a meal is very important in the
      prevention of the problems that persons with type 2 diabetes often encounter. Hypothesis is
      that Pramlintide will lower blood sugar and fat levels after a meal.

    <textblock>
      A well recognized and troublesome feature of diabetes management is the exacerbated post
      prandial glucose elevations following a typical high fat meal. To date the mechanisms driving
      this increased post prandial glycemia are unclear. Pramlintide is believed to affect
      intermediary metabolism as well as nutrient absorption. The relative contributions from
      altered absorption and metabolism to the observed post prandial reductions in plasma glucose
      and TG concentrations remain uncertain, however. Combinations of radioactive and stable
      isotope labeling techniques are able to quantify the relevant fluxes of glucose and lipids in
      vivo in humans and are therefore able to provide quantitative answers to these questions.

      Aims:

        1. To determine the effects of Pramlintide on reducing endogenous production of
           very-low-density-lipoprotein (VLDL)-triglycerides(TG) following a high fat breakfast,
           lunch and dinner in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). A triple isotope
           approach will be used to determine rate of appearance of (VLDL)-triglycerides following
           breakfast, lunch and dinner.

        2. To compare the relative roles of slowed glucose absorption and reduced endogenous
           glucose production (glucagonstatic mechanism) in the glucose-lowering effects of
           Pramlintide in the post prandial state in patients with T2DM.
