    <textblock>
      Multicenter, open-label, phase 1, cohort dose escalation study to determine the Maximum
      Tolerated Dose (MTD) of OSI-906 in combination with erlotinib
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will open with Schedule 1 (S1), in which OSI-906 is administered on Days 1-3 every
      7 days. Erlotinib will be administered daily starting on Day 2. A treatment period is defined
      as 21 days.

      Initiation of Schedule 2 (S2), in which OSI-906 is administered daily starting on Day 1 and
      erlotinib is administered daily starting on Day 2, will occur after observation of clinically
      significant related toxicity &gt;/= grade 2 in any patient on S1 or after &gt; 2 dose levels in S1
      have been examined without evidence of Dose Limiting Toxicities (DLT).

      Initiation of Schedule 3 (S3), in which OSI-906 is administered twice daily starting on Day 1
      and erlotinib is administered daily starting on Day 2, will occur after observation of
      clinically significant related toxicity &gt;/= grade 2 in any patient on S2 or after &gt; 2 dose
      levels in S2 have been examined without evidence of DLT.

      Once the phase 2 dose has been established for S3, 1 expansion cohort will be opened.

      The Expansion Cohort will enroll approximately 30 evaluable patients with stage IIIB/IV
      Non-small Cell Lung Carcinoma (NSCLC). Patients in the NSCLC Expansion Cohort will be
      required to have either archival tissue or fresh tumor tissue available at the start of
      study.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Histologically or cytologically confirmed advanced solid tumor

          -  For the NSCLC Expansion Cohort, a confirmed diagnosis of stage IIIB/IV NSCLC after
             failure of at least 1 prior chemotherapy regimen is required

          -  Patients with Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status &lt;/= 2

          -  Predicted life expectancy &gt;/= 12 weeks

          -  Patients may have had prior therapy, providing certain conditions are met:

               1. Chemotherapy: A minimum of 3 weeks (4 weeks for carboplatin or investigational
                  anticancer agents and 6 weeks for nitrosoureas and mitomycin C) must have elapsed
                  between the end of treatment and registration into this study. Patients must have
                  recovered from any treatment-related toxicities (except for alopecia, fatigue,
                  and grade 1 neurotoxicity) prior to registration.

               2. Hormonal therapy: Patients may have had prior anticancer hormonal therapy
                  provided it is discontinued prior to registration into the study. However,
                  patients with prostate cancer with evidence of progressive disease may continue
                  on therapy that produces medical castration (eg, goserelin or leuprorelin),
                  provided this therapy was commenced at least 3 months earlier.

               3. Radiation: Patients may have had prior radiation therapy provided they have
                  recovered from the acute, toxic effects of radiotherapy prior to registration. A
                  minimum of 21 days must have elapsed between the end of radiotherapy and
                  registration into the study unless the radiation affected less than 25% of bone
                  marrow.

               4. Surgery: Previous surgery is permitted provided that wound healing has occurred
                  prior to registration.

          -  Serum creatinine &lt;/= 1.5 x ULN

          -  Patients must be nonsmokers (or former smokers who stopped smoking &gt; 3 months
             previously) and have a negative cotinine test at baseline and on Day 1

          -  Patients in the NSCLC Expansion Cohort must have measurable disease per Response
             Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST)

          -  Patients in the NSCLC Expansion Cohort will be required to have either an archival or
             fresh tumor tissue (whole or partial block) available at the start of study

          -  Patients must be accessible for repeat dosing and follow-up, including pharmacokinetic
             sampling

          -  Patients - both males and females - with reproductive potential must agree to practice
             effective contraceptive measures throughout the study. Women of childbearing potential
