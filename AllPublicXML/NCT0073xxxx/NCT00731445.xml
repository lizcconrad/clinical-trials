      This phase I/II is studying the side effect and best dose of Z-208 for patients with advanced
      hepatocellular carcinoma
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, dose-escalation study PhaseI Treatments repeats for 28 days for 1
      course in the unacceptable toxicity

      Cohort of 3 patients receive escalating doses of Z-208 until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD)
      is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 1 of 3 patients
      experience dose-limiting toxicity.

      PhaseII Treatments repeats for 28 days for 6 courses until absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.
