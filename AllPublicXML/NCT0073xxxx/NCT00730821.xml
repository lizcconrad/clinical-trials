    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this trial is to determine the MTD of the combination of BIBW
      2992/BIBF 1120 therapy administered concomitantly in a 28-day cycle schedule.

      Secondary objectives are the collection of antitumor efficacy data, the determination of
      pharmacokinetic parameters of BIBF 1120 and BIBW 2992, and if data allow the determination of
      the pharmacokinetic influence of BIBW 2992 on BIBF 1120 and vice versa.
