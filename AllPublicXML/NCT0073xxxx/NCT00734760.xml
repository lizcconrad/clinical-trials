      This study was conducted to test whether a focused education and counseling intervention
      delivered by a nurse will decrease time of delay in seeking treatment for the signs and
      symptoms of acute coronary syndrome (i.e., heart attack) in patients already identified as
      having ischemic heart disease.

      Delay to treatment from the onset acute coronary syndrome (ACS)continues to be a significant
      cause of morbidity and mortality. This study was conducted to evaluate a tailored education
      and counseling program designed for individuals at high risk for a future event. Study
      Hypothesis: The central hypothesis of this study was that a focused education and counseling
      intervention delivered by a nurse will decrease time of delay in seeking treatment for the
      signs and symptoms of AMI in patients already identified as having ischemic heart disease.
      Patients were randomized to receive a nurse-administered education and counseling
      intervention designed to promote early presentation for medical treatment in the face of
      cardiac symptoms or to usual instructions by their healthcare provider. Primary &amp; Secondary
      Endpoints: The primary endpoint of this trial was prehospital delay time, i.e., time from
      onset of symptoms to arrival at the hospital. The secondary endpoints were: use of the
      emergency medical system; use of aspirin; healthcare resource utilization; and knowledge,
      attitudes and beliefs about heart disease.
