  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the pharmacokinetics (how the drug is absorbed
      into the bloodstream, distributed in the body and eliminated from the body) after a single
      dose and after repeated administration of TMC278 administered once daily for 11 days in
      subjects with mild or moderate hepatic impairment (impaired liver function), compared with
      healthy control subjects. Furthermore the short-term safety and tolerability (how well the
      body tolerates the drug) of TMC278 will be assessed.

    <textblock>
      Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected patients are routinely being treated with
      combinations of 3 or 4 drugs (highly active antiretroviral therapy [HAART]), to reduce the
      risk of viral resistance development. Development of new potent antiretroviral (ARV) drugs is
      urgently needed to prolong suppression of viral replication in subjects infected with HIV.
      This is a Phase I, open-label, parallel, controlled, sequential study to investigate the
      single-dose and steady-state pharmacokinetics, and short-term safety and tolerability of
      TMC278 in subjects with mild or moderate hepatic impairment compared to subjects with normal
      hepatic function. The trial aims to provide guidance on administration and dose
      recommendations of TMC278 in subjects with mildly or moderately impaired hepatic function.
      The study population will consist of a total of 32 male and female subjects between 18 and 65
      years. Panel A will consist of 8 subjects with mild hepatic impairment and 8 healthy subjects
      matched for sex, age (± 5 yrs), and BMI (± 15%). Panel B will consist of 8 subjects with
      moderate hepatic impairment and 8 healthy subjects matched for sex, age (± 5 yrs), and BMI (±
      15%). Treatment in Panel A and Panel B will be conducted sequentially. Subjects in Panel A
      will receive a TMC278 25 mg tablet once daily for a total of 11 days. Recruitment for
      subjects for Panel B will start after evaluation of the safety, tolerability and
      pharmacokinetic data from subjects in Panel A. The anticipated dose of TMC278 to be
      administered to subjects in Panel B is the same dose as for Panel A (25 mg once daily for 11
      days), but this dose might be adjusted depending on the results of Panel A.
