  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase I study of Nanoliposomal CPT-11 in patients with Recurrent high-grade
      gliomas. Patients must have a histologically proven intracranial malignant glioma, which
      includes glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), gliosarcoma (GS), anaplastic astrocytoma (AA),
      anaplastic oligodendroglioma (AO), anaplastic mixed oligoastrocytoma (AMO), or malignant
      astrocytoma NOS (not otherwise specified). Patients who are wild type or heterozygous for the
      UGT1A1*28 gene will received Nanoliposomal CPT-11. The total anticipated accrual will be
      approximately 36 patients (depending upon the actual MTD). The investigators hypothesis is
      that this new formulation of CPT-11 will increase survival over that seen in historical
      controls who have recurrent gliomas because CPT-11 will be encapsulated in a liposome
      nanoparticle, which has been seen to reduce toxicities from the drug.

    <textblock>
      Patients with recurrent malignant glioma will receive Nanoliposomal CPT-11 at the time of
      relapse. The dose will be adjusted according to a phase-1 dose escalation scheme. Patients
      will receive drug intravenously every 3 weeks until tumor progression or excessive toxicity.
      Weekly follow up will occur to assess toxicities during the DLT phase of the trial. Patients
      will have different dose escalation if UGT1A1 is 6/6 versus UGT1A1 is 6/7. Patients with UGT
      1A1 of 7/7 will not be eligible. All patients must have UGT 1A1 status know as an eligibility
      requirement. Patients will be followed for both toxicity and progression, and progression
      will be evaluated by MR imaging every 6 weeks. Pharmacokinetics will be obtained in the first
      treatment cycle.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with histologically proven intracranial malignant glioma are eligible . -All
             patients must sign an informed consent

               -  Patients must be &gt; 18 years old, and with a life expectancy &gt; 8 weeks.

               -  Patients must have a Karnofsky performance status of &gt; 60.

          -  Patients must have recovered from the toxic effects of prior therapy

          -  Patients must have adequate bone marrow function (WBC &gt; 3,000/µl, ANC &gt; 1,500/mm3,
             platelet count of &gt; 100,000/mm3, and hemoglobin &gt; 10 gm/dl), adequate liver function
             (SGOT and bilirubin &lt; 2 times ULN), and adequate renal function (creatinine &lt; 1.5
             mg/dL and/or creatinine clearance &gt; 60 cc/min) Patients must have shown radiographic
             evidence for tumor progression by MRI or CT scan. A scan should be performed within 14
             days prior to registration and on a steroid dose that has been stable for at least 5
             days. -Patients having undergone recent resection of recurrent or progressive tumor
             will be eligible as long as all of the following conditions apply:

               -  They have recovered from the effects of surgery.

               -  Residual disease following resection of recurrent malignant glioma is not

             carcinoma in-situ of the cervix), unless in complete remission and off of all therapy
             for that disease for a minimum of 3 years are ineligible.

          -  Patients must not have active infection or serious intercurrent medical illness.

          -  Patients must not be pregnant/breast feeding and must agree to practice adequate
             contraception.

             drug metabolism.

          -  Patients must not have received prior therapy with irinotecan.

          -  Patients with 7/7 (homozygous) UGT1A1*28 genotyping will be excluded from the study.
