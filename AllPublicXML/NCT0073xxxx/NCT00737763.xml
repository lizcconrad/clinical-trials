  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this single-center therapeutic study, we will study the ability of efalizumab to protect
      remaining beta cells in teenagers and young adults who have been newly diagnosed with type 1
      diabetes mellitus. Efalizumab is a monoclonal antibody which prevents the activation of
      antigen specific T lymphocytes to sites of inflammation. Efalizumab was approved by the FDA
      in 2003 for the treatment of psoriasis. It has been proven to be safe, well tolerated and
      effective in targeting T cell mediated disorders like those seen in autoimmunity.

      Since there is data that shows that early intervention can prevent further destruction of
      insulin producing beta cells, the patients who will be enrolled in this study will have been
      diagnosed with Type 1 diabetes within 6 weeks of enrolling and starting therapy. Patients who
      meet the screening criteria will be randomized at a 2 to 1 ratio to either get weekly
      subcutaneous injections of efalizumab for 26 weeks versus a placebo injection. The
      researchers and patients will be blinded to the treatment group assignment. All patients will
      be followed for two years.

      The primary endpoint for this study will be the difference from baseline in the body's
      ability to respond to a Mixed Meal Tolerance Test at 12 months after enrollment. The Mixed
      Meal Tolerance test will help test the production of insulin by the pancreas. By comparing
      the results of these tests between the treated group and the placebo group, we hope to be
      able to show preservation of beta cell function in the group treated with efalizumab.
