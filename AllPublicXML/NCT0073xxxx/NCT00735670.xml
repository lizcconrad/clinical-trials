    <textblock>
      This study was initially designed to test the efficacy of Venlafaxine HCl in reducing
      incidence of the onset of major depression after a new spinal cord injury (SCI). After
      several protocol modifications, the purpose of the study is to test the effectiveness of a
      sub-therapeutic dose of Venlafaxine HCl to reduce mild to moderate symptoms in persons with
      SCI.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The successes of psychological and pharmacological modes of intervention in treating
      depression, both alone and combined, are well documented in the literature. While a great
      deal of research has identified specific clinical indications for many antidepressants
      currently available in the general population, little is known about the clinical indications
      of these agents in SCI. This study is proposed to test the benefits of Venlafaxine HCI
      (Effexor XR) for reducing mild to moderate symptoms of depression among people with SCI. The
      intervention will last 12 weeks and there will be 13 assessments and data collection points.
      Data will be collected at 26 weeks also. Eight face to face contacts are anticipated.

      Because of the change in protocol to reducing mild to moderate symptoms and substantially
      lower enrollment than anticipated (1/6th of what we anticipated), we deleted a number of
      study outcomes listed in the 2011 posting of this study. Most of these were not part of the
      original posting in 2008, and those that were deleted were no longer relevant to new
      protocol's focus on reducing mild to moderate depression. The two outcomes reported here were
      most relevant to the revised protocol.

    <measure>16-Item Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology - Self Report (QIDS-SR16)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 13</time_frame>
    <description>The QIDS assesses symptoms of depression across the nine DSM-IV criterion domains for major depressive episode. The primary end-point in this study was the number of participants who had a &gt;50% change in scores on the QIDs from baseline to week 13 (end of treatment period).</description>

    <measure>Depression Scale of the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and weeks 1, 2, 3, 5, 9, 13, 14, 15, 16, 18, 20 and 26 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The nine items of the PHQ-9 are based directly on the nine diagnostic criteria for major depressive disorder in the DSM-IV. Higher total scores indicate more severe symptomatology, ranging from 0 (no symptoms) to 27 (most severe symptoms). Data in the tables begin with the overall mean for each group that includes all subjects, average across all assessment time points. Each subsequent row reports the mean and standard deviation of each time point by allocation, noting sample size for each group in the arm/group title given missing data in each time point after baseline.</description>

    <description>Venlafaxine HCl is classified as a selective serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SSNRI) and has been approved by the FDA for the treatment of major depressive disorder. The treatment group will receive a sub-therapeutic dose over a two week period, with a two week titration, starting at 37.5 mg up to a maximum dose of 150 mg per day. At the end of the treatment period, dosage was tapered down in a step-wise fashion over a period of three weeks; 75 mg. for two weeks and 37.5 mg. for one week. While this was the standard protocol, study drug tapering was individualized based on side effects and the clinical judgment of the prescriber.</description>

      <recruitment_details>Recruitment into the final protocol began in May 2009 and continued through July 2011. Participants were recruited from the surrounding community through clinics, existing research studies, and community organizations.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>Because of challenges of recruiting inpatients with new injuries, the final modification to the protocol was to restrict inclusion criteria to those with chronic SCI (&gt;6 months after injury) and the objective of the study shifted from preventing a major depressive episode to a reduction in symptoms. Therefore 13 / 34 enrolled were ineligible.</pre_assignment_details>

            <description>Venlafaxine HCl is classified as a selective serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SSNRI) and has been approved by the FDA for the treatment of major depressive disorder. The treatment group will receive a sub-therapeutic dose over a two week period, with a two week titration, starting at 37.5 mg up to a maximum dose of 150 mg per day. At the end of the treatment period, dosage was tapered down in a step-wise fashion over a period of three weeks; 75 mg. for two weeks and 37.5 mg. for one week. While this was the standard protocol, study drug tapering was individualized based on side effects and the clinical judgment of the prescriber.</description>

        <description>The nine items of the PHQ-9 are based directly on the nine diagnostic criteria for major depressive disorder in the DSM-IV.

Data in the tables begin with the overall mean for each group that includes all subjects, average across all assessment time points. Each subsequent row reports the mean and standard deviation of each time point by allocation, noting sample size for each group in the arm/group title given missing data in each time point after baseline.</description>

            <groups_desc>A linear mixed model (LMM) analysis was used and included a random intercept effect based on lowest Akaike’s Information Criterion values when we compared three random coefficient models (intercept, slope and intercept and slope). To examine whether allocation group influenced the effect of time and baseline PHQ-9 sore on the trajectory of PHQ-9 scores, we included two interaction terms (time by allocation group and baseline PHQ-9 score by allocation group).</groups_desc>

          <title>Venlafaxine</title>
          <description>Venlafaxine HCl is classified as a selective serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SSNRI) and has been approved by the FDA for the treatment of major depressive disorder. The treatment group will receive a sub-therapeutic dose over a two week period, with a two week titration, starting at 37.5 mg up to a maximum dose of 150 mg per day. At the end of the treatment period, dosage was tapered down in a step-wise fashion over a period of three weeks; 75 mg. for two weeks and 37.5 mg. for one week. While this was the standard protocol, study drug tapering was individualized based on side effects and the clinical judgment of the prescriber.</description>
