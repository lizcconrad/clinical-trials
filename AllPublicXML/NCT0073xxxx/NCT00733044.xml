  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background: Tinnitus is a common chronic health condition that affects 10% to 20% of the
      general population. Among severe sufferers it causes disability in various areas. As a result
      of the tinnitus quality of life is often impaired. At present there is no cure or uniformly
      effective treatment, leading to fragmentized and costly tinnitus care. Evidence suggests an
      integral multidisciplinary approach in treating tinnitus is effective. The main objective of
      this study is to examine the effectiveness, costs, and cost-effectiveness of an integral
      treatment provided by a specialized tinnitus center versus usual care. This paper describes
      the study protocol.

      Methods/Design: In a randomized controlled clinical trial 198 tinnitus patients will be
      randomly assigned to a specialized tinnitus care group or a usual care group. Adult tinnitus
      sufferers referred to the audiological centre are eligible. Included patients will be
      followed for 12 months.

      Primary outcome measure is generic quality of life (measured with the Health Utilities Index
      Mark III). Secondary outcomes are severity of tinnitus, general distress, tinnitus
      cognitions, tinnitus specific fear, and costs. Based on health state utility outcome data the
      number of patients to include is 198. Economic evaluation will be from a societal
      perspective.

      Discussion/ Conclusion: This is, to our knowledge, the first randomized controlled trial that
      evaluates an integral treatment of tinnitus that includes a full economic evaluation from a
      societal perspective. If this intervention proves to be effective and cost-effective,
      implementation of this intervention is considered and anticipated.

    <description>The intervention consists of the integration of integral tinnitus management provided by a specialized tinnitus centre in the health care system. The tinnitus centre offers care following a stepped-care approach with two levels. The first level of intervention consists of audiological diagnostics and intervention, a tinnitus educational group session and a individual consult with a clinical psychologist. For patients with mild complaints this basic intervention is expected to suffice. For patients with moderate to severe complaints a second level of intervention exists. This level of intervention consists of combinations of the following therapies: Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT), Attention Diversion (AD), exposure techniques, and Relaxation Therapy (RT).</description>

    <description>Usual care consists of a standardized version of treatment that is currently applied in peripheral audiological centres throughout the Netherlands. A telephone survey was conducted amongst all audiological centres (n=28) in the Netherlands. The results of this survey determined the content of the usual care treatment protocol in the current study. The treatment consists of audiological diagnostics and intervention and, if necessary, one or more consults with a social worker with a maximum of ten one hour sessions.</description>
