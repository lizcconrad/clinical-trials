  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research study is being conducted through the University of Pittsburgh Cancer Institute
      (UPCI). It will evaluate the concentrations of Gleevec®, an oral drug used to treat some
      types of cancer, in the blood of healthy volunteers when taken with and without Tums Ultra®,
      a calcium product often used in the treatment of upset stomach and as a calcium supplement.

      This is an open-label, single-institution, randomized cross-over, fixed-schedule
      investigation of the effects of calcium carbonate on the pharmacokinetics (PK) of Gleevec® in
      healthy volunteers. Healthy volunteers will be recruited to participate in this study such
      that twelve subjects (6 men / 6 women) will complete the study at UPCI. Subjects will be
      compensated for participation.

      Half of the subjects will receive Gleevec® alone on Day 1 and Gleevec® and calcium carbonate
      on Day 15, and the other half will receive Gleevec® and calcium carbonate on Day 1 and
      Gleevec® alone on Day 15, determined by randomization of subjects receiving either the
      combination or Gleevec® alone during the first visit. Doses will be 400 mg Gleevec® and 4000
      mg calcium carbonate (4 x Tums Ultra 1000® chewable tablets, equivalent to 4000 mg calcium
      carbonate or 1600 mg calcium.

      Multiple PK blood samples will be taken from Days 1-4 and Days 15-18. Gleevec® PK will be
      assessed after oral administration of 400 mg Gleevec® alone, and after oral administration of
      400 mg Gleevec® with concomitant administration of 4000 mg calcium carbonate. Two 10-hour
      outpatient dosing visits and six brief outpatient visits are required to accommodate all
      study procedures.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Healthy men or women 18 years of age or older. Healthy subjects are defined as
             individuals who are free from clinically significant illness or disease (such as
             coronary arterial disease, chronic heart failure, bleeding disorder, hypertension,
             chronic renal failure etc.) as determined by their medical history, physical
             examination, and laboratory studies. For the purposes of this protocol, &quot;clinically
             significant&quot; is defined as any history or indication of illness or disease, such as
             those listed above.

          -  Body Mass Index (BMI) &lt; 31 kg/m2 (weight/height2).

          -  Female patients of childbearing potential must have negative pregnancy test within 14
             days before initiation of study drug dosing. Postmenopausal women must be amenorrheic
             for at least 12 months to be considered of non-childbearing potential. Female patients
             of reproductive potential must agree to employ an effective barrier method of birth
             control throughout the study and for up to 7 days following discontinuation of study
             drug.

          -  Written, voluntary informed consent.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Abnormal marrow function as defined by leucocyte, neutrophil, or platelet counts
             outside of normal limits.

          -  Any evidence of renal dysfunction (proteinuria; serum creatinine &gt; upper limit of
             normal; or if serum creatinine &gt; upper limit of normal, a calculated creatinine
             clearance &lt; 60 mL/min/1.73 m2).

          -  Impaired hepatic function (liver enzymes greater than the upper limit of normal or
             bilirubin outside the normal range).

          -  Taking any medications (including over the counter products), herbal products, mineral
             supplements or vitamins (other than a daily multivitamin preparation), other than
             contraceptives (for women), within 2 weeks of start of the study. All forms of
             contraceptive medication are permissible for this study and would not result in a
             female's exclusion from participation. Patients who take medications on a chronic
             basis, such as antihypertensive medications or thyroid replacement therapy, etc. are
             not eligible for the study.

          -  Subjects has received any other investigational agents within 28 days of first day of
             study drug dosing.

          -  Female subjects who are pregnant or breast-feeding.
