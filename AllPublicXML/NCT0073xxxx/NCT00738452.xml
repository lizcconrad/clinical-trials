      RATIONALE: Radiation therapy uses high energy x-rays to kill tumor cells. Drugs used in
      chemotherapy, such as carboplatin, paclitaxel, cisplatin, and etoposide, work in different
      ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from
      dividing. Radiolabeled monoclonal antibodies can find tumor cells and carry tumor-killing
      substances to them without harming normal cells. Giving radiation therapy and combination
      chemotherapy together before radiolabeled monoclonal antibody therapy may kill more tumor
      cells.

      PURPOSE: This phase I trial is studying the side effects and best dose of radiolabeled
      monoclonal antibody therapy when given after radiation therapy and combination chemotherapy
      in treating patients with stages I-IIIB non-small cell lung cancer.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and associated
      toxicities of intravenous yttrium-90 (90Y) chimeric T84.66 (cT84.66) anti-carcinoembryonic
      antigen (CEA) antibody targeted radiotherapy delivered after carboplatin/paclitaxel or
      cisplatin/etoposide and external beam radiotherapy in patients with CEA positive stage III
      unresectable or medically inoperable non-small cell lung cancer.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. To collect data on the biodistribution, clearance and metabolism of
      90Y (yttrium-90) and 111In (indium-111) chimeric T84.66 administered intravenously. II. To
      collect data on radiation doses to whole body, normal organs, and tumor through serial
      nuclear imaging.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of yttrium Y 90 anti-CEA monoclonal antibody
      cT84.66.

      CHEMORADIOTHERAPY: Patients undergo external beam radiation therapy 5 days a week for 45
      days. Beginning within 24 hours of the start of radiation therapy, patients receive
      paclitaxel intravenously (IV) over 1 hour and carboplatin IV over 30 minutes on days 1, 8,
      15, 22, 29, and 36 OR cisplatin IV over 60 minutes on days 1, 8, 29, and 36 and etoposide IV
      over 60 minutes on days 1-5 and 29-33.

      CONSOLIDATION RADIOIMMUNOTHERAPY: Beginning 6-10 weeks after completion of chemoradiotherapy,
      patients with stable disease, partial response, or complete response receive a therapeutic
      dose of yttrium Y 90 anti-CEA monoclonal antibody cT84.66 IV. Treatment continues in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for up to 6 months
