  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-site, investigator-initiated, open-label, randomized/controlled clinical
      trial to compare the viral load response in plasma (and, in a subset of subjects, in
      gastrointestinal lymphoid tissue reservoirs) in subjects with acute/early HIV-1 infection
      treated with 12 weeks of raltegravir-based versus efavirenz-based ART (each combined with
      tenofovir/emtricitabine). Subjects will receive a self-limited course of therapy rather than
      a commitment to life-long HAART, as has been the experimental approach in a variety of
      clinical protocols in the United States and Europe. Subjects will complete a 12 week course
      of therapy, and those who meet treatment-response and safety criteria will then undergo a
      similarly intensive period of virology and immunology monitoring to compare the timing and
      dynamics of any observed virologic rebound following the treatment intervention.

    <description>Mean CD4 count between groups 1 month after starting study drug. CD4 cells are types of white blood cells called T lymphocytes or T cells that fight infection. CD4 counts are most often used to evaluate the immune system of a person diagnosed with a human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection to help stage and monitor progression of the disease and monitor effectiveness of antiretroviral treatment. A CD4 count is typically reported as an absolute level or count of cells (expressed as cells per cubic millimeter of blood). A normal CD4 count ranges from 410-1,590 cells/mm3. Sometimes results are expressed as a percent of total lymphocytes (CD4 percent).</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects 19 years of age or older who meet the NIH Acute Infection and Early Disease
             Research Program (AIEDRP) definition of acute or early HIV-1 infection. Briefly, acute
             HIV-1 infection is defined as &gt; 5000 copies per milliliter of HIV RNA and one of the
             following documented within a 7 day period of the initial positive PCR-based assay: 1)
             a negative HIV-1 EIA or 2) a positive EIA with a negative or indeterminant HIV-1
             Western Blot test (interpreted based on current CDC guidelines). For the purposes of
             this protocol, early HIV-1 infection is defined as detectable HIV RNA by PCR-based
             assay, a positive HIV EIA, a positive HIV-1 Western blot, and one of the following: 1)
             a documented negative HIV EIA in the preceding 6 months or 2) an HIV detuned EIA
             standardized optical density measurement (defined as sample OD - negative control OD/
             positive control OD) of &lt; 1.0 within 14 days of the positive HIV EIA (consistent with
             acute infection occurring in the past 120 days).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Lack consistent evidence of seroconversion or documented appropriate antibody testing
             for persistent HIV infection during the screening and early follow-up period.

          -  Prior receipt of antiretroviral therapy.

          -  Serum creatinine &gt; 2.0 x upper limit of normal or a calculated creatinine clearance at
             time of screening &lt; 30 mL/min (and 0.85X this value for females).

          -  Alkaline phosphatase &gt;5 x upper limit of normal.

          -  AST (SGOT) and ALT (SGPT) &gt; 5 x upper limit of normal. Repeat of a laboratory
             screening test will be allowed for test results that are unexpected based on
             documented prior laboratory results or to monitor declining trends that may relate to
             the primary retroviral syndrome.

          -  Have any severe medical illness that the investigators feel will interfere with the
             ability to take therapy or that will result in making therapy too risky for the
             subject. This includes active tuberculosis treatment, severe liver disease due to
             alcoholism or viral hepatitis, or unstable cardiovascular or cerebrovascular disease.

          -  Have significant psychiatric illness or ongoing substance abuse that, in the opinion
             of the investigators, would compromise the ability of the subject to provide adequate
             informed consent or to adhere to the study procedures safely and consistently.

          -  Women who are pregnant or actively breastfeeding at the time of screening.

          -  Men or women who are actively attempting to become pregnant, or who are unable or
             unwilling to institute adequate birth control measures during the entire course of
             this treatment protocol.

        <title>Mean Hematocrit Between Treatment Groups at 14 Months</title>
        <description>Mean hematocrit of all subjects at 14 months after starting study drug. The hematocrit, also known as packed cell volume (PCV) or erythrocyte volume fraction (EVF), is the volume percentage (%) of red blood cells in blood. It is normally 45% for men and 40% for women.</description>

The calculated number of platelets in a volume of blood, usually expressed as platelets per cubic millimeter (cmm) of whole blood. Platelets are the smallest cell-like structures in the blood and are important for blood clotting and plugging damaged blood vessels. Platelet counts are usually done by laboratory machines that also count other blood elements such as the white and red cells. They can also be counted by use of a microscope. Normal platelet counts are in the range of 150,000 to 400,000 per microliter (or 150 - 400 x 100 per liter).</description>

        <title>Mean Platelet Count Between Treatment Groups at 12 Months</title>
        <description>The mean platelet count between treatment groups at 12 months after starting study drug. The calculated number of platelets in a volume of blood, usually expressed as platelets per cubic millimeter (cmm) of whole blood. Platelets are the smallest cell-like structures in the blood and are important for blood clotting and plugging damaged blood vessels. Platelet counts are usually done by laboratory machines that also count other blood elements such as the white and red cells. They can also be counted by use of a microscope. Normal platelet counts are in the range of 150,000 to 400,000 per microliter (or 150 - 400 x 109 per liter).</description>

        <description>Mean CD4 count between groups 1 month after starting study drug. CD4 cells are types of white blood cells called T lymphocytes or T cells that fight infection. CD4 counts are most often used to evaluate the immune system of a person diagnosed with a human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection to help stage and monitor progression of the disease and monitor effectiveness of antiretroviral treatment. A CD4 count is typically reported as an absolute level or count of cells (expressed as cells per cubic millimeter of blood). A normal CD4 count ranges from 410–1,590 cells/mm3. Sometimes results are expressed as a percent of total lymphocytes (CD4 percent).</description>

        <title>Mean CD4 Count Between Treatment Groups at 4 Months</title>
        <description>Mean CD4 count between groups 4 months after starting study drug. CD4 cells are types of white blood cells called T lymphocytes or T cells that fight infection. CD4 counts are most often used to evaluate the immune system of a person diagnosed with a human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection to help stage and monitor progression of the disease and monitor effectiveness of antiretroviral treatment. A CD4 count is typically reported as an absolute level or count of cells (expressed as cells per cubic millimeter of blood). A normal CD4 count ranges from 410-1,590 cells/mm3 in adults and teens. Sometimes results are expressed as a percent of total lymphocytes (CD4 percent).</description>

        <title>Mean CD4 Count Between Treatment Groups at 10 Months</title>
        <description>Mean CD4 count between groups 10 months after starting study drug. CD4 cells are types of white blood cells called T lymphocytes or T cells that fight infection. CD4 counts are most often used to evaluate the immune system of a person diagnosed with a human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection to help stage and monitor progression of the disease and monitor effectiveness of antiretroviral treatment. A CD4 count is typically reported as an absolute level or count of cells (expressed as cells per cubic millimeter of blood). A normal CD4 count ranges from 410-1,590 cells/mm3 in adults and teens.
