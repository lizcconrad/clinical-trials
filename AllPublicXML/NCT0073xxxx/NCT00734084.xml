    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of this investigation is to evaluate the surgical performance of the
      DePuy Minimally Invasive (Preservation) Unicompartmental Knee and Instrumentation in a
      Multi-centre setting.

      The secondary objective of this investigation is to evaluate the long-term survivorship of
      the DePuy Minimally Invasive (Preservation) Unicompartmental Knee.

      Primary endpoint - to demonstrate the suitability of the developed instrumentation to safely
      and accurately implant the preservation Unicompartmental Knee using postoperative
      radiographic limb and component alignment data.

      Secondary endpoints - to demonstrate the survivorship and performance of the Preservation
      Unicompartmental Knee using the American Knee Society clinical and radiological assessment,
      Oxford Knee Score and survivorship analysis.

             could effect follow-up care or treatment outcomes.

          -  Subjects who have participated in a clinical study with an investigational product in
             the last month.

          -  Subjects who are currently involved in any injury litigation claims.
