  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if the opioid agonist effects of doses of 4/1 mg,
      8/2 mg, and 16/4 mg of buprenorphine/naloxone can be completely blocked by 50 mg of oral
      naltrexone. This study will provide data to support the design of a similar study of the
      depot formulation of naltrexone and ultimately to study this combination for the treatment of
      cocaine dependence.
