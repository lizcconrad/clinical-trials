    <description>Percentage of participants with objective response based on assessment of confirmed complete response (CR) or confirmed partial response (PR) according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST). Confirmed response are those that persist on repeat imaging study at least 4 weeks after initial documentation of response. CR are those with disappearance of all target lesions. PR are those with at least 30 percent decrease in sum of the longest dimensions of target lesions taking as a reference the baseline sum longest dimensions.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Overall Survival (OS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline until death or assessed every 2 months (up to 28 days after the last dose)</time_frame>
    <description>Time in months from the start of study treatment to date of death due to any cause. OS was calculated as (the death date minus the date of first dose of study medication plus 1) divided by 30.4. Death was determined from adverse event data (where outcome was death) or from follow-up contact data (where the participant current status was death).</description>

    <measure>Progression Free Survival (PFS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, assessed every 2 months (up to 28 days after the last dose)</time_frame>
    <description>Time in months from start of study treatment to the first documentation of objective tumor progression or to death due to any cause. PFS calculated as (Months) = (first event date minus first dose date plus 1) divided by 30.4. Tumor progression was determined from oncologic assessment data (where data meet the criteria for progressive disease [PD]), or from adverse event (AE) data (where the outcome was &quot;Death&quot;).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>

    <measure>Duration of Response (DR)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline until disease progression or discontinuation from the study due to any cause, assessed every 6 weeks during chemotherapy phase and every 8 weeks during single agent phase up to final study visit (Week 78)</time_frame>
    <description>Time in months from the first documentation of objective tumor response to objective tumor progression or death due to any cause. Duration of tumor response was calculated as (the date of the first documentation of objective tumor progression or death due to cancer minus the date of the first CR or PR that was subsequently confirmed plus 1) divided by 30.4. DR was calculated for the subgroup of participants with a confirmed objective tumor response.</description>
