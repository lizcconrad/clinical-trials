    <textblock>
      This is a single centre, double-blind, randomised, parallel group, placebo controlled study
      to assess the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of AZD1386 when given as multiple
      doses to 32 (24 healthy young and 8 healthy elderly) Japanese subjects. For young healthy
      subjects (aged ≥20 to ≤45 inclusive) 3 consecutive multiple ascending dose panels are
      planned. For elderly healthy subjects (aged ≥65 to≤80 inclusive) 1 multiple dose panel is
      planned.

             values and normal resting ECG

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  History of somatic or psychiatric disease/condition, which may interfere with the
             objectives of the study as judged by the investigator

          -  A family history of short or long QT syndrome (SQTS) or sudden cardiac death (SCD)
             amongst first degree relatives

          -  Subjects with orthostatic hypotension defined as a decrease of ≥ 25mmHg systolic blood
             pressure and/or a decrease of ≥15mmHg diastolic blood pressure within 5 minutes when
             going from a supine to standing position

          -  Clinically significant illness or clinically relevant trauma within 2 weeks prior to
             the administration of the investigational product as judged by the investigator
