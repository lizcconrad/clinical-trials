  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to investigate the safety and tolerability of AZD1704
      following single ascending doses in healthy Japanese male and non-fertile female volunteers
      by assessment of adverse events (AEs), vital signs (supine and standing blood pressure, pulse
      rate, respiratory rate and body temperature), safety laboratory variables and 12 lead
      electrocardiography (ECG). The secondary objectives of the study are: to investigate the
      subjective CNS effects of orally administered AZD1704 in healthy Japanese male and
      non-fertile female volunteers on a psychometric rating scale by assessment of specific
      adjectives (stimulated, anxious, sedated, down and high) rated on visual analogue mood scale
      (VAMS) and to investigate the pharmacokinetic profile of AZD1704 following single ascending
      doses in healthy Japanese male and non-fertile female volunteers.

  <overall_status>Terminated</overall_status>
  <why_stopped>
    AZD1704 has essentially similar PK profile in Japanese subjects as in Caucasians. One of the
    main purposes of the study has thereby been achieved.
