    <measure>Mean Change From Baseline in Daily rTNSS Over the Entire Treatment Period (28 Days)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline through Week 4 (28 days)</time_frame>
    <description>The Total Nasal Symptom Score (TNSS) is the sum (scale 0-9) of the individual nasal scores for rhinorrhea, nasal congestion, and post-nasal drip. All symptoms were evaluated using a scale of 0 (None), 1 (Mild), 2 (Moderate), or 3 (Severe). Reflective (r) assessments were performed in the morning (AM) and evening (PM) and assessed the participant's symptoms over the preceding 12 hours. The daily reflective Total Nasal Symptoms Score (daily rTNSS) is the average of the AM and PM rTNSS. Mean change from baseline was calculated as the participant's treatment period mean minus the baseline mean.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline through Week 4 (28 days)</time_frame>
    <description>The TNSS is the Total Nasal Symptom Score (scale 0-9), a sum of the individual nasal scores for (1) rhinorrhea, (2) nasal congestion, and (3) post-nasal drip. All 3 symptoms were evaluated using a scale of: 0 (None), 1 (Mild), 2 (Moderate), or 3 (Severe). Reflective (r) assessments were performed in the morning (AM) and evening (PM) and assessed the participant's symptoms over the preceding 12 hours (AM rTNSS, PM rTNSS). The AM pre-dose instantaneous assessment (AM pre-dose iTNSS) was performed in the morning just prior to dosing and assessed symptoms at that moment.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline through Week 4 (28 days)</time_frame>
    <description>Mean change for the individual symptoms of rhinorrhea, nasal congestion, and post-nasal drip. Reflective rating represents the participant's symptoms over the preceding 12 hours. Reflective assessments were performed in the morning (AM) and evening (PM). The daily reflective individual nasal symptom score average of the AM and PM reflective individual nasal symptoms is the daily reflective individual nasal symptom score. All symptoms were evaluated on a 0 (none) to 3 (severe) scale.</description>

    <description>The AM pre-dose instantaneous assessment is performed in the morning prior to dosing and evaluates symptoms at that moment. The individual symptoms of rhinorrhea, nasal congestion, and post-nasal drip were measured at this time. All three symptoms were evaluated using a 0 (none) to 3 (severe) scale. This assessment provides information on the duration of action of the treatment.</description>

    <measure>Mean Change From Baseline in Total Ocular Symptoms Over the Entire Treatment Period (28 Days)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline through Week 4 (28 days)</time_frame>
    <description>The Total Ocular Symptom Score (TOSS) is a sum (scale 0-9) of the individual ocular scores for eye itching/burning, eye tearing/watering, and eye redness. All 3 symptoms were evaluated using a scale of 0 (None), 1 (Mild), 2 (Moderate), or 2 (Severe). The daily reflective TOSS (daily rTOSS) is the average of the morning (AM) and evening (PM) rTOSS assessments that measure symptoms over the previous 12 hours. The AM pre-dose instantaneous (iTOSS) assessment is performed in the morning prior to dosing and evaluates symptoms at that moment, providing data on the duration of action of treatment.</description>

             or

          -  Females of childbearing potential who are not sexually active must commit to complete
             abstinence from intercourse for two weeks before exposure to the study drug,
             throughout the clinical trial, and for a period after the trial to account for

          -  Double barrier method - spermicide plus a mechanical barrier (e.g., spermicide plus a
             male condom or a spermicide and female diaphragm).

        Female subjects should not be enrolled if they plan to become pregnant during the time of
        study participation. A urine pregnancy test will be performed at the screening visit (Visit
        1), the randomisation visit (Visit 2) and at the final visit (Visit 6 or Early Withdrawal).

          -  Clinical history: Diagnosis or evidence of air pollution triggers as the predominant

                  predominantly by air pollution exposure (written or verbal confirmation) in the
                  opinion of the investigator and evidence of symptoms such as rhinorrhea, nasal
                  congestion and postnasal drip relating to concentration of air particulates, air
                  quality and levels of exposure.

               -  Based on the trigger questionnaire, subjects must indicate that air pollution is
                  the predominant trigger that makes their rhinitis symptoms worse completed at
                  Visit 1.

        <title>Mean Change From Baseline in Daily rTNSS Over the Entire Treatment Period (28 Days)</title>
        <description>The Total Nasal Symptom Score (TNSS) is the sum (scale 0-9) of the individual nasal scores for rhinorrhea, nasal congestion, and post-nasal drip. All symptoms were evaluated using a scale of 0 (None), 1 (Mild), 2 (Moderate), or 3 (Severe). Reflective (r) assessments were performed in the morning (AM) and evening (PM) and assessed the participant's symptoms over the preceding 12 hours. The daily reflective Total Nasal Symptoms Score (daily rTNSS) is the average of the AM and PM rTNSS. Mean change from baseline was calculated as the participant's treatment period mean minus the baseline mean.</description>

        <description>The Total Ocular Symptom Score (TOSS) is a sum (scale 0-9) of the individual ocular scores for eye itching/burning, eye tearing/watering, and eye redness. All 3 symptoms were evaluated using a scale of 0 (None), 1 (Mild), 2 (Moderate), or 2 (Severe). The daily reflective TOSS (daily rTOSS) is the average of the morning (AM) and evening (PM) rTOSS assessments that measure symptoms over the previous 12 hours. The AM pre-dose instantaneous (iTOSS) assessment is performed in the morning prior to dosing and evaluates symptoms at that moment, providing data on the duration of action of treatment.</description>
