  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Changes in chelation treatment and transfusion practices, during the past two decades, have
      dramatically improved the prognosis of thalassemia major patients.Deferiprone (DFP) has been
      compared with deferoxamine (DFO), using different schedules of treatment, in the majority of
      the 13 clinical trials published between 1990 and 2008.No statistically significant
      difference was shown between these two interventions during, at most, 18 months of
      treatment.Three randomised trials that compared sequential DFP-DFO treatment versus DFO alone
      reported controversial results but this could be due to small sample sizes and short
      treatment duration. In fact, no trial with treatment duration longer than 18 months15, which
      reported on mortality, adverse events, serum ferritin concentrations, as well as costs has so
      far been published.

      This long-term sequential DFP-DFO treatment versus DFP alone treatment trial was conducted to
      assess the impacts of these chelation treatments on serum ferritin concentrations, mortality,
      adverse events, and costs in thalassemia major patients.

      The trial was designed as a multicentre randomised open-label trial with blinded data
      management and data analyses, to assess whether either treatment was superior to the other.
      The trial was performed on behalf of the Italian Society for the study of Thalassemia and
      Haemoglobinopathies (SoSTE). The investigators initiated, carried out, and controlled the
      trial, which was conducted without influence of the non-commercial sponsor.16
