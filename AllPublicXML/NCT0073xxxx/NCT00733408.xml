  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well giving paclitaxel albumin-stabilized nanoparticle
      (Nab-paclitaxel) formulation together with bevacizumab followed by bevacizumab and erlotinib
      hydrochloride work in treating patients with metastatic breast cancer. Drugs used in
      chemotherapy, such as paclitaxel albumin-stabilized nanoparticle formulation, work in
      different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping
      them from dividing. Monoclonal antibodies, such as bevacizumab, can prevent cancer growth by
      blocking the ability of cancer cells to grow and spread. Erlotinib hydrochloride may stop the
      growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. This trial
      evaluates a maintenance treatment with erlotinib and bevacizumab after Nab-paclitaxel and
      bevacizumab which may control cancer growth with biologic therapies.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Progression free survival.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Response rate.

      II. Overall survival.

      III. Safety and toxicity.

      IV. Exploratory biomarkers will be assessed as potential predictors of response to treatment
      including: expression of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and secreted protein acidic
      and rich in cysteine (SPARC) in the primary tumor and changes in levels of circulating tumor
      cells (CTCs) and circulating endothelial cells (CECs).

      OUTLINE:

      INDUCTION THERAPY: Patients receive paclitaxel albumin-stabilized nanoparticle formulation
      intravenously (IV) on days 1, 8, and 15 and bevacizumab IV over 30-90 minutes on days 1 and
      15. Treatment repeats every 28 days for 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      MAINTENANCE THERAPY: Patients achieving complete response, partial response, or stable
      disease after completion of induction therapy will receive bevacizumab IV over 30-90 minutes
      once every 14 or 21 days and erlotinib hydrochloride orally (PO) once daily (QD) in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up per physician discretion.

    <time_frame>Time from date of registration to date of first documentation of progression or symptomatic deterioration or death due to any cause, assessed up to 8 years</time_frame>
    <description>Kaplan-Meier survival curves will be used. A 95% confidence interval for the median PFS will be calculated. A lower bound greater than 8 months would be strong evidence that Nab-Paclitaxel- bevacizumab induction therapy followed by bevacizumab-erlotinib hydrochloride maintenance therapy is superior to paclitaxel and bevacizumab. However, a median PFS of 13 months or greater (regardless of whether the 95% confidence interval for the median extends below 8 months) could also indicate promising results.</description>
