    <textblock>
      The purpose of study is to conduct a pivotal evaluation of the EndoPhotonix™ SOLAR™ System
      and ATRILAZE™ System in order to obtain a labeling claim on the devices for the treatment of
      atrial fibrillation.

      The study will test the safety and effectiveness of the EndoPhotonix™ Laser Ablation Systems
      to photocoagulate cardiac tissue during cardiac surgery, to create electrical isolation of
      the pulmonary veins and create other electrical isolation lesions in order to treat atrial
      fibrillation. The surgical procedure will be conducted during concomitant mitral valve repair
      or replacement surgery or in combination with other cardiac surgery including aortic valve
      surgery, tricuspid valve surgery, or coronary artery bypass surgery.

      The study objective is to generate Level II controlled data to support the expansion of
      indications for the SOLAR™ System based on 0-30 day data; as well as to support the expansion
      of indications for the SOLAR™ System and ATRILAZE™ System for the treatment of atrial
      fibrillation based on 180 days data. The data will be evaluated by comparing post-operative
      data to the historical control data. The subjects in the study cohort will receive laser
      ablation therapy using the investigational device during a concomitant surgical procedure.

             electrical cardioversion. Long term persistent AF is defined as continuous AF of
             greater than three months duration.
