    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, multi-site, 6-month study of an investigational compound in elderly
      outpatients, age 65 years old or above, to assess the long-term safety and tolerability of
      the compound in the treatment of elderly subjects with Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD).
