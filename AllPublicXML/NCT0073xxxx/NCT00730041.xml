      The study will be done for the following purposes:

        -  to see if Pillar implants in combination with CPAP therapy can help people with their
           OSA by decreasing the CPAP pressures

        -  to find out if receiving Pillar implants will increase CPAP use

      Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA) is the intermittent cessation of breathing during sleep due to
      the collapse of the pharyngeal airway. As reported in the April 2004 Journal of the American
      Medical Association, it is estimated that 59 million people in the United States suffer OSA
      symptoms. OSA is typically diagnosed through an overnight sleep study (polysomnogram or PSG)
      in a sleep laboratory or a portable monitoring system. The American Academy of Sleep
      Medicine's (AASM) recommended treatment for patients with OSA is Continuous Positive Airway
      Pressure (CPAP), which is a life-long therapy that requires subjects to wear a nasal or
      facial mask connected to a portable airflow generator while sleeping. CPAP therapy is
      intended to treat OSA by preventing collapse of the upper airway during sleep with the use of
      positive pressure. Compliance with CPAP therapy may be a problem as fewer than 50% of
      patients using CPAP have been considered &quot;regular&quot; users due to a variety of factors such as
      claustrophobia, nasal stuffiness, social factors, and inconvenience.

      The Pillar® Palatal Implant System is currently commercially available in the United States,
      Europe, and other countries to treat habitual snoring and mild to moderate OSA. It is a
      minimally invasive, well-tolerated procedure that reduces the flexibility of the soft palate
      and increases its stiffness, which reduces snoring and may limit the palate's ability to
      collapse into the airway during sleep contributing to clinical episodes of OSA.

      The Pillar system consists of a delivery system and an implant. The delivery system is
      comprised of a disposable handle and needle assembly that allows for positioning and
      placement of the implants within the soft palate. The 18mm x 2mm implant is a cylindrical
      shaped segment of braided polyester filaments that is intended for permanent implantation
      into the soft palate. The needle of the delivery system is inserted into the soft palate,
      near the hard palate junction. A sliding thumb switch is retracted to deploy the implant. The
      first implant is placed midline and two additional implants are placed, one on each side
      approximately 2mm from the midline implant, for a total of three implants.

      An antiseptic rinse is recommended pre-procedure and an appropriate broad-spectrum antibiotic
      should be given both pre and post-procedurally. Local anesthesia is used in all patients.
      Pain medication is suggested to manage discomfort in the immediate post-operative period.

      While the Pillar procedure can be effective in the treatment of mild to moderate OSA, its
      effect in combination with CPAP treatment has never been studied. In this study, the
      treatment of OSA using the Pillar procedure in combination with standard CPAP treatment vs.
      sham procedure in combination with standard CPAP treatment will be investigated. All subjects
      will be asked to continue their normal use of CPAP treatment during the study. The study will
      evaluate whether or not the Pillar implants allow less therapeutic pressure to be used in
      treating the OSA and if less pressure translates to increased usage.

    <description>The Pillar system is intended as an initial treatment option for mild to moderate OSA. It consists of a delivery system and an implant. The delivery system is comprised of a disposable handle and needle assembly that allows for positioning and placement of the implant within the soft palate of the mouth. The 18mm x 2mm implant is a cylindrical shaped segment of braided polyester filaments that is intended for permanent implantation into the soft palate. The implant is pre-loaded into the needle. Three implants are placed in each subject under local anesthesia. Because implants are not able to be seen in the soft palate tissue, the physician is unable to see if an implant is placed or not placed and thus is blinded to the intervention type.</description>

    <description>The Pillar system consists of a delivery system and an implant. The only difference between the treatment and sham arm in this study is that the sham delivery device is not pre-loaded with the implant. Otherwise the appearance, manufacturing and function of the delivery devices are identical. Three insertions are made, but no implants are actually deployed during the procedure. Because implants are not able to be seen in the soft palate tissue, the physician is unable to see if an implant is placed or not placed and thus is blinded to the intervention type.</description>

        <description>The American Academy of Sleep Medicine’s (AASM) recommended treatment for patients with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP), which is a life-long therapy that requires subjects to wear a nasal or facial mask connected to a portable airflow generator while sleeping. CPAP therapy is intended to prevent collapse of the upper airway. CPAP pressures are measured in centimeters of water, and range in whole numbers from 4cm H2O to 20cm H2O. The therapeutic pressure is usually determined during overnight polysomnography and usually performed by a technician.</description>

        <title>Measurement of Total Leak as Recorded by SmartCard (Home Compliance Feature of the Continuous Positive Airway Pressure Machine)</title>
        <description>Leak is an indicator of mask/headgear fit and can also be used to substantiate or contradict an assigned therapeutic pressure. Total leak is the sum of intentional leak to prevent carbon dioxide rebreathing and unintentional leak. Each mask has a known amount of leak (the intentional leak), and subjects were instructed not to changes masks to minimize this variable. Approximate range is 0-100, and the amount of leak increases as the number increases. Average leak values are in the 20-50 liters per minute range. The CPAP machine records leak data during each night of usage and can average.</description>

        <description>The Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) was included in the subject questionnaire as a tool to further assess the quality of sleep for each subject throughout the follow-up period. This scale is a validated clinical indicator that quantifies the patient’s chance of falling asleep during eight different activities of daily living such as reading, talking, resting and driving. Each of the eight questions has four possible responses: 0 = would never doze, 1 = slight chance of dozing, 2 = moderate chance of dozing to 3 = high chance of dozing, for a possible maximum score of 24.</description>

        <description>The FOSQ can assess the quality of sleep and this scale is a validated measure the impact of excessive sleepiness on multiple activities of daily living. It has 30 questions in 5 subgroups of general productivity (8 questions), social outcome (2), activity level (9), vigilance (7), and intimate relationships and sexual activity (4). Responses for each question range from 1 (extreme difficulty or low activity level) to 4 (no difficulty or high activity level) for each subgroup. A mean is calculated for each subgroup, and then the mean of the subgroups is calculated and multiplied by 5.</description>
