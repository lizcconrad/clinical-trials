    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to examine how certain kinds of fruit juice that contain natural
      antioxidants and natural anti-inflammatory properties may reduce exercise-induced muscle pain
      and injury. Participants will be recruited from registered participants in the Hood To Coast
      Relay. The Hood To Coast Relay Race Officials will post the study on their website to find
      interested teams. Interested participants will then be contacted by the study staff by phone
      regarding the study's inclusion and exclusion criteria and to schedule the initial health
      screening visit. The participants will undergo an initial health screening and survey about
      muscle soreness, and then drink the investigational juice twice daily for 8 days. On the 7th
      day of drink administration, the participants will report to the starting location of the
      Hood To Coast Relay to meet with the investigators for 30 minutes to survey muscle pain and
      juice tolerability. The participants will then participate in the Hood To Coast Relay,
      drinking 2 more bottles of juice over the duration of the relay. At the conclusion of the
      relay, the participants will meet with study investigators to take the same short survey
      about muscle pain and juice tolerability.
