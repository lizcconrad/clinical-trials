  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Jaundice is the most frequent reason for readmission for healthy newborns after discharge
      from the nursery. In the Capital Health area, around 2.5% (315 babies in 2005) of all healthy
      newborns were admitted to the hospital for jaundice. Although jaundice is very common, it is
      not always a benign condition. If left untreated, it can have devastating consequences
      including cerebral palsy and hearing loss. It is therefore critical to be able to identify
      the newborns at risk for severe jaundice. So far, heel puncture of blood collection has been
      the traditional method to monitor jaundice in newborns. This causes pain to infants,
      generates anxiety in parents, and consumes significant health care resources. The aim of this
      study is to evaluate the efficacy of a new and noninvasive screening tool, the transcutaneous
      bilirubinometer, in detecting babies in our communities who require hospital readmission.
      This study will demonstrate whether incorporating transcutaneous bilirubinometer in the home
      care program delivered by nurses of Healthy Beginning allows the early detection of babies at
      risk of developing severe jaundice at a lower cost and with less discomfort.

    <description>In the 7 control Capital Health community health centers, babies will be followed up according to the current policy. Bilirubin determinations will be performed at the discretion of the visiting nurse if the infant is inappropriately jaundiced or at the request of the physician if risk factors are present. Transcutaneous Bilirubinometers will not be available in each of these 7 centers for all the duration of the study.</description>

    <description>For all eligible babies living in the 7 intervention community health centers, a Transcutaneous Bilirubinometer will be routinely used by all community nurses in conjunction with an algorithm that will guide the nursing management of the neonates based on the values obtained.Depending on the level of bilirubin obtained and whether risk factors (gestational age &lt; 38 weeks, blood group incompatibility with DAT positive) are present or not, a different management plan will apply. The algorithm is based on curves established by Bhutani et al to predict the risk of significant hyperbilirubinemia based on predischarge bilirubin measurements.</description>
