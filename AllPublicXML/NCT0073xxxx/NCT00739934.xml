  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study we will measure the concentration of the drug called voriconazole which is used
      to fight infections caused by fungus in children who usually are cancer patients and have
      their immune system down. Since we know the dose in adults, and we think we know the matching
      doses in the young patients ages 2 to 12 years old, we will compare the amount of drug that
      goes into the system with what we know works in adults. We give the drug by a needle directly
      into the blood, then few days later we stop that and give the drug by mouth. Meanwhile, we
      draw a little bit of blood at certain times to measure the drug in it.

Notes:
If unable to switch to oral medication on Day 8, subjects can continue with IV treatment up to Day 20 before switching to oral dose.
Only morning oral dose will be given on Day 14 (or the seventh day of oral dosing if IV regimen is extended). However, if clinically indicated, voriconazole treatment may be continued up to Day 30.
