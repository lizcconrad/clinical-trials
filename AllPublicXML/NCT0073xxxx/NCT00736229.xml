      Diabetic patients with acute myocardial infarction (MI) have particularly poor outcomes.
      Clinical practice guidelines from the American College of Cardiology/American Heart
      Association for the treatment of patients with acute coronary syndromes call for treatment to
      achieve preprandial glucose &lt;110 mg/dL, a maximum daily target &lt;180 mg/dL, and a
      post-discharge hemoglobin A1c &lt;7%. Initiation of aggressive insulin therapy is also warranted
      to achieve blood glucose &lt;150 mg/dL during days 0-3 and 80-110 mg/dL when possible
      thereafter. To date, no studies have been conducted assessing the efficacy of intravenous
      exenatide administration on achieving glucose lowering in hyperglycemic coronary ICU
      patients.

          <description>In September 2009, the intensive glucose control protocol in ACS patients was modified to reflect emerging data on glucose management in the ICU.

          <description>In 2008, the Mid America Heart and Vascular Institute implemented an intensive glucose control protocol using IV insulin in critically ill hyperglycemic patients hospitalized with ACS. All patients admitted with blood glucose ≥140 mg/dL received intravenous insulin infusion to achieve a target blood glucose 90-120 mg/dL. The efficacy of this protocol has been studied compared to ACS patients with admission blood glucose &gt;140 mg/dL admitted prior to protocol implementation.</description>

            <description>Patients with admission blood glucose values of 140-400 mg/dL admitted to the coronary intensive care unit were eligible. Patients that provided consent were intravenously infused with Exenatide as a 0.05 mcg/min bolus for 30 minutes followed by a fixed 0.025 mcg/min dose for up to 48 hours. Blood glucose values were measured hourly following commencement of infusion.</description>

            <description>In September 2009, the intensive glucose control protocol in acute coronary syndrome (ACS) patients was modified to reflect emerging data on glucose management in the ICU. From this point forward, all patients with an admission blood glucose &gt;180 mg/dL received intravenous insulin infusion to achieve a target blood glucose 100-140 mg/dL. These data came from a medical record review and the retrospective data collection and analysis were approved by the Saint Luke's Hospital Institutional Review Board.</description>

            <description>In 2008, the Mid America Heart and Vascular Institute implemented an intensive glucose control protocol using IV insulin in critically ill hyperglycemic patients hospitalized with ACS. All patients admitted with blood glucose ≥140 mg/dL received intravenous insulin infusion to achieve a target blood glucose 90-120 mg/dL. The efficacy of this protocol has been studied compared to ACS patients with admission blood glucose &gt;140 mg/dL admitted prior to protocol implementation.
