    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if intensive insulin therapy really reduces the
      incidence of acute kidney injury in critically ill patients, using for analysis the RIFLE
      criteria for definition of AKI.

    <description>Group 1 (Carbohydrate Restrictive Strategy). Patients received intravenous hydration with a glucose free solution (Ringer III) and enteral nutritional formula containing 33.3% carbohydrates, 16,7% proteins and 50% lipids (Glucerna, Abbott Laboratories). These patients received regular insulin subcutaneously four times daily, aiming to maintain blood glucose levels at least below 180 mg/dl, and, in stable patients, ideally below 150 mg/dl.</description>

    <description>Group 2 (Intensive Insulin Therapy). Continuous intravenous insulin infusion was adjusted to maintain glycemic levels at least below 150 mg/dl, and, in stable patients and ideally, between 80 to 120 mg/dl. Patients were submitted to capillary glycemic measurements every 2 hours. The insulin dose was adjusted according to an algorithm run by nurses and overseen by physicians. These patients received glucosaline (5% glucose + 0.9 NaCl) hydration and enteral nutrition with a formula containing 45% carbohydrates, 17% proteins and 38% lipids (Diason, Nutricia Clinical Care Ltd).</description>

        We are going to evaluate retrospectively the occurrence of acute kidney injury defined by
        the RIFLE criteria in a population of patients submitted to two different strategies for
        glycemic control: a carbohydrate restrictive strategy or intensive insulin therapy. The
        protocol of the original trial that we are going to summarize below, was approved by the
        Research Ethical Committee of the Federal University of Maranhão. We included 337 adult
        patients, non pregnant, admitted from July 1, 2004 to December 31, 2006, to a 20-bed
        multidisciplinary ICU of a general hospital and to an 11-bed trauma center ICU that had at
        least two blood glucose levels above 150 mg/dl from three measurements obtained in the
        first 12 hours after admission.
