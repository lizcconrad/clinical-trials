    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this trial is to compare the relative hemodynamic effect of a novel
      intravenous formulation of amiodarone (PM101), administered as an immediate IV bolus push,
      with placebo and with the currentlyl available formulation of Amiodarone IV, administered as
      a 10-minute IV infusion, on systolic arterial pressure.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Men and women &gt;18 years of age at Screening, with a diagnosis of stable congestive
             heart failure

          -  NYHA Functional Classification of Heart Failure Class II, III, or IV

          -  Documented left ventricular ejection fraction â‰¤35% within 6 months before Screening,
             provided that the assessment was not within 4 weeks of a myocardial infarction

          -  Outpatient or inpatient

          -  On stable doses of medications to treat congestive heart failure (eg, beta-blockers,
             angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor/angiotensin-receptor antagonist, diuretic) for
             at least 7 days before dosing with trial drug

          -  Have a 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) at Screening that shows no clinically
             significant abnormalities of rate, rhythm, or conduction (such as high-grade
             atrioventricular block, bifascicular or trifascicular block), that would jeopardize
             the safety or the ability to accurately measure the arterial pressure of the subject,
             in the opinion of the investigator

          -  Able to communicate effectively with the trial personnel

          -  Able to undergo study related procedures as required by the protocol

          -  Adequately informed of the nature and risks of the trial and give written informed
             consent prior to undergoing any trial-related procedures

          -  Women of childbearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test both at Screening
             and at check-in to the trial site before receiving trial drug on Day 1 and must be
             using an effective medically acceptable form of birth control for the duration of the
             trial (up through the Day 8 follow-up evaluation)

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Known hypersensitivity or allergy to amiodarone, Captisol, Amiodarone IV, or any of
             its excipients

          -  Known hypersensitivity or allergy to iodine or radio-opaque dyes

          -  Presence of asthma or other pulmonary disease, thyroid disease (hypo or
             hyperthyroidism), hepatitis, or other liver disease that would place the subject at
             increased risk from treatment with amiodarone, in the opinion of the investigator

          -  Myocardial infarction within the 30 days before Screening

          -  Functioning pacemaker at Screening or on Day 1

          -  Amiodarone administration within 7 days before dosing with trial drug

          -  Cardiogenic shock, marked sinus bradycardia, or second- or third-degree
             atrioventricular block

          -  Any disease or condition that might compromise trial evaluations or place the subject
             at increased risk from treatment with amiodarone, in the opinion of the investigator

          -  Any clinically significantly abnormal laboratory test at Screening or Day 1 that would
             place the subject at increased risk from treatment with amiodarone, in the opinion of
             the investigator

          -  Women who are pregnant or breastfeeding A-ny subject who has received an
             investigational drug within 30 days before dosing with trial drug

          -  Inability to obtain 3 baseline SAP readings with no more than 5 mm Hg difference among
             these readings
