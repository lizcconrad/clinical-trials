  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In order to avoid renal transplant rejection, the immune system should be suppressed. After
      the renal transplant subjects are treated with a combination of two to four different types
      of immunosuppressive drugs. Theses drugs are very efficient in the prevention of the renal
      transplant rejection. Still, they can cause side effect.

      Research in renal transplant tries to find the best treatment in order to avoid renal
      rejection on one hand and to reduce as much as possible the undesired adverse and toxicity
      effects on the other hand.

      Therapeutic efficacy and the onset of adverse effects are influenced by levels of
      mycophenolic acid (MPA, the active metabolite of MMF, CellCept®).

      The primary objective of this study is to assess the treatment superiority of CellCept® Dose
      Adjustment treatment, based on individual MPA concentration value monitored periodically,
      against treatment with CellCept® Fixed Dose (standard care).

      Patient will be randomized into two treatment groups on a 1:1 ratio. Both groups will be
      treated with the same drugs which is the usual treatment for avoiding renal transplant
      rejection. In one group the CellCept® dose will be adjusted based on MPA concentration value
      which will be monitored periodically; and the second group will be treated with CellCept®
      Fixed Dose (based on the clinical judgment of the treating physician).
