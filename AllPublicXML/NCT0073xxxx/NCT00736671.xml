      This research study will evaluate functions of memory, thinking, eye movements and walking
      and how these relate to the measurement of certain chemicals (acetylcholine and dopamine) in
      the brain using an imaging procedure called positron emission tomography (PET). You may know
      that the brain chemical dopamine, a &quot;neurotransmitter&quot; substance (a chemical messenger that
      nerve cells need to communicate with each other), is important for the brain to control
      movements and that the brain chemical acetylcholine may have functions related to mental
      concentration and attention. At the present time, the investigators have no clear information
      how these two chemicals in the brain of patients with Parkinson's disease are related to the
      risk of falling.

      Although most research in PD has a focus on presynaptic dopaminergic denervation, new lessons
      may be learned by exploring to what extent alterations in non-motor and non-dopaminergic
      systems may play a role in the balance impairment in this disorder. This project is designed
      to evaluate striatal pre-synaptic dopaminergic, cortical, thalamic, and brainstem
      cholinergic, cognitive, and oculomotor mechanisms underlying the risk of falling and
      imbalance in PD. The proposed study will exploit advances in our center in the development of
      dynamic biomathematical modeling of electronic platform data, application of specialized
      cognitive and oculomotor assessments, and positron emission tomography (PET). This novel
      multi-system approach holds promise for understanding mechanisms of falling in PD beyond
      pre-synaptic dopaminergic nigrostriatal denervation.

        Patients with Parkinson's disease and normal control persons between the ages of 50-85
        years are eligible to participate in this study. Participants should be willing and able to
        comply with study requirements. Normal control persons should not have a history of brain
        or mental disorders. Both males and females are eligible.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects considered for inclusion will be female or male subjects either currently
             enrolled or eligible for care at the VA aged 50-85 years, or community volunteers.

          -  The racial, gender and ethnic characteristics of the proposed subjects population
             reflect the demographics of the patient population of the VA. However, extra efforts
             will be made to recruit women and minorities (see table 5).

          -  Children will be excluded from the study.

          -  No exclusion criteria shall be based on race, ethnicity, gender, or asymptomatic HIV
             status.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Inability to stand or walk independently (i.e., patients in Hoehn and Yahr stage IV
             and V).

          -  Vertiginous disorder.

          -  Orthostatic hypotension or unstable cardiovascular disease at risk of syncope (drop in
             systolic blood pressure of &gt; 20 mm Hg upon standing).

          -  History of stroke with focal cortical lesions.

          -  Cerebellar, myelopathic or significant radiculopathy syndrome.

          -  Diminished light perception in both eyes (&lt; 20/40 corrected OU).

          -  Intracranial surgery.

          -  Subjects who have participated in other research protocols such that their cumulative
             radiation absorbed dose to whole body, gonads, bone marrow or lens of the eye would
             exceed 5 Rem, or dose to other body organs is more than 15 Rem in preceding 12 months.

          -  Pregnancy (beta-HCG test within 48 hours of PET study) or breastfeeding.

          -  Contra-indications to MRI.
