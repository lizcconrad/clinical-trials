  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to examine if morphine administered by bolus before initiating
      Remifentanil by infusion decreases the incidence of acute post-operative opioid tolerance as
      demonstrated by decreased post - operative morphine consumption in children undergoing
      scoliosis surgery.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      At our institution, a study has recently demonstrated that intraoperative infusion of
      remifentanil is associated with development of clinically relevant acute opioid tolerance in
      adolescents undergoing scoliosis surgery. This results in increased morphine consumption
      which in turn is associated with increased incidence of side effects such as respiratory
      depression, nausea and vomiting, pruritus, ileus and urinary retention. All of these side
      effects can result in increased consumption of rescue medications with the additional
      potential for increased duration of patient stay. Any measures that can be introduced to
      decrease the development of acute opioid tolerance in this patient population would have
      significant impact on patient morbidity, patient comfort and possibly duration of patient
      stay.
