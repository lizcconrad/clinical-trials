    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and dose
      limiting toxicity (DLT) of dasatinib when combined with protracted, daily temozolomide (TMZ).
      Secondary objectives are: To further evaluate the safety and tolerability of dasatinib plus
      protracted, daily TMZ; 2. To evaluate the pharmacokinetics of dasatinib when administered
      with protracted, daily TMZ among recurrent malignant glioma patients who are on and not on
      CYP-3A enzyme inducing anti-epileptic drugs (EIAEDs); 3. To evaluate for anti-tumor activity
      with this regimen in this patient population.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, single center, one-arm phase I dose-escalation study of dasatinib plus
      protracted , daily TMZ administered orally on a continuous daily dosing schedule among adult
      patients with recurrent or relapsing malignant glioma. The study format includes a classical
      &quot;3+3&quot; dose escalation design to determine the MTD and DLT of dasatinib plus protracted, daily
      TMZ among recurrent malignant glioma patients. Patients will be stratified based on whether
      they are receiving EIAED and each stratum will independently dose escalate. Additionally, the
      study will characterize the safety, tolerability, biologic activity, and pharmacokinetic
      profile of dasatinib when used in combination with protracted, daily TMZ.

      Patients will start treatment on day 1 of cycle 1 with dasatinib. For patients undergoing
      dasatinib pharmacokinetic (PK) analysis, dasatinib will be administered alone until initial
      PK assessments are collected. Protracted TMZ will be initiated after initial dasatinib PK
      assessments are collected and will continue to be administered with dasatinib on a continuous
      daily dosing schedule. The initial dasatinib PK assessments will be collected over 24 hours
      between days 3-7 of cycle 1. Patients not undergoing dasatinib PK collections will begin both
      dasatinib and protracted, daily TMZ together on day 1, cycle 1.

      The protracted, daily TMZ dose will be 50 mg/mÂ² daily for all patients. The dose level of
      dasatinib will be increased in successive cohorts. Cohorts of 3-6 patients will accrue at
      each dose level until MTD is defined. Each cohort will consist of a minimum of 3 newly
      enrolled patients. Intra-patient dose escalation is not permitted. It is estimated that this
      study will enroll a minimum of 30 patients (up to 4 dose levels/stratum; 3 patients/dose
      level for levels 1-3 and 6 patients at level 4) and a maximum of 48 patients (6 patients/dose
      level; 4 dose levels/stratum). Cohorts may be expanded at any dose level for further
      elaboration of safety and pharmacokinetic parameters as required.

      The primary safety and efficacy analysis will be conducted on all patient data at the time
      all patients who are still receiving study drug will have completed at least 4 cycles of
      treatment. The additional data for any patients continuing to receive study drug past this
      time, as allowed by the protocol, will be further summarized in a report once these patients
      either completed or discontinued the study. Prior to the primary analysis, an additional
      safety report may be prepared.

      The most common side effects include vomiting, diarrhea, anorexia (loss of appetite), fluid
      retention, fatigue, headache, rash, hypocalcemia (low calcium level), and decreases in blood
      counts. Other possible side effects may include nausea, joint pain, muscle aches, generalized
      pain, abdominal pain, and fever. Rare side effects may include QTc prolongation (heart beat
      changes), pulmonary edema (fluid around the lungs), difficulty breathing, cough, hemorrhage,
      gastrointestinal bleeding, pneumonia, cardiac effusion (fluid in the sac surrounding the
      heart), and cardiac failure. Temodar has been well tolerated by both adults and children with
      the most common toxicity being mild myelosuppression. Other, less likely, potential
      toxicities include nausea and vomiting, constipation, headache, alopecia, rash, burning
      sensation of skin, esophagitis, pain, diarrhea, lethargy, hepatotoxicity, anorexia, fatigue
      and hyperglycemia. As in the case with many anti-cancer drugs, Temodar may be carcinogenic.
      Rats given Temodar have developed breast cancer.

             tumor on 2 consecutive scans at least 4 weeks apart;

          8. An interval of at least 4 weeks from prior chemotherapy (except nitrosoureas which
             require 6 weeks) unless there is unequivocal evidence of tumor progression and the
             patient has recovered from all anticipated toxicities from prior therapy;

          9. An interval of a least 14 days from exposure to investigational agents, unless there

             anticipated toxicities from prior therapy;

         10. Signed written informed consent including HIPAA according to institutional guidelines.
             A signed informed consent must be obtained prior to any study specific procedures;

             study regimen). Sexually active women of childbearing potential (WOCBP) must use an
             effective method of birth control during the course of the study, in a manner such
             that risk of failure is minimized. Prior to study enrollment, women of childbearing
             potential must be advised of the importance of avoiding pregnancy during trial
             participation and the potential risk factors for an unintentional pregnancy;

         10. Concurrent severe and/or uncontrolled medical disease that could compromise
             participation in the study such as pleural or pericardial effusion of any grade,

         20. Hypokalemia or hypomagnesemia if it cannot be corrected;

         21. Concomitant Medications, consider the following prohibitions:

               1. Drugs that are generally accepted to have a risk of causing Torsades de Pointes
                  including: (Patients must discontinue drug 7 days prior to starting dasatinib)

                    1. quinidine, procainamide, disopyramide

                    2. amiodarone, sotalol, ibutilide, dofetilide

                    3. erythromycin, clarithromycin

                    4. chlorpromazine, haloperidol, mesoridazine, thioridazine, pimozide

                    5. cisapride, bepridil, droperidol, methadone, arsenic, chloroquine,
                       domperidone, halofantrine, levomethadyl, pentamidine, sparfloxacin,
                       lidoflazine.

               2. Drugs that reduce dasatinib exposure such as H2 blockers or proton-pump
                  inhibitors (eg famotidine and omeprazole), which can cause long-term suppression
                  of gastric acid secretion. The concomitant use of H2 blockers or proton pump
                  inhibitors with dasatinib is in general not recommended and antacids should be
                  considered in place of H2 blockers or proton pump inhibitors in patients
                  receiving dasatinib therapy. However, given that nearly all recurrent malignant
                  brain tumor patients are on dexamethasone for increased intracranial pressure,
                  such patients must also receive effective medical therapy to prevent
                  complications related to increased gastric acid secretion due to chronic
                  dexamethasone therapy. Therefore all patients enrolled on the current protocol
                  will receive standard H2 blocker (preferred) or proton pump inhibitor (PPI)
                  therapy to be administered on a daily basis each evening. Dasatinib will be
                  administered each morning in order to maximize the time interval from
                  administered H2 blocker (preferred) or proton pump inhibitor (PPI).

               3. Drugs that cause hypocalcemia (i.e. IV bisphosphonates will be withheld for the
                  first 8 weeks of dasatinib therapy due to risk of hypocalcemia).

               4. Any prohibited CYP3A4 inhibitors; 22. Prisoners or subjects who are compulsorily
                  detained (involuntarily incarcerated) for treatment of either a psychiatric or
                  physical (e.g., infectious) illness.
