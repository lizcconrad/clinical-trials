  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      To evaluate the StarClose™ VCS in the femoral artery in subjects who are ambulated early
      post-percutaneous cardiac or peripheral vascular, diagnostic catheterization procedure. The
      clinical use of vascular closure devices for rapid hemostasis after femoral access was first
      reported in 1991. 18 participants may be ambulated almost immediately after diagnostic
      coronary angiography and discharged many hours earlier than currently practiced in most
      centers utilizing a supine restriction period of 6 hours after diagnostic catheterization.14
      After coronary interventions, participant comfort is additionally increased by immediate
      sheath removal.

      This early ambulation study is an evaluation of a clip-based technology, which achieves
      vascular hemostasis with the use of a novel extravascular Nitinol clip to provide an
      immediate mechanical closure that does not depend upon the body's clotting system. The
      procedures will be performed in participants who meet specific entrance criteria.
