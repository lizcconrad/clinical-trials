  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      For patients with this type of cancer, one standard treatment option is cetuximab (Erbitux®)
      + radiation. We wish to study the addition of albumin-bound paclitaxel (Abraxane®) to this
      standard regimen of cetuximab + radiation. Albumin-bound paclitaxel and cetuximab both are
      chemotherapy drugs which are administered by vein.

      Previous studies have shown that albumin-bound paclitaxel can kill head and neck cancer cells
      when given alone or in combination with chemotherapy. The purpose of this study is to
      establish a safe dose range of albumin-bound paclitaxel given in combination with cetuximab
      and radiation therapy. The investigators want to find out what effects, good and/or bad, the
      albumin-bound paclitaxel has on you and your head and neck cancer.

    <description>All patients will receive standard treatment with definitive radiation therapy (IMRT, intensity-modulated radiation therapy) administered concurrently with cetuximab (400 mg/m2 intravenous loading dose one week prior to radiation therapy, followed by 250 mg/m2 weekly intravenous infusions). To explore different dose levels of nanoparticle albumin-bound paclitaxel (Abraxane®) given intravenously weekly with the standard regimen of weekly cetuximab + daily radiation therapy.
The total number of planned cetuximab infusions is 8 (loading dose, plus 7 weekly infusions concurrent with radiation therapy). The total number of planned albumin-bound paclitaxel infusions is 7 (all concurrent with radiotherapy). Five dose levels of weekly intravenous (IV) albumin-bound paclitaxel will be explored.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Locally and/or regionally advanced head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (AJCC Stage
             III-IVB)

          -  Karnofsky performance status ≥ or = to 70%

          -  Adequate bone marrow function: absolute neutrophil count ≥ or = to 1,500/μl, platelets
             ≥ or = to 100,000/μl, hemoglobin ≥ or = to 9 gm/dl

          -  Adequate hepatic function:

        Total Bilirubin ≤ or = to institutional upper limit of normal (ULN) AST and ALT and
        Alkaline Phosphatase must be within the range allowing for eligibility. In determining
        eligibility the more abnormal of the two values (AST or ALT) should be used

          -  Patients must have adequate renal function: serum creatinine ≤ 1.5 mg/dl or estimated
             creatinine clearance of ≥ 45 ml/min by Cockcroft and Gault method

          -  Men and women of childbearing potential must be willing to consent to using effective
             contraception while on treatment and for at least 3 months thereafter

          -  Women of childbearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test

          -  Patients must have ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written
             informed consent document

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Other active malignancy, other than indolent malignancies which the investigator
             determines are unlikely to interfere with treatment or efficacy analysis. For example,
             patients with non-melanoma skin cancer, in situ carcinoma of the cervix, or prostate
             cancer within the no current biochemical (PSA) or radiologic evidence of disease may
             enroll

          -  Prior radiation therapy for head and neck cancer

          -  Patients with multifocal peripheral sensory alterations or paresthesias (including
             tingling) interfering with function, per patient report (example: activities of daily
             living)

          -  Inability to comply with study and/or follow-up procedures

          -  Women who are pregnant or lactating

          -  Serious concomitant medical disorders (for example, active infection, uncontrolled
             seizure disorder, unstable angina, auto-immune connective tissue disease) that, in the
             opinion of the investigator, would compromise the safety of the patient or compromise
             the patient's ability to complete the study

          -  History of severe infusion reaction to a monoclonal antibody

          -  Patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma are not eligible
