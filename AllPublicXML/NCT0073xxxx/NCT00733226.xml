      The purpose of this study is to determine whether OM-85 BV (Broncho-Vaxom)has any effect on
      respiratory infections, infection related wheezing attacks, beta-2 agonist use, duration of
      attacks and effect on serum cytokine levels.

      Context: Respiratory infections are the major cause of wheezing attacks in children with
      recurrent wheezing or asthma in preschool age. OM-85 BV is an bacteria lysate which has been
      proven to prevent respiratory infections about 40 percent in children.

      Objective: To determine if using OM-85 BV diminish the number and duration of the respiratory
      infections and respiratory infection related wheezing attacks,beta-2 agonist and steroid use,
      and number and duration of hospitalizations in children with recurrent wheezing and asthma.
      And also to determine if OM-85 BV has any effect on serum cytokine levels after 6 months.

      Study Design/Setting/Participants: A double-blind, randomized, controlled trial of OM-85 BV
      versus placebo for children 6 months to 6 years of age who have respiratory tract infection
      related recurrent wheezing attacks.

      Intervention: Participants will receive either active Broncho-Vaxom or placebo for 3 months.

      Study Measures: They follow up for 1 year for number and duration of wheezing attacks,
      number, type and duration of respiratory infections, number and duration of beta-2 agonist
      use, number and duration of steroid use and number and duration of hospitalizations. Serum
      cytokine levels will measure to determine if Broncho-Vaxom has any effect on serum cytokine
      levels (at the beginning of the trial and sixth months of the trial).

    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Acute wheezing attack was defined as episode of progressive increase in shortness of breath, cough, wheezing, retraction of the chest and chest tightness, or combination of these symptoms. When wheezing attack occured it was Over the 12 months of the study mean number (rate) of wheezing attacks/per patient was calculated and compared with placebo. This outcome measure was calculated by dividing cumulative wheezing attacks to number of participants in each group.</description>

    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Over the 12 months of the study we calculated mean duration of each wheezing attacks/per patients.This measure was calculated separately for each participants by dividing duration of wheezing attacks to number of wheezing attacks.</description>

    <description>All the common colds were recorded during the 12 months of the study. At the and of the study period the two groups were compared according to the number of common-cold/per patient over the 12 months of the trial.
This outcome was calculated by dividing cumulative number of common colds by number of participants in each group over the 12 months of the trial.</description>

    <description>All the wheezing attacks which were enough severe to require systemic steroid therapy were recorded over the 12 months of the study.
At the and of the study period, number of wheezing attacks that required systemic steroid therapy/per patients were calculated. This outcome was calculated by dividing cumulative number of wheezing attacks that required systemic steroid therapy by number of participants in each group.</description>

This outcome was calculated by dividing cumulative number of hospitalizations by number of participants in each group over the 12 months of the trial.</description>
