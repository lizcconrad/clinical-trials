  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators recent epidemiologic work in several national surveys and cohorts of men
      and women have shown that dietary patterns high in plant-based foods and phytochemicals are
      associated with lower plasma levels of insulin, triglycerides, and C-reactive protein, and
      reduced risk of type 2 DM and CHD. While the physiologic impact of different foods on serum
      glucose and insulin is of critical importance, the extent to which specific dietary nutrients
      can modify insulin resistance is not well understood. Magnesium is a biologically active
      constituent in whole-grain, green leafy vegetables, and nuts and appears to play an essential
      role in hundreds of physiologic processes in humans. However, it remains uncertain whether
      magnesium intake can exert effects on insulin sensitivity and inflammation. Moreover, little
      is known of the extent to which magnesium intake elicits changes in the expression levels of
      key genes responsible for glucose homeostasis and systemic inflammation. The ultimate
      clinical question is whether magnesium supplementation would be clinically effective for the
      improvement of metabolic disorders in not yet diabetic but high-risk individuals, especially
      those who are susceptible to insulin resistance. Therefore, as a direct follow up on our
      previous work in studying the health benefits of plant-based foods such as whole grains,
      fruits and vegetables, we propose a pilot randomized trial to unravel the metabolic and
      anti-inflammatory effects of magnesium supplementation versus placebo among overweight
      individuals with the metabolic syndrome who are particularly prone to the adverse effects of
      magnesium deficiency. Recent advancements in molecular genetics and genomic technologies have
      also enabled us to analyze the expression levels of thousands of genes simultaneously in
      different experimental conditions. The application of high throughput microarray technology
      in randomized-controlled setting when analyzed with novel statistical methods, will not only
      help our understanding of nutrient-disease relations, but also afford the investigators the
      opportunity to gain important insight into the molecular mechanism for complex biological
      systems of inflammation, insulin resistance, and metabolic abnormalities in response to
      nutrition intervention.
