  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research study will evaluate functions of memory, thinking, behavior, and daily life
      activities and how these relate to the measurement of certain chemicals (acetylcholine and
      dopamine) in the brain using an imaging procedure called positron emission tomography (PET).
      You may know that in Alzheimer's dementia (dementia is a disease where persons become
      forgetful and confused), a reduction in the amount of acetylcholine, a &quot;neurotransmitter&quot;
      substance (a chemical messenger that nerve cells need to communicate with each other), may be
      responsible for some of the memory and behavioral changes. At the present time, the
      investigators have no clear information on the levels of acetylcholine in the brain of
      patients with Parkinson's disease who also have memory or behavioral changes.

        Patients with Parkinson's disease, either with or without memory or concentration
        difficulties, and normal control persons between the ages of 50-85 years are eligible to
        participate in this study. Participants should be willing and able to comply with study
        requirements. Normal control persons should not have a history of brain or mental
