  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Intracranial bleeding from ruptured blood vessels (called a subarachnoid haemorrhage -SAH)
      affects 7000 patients each year in the UK and is a source of considerable death and
      disability, even in young adults. Recent observations indicate that these bleeds can cause
      reduced cerebral blood flow which leads to a bad outcome. High rates of death and disability
      occur, and are particularly prevalent when low cerebral blood flow results in stroke.
      Prevention of cerebral artery spasm and improvement in blood vessel reflexes are the target
      of modern therapy. Candidate drugs include statins which have an impeccable safety record and
      multiple potential beneficial actions (improve cerebral blood flow, reduce inflammatory
      processes, reduce adverse blood coagulation) following SAH.

      The investigators plan to use a statin, Simvastatin (40 mg) to improve cerebral blood flow
      and reduce inflammation. We have already completed a phase 11 study (n=80) which demonstrated
      potential benefits for acute statin therapy following SAH, and the investigators now wish to
      conduct a multi-centre phase 111 study to explore any potential clinical benefits in a larger
      population (n=1600). The purpose is to see whether the positive effects of statins seen in
      our phase II study translate into clinical benefits - both short term (e.g. reduced need for
      intensive care) and long term (outcome and wellbeing at 6 months).

        Inclusion Criteria

          -  Patients (age 18 - 65 yr) in which the admitting neurosurgeon has confirmatory
             evidence of an aneurysm, either by CT angiography, MR angiography or DSA.

          -  Any clinical grade accepted provided a reasonable prospect of survival.

          -  Delay to randomisation and initiation of trial medication from the time of the
             presenting ictus does not exceed 96 hours.

        Exclusion Criteria

          -  Unsalvageable patients:Fixed and dilated pupils after resuscitation, and/or a
             devastating scan, which precludes definitive therapy.
