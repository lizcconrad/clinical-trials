      The investigators conducted a prospective study to determine the safety and efficacy of minor
      and major hepatectomy selected by predetermined criteria in 138 patients with hilar
      cholangiocarcinoma. In selected patients, minor liver resection was a good treatment.

      Objective: To determine the safety and efficacy of minor and major hepatectomy selected by
      predetermined criteria in patients with hilar cholangiocarcinoma (HC).

      Summary Background Data: For HC treated with hepatectomy, the extent of liver resection
      remains controversial despite extensive studies.

      Methods: From January 2000 to December 2007, we prospectively studied patients who received
      surgical treatment for HC. Of the 187 patients who were surgically treated, 138 (73.8%)
      underwent resection with a curative intent. Minor hepatectomy was carried out in 93 patients
      who had Bismuth-Corlette types I, II and III HC without hepatic artery/portal vein invasion;
      and major hepatectomy in 45 patients who had type III HC with hepatic artery/portal vein
      invasion, or type IV HC.
