  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the commonness of the C677T mutation in the MTHFR
      gene in subjects with B12 deficiency. Also, we'd like to investigate the effect of B12
      deficiency combined with the C677T mutation on endothelial function.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      we showed that patiebts with B12 deficiency have higher than expected frequency of MTHFR
      mutation and patients with both abnormalities havean abnormal endothelial function

    <measure>The primary measure to determine the effect of the treatment will be reduced levels of Homocysteine in subjects with B12 deficiency combined with C677T mutation in the MTHFR gene.</measure>
    <time_frame>The key measure would be measured upon enrollment and 6 weeks afterwards, upon completion of treatment based on 1mg Vitamin B12 sublinual and 5 mg Folic Acid per day.</time_frame>
