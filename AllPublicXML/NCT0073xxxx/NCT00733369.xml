  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main objective of this study is to determine if the P.F.C. Sigma RP-F Knee delivers a
      greater post-operative range of motion (ROM) compared with the P.F.C. Sigma RP Knee in
      primary TKA.

      The secondary objectives of this investigation are to evaluate the clinical and patient
      outcomes and survivorship associated with the DePuy P.F.C. Sigma RP-F and RP Posterior
      Stabilised (PS) Knee over 5 years.

      Primary Outcome: Change from pre-operative range of motion at 1 year between patients
      receiving P.F.C. Sigma RP vs P.F.C. Sigma RP-F

      Secondary endpoints: Comparative evaluation of any post-operative variation between subjects
      receiving primary TKA with either of the above devices in terms of Knee and Osteoarthritis
      Scores (KOOS), American Knee Society Score (AKS), EQ-5D Score and Oxford Knee Score (OKS)

    <measure>Change From Pre-op to 1 Year Range of Motion.</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
    <description>Range of motion is knee flexion (how far the patient can bend their knee) minus knee extension (how far the patient can straighten their knee). The result of this subtraction is the range of motion (bending and straightening) for that knee.</description>

        <description>The Knee injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS) is a patient reported outcome that evaluates the short and long-term symptoms and function in subjects with knee injury and osteoarthritis. It consists of 5 separately scored subscales – Pain, Symptoms, Function in daily living (ADL), Function in Sport and Recreation, and knee-related Quality of Life (QOL) – ranging from 0 to 100 point score (where 100 indicates the best outcome).</description>

        <description>EQ-5D3L is a patient reported standardized instrument used to measure health that comprises of 5 descriptive dimensions: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression; and 1 visual analog scale (VAS) that measures health. The descriptive dimensions each have 3 levels: no problems (scored as 1), some problems (scored as 2), and extreme problems (scored as 3); whereas the VAS measure ranges from 0 to 100 where 100 is the best imaginable health state.</description>

        <description>EQ-5D3L is a patient reported standardized instrument used to measure health that comprises of 5 descriptive dimensions: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression; and 1 visual analog scale (VAS) that measures health. The descriptive dimensions each have 3 levels: no problems (scored as 1), some problems (scored as 2), and extreme problems (scored as 3); whereas the VAS measure ranges from 0 to 100 where 100 is the best imaginable health state.</description>

          <title>To Compare the Change in EQ-5D3L VAS Score From Pre-Op to 5 Years Post-Op Between PFC Sigma RP and PFC Sigma RP-F Treatment Groups.</title>
          <description>EQ-5D3L is a patient reported standardized instrument used to measure health that comprises of 5 descriptive dimensions: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression; and 1 visual analog scale (VAS) that measures health. The descriptive dimensions each have 3 levels: no problems (scored as 1), some problems (scored as 2), and extreme problems (scored as 3); whereas the VAS measure ranges from 0 to 100 where 100 is the best imaginable health state.</description>

      <time_frame>The adverse event data were collected between treatment time point and 24 month follow up as this study has been terminated early.</time_frame>
      <desc>Study protocol was designed and executed on using ‘knees’ as study units. Adverse events were collected based on the knees being investigated, not per participant, it is not possible to regroup data 'per participant'. Therefore the numbers affected and at risk below are referring to knees.</desc>
