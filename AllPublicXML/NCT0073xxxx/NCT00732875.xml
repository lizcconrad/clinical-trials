    <textblock>
      This trial is extension part of the P04280 (placebo-controlled, double-blind, randomized
      study of chronic treatment with infliximab in approximately 140 patients, NCT00202852). This
      study will be conducted at 6 study centers in South Korea. After completion of the last
      follow-up visit at Week 30 and code break in main double-blind trial, subjects randomized to
      the placebo group and those who were treated with an infliximab-containing regimen who
      maintained clinical response at the time of study completion will be provided with open-label
      infliximab for treatment of their conditions and additional safety data will be collected.

             epitrochlear, or periaortic areas), or splenomegaly.

          -  Any current known malignancy or history of malignancy within the previous 5 years,
