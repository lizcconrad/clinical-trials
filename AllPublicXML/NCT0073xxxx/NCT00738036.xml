  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To define a rational pharmacological management of pain for the subjects under opioid
      maintenance therapy (methadone or buprenorphine), it is first of all necessary to estimate
      the efficiency of the current practices on pain management as well as their potentially
      noxious consequences, in particular on the long term opioid maintenance therapy.

      The objective of the study is to compare the efficiency of the opioid maintenance therapy
      according to the arisen of an acute painful phenomenon requiring an analgesic management for
      these patients. At first, this work will allow to determine the results on acute pain of the
      current practices for these patients. The comparison of the long term consequences on opioid
      maintenance therapy between the patients that presented an acute painful phenomenon and the
      control patients should help to improve acute pain management for these patients while
      limiting the risk of relapse in the abused consumption of psychoactive substances.
