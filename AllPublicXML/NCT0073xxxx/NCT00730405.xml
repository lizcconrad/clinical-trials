      A phase 2, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, dose-ranging study
      to investigate the efficacy and safety of 4 dose regimens of ORAL albaconazole in subjects
      with distal subungual onychomycosis. Subjects will take oral study drug for up to 36 weeks
      and then will be followed for an additional 16 weeks to determine if the study drug was
      efficacious. Subjects will have routine blood draws and other safety assessments during the
      study, as well as regular assessments of their toenail fungus

    <measure>The Percentage of Participants Who Achieve Effective Treatment at Week 52</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 52</time_frame>
    <description>At each study visit, the investigator assessed the percentage of affected toenail on the target nail by estimating the percent affected nail in each quadrant, summing the percent affected in each quadrant and dividing the sum by 4. Effective treatment was defined as a mycological cure and clear or almost clear nail (distal subungual hyperkeratosis and/or onycholysis leaving less than 10% of nail plate effected). Comparisons were carried out in a sequential step-down fashion, combined with the Holm procedure at step 2. P-value was based on a sequential step-down combined with the Holm procedure. It was assessed on Week 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, 30, 36, 44 and 52.</description>

    <measure>The Percentage of Participants Who Achieve Clinical Cure at Week 52</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 52</time_frame>
    <description>At each study visit, the investigator assessed the percentage of affected toenail on the target nail by estimating the percent affected nail in each quadrant, summing the percent affected in each quadrant and dividing the sum by 4. Clinical cure was defined as 100% clear nail. It was assessed on Week 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, 30, 36, 44 and 52.</description>

    <measure>The Percentage of Participants Who Achieve Mycological Cure at Week 52</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 52</time_frame>
    <description>At each study visit, the investigator assessed the percentage of affected toenail on the target nail by estimating the percent affected nail in each quadrant, summing the percent affected in each quadrant and dividing the sum by 4. Mycological cure was defined as negative potassium hydroxide (KOH) and negative cultures for dermatophytes. It was assessed on Week 12, 16, 20, 24, 30, 36, 44 and 52.</description>

    <measure>The Percentage of Participants Who Achieve Complete Cure at Week 52</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 52</time_frame>
    <description>At each study visit, the investigator assessed the percentage of affected toenail on the target nail by estimating the percent affected nail in each quadrant, summing the percent affected in each quadrant and dividing the sum by 4. Complete cure was defined as mycological cure plus clinical cure. It was assessed on Week 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, 30, 36, 44 and 52.</description>

    <measure>Absolute Change in Unaffected Part of Target Nail From Baseline to Week 52</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Week 0/Day 1 or before) and up to Week 52</time_frame>
    <description>Length of the unaffected part of the target nail was measured in millimeters along the midpoint from the nail fold to the proximal border of the affected part (lowest point affected) along the midpoint of the target nail. It was assessed on Week 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, 30, 36, 44 and 52. Baseline values were the observations at Week 0/Day 1 or before. Change from Baseline was a Baseline value subtracted from Week 52 value. P-value was based on analysis of variance (ANOVA) with treatment and pooled center. Statistics is provided for adjusted least square mean.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>The Percentage of Participants With a Global Change Score of Cleared or Much Improved at Week 52</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 52</time_frame>
    <description>A count of the number of toenails affected, using visual examination, was performed at all study visits (Week 12, 24, 30, 36, 44 and 52). The investigator given a global evaluation of the toenails condition, based on the investigator's assessment of the reduction in extent of nail involvement and improvement in clinical signs as compared with the status at the Baseline visit. The 0-5 rating scale was used: 0: cleared, 1: much improved, 2: minimally improved, 3: unchanged, 4: minimally worse and 5: much worse; where higher score indicates worse condition and lower score indicates clear toenail.</description>

        <title>The Percentage of Participants Who Achieve Effective Treatment at Week 52</title>
        <description>At each study visit, the investigator assessed the percentage of affected toenail on the target nail by estimating the percent affected nail in each quadrant, summing the percent affected in each quadrant and dividing the sum by 4. Effective treatment was defined as a mycological cure and clear or almost clear nail (distal subungual hyperkeratosis and/or onycholysis leaving less than 10% of nail plate effected). Comparisons were carried out in a sequential step-down fashion, combined with the Holm procedure at step 2. P-value was based on a sequential step-down combined with the Holm procedure. It was assessed on Week 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, 30, 36, 44 and 52.</description>

        <title>Absolute Change in Unaffected Part of Target Nail From Baseline to Week 52</title>
        <description>Length of the unaffected part of the target nail was measured in millimeters along the midpoint from the nail fold to the proximal border of the affected part (lowest point affected) along the midpoint of the target nail. It was assessed on Week 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, 30, 36, 44 and 52. Baseline values were the observations at Week 0/Day 1 or before. Change from Baseline was a Baseline value subtracted from Week 52 value. P-value was based on analysis of variance (ANOVA) with treatment and pooled center. Statistics is provided for adjusted least square mean.</description>

        <description>A count of the number of toenails affected, using visual examination, was performed at all study visits (Week 12, 24, 30, 36, 44 and 52). The investigator given a global evaluation of the toenails condition, based on the investigator’s assessment of the reduction in extent of nail involvement and improvement in clinical signs as compared with the status at the Baseline visit. The 0-5 rating scale was used: 0: cleared, 1: much improved, 2: minimally improved, 3: unchanged, 4: minimally worse and 5: much worse; where higher score indicates worse condition and lower score indicates clear toenail.</description>
