      The purpose of the current study is to evaluate the technical success, safety and procedure
      feasibility of hysteroscopic cryoablation treatment of symptomatic uterine fibroids in women
      who do not desire further pregnancies using Galil Medical's 17-gauge 400mm Argon-based
      cryoablation needles

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Currently there are no optimal methods for treating symptomatic uterine fibroids. Existing
      therapeutic options are conservative (medications), invasive (e.g., hysterectomy, surgical
      myomectomy), or minimally invasive (uterine artery embolization, or myolysis).

      Fibroid ablation using cryogenic energy, known as Cryoablation, offers a potential
      alternative method of fibroid treatment. Cryotherapy is a well-established technique for the
      treatment of various benign and malignant conditions. Cryoablation has been described for the
      treatment of prostate cancer, renal cell carcinoma, liver tumors and benign and malignant
      breast tumors.

      Galil Medical's proposed feasibility study is looking to examine the technical success,
      safety and feasibility of a hysteroscopic approach for the treatment of symptomatic fibroids.
      This technique involves the insertion and placement of Galil Medical's 17-gauge cryoablation
      needle(s)guided by a hysteroscopic device. Ultrasound provides real-time monitoring of the
      needle insertion, placement and iceball propagation during the cryoablation procedure.

      This treatment offers the patient to preserve her uterus by a minimally invasive procedure.
      The type of the fibroids intended for treatment (Type II submucous myomas)are often very
      difficult to completely and safely remove hysteroscopically and are often treated through an
      open or laparoscopic procedure. A hysteroscopic procedure does not involve intraperitoneal
      intervention and is therefore expected to be associated with less intra-operative and
      post-operative complications.

      The recovery from hysteroscopic cryoablation is expected to be fast with only minimal self
      resolving discomfort. The patient should be able to return to her normal activity within
      24-48 hours.

    <description>Per the protocol, this outcome intended to report the average duration of post operative hospital stay. However, this measurement was made very generally and was not collected in number of hours, only the dates were collected. The only actual data that can be stated is that all subjects were discharged from the hospital on the same day as the procedure. In order to report the average length of hospital stay, the wording on the outcome measure title has been changed.</description>

        <description>Per the protocol, this outcome intended to report the average duration of post operative hospital stay. However, this measurement was made very generally and was not collected in number of hours, only the dates were collected. The only actual data that can be stated is that all subjects were discharged from the hospital on the same day as the procedure. In order to report the average length of hospital stay, the wording on the outcome measure title has been changed.</description>
