      Part I: Intramuscular (i.m.) vaccination of a single dose of 0.1 µg, 0.3 µg, 1 µg, 2 µg, 3
      µg, 5 µg and 8 µg of STF2.HA1 (SI) (VAX125) to be given on Day 0

      Part II: Intramuscular (i.m.) vaccination of a single dose of placebo or one of two dose
      levels of STF2.HA1 (SI) (VAX125) (optimum dose levels to be determined from the safety and
      immunogenicity data from Part I of this study) to be given on Day 0

      Part I Primary: To assess the safety, reactogenicity, and tolerability of the VAX125 vaccine
      delivered i.m. in a single dose regimen of dose levels of 0.1 µg, 0.3 µg, 1 µg, 2 µg, 3 µg, 5
      µg, and 8 µg in healthy adults 18 - 49 years of age, inclusive.

      Secondary: To assess the immunogenicity of the VAX125 vaccine delivered i.m. in a single dose
      regimen at dose levels of 0.1 µg, 0.3 µg, 1 µg, 2 µg, 3 µg, 5 µg, and 8 µg, for inducing a
      post-vaccination serum HAI antibody response in healthy adults against the influenza A virus
      H1 HA.

      Part II Primary: To assess the safety, reactogenicity, and tolerability of a single dose of
      the VAX125 vaccine delivered i.m. in one of two dose levels as compared to placebo, (optimum
      dose levels to be determined from the safety and immunogenicity data from Part I of this
      study), in healthy adults 18- 49 years of age, inclusive.

      Secondary: To assess the immunogenicity of a single dose the VAX125 vaccine delivered i.m. in
      one of two dose levels as compared to placebo (optimum dose levels to be determined from the
      safety and immunogenicity data from Part I of this study) for inducing a post-vaccination
      serum HAI antibody response in healthy adults against the influenza A virus H1 HA antigen.

          -  Healthy, as determined by medical history, physical examination, vital signs, and
             clinical safety laboratory examinations

          -  Females should willing to use another reliable form of contraception approved by the
             Investigator and a negative urine pregnancy test within 24 hours preceding receipt of
             vaccination

             without fever, or a fever &gt;37.9ºC orally. Study vaccine can be administered to persons
             with a minor illness, such as diarrhea, or mild upper respiratory tract infection with
