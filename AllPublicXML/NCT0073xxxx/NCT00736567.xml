    <textblock>
      PATH is a member of a consortium that is developing a Diagnostic Enterics Card (DEC) which
      will allow clinicians to diagnose a group of diarrheagenic pathogens linked to morbidity and
      mortality. The pathogens detected on DEC include Salmonella, Campylobacter jejuni, Shigella
      species, and Escherichia coli O157:H7. This study will evaluate the performance of the assays
      and the platform in clinical conditions with non-expert users. It will provide important data
      on the performance of DEC for at least one target pathogen, an understanding of the potential
      impact of different sample types on device performance, and human factors associated with
      instrument interface in the field.
