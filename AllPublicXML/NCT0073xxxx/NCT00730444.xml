  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      GE Healthcare has recently submitted a New Drug Application (NDA) for Iobenguane I 123
      Injection ([123I]mIBG (AdreView)) as a diagnostic nuclear imaging agent for the detection of
      primary or metastatic neuroblastoma and pheochromocytoma. The present protocol establishes an
      Expanded Access program to provide AdreView to pediatric medical centers and hospitals that
      treat neuroblastoma patients. AdreView will be provided for use in diagnostic assessment of
      patients with known or suspected neuroblastoma for whom there is an appropriate clinical
      indication for [123I]mIBG imaging.

    <textblock>
      The sponsor will provide [123I]mIBG as a single dose in a ready-to-use vial. All patients
      greater than or equal to 18 years of age and children with a weight of greater than or equal
      to 70 kg will receive an intravenous injection of 370 ±10% MBq (333 to 407 MBq [9.0 to 11
      mCi]) of [123I]mIBG. Children &lt;16 years of age (with a weight of 8-70 kg) will receive an
      activity of [123I]mIBG calculated on the basis of a reference activity for an adult scaled to
      body weight. Each investigator is responsible for obtaining the appropriate thyroid blockade
      agent and for its administration in accordance with national and local regulations and
      guidelines. Approximately 24 (± 6) hours following administration of [123I]mIBG all patients
      will return to the clinic for scintigraphic imaging. Imaging will be performed as per the
      standard procedures of the investigational site. This should include at a minimum total body
      planar scintigraphy. Single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) may be performed
      following planar scintigraphy, as appropriate.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  The patient has known or suspected neuroblastoma and is undergoing evaluation of
             disease status (for which a mIBG scintigraphic examination is clinically appropriate).

          -  The patient is able and willing to comply with study procedures and a signed and dated
             informed consent is obtained from the patient (or their legal guardian.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  The patient uses medications that are known to interfere with [123I]mIBG uptake and
             these medications cannot be safely withheld for a least 24 hours before study
             procedures.
