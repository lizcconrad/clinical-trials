    <textblock>
      Intraoperative blood loss is a major concern during hepatic resection, as it has been shown
      to adversely affect patients' perioperative outcome. Reduction of central venous pressure
      during parenchymal transection has been shown to effectively lower liver hemorrhage. While
      CVP reduction is mainly achieved via fluid restriction and diuretics, dehydration may impair
      organ function. Moreover, it may lead to hemodynamic instability, particularly in case of
      severe bleeding. For this reason the technique of infrahepatic inferior vena cava clamping
      has been suggested which is able to lower CVP without the need for fluid restriction.

      In the present study the two strategies to reduce CVP and by this intraoperative bleeding,
      namely fluid restriction and inferior vena cava clamping are compared with intraoperative
      blood loss as primary endpoint.
