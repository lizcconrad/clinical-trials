      The objective of this study is to determine whether the amount or type of fungal DNA present
      in the nose and home environment can be correlated with the outcomes of the following quality
      of life (QOL) instruments: Medical Outcomes Study 36-item Short Form (SF-36) and the
      Sino-Nasal Outcomes Study - 20 Questions (SNOT-20).

      The objective of this study is to determine whether the amount or type of fungal DNA present
      in the nose and home environment can be correlated with the outcomes of the following quality
      of life (QOL) instruments: Medical Outcomes Study 36-item Short Form (SF-36) and the
      Sino-Nasal Outcomes Study - 20 Questions (SNOT-20).

      The study design involves case control Polymerase Chain reaction (PCR) analysis of nasal
      mucosal swabs, saliva swabs, blood serum, and home vacuum cleaner bags in patients with
      sinusitis and normal controls.

      The hypothesis is that the quantity and type of fungal DNA present in the nose and home
      environment are directly correlated with quality of life. Our research aims to both quantify
      the amount of fungi present in the nasal mucosa as well as to measure the severity of the
      patient's chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) as a function of SNOT-20 and SF-36 outcomes
      questionnaires. We hypothesize that the amount and type of fungi present in the nose and home
      environment will correlate with the severity of the patients' symptoms of CRS.

    <description>Patients with sinusitis compared to patients without.
To find out if any specific type of fungus or mold is correlated with chronic sinus disease. The study will add new information about the different types of fungus and mold found in the human nose.</description>

    <intervention_name>Nasal swab under endoscopic guidance</intervention_name>
    <description>After the application of pontocaine and neosynephrine spray, the following will be done:
A small sponge applicator will be used to swab the inside of your mouth for saliva collection
A blood sample (6cc - one tube) will be collected
A small brush applicator called a cytology brush and an instrument called an endoscope will be used to swab the inside of your nose (middle meatus)
Subjects will be asked to complete 2 standard quality of life questionnaires regarding how much your symptoms bother you
You will be asked to bring in a vacuum cleaner bag from home at a follow-up appointment which will be swabbed as well
The samples will be refrigerated and analyzed using PCR to detect and speciate fungus.</description>
