    <textblock>
      The objective of this trial is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of the ExAblate 2000
      system for enhancement of fertility in women with non-hysteroscopically resectable uterine
      fibroids, who are diagnosed with unexplained infertility.

      Uterine fibroids are fairly common in women of child-bearing age. An evidence based review
      supported removing fibroids that distort the uterine cavity to increase pregnancy rates and
      decrease the rates of miscarriage. Some fibroids can be removed hysteroscopically which is
      minimally invasive, with low morbidity. However, removal of fibroids within the uterine wall
      require more invasive surgical procedures (e.g., myomectomy), with increasing morbidity risks
      including, but not limited to, infection, blood loss and postoperative uterine adhesions.

      ExAblate is approved by FDA for the treatment of uterine fibroids; however, its use in
      patients seeking pregnancy is considered experimental. Accumulated evidence suggests there
      are no significant complications from the procedure in women seeking pregnancy as with
      existing fibroid therapies; however, these data are based on a small number of patients. This
      study will evaluate fertility enhancement following ExAblate treatment or myomectomy, in
      women with unexplained infertility and who have non-hysteroscopically resectable uterine
      fibroids.
