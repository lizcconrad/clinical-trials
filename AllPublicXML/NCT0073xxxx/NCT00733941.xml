  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Individuals who participate in regular physical exercise possess a lower prevalence of
      cardiovascular risk factors such as hypertension, type 2 diabetes, obesity and
      hypercholesterolemia, and aerobic exercise is therefore considered an important adjuvant
      therapy in risk factor modification and to promote health.

      The main focus of the present study is therefore to detect how rapid it is possible to
      increase aerobic capacity with interval running exercise.

      The hypothesis is that it is possible to improve maximal oxygen uptake faster when increasing
      training frequency. The total gain in maximal oxygen uptake will however be the same between
      the two groups when they have performed the same amount of training

      We will perform aerobic interval training at an intensity of 90-95% of maximum heart rate in
      healthy individuals. The subjects will be randomly assigned to carry out a total of 24
      exercise-sessions, either at 3 times per week or 8 times per week.

      The two groups will carry out 24 training sessions before 8 weeks of detraining will provide
      how rapidly aerobic capacity is lost due to inactivity. After the detraining period a
      retraining phase is introduced to detect if improvements in aerobic capacity occur more
      rapidly compared to before the first training period

      The subjects will be tested for oxygen uptake, pumping capacity of the heart, blood volume,
      skeletal muscle enzyme activity, endothelial function.
