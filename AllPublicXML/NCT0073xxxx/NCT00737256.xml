  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to gather systematic clinical data on whether aripiprazole, a
      partial dopamine agonist, beneficially affects schizophrenia plus cocaine dependence
      subjects. Since aripiprazole has established effects against schizophrenia, the study focuses
      on whether aripiprazole concurrently reduces co-morbid cocaine dependence in schizophrenia
      plus cocaine dependence sufferers compared to a standard typical antipsychotic treatment
      (perphenazine). The working hypothesis states that subjects in the aripiprazole treatment arm
      of the study will give fewer cocaine positive urine specimens as compared to the perphenazine
      control arm.
