  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test the safety and tolerability of repeated subcutaneous
      (SC) doses of belimumab in subjects with SLE.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This clinical trial will evaluate the safety, pharmacokinetics (PK), and effect on biomarkers
      of repeated subcutaneous (SC) administration of belimumab in subjects with SLE. As data
      permit, an exploratory pharmacodynamic analysis will be performed to evaluate the correlation
      between belimumab serum exposure, PGA, SELENA SELDAI, and biomarker effects.
