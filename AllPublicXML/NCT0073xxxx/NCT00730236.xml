      The goal of this trial is to study the effects of AEGR-733 on LDL cholesterol, other lipids
      as well as measures of safety over the long-term.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) is a serious life-threatening genetic disease.
      Total plasma cholesterol levels are generally over 500 mg/dl and markedly premature
      cardiovascular disease is the major consequence. Untreated, most patients develop
      atherosclerosis before age 20 and generally do not survive past age 30. The primary goal of
      therapy involves reducing cholesterol (specifically, LDL cholesterol) and preventing coronary
      artery disease. Unfortunately, patients with homozygous FH are minimally responsive or
      unresponsive to available drug therapy and thus there are limited treatment options. The
      current standard of care is LDL apheresis, a physical method of removing the plasma of LDL
      cholesterol which can transiently reduce cholesterol by more than 50%. However, there is
      rapid re-accumulation of LDL cholesterol in plasma, and therefore apheresis has to be
      repeated frequently (every 1-2 weeks) and requires 2 separate sites for IV access. Although
      anecdotally this procedure may delay the onset of atherosclerosis, it is laborious,
      expensive, and not readily available. Furthermore, although it is a procedure that is
      generally well tolerated, the fact that it needs frequent repetition and IV access can be
      challenging for many of these young patients. Therefore, there is a tremendous unmet medical
      need for new medical therapies for this orphan disease.

      AEGR-733 is a novel oral therapeutic agent for hypercholesterolemia. Its mechanism involves
      inhibition of microsomal triglyceride transfer protein, resulting in a reduction of LDL
      cholesterol. Earlier studies in patients with homozygous FH reveal AEGR-733 is highly
      effective in lowering LDL cholesterol, yet long term safety and efficacy need to be
      established.

    <certain_agreements>
      <pi_employee>Principal Investigators are NOT employed by the organization sponsoring the study.</pi_employee>
      <restrictive_agreement>The CTAs generally envision a multisite publication, with the PI’s right to publish individually if the pooled publication does not occur within 12 months of study completion. Sponsor has a 45 to 60 day review/approval period to request deletion of confidential information or to request limited deferral to protect its proprietary technology. In one case, the publication provision is more general, specifying that the Sponsor and clinical site will agree on the manner/terms of publication.</restrictive_agreement>
