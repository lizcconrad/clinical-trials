    <measure>Change From Baseline in Weighted Mean Heart Rate 0-4 Hours Post-dose at the End of the 28-day Treatment Period</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to Day 28</time_frame>
    <description>Co-Primary Endpoint. Weighted mean was derived by calculating the average area under the curve (AUC), and then dividing by the relevant time interval. Baseline is the most recent result taken on or before pre-dose Day 1. Heart rate was recorded at 60 minutes (min) prior to dosing and at 15 min, 45 min, 90 min, 120 min, and 240 min post-dose on Day 28. Change from Baseline was calculated as the Day 28 value minus the Baseline value. Analysis was performed using a restricted maximum likelihood (REML)-based repeated measures mixed model approach (MMRM) with covariates of Baseline heart rate, sex, age, smoking status, treatment, and day and day by treatment and day by Baseline interactions. par.=participants.</description>

    <time_frame>From Baseline (Day 1) until Follow-up (up to Study Day 37)</time_frame>
    <description>Co-Primary Endpoint. An AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a participant or clinical investigation participant, temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product. An SAE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence that, at any dose: results in death; is life-threatening; requires hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization; results in disability/incapacity; or is a congenital anomaly/birth defect. See the SAE/AE module of this results summary for a list of specific SAEs/AEs occurring in the study.</description>

    <measure>Mean Change From Baseline in Clinic Visit Trough Forced Expiratory Volume in One Second (FEV1) on Days 2, 15, and 29</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline; Day 2, Day 15, and Day 29</time_frame>
    <description>FEV1 is a measure of lung function and is defined as the maximal amount of air that can be forcefully exhaled in one second. Trough FEV1 on Days 2, 15, and 29 is defined as the mean of the FEV1 values obtained 23 and 24 hours after dosing on Days 1, 14, and 28. The highest of 3 technically acceptable measurements was recorded. Baseline FEV1 is defined as the mean of the two assessments obtained 30 minutes pre-dose and immediately pre-dose on Day 1. Change from Baseline was calculated as the Day 29 value minus the Baseline value. Analysis was performed using Mixed Model Repeated Measures (MMRM) with covariates of Baseline FEV1, sex, age, smoking status, treatment and day, and day by treatment and day by Baseline interactions.</description>

    <measure>Mean Change From Baseline (Pre-dose on Day 1) in Weighted Mean FEV1 (0-4 Hours Post-dose) on Days 1 and 28</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (pre-dose on Day 1); Day 1 and Day 28</time_frame>
    <description>FEV1 is a measure of lung function and is defined as the maximal amount of air that can be forcefully exhaled in one second. Serial FEV1 measurements were taken electronically by spirometry at the Day 1 and Day 28 clinic visits (60 minutes pre-dose; immediately pre-dose; post-dose after 5, 15, and 30 minutes and 1, 2, and 4 hours. Weighted mean was calculated using the 24-hour serial FEV1 measurements that included the 0 to 4 hours post-dose assessment. At each time point, the highest of 3 technically acceptable measurements was recorded. Baseline FEV1 was defined as the mean of the two assessments obtained 30 minutes pre-dose and immediately pre-dose on Day 1. Change from Baseline was calculated as the average Day 28 FEV1 value minus the Baseline value. Analysis was performed using Mixed Model Repeated Measures (MMRM) with covariates of Baseline FEV1, sex, age, smoking status, treatment and day, and day by treatment and day by Baseline interactions.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

        Subjects eligible for enrollment in the study must meet all of the following criteria:

          1. Informed consent: Subjects must give their signed written informed consent to
             participate.

          2. Gender: Male subjects or female subjects of non-child bearing potential (e.g.
             post-menopausal or surgical sterile) 40 - 80 years of age at screening (Visit 1).

               -  Post-menopausal females are defined as being amenorrhoeic for greater than 2
                  years with an appropriate clinical profile, e.g. age appropriate, history of
                  vasomotor symptoms. However if indicated this can be confirmed by estradiol and
                  FSH levels consistent with menopause (according to laboratory ranges) at
                  screening (Visit 1).

               -  Surgically sterile females are defined as those with a documented (medical report
                  verification) hysterectomy and/or bilateral oophorectomy or Tubal Ligation.

               -  Furthermore, male subjects in this study must use double-barrier
                  (condom/spermicide) birth control methods or abstain from sexual intercourse with
                  female partners who are pregnant, lactating, or able to bear children in addition
                  to any birth control methods the female partner is using, from the first dose of
                  the study medication until 90 days after the last dose of the study medication.

          3. COPD diagnosis: Subjects with a clinical history of COPD in accordance with the
             following definition by the American Thoracic Society/European Respiratory Society
             [Celli, 2004] :

             COPD is a preventable and treatable disease characterized by airflow limitation that
             is not fully reversible. The airflow limitation is usually progressive and is
             associated with an abnormal inflammatory response of the lungs to noxious particles or
             gases, primarily caused by cigarette smoking. Although COPD affects the lungs, it also
             produces significant systemic consequences.

          4. Tobacco use: subjects with a current or previous history of ≥ 10 pack-years of
             cigarette smoking at screening (Visit 1). Previous smokers are defined as those who
             have stopped smoking for at least 6 months prior to Visit 1.

             • Number of pack years = (number of cigarette per day/20)) x number of years smoked

          5. Severity of Disease: subjects who conform to the current severity classification for
             Stage II/III disease in terms of post-bronchodilator spirometry at Screening Visit 1:

               -  Subject with a measured post-salbutamol FEV1/FVC ratio of ≤0.70

               -  Subjects with a measured post-salbutamol FEV1 ≥ 40 % and ≤ 80 % of predicted
                  normal values calculated using NHANES III reference equations.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Subjects meeting any of the following criteria must not be enrolled in the study:

          1. Pregnancy: Women who are pregnant or lactating

          2. Asthma: Subjects with a current diagnosis of asthma. (Subjects with a prior history of
             asthma are eligible if COPD is the current diagnosis)

          3. α1- antitrypsin deficiency: Subjects with α-1 antitrypsin deficiency as the underlying
             cause of COPD

          4. Other respiratory disorders: Subjects with active tuberculosis, lung cancer,
             bronchiectasis, sarcoidosis, lung fibrosis, pulmonary hypertension, interstitial lung
             diseases or other active pulmonary diseases

          5. Lung Resection: Subjects with lung volume reduction surgery within the 12 months prior
             to Screening

          6. Chest X-ray (or CT scan): Subjects with a chest X-ray (or CT scan) that reveals
             evidence of clinically significant abnormalities not believed to be due to the
             presence of COPD. A chest X-ray must be taken at Screening if a chest X-ray or CT scan
             is not available within 6 months prior to Screening

          7. Poorly controlled COPD: Subjects with poorly controlled COPD, defined as the
             occurrence of any of the following in the 6 weeks prior to Screening:

               -  Acute worsening of COPD that is managed by subject with corticosteroids or
                  antibiotics, or

               -  Acute worsening of COPD that requires treatment prescribed by a physician
                  Subjects who are hospitalized due to poorly controlled COPD within 12 weeks of
                  the Screening Visit

          8. Lower respiratory tract infection: Subjects with lower respiratory tract infection
             that required the use of antibiotics within 6 weeks prior to Visit 1

          9. 12-lead ECG (Electrocardiogram): An abnormal and clinically significant 12-lead ECG
             that results in an active medical problem. For this study, an abnormal ECG is defined
             as a 12-lead tracing that is interpreted as, but not limited to, any of the following:

               -  Clinically significant conduction abnormalities (e.g. left bundle branch block,
                  Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome)

               -  Clinically significant arrhythmias (e.g. atrial fibrillation, ventricular
                  tachycardia)

             The independent cardiologist, contracted by GSK, will determine the clinical
             significance of any ECG abnormalities and determine if a subject is precluded from
             entering the study. However, the following predetermined ECG abnormalities are
             considered clinically significant and will result in exclusion of a subject:

               -  Ventricular rate &lt; 45 bpm

               -  PR interval &gt; 240 msec

               -  Evidence of Second-Degree (Mobitz type II) or Third-Degree atrioventricular (AV)
                  block

               -  Pathological Q waves

               -  Non-specific intraventricular conduction delay

               -  Right or left complete bundle branch block

               -  A mean QTc(B) value at Screening &gt; 450 msec, or uncorrected QT &gt;600 msec or an
                  ECG that is not suitable for QT measurements (e.g. poorly defined termination of
                  the T wave)

         10. Other Diseases/abnormalities: Subjects with historical or current evidence of
             clinically significant cardiovascular, neurological, psychiatric, renal, hepatic,
             immunological, endocrine (including uncontrolled diabetes or thyroid disease) or
             haematological abnormalities that are uncontrolled. Significant is defined as any
             disease that, in the opinion of the investigator, would put the safety of the subject
             at risk through participation, or which would affect the efficacy or safety analysis
             if the disease/condition exacerbated during the study.

         11. Hepatitis: Subjects with a positive Hepatitis B surface antigen or positive Hepatitis
             C antibody pre-study or at Screening

             the skin would not be excluded if the subject has been considered cured within 5 years
             since diagnosis.

         14. Drug/food allergy: Subjects with a history of hypersensitivity to any of the study
             medications (e.g. beta-agonists, corticosteroid) or components of the inhalation
             powder (e.g. lactose, magnesium stearate). Or a history of drug or other allergy such
             as a history of severe milk protein allergy that, in the opinion of the study
             physician, contraindicates the subject's participation

         15. Drug/alcohol abuse: Subjects with a known or suspected history of alcohol or drug
             abuse within the last 2 years

         16. Medication prior to spirometry: Subjects who are medically unable to withhold their
             rescue medication for the 6-hour period required prior to spirometry testing at each

             intellectual deficiency, poor motivation or other conditions that will limit the
             validity of informed consent to participate in the study

         21. Prior use of study medication/other investigational drugs: Subjects who have received
             the GW642444 in previous studies. Subjects who have received an investigational drug

        <title>Change From Baseline in Weighted Mean Heart Rate 0-4 Hours Post-dose at the End of the 28-day Treatment Period</title>
        <description>Co-Primary Endpoint. Weighted mean was derived by calculating the average area under the curve (AUC), and then dividing by the relevant time interval. Baseline is the most recent result taken on or before pre-dose Day 1. Heart rate was recorded at 60 minutes (min) prior to dosing and at 15 min, 45 min, 90 min, 120 min, and 240 min post-dose on Day 28. Change from Baseline was calculated as the Day 28 value minus the Baseline value. Analysis was performed using a restricted maximum likelihood (REML)-based repeated measures mixed model approach (MMRM) with covariates of Baseline heart rate, sex, age, smoking status, treatment, and day and day by treatment and day by Baseline interactions. par.=participants.</description>

        <description>FEV1 is a measure of lung function and is defined as the maximal amount of air that can be forcefully exhaled in one second. Trough FEV1 on Days 2, 15, and 29 is defined as the mean of the FEV1 values obtained 23 and 24 hours after dosing on Days 1, 14, and 28. The highest of 3 technically acceptable measurements was recorded. Baseline FEV1 is defined as the mean of the two assessments obtained 30 minutes pre-dose and immediately pre-dose on Day 1. Change from Baseline was calculated as the Day 29 value minus the Baseline value. Analysis was performed using Mixed Model Repeated Measures (MMRM) with covariates of Baseline FEV1, sex, age, smoking status, treatment and day, and day by treatment and day by Baseline interactions.</description>

        <title>Mean Change From Baseline (Pre-dose on Day 1) in Weighted Mean FEV1 (0-4 Hours Post-dose) on Days 1 and 28</title>
        <description>FEV1 is a measure of lung function and is defined as the maximal amount of air that can be forcefully exhaled in one second. Serial FEV1 measurements were taken electronically by spirometry at the Day 1 and Day 28 clinic visits (60 minutes pre-dose; immediately pre-dose; post-dose after 5, 15, and 30 minutes and 1, 2, and 4 hours. Weighted mean was calculated using the 24-hour serial FEV1 measurements that included the 0 to 4 hours post-dose assessment. At each time point, the highest of 3 technically acceptable measurements was recorded. Baseline FEV1 was defined as the mean of the two assessments obtained 30 minutes pre-dose and immediately pre-dose on Day 1. Change from Baseline was calculated as the average Day 28 FEV1 value minus the Baseline value. Analysis was performed using Mixed Model Repeated Measures (MMRM) with covariates of Baseline FEV1, sex, age, smoking status, treatment and day, and day by treatment and day by Baseline interactions.</description>
