  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to develop computer programs to assist radiologists in finding
      breast cancer on mammograms and to compare the computer's accuracy of detecting cancers on
      direct digital and film mammograms.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      To develop a computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) system for full field digital mammography (FFDM)
      using advanced computer vision techniques and to evaluate the effects of CAD on
      interpretation of digital mammograms (DMs). This system will assist radiologists with the
      four most important areas in mammographic interpretation: (1) detection of masses, (2)
      classification of masses, (3) detection of microcalcifications, (4) classification of
      microcalcifications. The proposed approach is distinctly different from previous approaches
      in that image information from two-view and bilateral mammograms will be fused with that from
      the single-view mammogram to improve lesion detection and characterization.

Two-view digital mammogram of the breast with a lesion that has been recommended for biopsy during the subject's regular clinical care. The digital mammogram is then analyzed by a computer program.</description>
