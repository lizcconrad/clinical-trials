  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the antiviral activity and safety of tenofovir
      disoproxil fumarate (TDF) in Asian-American adults (self-reported Asian descent, living in
      the United States) with chronic hepatitis B infection. All participants will receive active
      treatment with TDF for 48 weeks.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Efficacy of TDF will be evaluated for reductions in serum HBV DNA, changes in liver enzymes,
      and the generation of antibody to the virus. Safety will be assessed by evaluating adverse
      events, laboratory abnormalities, and the development of drug resistance mutations.

    <time_frame>Week 48</time_frame>
    <description>Blood samples were collected for evaluating serum chemistry, including determination of ALT, and for measuring HBV DNA via PCR method. Composite endpoints proposed in the protocol included the percentage of participants with HBV DNA &lt; 400 copies/mL (&lt;69 IU/mL) and normal ALT (ALT &lt;= ULN [34 U/L]); and with HBV DNA &lt; 400 copies/mL, normal ALT, and HBeAg loss/seroconversion. Because so few participants lost hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg) or developed antibody to hepatitis B e antigen (anti-HBe), only the composite endpoint of HBV DNA &lt; 400 copies/mL and normal ALT was analyzed.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in FibroTest Value</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 48</time_frame>
    <description>The FibroTest score is used to assess liver fibrosis and is calculated based on a formula including the participant's age and sex and 5 laboratory parameters: alpha 2 macroglobulin, haptoglobin, gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT), bilirubin, and apolipoprotein A1. Scores can range from 0.00 to 1.00, with higher scores indicating a greater degree of fibrosis.</description>

HBeAg/HBsAg serocoversion is defined for an individual participant as HBeAg+/HBsAg+ at baseline and HBeAg-/HBsAg- and anti-HBe+/antibody to hepatitis B surface antigen+ (anti-HBs+) at Week 48.</description>
