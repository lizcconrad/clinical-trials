  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This single arm study will assess the efficacy and safety of MabThera + chlorambucil as
      induction therapy, followed in responders by maintenance therapy or observation in elderly
      patients with previously untreated chronic lymphocytic leukemia. During the induction phase
      patients will receive 2 x 4 weekly courses of chlorambucil followed by 8 x 4 weekly courses
      of chlorambucil + MabThera. Subsequently, responders will be randomized to receive 12 doses
      of MabThera given every 8 weeks, or no further treatment. The anticipated time on study
      treatment is 2+ years, and the target sample size is &lt;100 individuals.

SD was defined by the absence of necessary criteria to achieve CR or PR, but no advancement to PD. Relapse was defined by a previously noted CR or PR with advancement to PD after a period of ≥ 6 months. Nodular PR was defined by the presence of residual lymphoid nodules.</description>

PD was defined by 1 of the following: 1) lymphadenopathy: any new lesion, HM/SM, or other organ infiltrates, or a ≥ 50% increase in greatest diameter of any previously noted lesion; 2) a ≥50% increase in previously noted HM/SM, or new appearance of HM/SM; 3) a ≥50% increase in blood lymphocyte count with at least 5000 B lymphocytes/μL; 4) transformation to a more aggressive histology, e.g., Richter’s syndrome; or 5) occurrence of cytopenia attributable to CLL. SD was defined by the absence of necessary criteria to achieve CR or PR, but no advancement to PD. Relapse was defined by a previously noted CR or PR with advancement to PD after a period of ≥6 months. Nodular PR was defined by the presence of residual lymphoid nodules.</description>

Participants without a follow-up assessment were censored at the day of last dose of study treatment. Mean survival time and it's standard error (SE) were underestimated because the largest observation was censored and the estimation was restricted to the largest event time.</description>

          <title>Disease-Free Survival</title>
          <description>The mean time, in days, from the date of first documented CR or CRi to the date of disease progression or death. CR, CRi, and PD as previously defined. Participants with no documented PD after CR or CRi were censored on the last date at which they were known to have had CR or CRi. In both groups, the mean survival time and its standard error were underestimated because the largest observation was censored and the estimation was restricted to the largest event time.</description>
