    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this investigation is to determine the survivorship of the LCS
      Complete AP Glide mobile bearing knee prosthesis at 5 years.

      The secondary objectives of this investigation are to evaluate the clinical performance of
      the LCS速 Complete AP Glide mobile bearing knee prosthesis and to determine its long-term
      survivorship.

At times, the survey is also displayed via 8 domain scales that are also scored from 0 to 100 (where 100 indicates the highest level of health) as follows: Physical Function, Role Physical, Bodily Pain, General Health, Mental Health, Role Emotional, Social Function, and Vitality.</description>
