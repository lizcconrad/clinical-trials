      The study hypothesis is that people who respond well to sulphonylureas have a different
      underlying cause for their diabetes than people who respond poorly to this medication. We are
      using two approaches to study this. In one approach we look at people who have previously
      responded well or poorly, confirm this by rechallenging them with a sulphonylurea drug, and
      then looking at how well they produce insulin in response to glucose and an intravenous
      sulphonylurea called tolbutamide. The second approach identifies people with a certain
      genetic predisposition to diabetes (due to changes in the TCF7L2 gene) and then looks at how
      well they respond to sulphonylurea medication.
