      This study is an open label randomized controlled trial in adult DM2 patients seen in ED
      services at John H. Stroger Hospital of Cook County serving a largely uninsured/underserved
      population. Individuals more than 18 years of age with DM2, either with new onset DM2 or
      known diabetics who did not take oral hypoglycemic agents for more than 2 weeks, presenting
      with fasting blood glucose (FBG) 300-500 mg/dl or random blood glucose (RBG) 400-700 mg/dl
      and who did not have any exclusion criteria listed in Table 1, were eligible for the study.
      Subjects were randomized to one of the two fixed dose treatment groups: 1) Glipizide XL 10 mg
      orally daily prior to breakfast (G group), 2) Glipizide XL 10 mg orally daily along with
      Insulin Glargine 10 units at bedtime, subcutaneously (G+G group).

    <description>Glipizide XL is an insulin secretagogue and is an extended release tablet designed to provide a controlled rate of delivery. Glipizide XL was chosen because it is the most frequently used discharge oral medication in our ED. It has a quick onset of action within a few hours after oral ingestion, lasts for 24 hours and has a powerful glucose lowering effect. In addition, there are very few contraindications to Glipizide XL and there is published literature regarding their use in subjects with severe hyperglycemia</description>

    <arm_group_type>Active Comparator</arm_group_type>
    <description>Insulin Glargine is a recombinant human basal insulin analog. It was chosen since it is a non-peaking insulin with cover for 24 hours. It can be injected subcutaneously only once a day and has a low incidence of hypoglycemia</description>
