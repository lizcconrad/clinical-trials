  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this registry is to better understand (1) complicated skin and soft-tissue
      infections requiring hospitalization, and (2) clinical and economic outcomes in hospitalized
      patients receiving intravenous antibiotic therapy.

      A prospective, multi-center, observational study involving 1200 patients hospitalized for the
      treatment of cSSTIs. The study will be conducted at approximately 50 hospitals in the US.
      Patients who consent to participate in the registry will be enrolled in the registry within
      24 hours of initial IV antibiotic therapy for treatment of one or more cSSTI types. Sites
      will treat patients according to their usual clinical practice. The objective of this
      registry is to characterize cSSTIs with respect to patient characteristics and describe
      patient outcomes.
