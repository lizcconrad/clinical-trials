  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To determine the activity of SCH 727965 in participants with breast cancer and in
      participants with nonsmall-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) compared to standard treatment. The
      standard treatment used is capecitabine for breast cancer and erlotinib for NSCLC. The study
      will also determine the activity of SCH 727965 treatment in participants who experience
      cancer progression after standard treatment.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Age &gt;=18 years, either sex, any race.

          -  Histologically or cytologically confirmed breast cancer or NSCLC; and radiographic or
             clinically advanced disease.

          -  BREAST CANCER:

               -  participant must have previously received both a taxane and an anthracycline
                  (unless anthracycline therapy is contraindicated) in the adjuvant and/or
                  metastatic setting,

               -  participant with HER2-positive disease must have progressed after trastuzumab and
                  concomitant or subsequent lapatinib,

               -  participant must have received at least one, but no more than two prior regimens
                  for recurrent or metastatic disease (endocrine and biologic therapies do not
                  count as chemotherapeutic regimens).

          -  NSCLC: at least one, but no more than two prior chemotherapeutic regimens for advanced
             disease.

          -  Measurable disease by the RECIST.

          -  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0, 1, or 2.

          -  Adequate hematologic, renal, and hepatic organ function and laboratory parameters.

          -  Ability to swallow tablets.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Known brain metastases. For NSCLC only, a participant with central nervous system
             metastasis is eligible provided the participant has received definitive local therapy
             (ie, radiation therapy or surgery), has stopped receiving treatment with
             corticosteroids, and is without symptoms for at least 4 weeks before randomization.

          -  History of previous radiation therapy to &gt;25% of total bone marrow.

          -  Known HIV infection.

          -  Known active hepatitis B or hepatitis C.

          -  Previous treatment with SCH 727965 or other cyclin-dependent-kinase inhibitors.

          -  BREAST CANCER:

               -  known dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase deficiency,

               -  previous treatment with capecitabine.

          -  NSCLC: previous treatment with erlotinib.
