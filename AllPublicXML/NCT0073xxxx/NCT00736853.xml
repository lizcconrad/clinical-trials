    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of tramadol hydrochloride
      plus acetaminophen (JNS013) in participants with chronic pain accompanied by osteoarthritis
      (a progressive and degenerative joint disease, in which the joints become painful and stiff)
      of the knee or low back pain (acute or chronic pain in the lumbar or sacral regions) which
      cannot be controlled sufficiently with non-steriodal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs).

      This is a multi-center (when more than one hospital or medical school team work on a medical
      research study), double-blind (test or experiment in which neither the person giving the
      treatment nor the participant knows which treatment the participant is receiving),
      placebo-controlled (an inactive substance; a pretend treatment [with no drug in it] that is
      compared in a clinical trial with a drug to test if the drug has a real effect), parallel
      group comparison study. The total duration of the study will be 11 weeks and consists of 4
      periods; a pre-observation period (4 weeks), open-label period (2 weeks), double-blind period
      (4 weeks) and follow-up period (1 week). Participants will receive tramadol hydrochloride
      plus acetaminophen tablets orally 4 times daily for 2 weeks with no less than 4-hour
      intervals (up to 8 tablets per day) during the open-label period and the dose will be fixed
      for each participant in the latter 1 week. During the double-period participants will receive
      tramadol hydrochloride plus acetaminophen tablets or placebo at the same dose as used for the
      latter 1 week of the open-label period for up to 4 weeks. Efficacy will be primarily
      evaluated by number of participants with insufficient pain relief after the start of
      double-blind period. Participant's safety will be monitored throughout the study.

The overall possible score ranges for PRID is -2=worst to 7=best.

          <description>The PRID is defined as sum of PID and PAR Scores for each participant at each evaluation time point (at 2 and 4 hours after the dosing). The overall possible score range for PRID is -2=worst to 7=best. The PID was calculated as PI at pre-dose on Day 1, 8, 15, 22, 28 minus PI at post-dose time point (i.e., 2 hours and 4 hours) on Day 1, 8, 15, 22, 28 respectively. Baseline PI score ranges from 1=minor to 3=severe, post-baseline PI score ranges from 0=none to 3=severe. Total possible score range for PID: -2=worst to 3=best and PAR was evaluated based on a 5-stage scale score ranges from 0=no relief and 4=complete relief.</description>

        <description>The SF-36 is a survey of participant health and quality of life. It consists of 8 sub-scales, which are the weighted sums of the questions in their section. The 8 sub-scales are: physical functioning, role-physical, role-emotional, general health, social functioning, bodily pain, vitality, mental health. Each item is scored on a scale ranging from 0-100. Higher score defines a more favorable health status or a better mental status.</description>
