      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as doxorubicin, work in different ways to stop
      the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing.
      Infusing doxorubicin beads into the liver, and blocking blood flow to the tumor, may keep
      doxorubicin near the tumor and kill more tumor cells.

      PURPOSE: This clinical trial is studying the side effects of doxorubicin beads and to see how
      well they work in treating patients with unresectable liver metastases from neuroendocrine
      tumors.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  To gather preliminary data and determine the feasibility of a randomized study of
           patients with unresectable hepatic neuroendocrine metastases using PVA microporous
           hydrospheres/doxorubicin hydrochloride.

      OUTLINE: A catheter is placed into the right or left hepatic artery. Patients with unifocal
      tumors will have the catheter or microcatheter placed more selectively into the 2nd or 3rd
      order branch off the right or left hepatic artery in closer proximity to the tumor. Polyvinyl
      alcohol (PVA) microporous hydrospheres/doxorubicin hydrochloride mixture is injected into the
      delivery area.

      Patients with less than 75% necrosis at 1 month undergo a second (and possibly a third a
      month later) chemoembolization.

      After completion of study therapy, patients are followed at 1 month, every 2 months for 1
      year, and then every 3 months for 1 year.

    <description>Safety was assessed at each DEB-TACE procedure and at every follow-up thereafter according to National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria (CTCAE) v3.0.

Scoring system for assessing symptom severity in patients with neuroendocrine/carcinoid syndrome was as follows:
- No symptoms - Patient completely asymptomatic
- Mild symptoms - Patient with symptoms of diarrhea, flushing, or asthma up to 4 times weekly
- Symptoms impact daily living - symptoms of diarrhea, flushing, or asthma up 5-7 weekly
- Severe symptoms - multiple daily symptoms of diarrhea, flushing, or asthma; symptoms require significant reorganization of daily activities
- Disabling symptoms - Patient disabled by multiple attacks and severe symptoms; unable to leave home or requires hospitalization</description>

        <title>Safety - Number of CTCAE v3.0 Events 1 Month Post DEB-TACE</title>
        <description>Safety was assessed at each DEB-TACE procedure and at every follow-up thereafter according to National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria (CTCAE) v3.0. The study was prematurely terminated due to high incidence of biloma and liver abscess. Safety data below is based off of 13 patients enrolled on protocol at 1 month post initial treatment.</description>

            <description>Patients were treated with DEB-TACE loaded with doxorubicin up to four procedures in 6 months as indicated, for a maximum of six procedures during the course of 2 years. Follow-up clinical examinations, laboratory assessments, and imaging took place 1 month after each DEB-TACE treatment and then every 2 to 3 months for a period of 2 years. Each DEB-TACE procedure used a maximum of 100mg doxorubicin loaded onto 100-300um LC Beads.</description>

RECIST:
Complete Response (CR): Disappearance of all targeted lesions Partial Response (PR): At least 30% decrease in the sum of longest diameter (LD) of targeted lesions Progressive Disease (PD): At least 20% increase in the sum of LD of targeted lesions Stable Disease (SD): Cases that are not applicable for PD or PR.
EASL:
CR: Absence of any enhancement in target lesion PR: Greater than 50% decrease from baseline enhancement in target lesion PD: Greater than 25% increase in target lesion SD: All other cases</description>

Scoring system for assessing symptom severity in patients with neuroendocrine/carcinoid syndrome was as follows:
- No symptoms - Patient completely asymptomatic
- Mild symptoms - Patient with symptoms of diarrhea, flushing, or asthma up to 4 times weekly
- Symptoms impact daily living - symptoms of diarrhea, flushing, or asthma up 5-7 weekly
- Severe symptoms - multiple daily symptoms of diarrhea, flushing, or asthma; symptoms require significant reorganization of daily activities
- Disabling symptoms - Patient disabled by multiple attacks and severe symptoms; unable to leave home or requires hospitalization</description>

          <description>Symptomatic response not assessed due to premature termination of study.
Scoring system for assessing symptom severity in patients with neuroendocrine/carcinoid syndrome was as follows:
- No symptoms - Patient completely asymptomatic
- Mild symptoms - Patient with symptoms of diarrhea, flushing, or asthma up to 4 times weekly
- Symptoms impact daily living - symptoms of diarrhea, flushing, or asthma up 5-7 weekly
- Severe symptoms - multiple daily symptoms of diarrhea, flushing, or asthma; symptoms require significant reorganization of daily activities
- Disabling symptoms - Patient disabled by multiple attacks and severe symptoms; unable to leave home or requires hospitalization</description>
