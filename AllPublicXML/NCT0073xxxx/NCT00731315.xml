    <textblock>
      Our study aims to test the utility of computer-assisted treatment for uncomplicated,
      recurrent urinary tract infections (UTIs) for women receiving care in safety net health care
      facilities. As of November 2009, we are also testing the utility of computer-assisted
      treatment for certain types of complicated cystitis (i.e. women with voiding symptoms and one
      of the following complicating symptoms: fever, flank pain, or symptoms greater than 7 days).

      An English version of the UTI Kiosk module was validated at UCSF urgent care clinic in 2005,
      and has been successfully integrated into the clinical work flow at this clinic for over 2
      years. The computer-based module is housed in a freestanding kiosk with a touch-screen
      monitor and audio handset to allow patients with low literacy and minimum computer skills to
      complete the module. A printer in the kiosk provides a summary of the patient's responses to
      each question in the module, as well as a prescription for the clinic physician to sign and
      return to the patient.

      It's important to emphasize that the computer only &quot;fast-tracks&quot; women who will be treated
      with antibiotics. All other women see the provider as usual. Also, all women who are eligible
      for computer treatment may opt to see a provider instead.
