    <textblock>
      This study is an open-label extension to the double-blind GUP-0205-1 and double-blind
      extension GUP-0205-1XX studies. High concentrations of anti-oxidants in pomegranate seeds
      present a potential strategy to delay clinical prostate cancer progression and prolong the
      interval from treatment failure to hormonal ablation. Eligible male subjects were previously
      assigned to the placebo group in the double-blind core study or the double-blind extension
      study and were diagnosed with disease progression while on placebo treatment. Upon satisfying
      all entry criteria, the subjects will receive open-label pomegranate extract for up to 48
      months in the absence of further disease progression or intolerable toxicity.

      This study is an open-label extension to the double-blind GUP-0205-1 and double-blind
      extension GUP-0205-1XX studies. Eligible male subjects, i.e.,men who had rising PSA levels
      following primary therapy for localized prostate cancer, were previously assigned to the
      placebo group in the double-blind study or the double-blind extension and were diagnosed with
      disease progression while on placebo treatment. Upon satisfying all entry criteria, the
      subjects will receive open-label pomegranate extract for up to 48 months in the absence of
      further disease progression or intolerable toxicity.

    <criteria>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Documented disease progression while on placebo in the GUP-0205-1 or GUP-0205-1XX
             study (a ≥100% increase over baseline serum PSA with a minimum increase of 1.0 ng/mL.

          -  Willingness and ability to sign an informed consent document.

          -  Agreement with complete abstinence from other commercially available pomegranate
             products during the course of the study.

          -  Use of dietary/herbal supplements (e.g., saw palmetto, selenium, etc) are acceptable
             provided the dose has been stable for at least 2 months prior to screening and the
             subject agrees not to change/stop during the course of the study.

          -  Performance status 0 or 1 on the ECOG scale at time of entry into this extension
             Study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Significant concomitant medical or psychiatric condition that, in the opinion of the
             investigator, would make the subject a poor protocol candidate.

          -  Hormonal therapy, with the exception of neoadjuvant androgen deprivation therapy (ADT)
             prior to or concurrent with primary therapy. Subjects who underwent neoadjuvant ADT
             cannot have a serum testosterone of ≤150 ng/mL at study entry.

          -  Concomitant or antecedent hormonal therapy for rising serum PSA after initial therapy
             of prostate cancer.

          -  Subjects unable or unwilling to comply with protocol requirements.

          -  Prior treatment with experimental drugs, high dose steroids, or with any other cancer
             treatment within 4 weeks prior to the first dose of study product and for the duration
             of the study.

          -  Serum PSA &gt;7.0 ng/mL (assessed at termination of the double-blind study or ET of the
             double-blind extension GUP-0205-1XX); at any PSA level, the subject will be excluded
             if determined by the investigator that the subject's continued participation would not
             be in their best interest).

          -  Serum PSA doubling time &lt;13 weeks (assessed at termination of the double-blind study
             or ET of the double-blind extension GUP-0205-1XX)).

          -  Evidence of metastatic disease on physical examination or on CT or bone scan.

          -  Use of finasteride, dutasteride at any point since primary therapy or during the
             study.

          -  Clinically significant abnormal laboratory value greater than 2 times the upper limit
             of normal (&gt;2XULN).
