  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Green banana has been traditionally used in diarrheal and other diseases. Recent studies have
      shown that green banana is beneficial in children with diarrhea.

      The purpose of this study is to try green banana in a portable, storable and dosable form in
      infants with diarrhea.

      Infants with diarrhea and meeting the inclusion criteria will receive either green banana
      powder or placebo (microcrystalline cellulose). Their response will be monitored for 10 days.
      The subjects, parents and researchers conducting the study will not know whether banana
      powder or placebo is being given to that particular subject (double blind randomized study).

      Two hundred patients will be enrolled in 24 months.
