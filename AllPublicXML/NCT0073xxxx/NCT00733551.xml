    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Healthy as determined by a physician, based on a medical evaluation including medical
             history, physical examination, laboratory tests and cardiac monitoring. A subject with
             a clinical abnormality or laboratory parameters outside the reference range for the
             population being studied may be included only if the Investigator and the GSK Medical
             Monitor agree that the finding is unlikely to introduce additional risk factors and
             will not interfere with the study procedures. In any case, liver function tests must
             be strictly within the normal range at screening.

          -  Male or female between 18 and 55 years of age, inclusive.

          -  Non-smoker for at least 6 months based on smoking history.

          -  A female subject is eligible to participate if she is of:

          -  Non-childbearing potential defined as pre-menopausal females with a documented tubal
             ligation or hysterectomy; or postmenopausal defined as 12 months of spontaneous
             amenorrhea [in questionable cases a blood sample with simultaneous follicle
             stimulating hormone (FSH) &gt; 40 MlU/mL is confirmatory.

          -  Child-bearing potential and agrees to use one of the contraception methods listed in
             the protocol for an appropriate period of time (as determined by the product label or
             investigator) prior to the start of dosing to sufficiently minimize the risk of
             pregnancy at that point. Female subjects must agree to use contraception for at least
             4 days following the last dose of study medication.

          -  Male subjects must agree to use one of the contraception methods listed in the
             protocol. This criterion must be followed from the time of the first dose of study
             medication through at least 4 days after the last dose of study medication.

          -  Body weight &gt; 50 kg and BMI within the range 18.5 - 29.9 kg/m2 (inclusive).

          -  QTcB or QTcF &lt; 450 msec or QTc&lt;480msec in subjects with Bundle Branch Block based on
             single or average QTc value of triplicate values obtained over a brief recording
             period.

          -  Normal physical examination (physical exam demonstrates no evidence of clinically
             active disease or physical or mental impairment). A subject with a clinical
             abnormality may be included only if the Principal Investigator or physician designee
             considers that the abnormality will not introduce additional risk factors and will not
             interfere with the study procedures. Consultation with the GSK medical monitor is
             required before such subjects may be included.

          -  Capable of giving written informed consent, which includes compliance with the
             requirements and restrictions listed in the consent form.

          -  Subjects will have negative Helicobacter pylori status or have received eradication
             within the last calendar year.

        Exclusion Inclusion:

          -  History or presence of any clinically significant metabolic condition,
             gastrointestinal (including passing of &gt; 3 stools/ day or &lt;3 stools/week) condition or
             endocrinological condition.

          -  History or presence of clinically significant gastro-intestinal, hepatic or renal
             disease or other condition known to interfere with the absorption, distribution,
             metabolism or excretion of drugs.

          -  History of major gastrointestinal surgical procedure within the last 10 years.

          -  History of cholecystectomy or biliary tract disease.

          -  History or presence of thyroid dysfunction (NOTE: subjects with abnormal TSH at
             screening/baseline or hypothyroidism on a stable dose of thyroid replacement therapy
             are not eligible).

          -  A history or presence of recreational drug abuse or dependence or current abuse as
             evidenced by positive pre-study drug/alcohol screen. A minimum list of drugs that will
             be screened for include amphetamines, barbiturates, cocaine, opiates, cannabinoids and
             benzodiazepines.

          -  A positive pre-study Hepatitis B surface antigen or positive Hepatitis C antibody
             result within 3 months of screening.

          -  History of regular alcohol consumption within 6 months of the study defined as:

          -  An average weekly intake of greater than 21 units or an average daily intake of
             greater than 3 units (males), or defined as an average weekly intake of greater than
             14 units or an average daily intake of greater than 2 units (females). One unit is
             equivalent to approximately a half-pint (220mL) of beer or 1 (25ml) measure of spirits
             or 1 glass (125ml) of wine.

          -  The subject has participated in a clinical trial and has received an investigational
             product within the following time period prior to the first dosing day in the current
             study: 30 days, 5 half-lives or twice the duration of the biological effect of the
             investigational product (whichever is longer).

          -  Exposure to more than four new chemical entities within 12 months prior to the first
             dosing day.

             supplements (including St John's Wort) within 7 days (or 14 days if the drug is a
             potential enzyme inducer) or 5 half-lives (whichever is longer) prior to the first
             dose of study medication, unless in the opinion of the Investigator and GSK Medical
             Monitor the medication will not interfere with the study procedures or compromise
             subject safety.

          -  History of sensitivity to any of the study medications, or components thereof or a
             history of drug or other allergy that, in the opinion of the investigator or GSK
             Medical Monitor, contraindicates their participation.

          -  Where participation in the study would result in donation of blood or blood products
             in excess of 500 mL within a 56 day period.

          -  Pregnant females as determined by positive serum or urine hCG test (from the first
             urine of the day) at screening or prior to dosing.

          -  Lactating or pregnant females.

          -  Unwillingness or inability to follow the procedures outlined in the protocol.

          -  For male volunteers: An unwillingness of the male subject to comply with the
             contraception requirements listed in the protocol, from the time of the first dose of
             study medication until at least 4 days following administration of the last dose of
             study medication.

          -  History of or current lactose intolerance.

          -  Subjects recruited for/participating in Cohorts 2-5 will be screened such that
             subjects exhibiting rapid gastric emptying rates will be excluded, as defined by the
             reference range of baseline gastric emptying rate (t1/2b) observed in cohort 1.
