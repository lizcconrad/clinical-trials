  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The long-range goal of this research is to develop better ways of helping GI cancer patients
      and their caregivers cope more effectively with the demands of the disease. The study is
      designed to test the hypothesis that a partner-assisted emotional disclosure intervention
      will be more effective in enhancing patient' psychological adjustment than a cancer education
      condition.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The diagnosis and treatment of GI cancer is a traumatic and life-altering event. Many
      patients with GI cancer experience significant emotional distress and disruptions in their
      social relationships as well as multiple physical symptoms and limitations in physical
      activities. There is evidence that cancer patients who are able to confide their feelings and
      concerns about the cancer experience with supportive others, particularly their partners,
      fare better. patients who are able to discuss cancer openly with their partners report fewer
      emotional and physical complaints, and higher levels of self-esteem and perceived control.
      However, there are a number of barriers that often inhibit discussion of cancer-related
      feelings. The proposed study will examine the effect of a new partner-assisted emotional
      disclosure (ED) protocol for patients with GI cancer.

      In this study, 200 patients diagnosed with GI cancer and their partners will be recruited to
      participate. The couples will be randomly assigned to one of two conditions: 1)
      partner-assisted emotional disclosure, or 2) cancer education. Assessment measures will be
      collected at evaluations conducted before and after treatment and at 8 weeks post treatment.
      All evaluations will be conducted over the phone. Information will also be collected from the
      physician and/or the patient's medical record at each of the three evaluations. Audiotapes of
      the partner-assisted emotional disclosure sessions will be transcribed and 10-minute segments
      will be randomly selected and analyzed to assess the extent to which patients express
      emotions and partners verbally reflect the partner's feeling in an empathic manner.

    <description>Patients and partners in the partner-assisted emotional disclosure condition will attend four weekly face-to-face sessions with a therapist. The first session will last 75 minutes and will focus on training in skills to facilitate the patient's disclosure. The subsequent 3 sessions will last 45 minutes each. In these sessions, the therapist will briefly review the strategies and provide feedback from the previous session and the patient will spend 30 minutes talking about their cancer-related concerns to the partner.</description>

    <description>The cancer education protocol consists of four weekly face-to-face sessions for education about living with GI cancer. The cancer education sessions will be delivered to patients and their partners and use a presentation and discussion format. Handouts and discussion sessions will center on the following topics: Orientation to Duke Cancer Care and the treatment team; suggestions for communicating with health care providers; resources for health information, psychosocial support, and financial concerns; evaluating health information on the internet; the impact of cancer on different domains of quality of life; and suggestions for maintaining quality of life.</description>
