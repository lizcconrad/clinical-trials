      (QD), in treating Generalized Anxiety Disorder.

    <textblock>
      The drug that was tested in this study is called Vortioxetine. Vortioxetine is being tested
      to treat anxiety in adults who have general anxiety disorder (GAD). This study looked at GAD
      relief in people who took vortioxetine.

      The study enrolled 304 patients. Participants were randomly assigned (by chance, like
      flipping a coin) to one of the two treatment groups—which remained undisclosed to the patient
      and study doctor during the study (unless there was an urgent medical need):

        -  Vortioxetine 5 mg

        -  Placebo (dummy inactive pill) - this was a capsule that looked like the study drug but
           had no active ingredient.

      All participants were asked to take one capsule at the same time each day throughout the
      study.

      This multi-center trial was conducted in the United States. The overall time to participate
      in this study was up to 13 weeks. Participants made 7 visits to the clinic, and were
      contacted by telephone 4 weeks after the last dose of study drug for a follow-up assessment.

    <measure>Change From Baseline in the Hamilton Anxiety Scale (HAM-A) Total Score at Week 8</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to Week 8</time_frame>
    <description>The HAM-A is an anxiety rating scale consisting of 14 items that assess anxious mood, tension, fear, insomnia, intellectual (cognitive) symptoms, depressed mood, behavior at interview, somatic (sensory), cardiovascular, respiratory, gastrointestinal, genitourinary, autonomic and somatic (muscular) symptoms. Each symptom is rated from 0 (absent) to 4 (maximum severity). Total scores range from 0 to 56 where &lt;17 indicates mild severity, 18-24 mild to moderate severity and 25-30 moderate to severe. Total scores above 30 are rare, but indicate very severe anxiety. Least Squares (LS) means were from a mixed model for repeated measurements (MMRM).</description>

The 3 scores are added together to calculate the total score, which ranges from 0 to 30, with higher scores indicating more impairment.

          <title>Hospital Anxiety and Depression – Anxiety subscale</title>
          <description>Hospital Anxiety and Depression (HAD) Anxiety sub-scale consists of 7 items that are assessed on a scale from 0 (no anxiety) to 3 (severe feeling of anxiety). The anxiety subscale determines a state of generalized anxiety including anxious mood, restlessness, anxious thoughts and panic attacks. Scores are summed and range from 0 to 21 (maximal severity). The number of participants with available data were 149 and 151 in each treatment arm respectively.</description>

        <description>The HAM-A is an anxiety rating scale consisting of 14 items that assess anxious mood, tension, fear, insomnia, intellectual (cognitive) symptoms, depressed mood, behavior at interview, somatic (sensory), cardiovascular, respiratory, gastrointestinal, genitourinary, autonomic and somatic (muscular) symptoms. Each symptom is rated from 0 (absent) to 4 (maximum severity). Total scores range from 0 to 56 where &lt;17 indicates mild severity, 18–24 mild to moderate severity and 25–30 moderate to severe. Total scores above 30 are rare, but indicate very severe anxiety. Least Squares (LS) means were from a mixed model for repeated measurements (MMRM).</description>

        <description>The Sheehan Disability Scale assesses functional impairment in 3 domains: work/school, social life or leisure activities, and home life or family responsibilities. The participant rates the extent to which each aspect is impaired on a 10-point visual analog scale, from 0 (not at all) to 10 (extremely). The 3 scores are added together to calculate the total score, which ranges from 0 to 30, with higher scores indicating more impairment.

        <title>Change From Baseline in the Hospital Anxiety and Depression (HAD) Anxiety Subscale at Other Weeks Assessed</title>
        <description>The Hospital Anxiety and Depression (HAD) Anxiety sub-scale consists of 7 items that are assessed by a scale from 0 (no anxiety) to 3 (severe feeling of anxiety). The anxiety subscale determines a state of generalized anxiety including anxious mood, restlessness, anxious thoughts and panic attacks. Scores are summed and range from 0 to 21 (maximal severity). LS means were from a mixed model for repeated measurements (MMRM).</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Sheehan Disability Scale (SDS) Total Score at Other Weeks Assessed</title>
        <description>The Sheehan Disability Scale assesses functional impairment in 3 domains: work/school, social life or leisure activities, and home life or family responsibilities. The participant rates the extent to which each aspect is impaired on a 10-point visual analog scale, from 0 (not at all) to 10 (extremely). The 3 scores are added together to calculate the total score, which ranges from 0 to 30, with higher scores indicating more impairment. LS means and P-values were from a mixed model for repeated measurements (MMRM).</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in the Hamilton Anxiety Scale (HAM-A) Total Score at Other Weeks Assessed in Participants With Baseline HAM-A ≥25</title>
        <description>The HAM-A is an anxiety rating scale consisting of 14 items that assess anxious mood, tension, fear, insomnia, intellectual (cognitive) symptoms, depressed mood, behavior at interview, somatic (sensory), cardiovascular, respiratory, gastrointestinal, genitourinary, autonomic and somatic (muscular) symptoms. Each symptom is rated from 0 (absent) to 4 (maximum severity). Total scores range from 0 to 56 where &lt;17 indicates mild severity, 18–24 mild to moderate severity and 25–30 moderate to severe. Total scores above 30 are rare, but indicate very severe anxiety. Least Squares (LS) means were from a mixed model for repeated measurements (MMRM).</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Clinical Global Impression Scale-Severity of Illness at Each Week Assessed</title>
        <description>The Clinical Global Impression - Severity scale (CGI-S) is a 7-point scale that requires the clinician to rate the severity of the patient's illness at the time of assessment, relative to the clinician's past experience with patients who have the same diagnosis. Considering total clinical experience, a patient is assessed on severity of mental illness on the following scale: 1, normal, not at all ill; 2, borderline mentally ill; 3, mildly ill; 4, moderately ill; 5, markedly ill; 6, severely ill; or 7, extremely ill. LS means were from a mixed model for repeated measurements (MMRM).</description>

        <description>The HAD-Depression subscale is completed by the participant and measures depression, focusing on the state of lost interest and diminished pleasure response. The subscale is made up of 7 items that are assessed on a scale from 0 (no depression) to 3 (severe feeling of depression). Participants are required to indicate the response which most accurately reflects the way they have felt over the last few days. The item scores are summed and the total subscore ranges from 0 to 21 (maximal severity). LS means were from a mixed model for repeated measurements (MMRM).</description>

          <description>The HAD-Depression subscale is completed by the participant and measures depression, focusing on the state of lost interest and diminished pleasure response. The subscale is made up of 7 items that are assessed on a scale from 0 (no depression) to 3 (severe feeling of depression). Participants are required to indicate the response which most accurately reflects the way they have felt over the last few days. The item scores are summed and the total subscore ranges from 0 to 21 (maximal severity). LS means were from a mixed model for repeated measurements (MMRM).</description>
