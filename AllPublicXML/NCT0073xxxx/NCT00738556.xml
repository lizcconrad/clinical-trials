    <textblock>
      Most doctors who use the new drug-eluting stents for the treatment of long coronary
      narrowings tend to cover the full length of the lesion with long or multiple stents. The
      investigators hypothesized that a policy of spot-stenting, i.e., stenting of only the very
      tight parts of the coronary narrowing, might result in better outcomes by means of avoiding
      multiple stents that have been associated with significant complications such as late stent
      thrombosis.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Coronary artery lesion length is an independent predictor of restenosis following coronary
      intervention and the deployment of multiple or long bare metal stents has been associated
      with an increased risk of adverse clinical outcome. Spot stenting, ie discrete stenting of
      only the most severe stenoses of long, diffuse lesions has been proposed as an alternative in
      this clinical setting. The introduction of drug-eluting stents has resulted in longer lesions
      being stented and the use of multiple, overlapping DES in patients with diffusely diseased
      coronary arteries has been considered safe and effective. However, there has also been
      evidence of increased major adverse cardiac events (MACE) with the use of multiple,
      overlapping DES,10-12 while long DES have been associated with increased probability of
      intraprocedural stent thrombosis.13 We hypothesized that an approach based on spot-stenting
      with the use of DES might result in superior clinical outcomes compared to full cover of
      atheromatic lesions with long or multiple stents. We are therefore conducting a randomized
      comparison of spot versus multiple overlapping stenting on consecutive patients with long
      (&gt;20 mm) lesions and indications for percutaneous coronary intervention.
