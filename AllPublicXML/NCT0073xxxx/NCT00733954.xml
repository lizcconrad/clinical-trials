      This study is a comparison between Clobetasol Propionate Spray and Clobetasol Propionate
      Ointment with Regard to Efficacy, Safety, Subject Satisfaction and Duration of Response in
      Moderate to Severe Stable Plaque Psoriasis. Subjects will be enrolled and randomized into one
      of two groups: clobetasol propionate Spray for 4 weeks of treatment or clobetasol propionate
      ointment for 2 weeks of treatment with a 2 week follow-up visit for each group.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects with a diagnosis of moderate to severe plaque psoriasis, defined as 3% - 20%
             of the body surface area. For the purposes of study treatment, most areas will be

             areas

          -  Overall disease severity is at least 3 (moderate)

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects who have surface area involvement too large that would require more than 50
             grams per week of clobetasol propionate spray or more than 50 grams per week of
             clobetasol propionate ointment

          -  Subjects whose psoriasis involves only the scalp, face or groin

          -  Subjects with non-plaque psoriasis or other related diseases not classified as plaque
             psoriasis
