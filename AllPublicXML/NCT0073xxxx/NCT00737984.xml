      Endometrial sampling improves the pregnancy rates in superovulation-IUI cycles
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Endometrial sampling is performed using the standard technique in the outpatient department.
      Similarly, superovulation with gonadotrophins will be performed according to our standard
      practice.Endometrial sampling will be done in the follicular phase not later than day 10 of
      the cycle. Endometrial sampling will be performed using Pipelle sampling catheter. The
      Pipelle is inserted gently through the cervical canal into the uterine cavity and advanced
      slowly till just resistance felt by the operator. Then, the piston is withdrawn to create
      negative suction and gentle movement of Pipelle up and down in the uterine cavity is
      performed while it is against the uterine wall. The Pipelle catheter is withdrawn gently and
      any obtained specimen will be sent for histopathological examination.
