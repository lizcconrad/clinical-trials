      The primary objective of this study is to define the safety and efficacy of recombinant human
      growth hormone (rh-GH, Genotropin) in a population of patients undergoing allogeneic stem
      cell transplant. The secondary objectives of this study are: to evaluate the incidence of
      mortality due to opportunistic infections in the first 6 months, to evaluate the incidence
      and severity of infectious complications, to assess laboratory parameters of post-transplant
      immune recovery in patients on GH therapy and to determine the probability and time of
      neutrophil and platelet recovery on GH therapy.
