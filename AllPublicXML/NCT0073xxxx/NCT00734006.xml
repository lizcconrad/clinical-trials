  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the proposed research is to measure the effect of drug-induced sedation on the
      functional connectivity between brain regions as indicated by EEG signal transmission within
      the human brain. The results of this study will help to identify the neurophysiological
      correlates of changes in conscious experience that occur during drug-induced sedation.

      In the proposed experiments cortical areas will be stimulated using low frequency,
      low-amplitude transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) in healthy human subjects during
      wakefulness and during drug-induced responsive sedation and unresponsive sedation.
      Simultaneously, high-density electroencephalography (Hd-EEG) will be recorded to evaluate the
      temporal and spatial characteristics of evoked responses and induced rhythms over the cortex.
