  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      18F-FDG PET/CT (2-[fluorine-18] fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose, Positron emission tomography- CT)
      is a noninvasive technique that allows quantifying and precisely localizing 18F-FDG uptake in
      the entire body. 18F-FDG uptake is caused by increased local metabolic activity. Such
      increased uptake has been described not only in neoplastic lesions but also in inflammatory
      lesions. In this condition, uptake has been correlated with local stimulation of tumor
      necrosis factor, and with monocyte priming and activation. A physiologic variable uptake may
      be observed in the bowel, especially the cecum, and has limited the use of PET in
      inflammatory bowel diseases. The advantage of combined PET and CT devices lead to significant
      improvements in the interpretation of the bowel areas, and greatly reduces the number of
      false-positive findings in the gastrointestinal tract.
