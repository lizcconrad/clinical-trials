      This study examined the safety and effectiveness of long-term administration of mometasone
      nasal spray in patients with perennial allergic rhinitis. Patients received mometasone for 12
      weeks plus an additional 12 weeks if patient agreed to continue. Dose of mometasone could be
      decreased or increased during the study based on patient's response.
