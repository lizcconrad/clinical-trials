      To evaluate effect of previous flavivirus exposure on the safety and immunogenicity of the
      ChimeriVax™ dengue tetravalent vaccine

      Primary Objectives:

        -  To describe the safety of one injection of ChimeriVax™ dengue tetravalent vaccine.

        -  To describe the immune response against dengue before and after one injection of
           ChimeriVax™ dengue tetravalent vaccine

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate a dengue tetravalent vaccine formulation in subjects aged 18 to 40
      years and previously immunised with a dengue or YF vaccine.
