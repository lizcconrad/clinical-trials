      This study will characterize the safety, tolerability, biological activity, and
      pharmacokinetics of LBH589 in Japanese patients with advanced solid tumors whose disease has
      progressed despite standard therapies, or for whom no standard therapy exists.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients with histologically or cytologically confirmed, advanced solid tumors whose
             disease has progressed despite available standard therapies, or for which no standard
             therapy exists.

          2. At least one measurable or non-measurable lesion as defined by modified RECIST
             Criteria for solid tumors

          3. Age ≥20 years old

          4. World Health Organization (WHO) Performance Status of ≤2

          5. Patients must have the following laboratory values as defined in protocol

          6. Life expectancy of ≥ 12 weeks

          7. Written informed consent obtained

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients with evidence of CNS tumor or metastasis

          2. Patients with pleural effusion and/or ascites to be drained

          3. Patients with any peripheral neuropathy ≥ CTCAE grade 2

          4. Impaired cardiac function defined in protocol

          5. Acute or chronic liver or renal disease

          6. Other concurrent severe and/or uncontrolled medical conditions that could cause
             unacceptable safety risks or compromise compliance with the protocol

          7. Patients who are currently receiving treatment with any of the medications which have
             the potential to prolong the QT interval and the treatment cannot be either
             discontinued or switched to a different medication

          8. Patients who have received chemotherapy ≤4 weeks prior to starting study drug or who
             have not recovered from side effects of such therapy
