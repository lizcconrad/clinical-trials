      The study will determine the survivorship of the fixed bearing P.F.C. Sigma knee with a
      cobalt chrome tibial tray at 5 years.

      The primary objective of this study is to assess the survivorship of the P.F.C. fixed bearing
      knee system using a cobalt chrome tibial tray and moderately cross-linked polyethylene insert
      at 5-Years. The secondary objectives of this investigation are to evaluate additional
      clinical outcomes to provide further information on the performance of the P.F.C. fixed
      bearing knee system using a moderately cross-linked polyethylene insert and cobalt chrome
      tibial tray. These outcomes will include Radiographic assessment, American Knee Society
      Score, Oxford Knee Score and SF-12.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects who have given voluntary written informed consent to participate in this
             study

          -  Subjects for whom primary total knee replacement is indicated due to degenerative
             joint disease, including rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis, avascular necrosis, and
             post traumatic arthritis, which is causing pain, deformity, or limitation of function
             uncontrolled by medical treatment.

          -  Subjects who, in the opinion of the Investigator, are able to understand this study,
             co-operate with the investigational procedures and are willing to return to the
             hospital for all scheduled post-operative follow ups.

          -  Male or Female subjects who are skeletally mature and for whom an appropriate size of
             device is available

          -  The following subjects are not considered eligible and must not be recruited to the
             investigation

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects scheduled for revision total knee arthroplasty, or who have had previous
             surgery to their knee except menisectomy, arthroscopy or synovectomy.

          -  Subjects aged over 80 Years

          -  Subjects experiencing any condition that may, in the opinion of the investigator,
             interfere with the total knee replacements survival or outcome (e.g. Pagets disease,
             Charcots disease, severe osteoporosis etc).

          -  Subjects who have evidence of active infections, which may spread, to other areas of
             the body (e.g. osteomyelitis, pyrogenic infection of the knee joint, overt infection
             etc)

          -  Subjects who are currently participating in any other clinical investigation of a
             device or pharmaceutical.

          -  Subjects having non-contained defects in the tibia or femur necessitating bone graft.

          -  Subjects with psychosocial disorders that would limit rehabilitation

          -  Subjects with a known history of poor compliance to medical treatment

          -  Subjects who are known drug or alcohol abusers.

          -  Other contraindications for the use of the P.F.C. ® S fixed bearing knee system as
             listed in the package insert.

          -  Women who are pregnant

          -  Subjects who are currently involved in any injury litigation claims
