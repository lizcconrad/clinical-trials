      This is a children's study evaluating the effects of a tonsillectomy with tonsillar fossae
      closure compared to without closure of the operative wound.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a children's study. Patients experience significant postoperative pain, activity
      limitation and sometimes other significant postoperative complications. We are going to
      compare the effects of closing the tonsil wound versus non-closure. A daily journal will be
      kept (by the patient's parent or legal guardian)to log in measures of morbidity.
      Postoperative telephone calls will be made and scripted questions will be asked regarding any
      tonsillar hemorrhage requiring medical re-evaluation, and dehydration requiring medical
      re-evaluation. The patients will also be examined in the clinic at 10-14 days postoperatively
      to determine if the fossa remained closed or dehisced.

    <description>We hypothesize that closure of the tonsillar fossa decreases the morbidity of pain by decreasing exposure of the raw operative bed to oral secretions, mediation, and oral intake, and decreases the morbidity of post-operative hemorrhage by having the operative wound closed.</description>
