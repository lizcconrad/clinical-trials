      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as azacitidine, work in different ways to stop
      the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing.

      PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well azacitidine works in treating patients with
      acute myeloid leukemia who are unsuitable for treatment with intensive chemotherapy.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  To evaluate the efficacy of azacitidine in patients with newly diagnosed or untreated
           acute myeloid leukemia who are unsuitable for induction type chemotherapy because of age
           or relevant comorbidities.

      Secondary

        -  To evaluate survival and adverse events.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive azacitidine subcutaneously on days 1-5. Treatment repeats every 28 days for
      6 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 3 months for 1 year and then
      every 6 months for 1 year.
