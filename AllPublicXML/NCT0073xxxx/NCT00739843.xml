      The purpose of this study is to estimate how quickly cognitive status and functional status
      in older patients on hemodialysis declines.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Dialysis outcome measures, which predict morbidity and mortality of younger patients on renal
      replacement therapy, such as dialysis clearance, do not correlate with survival of the
      elderly patients on hemodialysis. Survival of older patients on hemodialysis is significantly
      worse when compared to that of the younger patients. Conditions commonly affecting older
      adults, such as functional decline, cognitive impairment, depression and declining quality of
      life have not been well studied in hemodialysis population. There may be an important
      relationship between these measurements and outcomes in older dialysis patients. Institution
      of appropriate age-specific interventions could result in improved health status and
      mortality of older patients on hemodialysis. Our broad objective is to better understand
      global functioning of the elderly dialysis patients and its possible impact on dialysis
      outcomes in attempt to improve health care of the older patients receiving hemodialysis.
