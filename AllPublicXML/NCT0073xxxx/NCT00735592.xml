      The study intends to assess the utility of performing a follow up X rays in children admitted
      to pediatric wards with lobar pneumonia. Usually those children are discharged with a
      recommendation for a follow up X rays but there are no enough studies proving that this
      recommendation is really necessary.

      Thew study will include follow up data in a group of about 200 patients admitted with lobar
      pneumonia during the years 2006 to 2007. All the clinical and laboratory data will be
      collected and also the X rays findings.

      The findings of follow up X rays if they were performed will also be summarized.
