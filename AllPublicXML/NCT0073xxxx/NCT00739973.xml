    <description>The arm in which the highest sitting diastolic pressures were found at study entry was the arm used for all subsequent readings. An automated BP measurement device and appropriate size cuff were used to measure arterial sitting blood pressure (BP) at trough with the arm supported at the level of the heart. At each study visit, after having the patient in a sitting position for at least 5 minutes, diastolic BP were measured 3 times at 1-2 minute intervals. A mean was calculated from the 3 measurements.</description>

        <description>The arm in which the highest sitting diastolic pressures were found at study entry was the arm used for all subsequent readings. An automated BP measurement device and appropriate size cuff were used to measure arterial sitting blood pressure (BP) at trough with the arm supported at the level of the heart. At each study visit, after having the patient in a sitting position for at least 5 minutes, systolic BP were measured 3 times at 1-2 minute intervals. A mean was calculated from the 3 measurements.</description>

          <description>The arm in which the highest sitting diastolic pressures were found at study entry was the arm used for all subsequent readings. An automated BP measurement device and appropriate size cuff were used to measure arterial sitting blood pressure (BP) at trough with the arm supported at the level of the heart. At each study visit, after having the patient in a sitting position for at least 5 minutes, diastolic BP were measured 3 times at 1-2 minute intervals. A mean was calculated from the 3 measurements.</description>

An automated BP measurement device and appropriate size cuff were used to measure arterial sitting blood pressure (BP) at trough with the arm supported at the level of the heart.

          <description>Blood pressure response in msDBP is defined as a mean sitting diastolic blood pressure &lt; 90 mmHg or a &gt;=10 mmHg reduction from baseline. A calibrated sphygmomanometer and appropriate size cuff were used to measure arterial sitting blood pressure (BP) at trough with the arm supported at the level of the heart. At each study visit, after having the patient in a sitting position for at least 5 minutes, systolic/diastolic BP were measured 3 times at 1-2 minute intervals. A mean was calculated from the 3 measurements.</description>
