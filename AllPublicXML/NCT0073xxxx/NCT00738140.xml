      The purpose of this study is to discover if intensive lifestyle changes (such as diet and
      increased physical activity) improve the body's sensitivity to insulin, and therefore help
      prevent diabetes and other cardiovascular disease, in men receiving GnRH hormone therapy for
      prostate cancer.

      -  In this study, participants will be divided into two groups. One group will undergo
           intensive lifestyle changes (Lifestyle Intervention Group) designed by the Diabetes
           Prevention Group, and the other (Control Group) will follow the guidelines for healthy
           living established by the Food Guide Pyramid and the National Cholesterol Education
           Program.

        -  All visits will take place at the General Clinical Research Center at the Massachusetts
           General Hospital.

        -  At the initial visit, the following will be performed: Bionutrition evaluation; Oral
           Glucose Tolerance Test (OGTT); additional blood work and; Dual Energy X-Ray
           Absorptiometry (DXA) Scan.

        -  After the initial visit, visits will be scheduled at 3, 6 and 12 months after and the
           above procedures will be repeated.

        -  Participants will be randomized into one of the two study groups. Lifestyle Intervention
           Group: The goal for participants assigned to this group are to achieve and maintain a
           weight loss of at least 7% of initial body weight through a healthy low calorie, low fat
           diet and to engage in physical activity of moderate intensity. Control Group:
           participants in this group will receive standard nutrition and exercise recommendations
           from the Food Guide Pyramid and the National Cholesterol Education Program Step 1 diet
           to reduce body weight and increase physical activity.
