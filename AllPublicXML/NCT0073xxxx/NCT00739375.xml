    <textblock>
      Pulmonary hypertension (PHT) is an elevation of pulmonary arterial pressure (PAP) that can be
      the result of heart, lung or systemic disease. PHT also complicates chronic hemodialysis (HD)
      therapy immediately after the creation of an arteriovenous (AV) access, even before starting
      HD therapy. It tends to regress after temporary AV access closure and after successful kidney
      transplantation. Affected patients have significantly higher cardiac output. This syndrome is
      associated with a statistically significant survival disadvantage. The laboratory hallmark of
      this syndrome is reduced basal and stimulatory nitric oxide (NO) levels. It appears that
      patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) acquire endothelial dysfunction that reduces the
      ability of their pulmonary vessels to accommodate the AV access-mediated elevated cardiac
      output, exacerbating the PHT. Doppler echocardiographic screening of ESRD patients scheduled
      for HD therapy for the occurrence of PH is indicated. Early diagnosis enables timely
      intervention, currently limited to changing dialysis modality such as peritoneal dialysis or
      referring for kidney transplantation.An echocardiographic diagnosis of pulmonary hypertension
      (PHT) is made when the systolic pulmonary arterial pressure (PAP) exceeds normal values (30
      mmHg). In mild PHT, PAP values range up to 45 mmHg, in moderate PHT, PAP is between 45 and 65
      mmHg, and in severe PHT, PAP values are greater than 65 mmHg. Systolic PAP equals cardiac
      output times pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR), (i.e., PAP = cardiac output Ã— PVR).
      Increased cardiac output by itself does not cause PH because of the enormous capacity of the
      pulmonary circulation to accommodate the increase in blood flow. Therefore development of PHT
      requires pathologic, marked elevation of pulmonary vascular resistance. The presence of PH
      may reflect serious pulmonary vascular disease, which can be progressive and fatal.
      Consequently, an accurate diagnosis of the cause of PHT is essential in order to establish an
      effective treatment program. Pulmonary hypertension can occur from diverse etiologies. In
      1996 we first noted unexplained PH in some long-term hemodialysis (HD) patients during an
      epidemiologic study of this disorder (Nakhoul F and Yigla M Rambam Medical Cemter-Haifa). It
      was assumed that their PHT was related to end-stage renal disease (ESRD) or to long-term HD
      therapy via an arteriovenous (AV) access.

      There are several potential explanations for the development of PHT in patients with ESRD.
      Hormonal and metabolic derangement associated with ESRD might lead to vasoconstriction of
      pulmonary vessels and increased pulmonary vascular resistance. Values of PAP may be further
      increased by high cardiac output resulting from the AV access itself, worsened by commonly
      occurring anemia and fluid overload. Despite almost five decades of HD therapy via a
      surgically created, often large, hemodynamically significant AV access the long-term impact
      of this intervention on the pulmonary circulation has received little attention.

      RD versus AV HD via AV access

      Proposed Mechanisms:

        1. Elevated Parathyroid hormone

        2. Metastatic Calcification due to the increase of the calcium-phosphor multiple

        3. High cardiac output

        4. Nitric oxide-endothelin metabolism

        5. A-v Access flow

      These observations indicate a role for AV access-mediated elevations in cardiac output in the
      pathogenesis of PH. The correlation between access flow and PAP values has not yet been
      studied. Since patients undergoing HD therapy via AV access had PH that reversed after
      successful kidney transplantation and after short AV access compression, we concluded that
      both ESRD and AV access-mediated elevated cardiac output are required for the development PH.
      From a physiologic point of view, due to the enormous capacity of the pulmonary
      microcirculation, increased cardiac output by itself cannot cause PH. It is the inability of
      the pulmonary circulation of some ESRD patients to accommodate the AV access-mediated
      elevated cardiac output that leads to the development of PH.
