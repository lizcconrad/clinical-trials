  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Elderly patients have a higher risk of experiencing adverse drug events due to an age related
      increase in morbidity and medication use. Inappropriate or wrong medication use among elderly
      patients acutely admitted to hospitals is assumed to result in earlier contact to general
      practitioner, emergency departments and re-admissions if not corrected during hospital
      admission. It is therefore our hypothesis that a systematic medication review conducted by
      pharmacists and physicians specialized in pharmacology will increase time to first
      unscheduled physician contact (general practitioner, emergency departments, ambulatory care
      and re-admissions) after discharge from hospital from an average of 21days to 25 days.
      Further, the following secondary outcome parameters will be measured at discharge and within
      3-month follow-up:

        -  length of in-hospital stay

        -  number of contacts to general practitioner 30 days after discharge, that resulted in
           medication changes

        -  number of re-admissions at 3-month

        -  number of death at 3-month

        -  number of contact to primary health care at 3-month

        -  patients self-experienced quality of health(EQ-5D) 3-month

    <description>Within 24 hours of admission a pharmacist retrieve medication histories from patients included in the intervention group. Medication histories will be obtained from - medical records, medication charts, patients electronical medication profile, interview with patients and if necessary contact to the patients general practitioner. The obtained medication history will be discussed with a physician specialized in pharmacology and an advisory note with suggested changes to the patients medication is added to the medical record. The orthopedic physicians are not obliged to follow the suggested changes</description>
