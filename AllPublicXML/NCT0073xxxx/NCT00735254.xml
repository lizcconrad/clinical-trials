      The purpose of this study is to examine the effect of using a pulsed dye laser (the VBEAM), a
      non-ablative laser (the Affirm) and a combination of both lasers to improve the appearance of
      your surgical scar. Both the pulsed dye laser and Affirm laser are approved by the US Food
      and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of scars. Surgical scars are a type of scar
      that can benefit from laser therapy. Redness and the appearance of small blood vessels near
      the surface of the skin (telangiectasias) develop in such scars as part of the normal healing
      process and usually spontaneously remit, but often slowly and incompletely. In many cases,
      lasers can accelerate the clearing of this redness and also improve scar texture.

      In summary, we will perform a total of three laser treatments. A personal interview, clinical
      examination, and a photograph will be taken at each visit. At the end of the three
      treatments, a final personal interview, clinical evaluation and photograph will be taken to
      document the effects of the laser treatments. At the end of the study, the patient will have
      the option to receive two additional laser treatments four weeks apart, also at no cost, to
      the entire scar.
