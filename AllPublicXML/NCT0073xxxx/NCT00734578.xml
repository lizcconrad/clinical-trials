    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the efficacy and safety of SPD503 in subjects with
      ADHD when co-administered with psychostimulants in children and adolescents aged 6-17 years
      with a diagnosis of ADHD with a sub-optimal, partial response to stimulants.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder Rating Scale-fourth Edition (ADHD-RS-IV) Total Score at Week 8 - Last Observation Carried Forward (LOCF)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and weekly up to 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The ADHD-RS-IV consists of 18 items scored on a 4-point scale ranging from 0 (no symptoms) to 3 (severe symptoms) with total score ranging from 0 to 54.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of Participants With Improvement on Clinical Global Impression-Improvement (CGI-I) at Week 8 - LOCF</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and weekly up to 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Clinical Global Impression-Improvement (CGI-I) consists of a 7-point scale ranging from 1 (very much improved) to 7 (very much worse). Improvement is defined as a score of 1 (very much improved) or 2 (much improved) on the scale.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Assessment of Clinical Global Impression-Severity of Illness (CGI-S) at Week 8 - LOCF</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and weekly up to 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>CGI-S assesses the severity of the subject's condition on a 7-point scale ranging from 1 (normal, not at all ill) to 7 (among the most extremely ill)</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in Conners' Global Index - Parent (CGI-P) Total Score at Week 8 - LOCF: Morning Assessment (Before School)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and weekly up to 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The index contains 10 items. Each item on the scale is scored from a range of 0 (reflecting never, seldom) to 3 (reflecting very often, very frequent) with total scores ranging from 0 to 30.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in Conners' Global Index - Parent (CGI-P) Total Score at Week 8 - LOCF: Evening Assessment (Before Bedtime)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and weekly up to 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The index contains 10 items. Each item on the scale is scored from a range of 0 (reflecting never, seldom) to 3 (reflecting very often, very frequent) with total scores ranging from 0 30.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of Participants With Improvement on Parent Global Assessment (PGA) at Week 8 - LOCF</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and week 8</time_frame>
    <description>Parent Global Assessment (PGA) consists of a 7-point scale ranging from 1 (very much improved) to 7 (very much worse). Improvement is defined as a score of 1 (very much improved) or 2 (much improved) on the scale.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in the Oppositional Subscale of the Conners' Parent Rating Scale-Revised Long Form (CPRS-R:L) Score at Week 8 - LOCF</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and weekly up to 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The oppositional subscale of the CPRS-R:L contains 10 items designed to reflect criteria for oppositional defiance disorder (ODD). Each item is scored on a range from 0 (not true at all) to 3 (very much true) with total scores ranging from 0 to 30. Higher scores are reflective of more severe symptoms.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in Before School Functioning Questionnaire (BSFQ) at Week 8 - LOCF</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and weekly up to 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>This scale was designed to assess symptoms of ADHD that typically occur in the morning. The BSFQ consists of two components. The first, a 20-item scale with ratings from 0 (none) to 3 (severe) with a range of 0-60 followed by two questions answered with duration of time (in minutes). The second, a 14-item scale with ratings from 0 (no) to 2 (a lot) with a range of 0-28. The results reported here are from the 20-item scale. Lower scores are better.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Post Sleep Questionnaire (PSQ) Quality of Sleep at Week 8 - LOCF</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and weekly up to 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Post Sleep Questionnaire (PSQ) overall rating of quality of sleep. There are 5 rating responses ranging from very poor to very good. No numbers are associated with the rating responses.</description>

        <description>The oppositional subscale of the CPRS-R:L contains 10 items designed to reflect criteria for oppositional defiance disorder (ODD). Each item is scored on a range from 0 (not true at all) to 3 (very much true) with total scores ranging from 0 to 30. Higher scores are reflective of more severe symptoms.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Before School Functioning Questionnaire (BSFQ) at Week 8 - LOCF</title>
        <description>This scale was designed to assess symptoms of ADHD that typically occur in the morning. The BSFQ consists of two components. The first, a 20-item scale with ratings from 0 (none) to 3 (severe) with a range of 0-60 followed by two questions answered with duration of time (in minutes). The second, a 14-item scale with ratings from 0 (no) to 2 (a lot) with a range of 0-28. The results reported here are from the 20-item scale. Lower scores are better.</description>
