  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Worldwide cervical cancer remains a major cause mortality among women. It is estimated that
      each year over 490,000 women are diagnosed with cervical cancer and more than 270,000 die
      from the disease. While the implementation of widespread screening programs has reduced the
      burden of cervical cancer, a large percentage of the population still remains unscreened or
      is underscreened. It is now recognized that human papillomavirus (HPV) is a necessary
      precursor for the development of cervical cancer. The first vaccine to prevent HPV was
      recently approved by the Food and Drug Administration and is now available at doctors
      offices. Despite the availability of a safe and effective means for the prevention of
      cervical cancer, widespread implementation of vaccination has been extremely difficult.
      Several potential issues have limited the development of widespread HPV vaccination programs,
      including cultural and religious beliefs, and limitations in the practicality of
      administering the vaccine. The overall goals of our work are to improve access to preventive
      strategies for cervical cancer. In this proposal we will examine the strategy of HPV
      vaccination for women who have just given birth. We believe that HPV vaccination of these
      women will be associated with a high level of patient satisfaction and acceptance. If
      successful, this strategy could play a major role in advancing the acceptance and
      implementation of HPV vaccination in the United States.

      Primary Objective

      1. To estimate compliance with the HPV vaccine series when initiated in postpartum women.

      Secondary Objectives

        1. To determine patient acceptance and satisfaction with HPV vaccination administered in
           the postpartum period.

        2. To determine predictors of compliance with the HPV vaccination series.
