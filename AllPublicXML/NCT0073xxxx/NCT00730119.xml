      This investigation is a multi-center study that will demonstrate that the GE Monitor meets
      equivalency and/or accuracy and/or performance criteria. This investigation will compare the
      test device(s) to itself, or one of the reference parameters, or a combination of parameters,
      including NIBP, temperature, SpO2, respirations, and ECG.

      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Signed informed consent from subject and/or guardian

          -  Ability to maintain proper placement of cuff and/or probe and/or sensor

          -  Presence of atrial fibrillation or other irregular heart rhythm (when applicable)

          -  Ability to single or dual monitor NIBP, ECG, and/or SpO2, whether or not already being
             monitored for any or all of these parameters (SuperSTAT development study only)

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Any subject deemed too unstable, by clinician's discretion, or for another reason
             deemed unacceptable for study by the clinician

          -  Known dysrhythmias (when applicable)

          -  Known disease state or medical condition that A) compromises circulation to the
             extremity, B) compromises musculo-skeletal integrity, or C) otherwise contraindicates
             use of a NIBP cuff and/or SpO2 sensor on an extremity or ECG patches on skin

          -  Vigorous exercise prior to participating in the study

          -  Excessive movement or excitability causing false values or no determinations

          -  Known allergy to latex when latex products will be in contact with subject

          -  Subjects who have eaten, drank, smoked or chewed gum in the preceding half hour
             (temperature parameter only)

          -  Nasal/septal defects, cold and/or allergies that would not allow the subject to
             breathe through their nose (temperature parameter only)

          -  Subjects with whom flammable anesthetics will be used.

          -  Adult/pediatric subjects,(greater than 1 year of age) who, at the clinician's
             discretion, could not tolerate approximately 12, but no more than 25 blood pressures
             on each extremity

          -  Pediatric/neonatal subjects,(less than 1 year of age) who, at the clinician's
             discretion, could not tolerate approximately 10, but no more than 12 blood pressures
             on each extremity

          -  Presence of pacemaker which makes the atrial fibrillation rhythm indistinguishable

          -  Subject's limb circumference is outside of the manufacturer's recommended cuff range

          -  Subject has Korotkoff sounds that persist to nearly zero (when applicable)
