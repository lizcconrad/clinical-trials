  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      N-acetylcysteine (NAC) is used to treat Tylenol toxicity. NAC is a rich source of the
      sulfhydryl group (SH) which is important for replenishing the body's glutathione stores.
      Glutathione acts as a free radical scavenger, to decrease the damage that would be caused by
      those toxic radicals. Patients who undergo orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT) have a high
      incidence of post-operative renal dysfunction. The most common etiology of post-operative
      renal dysfunction is related to high levels of toxic free radicals. Free radicals may
      contribute to primary liver graft failure or delayed liver graft function.

      Specific Aims &amp; Objectives:

      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of NAC in improving liver
      graft performance and lowering the incidence of post-operative renal dysfunction. The
      secondary objectives are to investigate the effect of NAC on endogenous glutathione body
      stores and its effect on FK506 induced toxicity.

      This is a randomized, double-blind placebo-controlled study that investigates the use of NAC
      during and after OLT. A total of 100 patients will be recruited. Fifty will receive a placebo
      (normal saline) and the other fifty will receive NAC. The patients in the NAC group will
      receive a loading dose of 140 mg/kg IV of NAC over one hour at the start of the surgery.
      Thereafter, NAC will be repeated every 4 hours at a dose of 70 mg/kg IV, for a total of 13
      doses. The placebo group will receive an equal volume of a normal saline infusion for 13
      doses. Both groups will be followed for one year after their OLT. The following data will be
      recorded and collected: liver function tests, renal function tests, liver graft survival
      rate, patient survival, serum level of glutathione (GSH-PX/GR), duration of hospital and ICU
      stay. To evaluate the accuracy of calculated serum creatinine clearance (CSCC) in predicating
      the renal performance in OLT patients, another two serum markers will be estimated. The 1st
      one is Cystatin-C and the 2nd is Beta-trace. The data from CSCC, cystatin-C and beta-trace
      will be compared to find out which is the best marker in between these three tests to
      predicate the renal function. The data will be recorded daily for the first week after the
      surgery, then on days 14, 21, 30, 90, 180 and finely at the end of the first year after the
      OLT. Statistical analysis of the data will be performed at the conclusion of the study period
      to determine the difference in the outcome and morbidity and mortality between the two
      groups.

      Objective and Specific Aims

      Objectives:

        -  Assess the efficacy of NAC to preserve liver graft function and to improve patient/graft
           survival following orthotopic liver transplantation.

        -  Assess the efficacy of NAC to preserve kidney function in the patients undergoing OLT.

      Primary Aims:

        -  Severity of the post reperfusion syndrome (PRS) will be compared in both groups by
           assessing hemodynamic parameters and the need for vasopressor support in the neohepatic
           stage.

        -  Liver graft function, the incidence of primary non-function and delayed function in both
           the treatment and placebo groups, will be assessed with post-operative liver function
           tests (ALT, AST, serum bilirubin, PT/INR, APTT, lactate, etc). Liver function tests will
           be assessed at one month, three month, six month and at one year following the OLT.

        -  The duration of ICU and hospital stays will be compared between the two groups.

        -  Survival rate (patient/graft) between the treatment and placebo groups will be compared
           at 1 month, 3 months, 6 months and 1 year.

        -  Renal function will be compared in the treatment and placebo groups by assessing the
           following parameters during and after liver transplantation: urine output (ml/24 hours),
           serum creatinine and BUN, calculated creatinine clearance.

        -  The incidence of postoperative acute renal failure (ARF) and the extent and duration of
           renal dysfunction will be compared between the treatment and the placebo groups.

      Secondary Aims:

        -  Investigating the effect of NAC on the endogenous glutathione peroxides/glutathione
           reductase (GSH-PX/GR) body stores in patients undergoing OLT.

        -  Investigating the effect of NAC on FK506 induced toxicity.

        -  Investigating the accuracy of two new markers for evaluating the renal function and
           glomerular filtration rate and compare them to CSCC.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Male or female patients age of 18 years

          -  Patients undergoing cadaveric liver transplant for the first time

          -  Patients with normal serum creatinine &lt; 1- 1.2 mg/dl or creatinine clearance 97-140
             ml/min and patients with mild renal dysfunction with serum creatinine of (2-2.5 mg/dl)
             or creatinine clearance 85-125 ml/min

          -  All patients will sign informed consent

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Allergy to NAC

          -  Patients with history of asthma

          -  Patient with fulminate hepatic failure

          -  Re-do OLT

          -  Simultaneous other organ transplant (i.e., pancreas, heart, and small bowel)

          -  Pre-existing renal failure requiring hemodialysis or continuous hemofiltration and
             patient refusal to participate in the study.

          -  Although, it is extremely uncommon for a patient with hepatic failure to become
             pregnant due to the pathological effect of hepatic failure on the reproductive system,
             the policy of Liver Transplantation Service at UPMC is to advise young female not to
             become pregnant while waiting for OLT. In addition the majority of the patients on the
             liver transplant waiting list at this institution are above 50 years of age. However,
             when a female patient of child-bearing potential is called in for OLT and there is a
             suspicion that she might be pregnant, a blood pregnancy test will be performed as a
             part of the standard of care for these patients.
