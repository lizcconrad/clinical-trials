      The purpose of this study is to describe adherence to anastrozole treatment current practice:
      cases where anastrozole treatment was halted ( timescale and causes) and estimate the
      proportion of postmenopausal women with early breast cancer who continue anastrozole therapy
      after one year follow-up.
