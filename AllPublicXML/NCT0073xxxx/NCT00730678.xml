      To investigate whether genetic polymorphisms in genes encoding proteins involved in the
      metabolism or effects of drugs or environmental agents influence the disposition or effects
      of these xenobiotic substrates. To investigate the nature of heritability and the genetic
      basis of pharmacogenetic traits by studying family members of individuals with specific
      genotypes.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Pharmacogenetics is that discipline devoted to elucidating the genetic determinants of drug
      response. Particularly in the area of drug metabolism, many genes exhibit genetic
      polymorphism; that is, a stable percentage of the population (which generally differs by
      ethnic group) is deficient in the functional expression of the enzyme involved, and the
      deficiency is typically inherited as an autosomal recessive trait. With currently known
      polymorphisms in drug metabolism, the percentage of homozygous deficient individuals ranges
      from 0.3% to as many as 90% of the population, depending on the enzyme and the ethnic group.

      Our prior studies have revealed multigenic pharmacogenetic models that are significantly
      predictive of various drug response phenotypes (e.g., drug resistance, drug clearance, drug
      toxicity, disease response) in children with ALL. The large number of candidate loci and the
      relatively small number of patients illustrate the fact that larger sample sizes are required
      to definitively establish these polygenic models. The fact that there were significant
      race/genotype interactions, such that predictions differed in whites vs blacks, highlights
      the need for adequate numbers of patients within racial and ethnic groups to allow
      differential analysis of genotypic predictors after adjusting for confounding demographic
      factors in pharmacogenetic studies via stratified design and analyses.
