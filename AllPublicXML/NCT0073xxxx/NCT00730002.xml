      The purpose of this study is to determine if three functional Magnetic Resonance brain
      imaging techniques: Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy(MRS),Magnetic Resonance perfusion, and
      Diffusion Tensor Imaging(DTI) can detect brain alterations distinctive for neuropsychiatric
      systemic lupus erythematosus (NPSLE)and systemic lupus erythematosus(SLE).

      Purpose of the Study:

      We plan with this study to obtain pilot data to support a larger grant application which will
      evaluate whether any of three types of functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (known as MR
      Spectroscopy [MRS], MR Perfusion Imaging, and MR Diffusion Tensor Imaging [DTI]) can detect
      alterations in brain function distinctive for Neuropsychiatric Systemic Lupus Erythematosus
      (NPSLE), Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE), and compare our findings to those found in an
      existing cohort of 20 normal healthy controls. Because this study is being done on a
      3T(tesla)scanner (3T(tesla) Achieva(Model name), Philips Medical Systems) and our previous
      group of healthy controls was assessed using a 1.5 T(tesla) scanner (LX EchoSpeed, General
      Electric(GE) Medical Systems), we propose to re-consent 10 of the previous 20 healthy
      controls and re-collect imaging data on the 3T(tesla) scanner in order to confirm that our
      previously-collected data from the group of 20 healthy controls is still valid. This will
      confirm that the change of field strength and manufacturer does not affect data validity.

      Recruiting Update as of March/2009: Enrollment is completed for Study Arms 1 and 2.

      This study is only being conducted in Ann Arbor, Michigan. Travel reimbursement does not
      include hotel accommodations or air fare to and from Ann arbor, Michigan.

    <description>As part of the Magnetic Resonance(MR) scan, you will need to lie still on a padded MR table inside the MR machine for about 15 minutes at a time while MR studies are being performed on you. The total time for the clinical portion of the MR study is approximately 35-40 minutes and there will be an additional 30 minutes for the research related MR studies. The total time you will spend on the MR table for this research will seldom be more than one hour.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Have no diagnosis of NPSLE, SLE, or any other condition which, in the investigator's
             opinion, might cause central nervous system(CNS) changes or interfere with the
             interpretation of results.

          -  Be 18 years of age or older.

          -  Be willing and able to complete all study procedures.

          -  Meet the criteria for diagnosis of systemic lupus erythematosus(SLE).

          -  Have recent onset or diagnosis of neurological symptoms that have been active within
             the last 14 days. The criteria for NPSLE study patients will be neurological symptoms,
             confirmed by neurologic examination, which, in the opinion of the treating physician,
             may be due to the patient's diagnosis of SLE, and requires MRI evaluation. Patients
             will be classified according to the nomenclature recommended by the American College
             Rheumatology(ACR) on Neuropsychiatric Manifestations in SLE, and further classified as
             &quot;focal,&quot; &quot;nonfocal,&quot; or &quot;seizure&quot; (64).

          -  Be able to complete all study procedures; and be able to sign the informed consent
             form or have a designated proxy or next-of-kin present to provide consent on behalf of
             the subject.

          -  Meet the American College of Rheumatology(ACR) criteria for SLE and be a member of the
             U of M lupus cohort.

          -  Report no neurological symptoms at the time of enrollment.

        Exclusion criteria:

          -  Co-morbid medical illnesses capable of causing a worsening of physical functional
             status independent of the diagnosis (e.g. morbid obesity, autoimmune diseases other
             than SLE), cardiopulmonary disorders (e.g. angina, congestive heart failure, chronic
             obstructive pulmonary disease(COPD), chronic asthma), fibromyalgia(FM), uncontrolled
             endocrine or allergic disorders (e.g. thyroid dysfunction, Type I diabetes), and
             malignancy within 2 years, excluding successfully treated squamous or basal skin
             carcinoma.

          -  Any present psychiatric disorder involving a history of psychosis (e.g. schizophrenia,
             schizoaffective disorder, schizophreniform disorder, delusional disorder etc.),
             current suicide risk or attempt within 2 years of the study, or substance abuse within
             2 years.

          -  Subjects who are pregnant.

          -  Subjects who are left-handed.

          -  Those SLE patients with acute onset of neurological symptoms with duration longer than
             14 days.

          -  Have acute onset of neurological symptoms related to systemic lupus
             erythematosus(SLE).
