  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This post-marketing study is designed to collect data relating to the use of the Delta Xtend™
      Total Shoulder Replacement System in shoulder with rotator cuff deficiencies. This allows for
      continued monitoring of the performance and safety of the prosthesis in a broader range of
      clinical situations.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Male or female subjects, aged less than 85 years inclusive.

          -  Subjects who have cuff tear arthropathy, osteoarthritis with cuff deficiency,
             rheumatoid arthritis, post traumatic injury, or a need for revision surgery of a
             failed anatomic prosthesis in the left or right shoulder, which requires (total)
             shoulder arthroplasty.

          -  Subjects with radiographic evidence of sufficient bone stock to seat and support the
             Delta XtendÔ Reverse Total Shoulder System.

          -  Subjects who in the opinion of the Clinical Investigator are considered suitable for
             treatment with the Delta Xtend Reverse Total Shoulder System.

          -  Patients with a life expectancy of greater than 12 months.

          -  Subjects who are able to give voluntary, written informed consent to participate in
             this clinical investigation and from whom consent has been obtained.

          -  Subjects who, in the opinion of the Clinical Investigator, are able to understand this
             clinical investigation, co-operate with the investigational procedures and are willing
             to return to the hospital for all the required post-operative follow-ups.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Male and female subjects aged 86 years or older.

          -  Subjects with complete deltoid muscle palsy in the target joint as determined by
             clinical evaluation.

          -  Subjects with active local or systemic infection or with a history of general or local
             infections in the target joint over the past 12 months.

          -  Subjects with severe deformities, or tumours, that would impair fixation or proper
             positioning of the implant.

          -  Subjects with no significant muscle, nerve or vascular disease.

          -  Subjects with a pathology that, in the opinion of the Clinical Investigator, will
             adversely affect healing.

          -  Known allergic reactions to implant materials (e.g. bone cement, metal, polyethylene)
             implant corrosion or implant wear debris.

          -  Subjects with a known history of poor compliance to medical treatment.

          -  Subjects who, in the opinion of the Clinical Investigator, have an existing condition
             that would compromise their participation and follow-up in this clinical
             investigation.

          -  Women who are pregnant.

          -  Subjects who are known drug or alcohol abusers or with psychological disorders that

             product in the last month.

          -  Subjects who are currently involved in any injury litigation claims.
