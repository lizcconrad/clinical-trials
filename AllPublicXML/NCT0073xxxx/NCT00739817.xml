      Background: Primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) is a rare genetic disease characterised by
      recurrent respiratory infections and subfertility due to dysfunction of cilia (brushes) of
      the lining cells. Undiagnosed and untreated it can result in an irreversible crippling
      chronic lung disease. The diagnosis of PCD is a difficult one and involves the complex
      assessment of ciliary structure and function. Thus, PCD is under diagnosed and appropriate
      preventative and symptomatic treatment may be denied in many patients. In addition, the gene
      responsible for PCD is at present unknown, thus preventing pre-natal diagnosis and genetic
      counseling.

      Working hypothesis and aims: Recently, it has become apparent that the evaluation of nasally
      expired nitric oxide (NO) constitutes a simple and non-invasive diagnostic method, which
      discriminates between PCD patients, PCD carriers and healthy controls at high rate of
      specificity and sensitivity. Testing is simple and last approximately one minute. We have
      recently identified a unique isolated Druze population with high prevalence of PCD. The high
      frequency of disease places this closed community at a high risk of undiagnosed PCD.

      The aim of this project is to use nasal NO measurement as a screening tool to identify
      possible undiagnosed cases of PCD and PCD carriers in this high risk Druze population.
