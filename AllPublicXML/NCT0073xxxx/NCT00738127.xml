      The purpose of this study is to determine a surgical technique is effective in the treatment
      of acute dorsal trans-scaphoid perilunate dislocations.

      Open reduction and internal fixation is an effective method of treating acute trans-scaphoid
      perilunate dislocations. We study a new surgical technique that allows for early wrist
      excises postoperatively. We compare this technique to Inoue et al. 's techniques affect the
      objective and subjective outcomes. We also compared the long-term outcomes of these two
      procedures performed in similar patient groups.Although both groups had satisfactory results
      with regard to their pain relief, sufficient grip strength and union of scaphoid fracture,
      the technique using in group I was more easily and quickly to perform. It allows early
      postoperative excises and results better functional wrist range of motion.

    <description>Group I (treatment with our technique) Eighteen patients (18 wrists) were available for long-term follow-up at an average of 47.8 months after surgery. There were 11 men and seven women. Their mean age at the time of surgery was 35.4 years (range, 22 to 56 years). The dominant hand was involved in 12 patients and the nondominant hand, in six.</description>

    <description>Group II (treatment with Inoue et al.'s technique) Fifteen patients (15 wrists) were evaluated at an average of 51 months. Nine patients were men and 6 were women. The mean age of the group at the time of surgery was 37.5 years (range, 24 to 58 years). The dominant hand was involved in 10 and nondominant hand, in seven.</description>

    <description>Inoue et al.'s technique is most commonly used which required placing three K-wires to immobilize both midcarpal joint and radiocarpal joint. This technique is effective, however, it has some problems. In the study, we improve the surgical technique.</description>
