  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary aim of the study is to determine the safety and tolerability of treatment with
      Varenicline in methamphetamine-dependent volunteers. The investigators also seek to determine
      the effects of treatment with Varenicline, as compared to placebo, on craving for
      methamphetamine or cigarettes following exposure to methamphetamine and smoking cues,
      respectively. The effects of treatment with Varenicline, as compared to placebo, on
      subjective effects produced by administration of methamphetamine or placebo will be attempted
      to be determined. Lastly, the investigators hope to determine the effects of treatment with
      Varenicline, as compared to placebo, on reinforcing effects produced by administration of
      methamphetamine or placebo.

    <measure>Effects of varenicline and methamphetamine on cardiovascular measures.</measure>
    <description>The safety of MA administration during treatment will be assessed by reporting of adverse events (AEs), and using ECG recording, and heart rate and blood pressure measurements. Digital 12-lead EKG will also be recorded prior to randomization. Blood pressure and heart rate will be measured from 15 min prior to MA or placebo dosing until 2 h after dosing. In addition, heart rate and blood pressure will be assessed throughout the inpatient portion of the protocol.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Effects of varenicline and methamphetamine on subjective measures</measure>
    <description>Efficacy will be assessed by measuring effects of treatment on subjective and reinforcing effects produced by administration of MA and craving produced by exposure to drug cues. Other diagnostic measures and assessment instruments will be used to further characterize the study population.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  English speaking volunteers who are not seeking treatment at the time of the study

          -  Be between 18-55 years of age

          -  Meet DSM-IV criteria for MA dependence

          -  Must be cigarette smokers, defined as smoking 10 or more cigarettes per day by
             self-report

          -  Have a self-reported history of using MA by the smoked or IV route and provide at
             least one MA-positive urine prior to admission

          -  Have vital signs as follows: resting pulse between 50 and 90 bpm, blood pressures
             between 105-150 mm Hg systolic and 45-90 mm HG diastolic; this criterion must be met
             within 2 days of admission

          -  Have hematology and chemistry laboratory tests that are within normal (+/- 10%) limits
             with the following exceptions: a) liver function tests (total Bilirubin, ALT, AST, and
             alkaline phosphatase) &lt; 3 x the upper limit of normal, and b) kidney function tests
             (creatinine and BUN) &lt; 2 x the upper limit of normal

          -  Have a baseline EKG that demonstrates normal sinus rhythm, normal conduction
             (including QTc), and no clinically significant arrhythmias

          -  Have a medical history and brief physical examination demonstrating no clinically
             significant contradictions for study participation, in the judgment of the admitting

             treatment or which would make study compliance difficult; history of suicide attempts
             within the past three months assessed by MINI and/or current suicidal ideation/plan as
             assessed by MINI

          -  Have evidence of clinically significant heart disease or hypertension, as determined
