      The objective of this study was to evaluate the safety of a candidate malaria vaccine
      (PfAMA-1) at 3 doses given at monthly intervals of 2 different dosages of AMA-1 (10 μg or 50
      μg ) adjuvanted either with alum hydroxide or AS02A or Montanide ISA 720 in healthy adults
      not previously exposed to the parasite Plasmodium falciparum.

          -  Age &gt; 18 and &lt; 45 years healthy volunteers.

          -  General good health based on history and clinical examination.

          -  All volunteers have to sign the informed consent form.

          -  Negative pregnancy test.

          -  Use of adequate contraception for females up to three months after the third injection
             (D140).

          -  Reachable by phone during the whole study period (18 months).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  History of malaria or residence in malaria endemic areas within the past six months.

          -  Previously participated in any malaria vaccine study

          -  Symptoms, physical signs and laboratory values suggestive of systemic disorders,
             including renal, hepatic, cardiovascular, pulmonary, skin, immunodeficiency,
             psychiatric and other conditions, which could interfere with the interpretation of the
             study results or compromise the health of the volunteers.

          -  Any laboratory abnormalities on screened blood samples beyond the normal range, as
             defined at UMC St Radboud. Positive HIV, HBV or HCV tests.

          -  Volunteers should not be enrolled in any other clinical trial during the whole trial
             period.

          -  Volunteers should not receive chronic medication, especially immunosuppressive agents
             (steroids, immunomodulating or immunosuppressive drugs) during the three months

          -  Known hypersensitivity to any of the vaccine components (adjuvant or peptide).

          -  Volunteers are not allowed to receive any vaccination or gammaglobulin during a period
             three months prior to the first immunization and up to six months after the 3rd
