      The primary objective of the study is to establish the correlation between NT-proBNP
      measurements in fresh human whole blood samples and those in plasma samples from the same
      study subjects, where said samples are collected in EDTA and Li-Hep anticoagulant tubes and
      measured by the StatusFirst™ CHF NT-proBNP device in conjunction with the DXpressTM Reader in
      a laboratory setting.
