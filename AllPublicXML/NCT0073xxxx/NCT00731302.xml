      This study examine whether patients with lupus respond to aspirin , and if not, if that is
      related to inflammation. We examine the ability of aspirin to inhibit the production of
      thromboxane in patients with lupus and controls and see if aspirin insensitive thromboxane
      production is inhibited by meloxicam.

      Premature cardiovascular disease is a major cause of mortality in patients with systemic
      lupus erythematosus (SLE) with the risk of myocardial infarction increased up to 50-fold. In
      addition to defining the mechanisms for accelerated atherosclerosis it is important to define
      the effects of drugs used to reduce cardiovascular risk in high-risk patients. Low dose
      aspirin, by inhibiting thromboxane A2 biosynthesis, has profound antiplatelet effects, but
      some patients have impaired thromboxane suppression - a phenomenon termed aspirin resistance.
      An explanation is that aspirin-independent thromboxane synthesis may occur through enhanced
      COX-2 activity, as would occur in an inflammatory condition such as lupus. However, little is
      known about the effects of low-dose aspirin in SLE. Thus, we propose to test the following
      hypothesis: 1) that aspirin insensitive thromboxane biosynthesis is increased in patients
      with lupus and is mediated by increased COX-2 activity.
