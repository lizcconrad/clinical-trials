      Anticipated Impacts on Veterans' Healthcare: The investigators' study will obtain important
      scientific and clinical knowledge about the efficacy of an evidence-based gender specific
      model of treatment (A Woman's Path to Recovery) for women Veterans with substance use
      disorder (SUD), compared to an existing model that is not gender specific (12-Step
      Facilitation). 12-Step Facilitation focuses on encouraging attendance at 12-step groups such
      as Alcoholics Anonymous. If the gender-specific approach to treatment is more effective than
      12-Step Facilitation for Veterans with SUD in the VA, it may substantially improve the
      physical and mental health outcomes of women Veterans, and decrease healthcare costs by
      providing a replicable method for delivering treatment.

      Project Background: SUD is common among women Veterans, and on the rise among younger women
      Veterans. As more women Veterans seek treatment at the VA, there is likely to be an increased
      need for evidence-based treatment of SUD. To the investigators' knowledge, the PI has
      developed the only gender-based treatment approach that has shown significant outcomes in a
      pilot trial, on multiple domains. This proposal represents an opportunity to evaluate its
      efficacy with women Veterans, including younger OIF/OEF Veterans.

      Project Objectives: The goal of this proposal is to examine the efficacy of an evidence-based
      gender-specific model of treatment for women Veterans with SUD in comparison to a control
      condition that is not gender-specific (12-Step Facilitation). The long-term objective is to
      improve treatment outcomes for women Veterans with SUD through use of a gender-specific model
      that is designed to be sensitive to women's unique needs.

      Project Methods: The investigators plan to conduct a randomized clinical trial in which women
      Veterans with SUD are assigned to either a gender-specific model of treatment (A Woman's Path
      to Recovery; WPR), or to a control condition (12-Step Facilitation; 12SF); the latter does
      not include gender-specific treatment. The investigators will recruit 102 women Veterans,
      ages 18-65, who are diagnosed with SUD and in 11/2012 the protocol was amended to have used
      substances in the last 90 days. In 9/2011, the protocol was amended to include patients in
      residential care. Their substance use 90-days prior to residential treatment will be measured
      for baseline data. The target is 66 randomized patients. The treatment phase will consist of
      12 weeks of weekly therapy; all participants will receive treatment-as-usual (any other
      treatments they choose to attend). Assessments will be conducted at baseline, Months 1 and 2,
      end of treatment and 3 month follow up. The study is powered to detect an effect of .80 at a
      .05 level of significance with this sample size. Cross-sectional, repeated measures and
      longitudinal analyses are proposed. The primary outcome variable is substance use, with a
      variety of secondary outcomes (e.g., psychosocial functioning, psychiatric symptoms, coping
      skills, 12-step attendance) also being explored. The investigators will evaluate potential
      mechanisms of action of WPR as a secondary question of interest. Biological measures are
      included to validate substance use self-report of participants. The investigators hypothesize
      that participants in the experimental condition (WPR) will have more positive outcomes on
      both primary and secondary variables, and a higher level of treatment satisfaction compared
      to those in the control condition (12SF) and that mediators/moderators of outcomes (i.e.,
      mechanisms of action) will be knowledge of gender-specific substance abuse recovery concepts
      and use of coping skills.
