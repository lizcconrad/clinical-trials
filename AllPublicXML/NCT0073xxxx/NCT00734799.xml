  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A substantial number of US Veterans are suffering from Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD)
      following deployment in recent military conflicts, and sleep disturbance is a primary
      complaint of Veterans presenting to the VA with PTSD. Veterans with PTSD have more
      self-reported and physician-rated health problems, and health status is associated with PTSD
      symptom severity. Most Veterans meeting criteria for PTSD report difficulty initiating or
      maintaining sleep (70-91%), and increased PTSD severity is associated with increased sleep
      disturbance. Even after receiving treatment for PTSD, Veterans continue to experience
      residual insomnia at a rate of about 50%, in spite of having achieved PTSD remission.

      There are currently no PTSD-specific sleep interventions available, excepting an intervention
      that is specific to nightmares. Given the prevalence of sleep disturbance in Veterans with
      PTSD, the absence of interventions for PTSD-related sleep problems, and the increasing number
      of post-deployment Veterans with trauma-related sleep difficulties, such interventions are
      desperately needed. In this study, we will test the effectiveness of a multi-component
      cognitive-behavioral sleep intervention for PTSD that targets both nightmares and insomnia
      for improving the overall sleep experience of Operation Iraqi Freedom (OIF) and Operation
      Enduring Freedom (OEF) Veterans with PTSD who are also receiving usual care. The primary
      objective is to pilot test the intervention for efficacy in reducing sleep disturbance. The
      secondary objective is to examine the relative impact of the intervention on PTSD symptoms.
      The project is a prospective, randomized, clinical intervention trial. Participants will be
      randomly assigned to a multi-component cognitive-behavioral sleep intervention for PTSD +
      Usual Care, or Usual Care alone. We are hypothesizing that 1) Veterans receiving the sleep
      intervention plus usual care will produce greater improvements (reduced total wake time,
      increased sleep efficiency, etc) in subjective sleep measures than will Usual Care alone; 2)
      Veterans receiving the sleep intervention plus usual care will produce greater improvements
      in nightmare frequency and severity than will Usual Care alone; and 3) the relationship
      between PTSD symptoms and treatment group will be significantly related to sleep quality in
      the period intervening baseline and follow-up.

    <measure>Insomnia Severity</measure>
    <time_frame>12-weeks after Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Insomnia severity was assessed using the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI). The ISI is a 7-item questionnaire that provides a global measure of perceived insomnia severity. Each item is rated on a 5-point Likert scale, and the total score ranges from 0-28. The following guidelines are recommended for interpreting the total score: 0-7 (no clinical insomnia), 8-14 (subthreshold insomnia), 15-21 (insomnia of moderate severity), and 22-28 (severe insomnia). The ISI was used to determine treatment eligibility, to assess treatment outcome, and to determine clinical significance of study findings. Participants were assessed at baseline and following a 12-week intervention period.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Nightmare Frequency</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks after Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Nightmare frequency was assessed using an electronic sleep diary. Diary data was collected for a period of 1 week at both baseline and 12 weeks after baseline. The number and severity of nightmares over a 1-week period were obtained using a hand-held computer (PDA) containing an interactive program that automates the collection of subjective sleep data. The PDA device was programmed to elicit daily responses from participants and electronically record multiple days of subjective sleep information, in addition to the number and severity of nightmares for the previous night. Nightmare frequency (number of nightmares per night) was one of five variables collected from electronic sleep diaries.</description>

    <description>Patients in the SIP condition will receive the same elements as the Usual Care patients. In addition, these patients will receive six, bi-weekly, 1-hour individual sessions with the PI, including 3 sessions of Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy for Insomnia (CBT-I) and 3 sessions of Imagery Rehearsal Therapy (IRT). CBT-I consists of education designed to correct unrealistic sleep expectations, a prescription for an individually-tailored behavioral regimen, standard sleep hygiene recommendations, and the identification and restructuring of dysfunctional beliefs and attitudes regarding sleep. IRT is a brief intervention designed to facilitate the patient's &quot;rescripting&quot; of reoccurring nightmares to decrease their associated affective distress.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria: Participants will be recruited from the population of Operation Iraqi
        Freedom/Operation Enduring Freedom veterans referred to the Posttraumatic Stress Disorder
        (PTSD) clinic for evaluation and treatment, and volunteers participating in the Mental
        Illness Research, Education and Clinical Centers (MIRECC) registry who agreed to be
        recontacted for future studies. All study participants will have: 1) provided informed
        consent; 2) utilize Durham VA Medical Center health care services as their primary source
        of health care; 3) will meet the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM-IV-R) criteria for
        a diagnosis of PTSD; 4) will screen positive for an Insomnia Disorder on the Duke
        Structured Sleep Interview for Sleep Disorders (DSISD); 5) and will score greater than 14
        on the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI).

          <title>Sleep Quality</title>
          <description>Sleep quality was assessed using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), a self-rating scale that yields a quantitative index of general sleep quality/disturbances. The PSQI is composed of 4 open-ended questions and 19 self-rated items (0-3 scale) assessing sleep quality and disturbances over a 1-month interval, and yields aglobal score of sleep quality, ranging from 0 to 21. A PSQI cutoff score of 5 is a sensitive and specific value for predicting both clinical and laboratory assessments of sleep.</description>

          <title>PTSD Symptom Checklist-M</title>
          <description>The PCL-M is a 17-item self-report measure reflecting the degree to which veterans were bothered by each of 17 DSM-IV symptoms of PTSD in the past month. It is rated on a 5-point scale ranging from 1 (“not at all”) to 5 (“extremely”). The total score can range from 17 to 85, with higher scores reflecting greater PTSD symptomatology. In Vietnam veterans, a PCL-M score ≥ 50 was found to be highly predictive of PTSD diagnosis using the SCID. The PCL-M was used to assess treatment outcome and as an indicator of clinical significance of study findings.</description>

          <description>The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index Addendum for PTSD (PSQIA) was used to assess PTSD-related sleep quality, and has acceptable psychometric properties. A cut-off score of 4 was found to have excellent sensitivity and specificity for discriminating those without PTSD from those with PTSD. Total scores on the PSQIA range from 0 to 21, with higher scores reflecting poorer PTSD-related sleep quality.</description>
