    <textblock>
      You are being asked to take part in this study because your doctor has determined that you
      have an ischemic foot ulcer. This research study will compare two approved standard of care
      treatment modalities for the management of ischemic foot ulcers. The ischemic foot ulcer
      (wound) on your foot is a result of a blocked artery in your leg. The wound can sometimes be
      healed with wound care alone, which includes dressing changes with creams and removing
      (debriding) the dead tissue. Alternatively, the significant narrowing or blockage in one of
      the arteries in your leg can be treated with several endovascular treatment techniques
      including:

        -  angioplasty, also called percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) and/or

        -  stent placement

        -  atherectomy

      The hypothesis of this study is that early endovascular or surgical intervention in subjects
      with moderate arterial insufficiency and a non-healing foot ulcer results in a higher overall
      incidence of wound healing in a significantly shorter period of time.

      Design:

      This study is a single center, prospective, randomized trial evaluating the benefit of
      endovascular intervention on the healing of ischemic foot ulcers when compared to best wound
      care alone. The study population will be comprised of subjects with a foot ulcer and
      non-palpable or diminished pedal pulses. The expected duration of subjects in this trial is 2
      years.

      Patients will be randomized into two groups:

        1. Wound Care (group 1)--Best standard wound care with aggressive debridement

        2. Endovascular Intervention + Wound Care (group 2)--Best standard wound care in
           combination with endovascular revascularization

      Subjects will undergo standard of care evaluation for ischemic foot ulcers. These same
      evaluations would be performed whether or not the subject was participating in this research
      study. In the event that a clinically significant event or unanticipated disease or condition
      is identified, the subject and their doctor will be notified, the investigator, will review
      the results of the tests and procedures that are standard of care, and the results will
      become part of the research record. Prior to undergoing randomization, the subject will sign
      and fully understand an IRB consent form that is HIPAA compliant.

             incompressible vessels, a toe brachial index of 0.4 to 0.8 is required.)

          -  Signed informed consent

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Severe ischemia as defined by advanced gangrene, an ABI of less then or equal to 0.3
             and monophasic waveforms on pulse volume recording

          -  Advanced renal insufficiency, defined as serum creatinine greater than or equal to 3
