    <textblock>
      In studies of Exubera in persons with diabetes, lung cancer occurred in a few more people who
      were taking Exubera than in people who were taking other diabetes medicines. All subjects
      diagnosed with lung cancer had a history of smoking and the number of lung cancer cases
      observed fell within the expected range based on population-based data. There is currently
      not enough information to determine if any of the observed lung cancer cases were related to
      Exubera use, therefore, the study is being conducted to further investigate whether Exubera
      use makes the appearance of lung cancer more likely.
