  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if patients are able to self-rate their physical
      abilities and how these ratings compare to the ratings of their health-care provider.

      The Karnofsky Performance Scale (KPS) is a highly validated and essential measuring tool
      across the cancer population. The scale relates to purely physical ability and covers 11
      stages, ranging from normal health to death, with each stage scored as a percentage. The
      score is determined by the health-care provider and is based on observation and narrative
      patient descriptions. The purpose of this study is to compare the scores rated by the
      health-care provider to the scores that patients assign to themselves.
