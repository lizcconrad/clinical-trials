  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether there is increased oral contraceptive pill
      (OCP) adherence in women receiving daily text messaging reminders to take their OCP, compared
      to women who do not receive reminders. The investigators hypothesize that women who receive
      daily text messaging reminders to take their OCP will have increased pill adherence compared
      to women who do not receive reminders.

      The investigators also hope to determine whether there is a difference in OCP adherence as
      measured by electronic monitoring device and wireless real-time data collection versus
      traditional patient pill diaries. The investigators hypothesize that electronic monitoring
      device and wireless real-time data collection will demonstrate lower adherence compared to
      traditional patient pill diaries.
