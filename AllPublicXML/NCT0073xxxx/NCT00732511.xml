  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      We are comparing the blood pressure-lowering effects of two marketed medications, Coreg CR
      and Toprol XL. Although both drugs reduce blood pressure by blocking the action of
      noradrenaline on beta-receptors in the blood vessels, Coreg CR also blocks alpha-receptors,
      which may provide added blood pressure-lowering. In addition, Coreg CR may have anti-oxidant
      actions. Cells which line blood vessels (termed &quot;endothelial cells&quot;) make nitric oxide (NO),
      which relaxes the muscle cells encircling the blood vessels, causing a reduction in blood
      pressure. When body cells use oxygen, they normally produce &quot;free radicals&quot;, which can
      destroy NO,leading to high blood pressure, heart damage and worsenimg of diabetes.
      Antioxidants remove free radicals and prevent or repair this damage. In this study we will
      measure endothelial cell function, blood vessel wall stiffness, NO in exhaled breath, and
      blood levels of substances which reflect NO production and destruction to determine if a pure
      beta-blocker (Toprol XL) differs from an alpha/beta blocker (Coreg CR) in these effects. We
      will also examine the mechanism by which such differences might occur.

      The following techniques will be used:

      Endothelial function will be measured non-invasively by flow-mediated changes in pulsatile
      blood volume in the finger-tips.

      Vascular compliance (stiffness) will be assessed by tonometry of the radial pulse wave
      (&quot;augmentation index&quot;) and diastolic puse wave analysis.

      Plasma nitrate/nitrite levels mirror NO production and will be measured
      spectrophotometrically by the Griess reaction.

      Plasma nitrotyrosine, an in vivo marker of NO-dependent damage induced by reactive nitrogen
      intermediates derived from NO, will be measured by ELISA.

      Exhaled NO may provide an real-time measure of endothelial cell NO production and can be
      measured by a hand-held device which contains an electrochemical detector sensitive to 5 ppb.
