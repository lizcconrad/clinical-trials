    <description>The MSDR® questionnaire establishes an individual's musculoskeletal functional status using information gathered from 1) a questionnaire the patient fills out regarding medical history, chronic medical conditions, and health risk factors; 2) anatomic pain survey completed by the patient; and 3) evaluation by a trained researcher of various patient biometric parameters related to range of motion. Stratifying an individual into a risk category with this evidence-based assessment tool then permits an assessment of which patients respond long term to therapy.
MSDR® demonstrates the ability to benchmark specific musculoskeletal findings (both clinical and sub-clinical) to ICD-9 Diagnoses supported by diagnostic, radiographic and/or MRI findings where clinically indicated.</description>
