    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this investigation is to compare the precision of long leg alignment
      achieved by the two types of procedure. The secondary objectives of this investigation are
      to:

      Compare the accuracy of long leg alignment achieved by the two types of procedure.

      Compare the number of optimal implantations achieved by the two types of procedure.

      Compare the clinical performance of the knee replacement in subjects who have undergone one
      of the two types of procedure.

      Compare the functional outcome achieved by subjects who have undergone one of the two types
      of procedure.

      Compare the interface radiographic appearance 5 years post-operatively between the two types
      of procedure.

      Compare the accuracy and precision of long leg alignment achieved by the two types of
      procedure 5 years post-operatively, i.e., at final follow-up and also the change in accuracy
      and precision between the final follow-up and baseline.

      Compare the Adverse Events experienced by the subjects who have undergone the two types of
      procedure.

      Primary endpoint: to compare the precision of the long leg alignment of the Ci MiTKA vs. the
      non navigated conventional TKA, specifically 3 months to demonstrate the variability of the
      mechanical axis.

      Secondary endpoints: to compare the precision of the long leg alignment of the Ci MiTKA vs.
      the non navigated conventional TKA specifically to demonstrate the proportion of procedures
      that fall within a satisfactory alignment window in either group.

        <description>WOMAC is a patient reported outcome (PRO) that evaluates the condition of subject's with knee osteoarthritis, and includes pain (score range 0-20), stiffness (score range 0-8), and physical function (score range 0-68) of the joint, where a lower score indicates a better outcome. The WOMAC total score is a combination of the three domains (pain, stiffness, and physical function) with a range of 0-96.</description>
