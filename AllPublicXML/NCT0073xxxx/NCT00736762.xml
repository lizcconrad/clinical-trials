      The postural alterations present in the seniors people act as predisponent form of
      incapacities that provoke alterations in the quality of life. The objective of this study is
      to evaluate the biomechanical characteristics of the balance of elderly people, before and
      after treatment with Global Postural Re-education. This research is characterized by
      experimental method of investigation.Thirty elderly people (30 women) will be randomized to
      two different groups from Group of Studies of Third Age - GETI, at University of the State of
      Santa Catarina:

        -  fifteen elderly women will be submitted to the Global Postural Re-education (GPR)
           program and to the GETI program of activities

        -  fifteen elderly women will be submitted only to the GETI program of activities.

      At baseline the subjects will be screened for balance measurements with the chattecx balance
      system and Berg Scale. These measurements will be repeat immediately after the intervention.
      The subjects randomised to the GPR program will participate in posture retraining techniques
      of approximately forty minutes, one time a week for ten weeks. The independent t test for
      pairs of random samples will be used, with level of significance of p≤0,05.
