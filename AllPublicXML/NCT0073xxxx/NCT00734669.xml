  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to establish the risk and frequency of non-symptomatic hypoglycemia
      in type 2 diabetes under previous therapy with glibenclamide. Participants will be monitored
      via a continuous glucose monitoring system in a standardized clinical setting during day and
      night time, implementing meals and exercise of moderate intensity performed in the
      postprandial state.

      The day-to-day change of blood glucose is associated with the frequency of vascular
      complications and the quality of life of diabetic patients. In this study the frequency of
      hypoglycemic events in combination with postprandial hyperglycemia in type 2 diabetic
      patients on oral insulinotropic therapy will be observed. Using more sophisticated technology
      than before the probability of type 2 diabetic patients on glibenclamide to experience
      hypoglycemic episodes will be registered. Hypoglycemia is prone to cardiovascular
      complications in type 2 diabetic patients due to concomitant dysregulation of blood flow.
      With standardized test meals followed by exercise in a clinical setting hormonal
      counterregulation and cardiovascular parameters associated with hypoglycemia will be
      identified. The acute effect of different conditions of exercise and a single dose of either
      glibenclamide or placebo will be followed each day during the total three-day observation
      period. Thus we will evaluate the frequency of and the risk factors associated with
      hypoglycemia and meal-related hyperglycemia in type 2 diabetic patients.
