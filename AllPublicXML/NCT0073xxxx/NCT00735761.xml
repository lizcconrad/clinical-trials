      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the episode duration of a herpes labialis recurrence
      in immunocompromised patients treated with ME-609 or Acyclovir.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study was to evaluate the episode duration of a herpes labialis
      recurrence, following a 5-day treatment with 5-time daily topical administration of ME-609 or
      acyclovir cream, in immunocompromised adults, 18 years and older.

      This interim report summarizes the results for short-term observations, i.e., during the
      initial study recurrence. A final study report will be prepared when the long-term follow-up
      is completed.
