      The purpose of the study is to determine efficacy and safety of combination therapy with
      adjusted-dose docetaxel-oxaliplatin-capecitabine in patients with advanced gastric
      adenocarcinoma and intermediate general status.(defined as ECOG 2 or weight loss 10-25% or
      older that 70 years and no comorbidities nor functional dependency nor geriatric syndrome)

          4. older or equal 70 years old

          5. Intermediate general status defined as at least one of the following characteristics:
             performance status (ECOG) = 2, weight loss ponderada between 10 and 25% in the last 3
             months

          6. life expectancy superior to 12 weeks

          7. adequate hematological function: Neutrophils ≥1.50x109, platelets ≥100x109, Hemoglobin

             NV in case of liver metastasis; Alkaline phosphatase &lt;3 NV ))

          9. Adequate renal function: renal function (Creatinine clearance &gt; 50mL/min), based on
             Cockroff - Gault. In case Creatinine clearance is &lt; 50 ml/min, a test in urine will be
             done in 24 hours and if the value is &gt; 50 ml/min, the patient could be eligible for
             the study

             exclusion criteria if chemo or radiotherapy has been given for localized disease and
             finished more than 1 year ago. In caso os only measurable disease in the radiated

                  (urinary respiratory infection); moderate-severe depression that interfere in the
                  habitual daily life; frequent falls (3 or more monthly); be disattended; urinary
                  incontinence, without stress, infection, diuretics or prostatic hyperplasia;
                  fecal incontinence without diarrhea or laxative; osteoporotic fracture of long
                  bone or vertebral squash

          7. Cardiac concomitant present:

               1. Symptomatic auriculoventricular arrhythmia history, and /or

               2. Congestive cardiac insufficiency non controlled by drugs, and / or
