  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary aim is to study the effects of vorinostat on cyclin E, cyclin D1 and Ki-67
      expression in lung, bronchial epithelium, and lung tumors of patients with resectable
      clinical stage I - III lung cancer. Secondary aims are: To evaluate the concentration of
      vorinostat in tumor tissue and to correlate lung tissue distribution with the plasma level in
      these patients; to perform exploratory analyses of the effects of vorinostat on the induction
      of apoptosis or necrosis in treated as compared to untreated tumors and on expression of p21,
      p27, EGFR and phospho-EGFR in lung tumors of patients with resectable clinical stage I - III
      lung cancer; to perform dynamic contrast enhanced CT of the primary tumor to study the
      effects of treatment on the vascular supply of the tumor and to correlate the results with
      the intratumoral vorinostat concentrations.

    <description>Vorinostat will be administered orally once daily in an open-labeled, unblinded manner to all subjects enrolled in the study. Subjects will receive vorinostat 400 mg once daily on a continuous daily basis for 7 to 10 days prior to surgical resection. Vorinostat should be taken with food within 0 to 30 minutes of a meal if possible. Patients should take the medication at approximately the same time each day on an ongoing basis. Missed doses will not be made up.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  All patients must have pathological confirmation of non small cell lung cancer.

          -  Patients must have resectable clinical stage I - III non small cell lung cancer as
             defined by the current International Staging System for Lung Cancer.

          -  Age &gt;18 years.

          -  Adequate hepatic and renal function documented prior to study entry to include:
             hepatic transaminases (AST or ALT) ≤ 2.0 times the upper limits of normal, total
             bilirubin ≤ 1.5 times the upper limits of normal, serum creatinine ≤ 1.5 times the
             upper limit of normal or estimated creatinine clearance ≥ 60 mL/min.

          -  All patients must be medical candidates for surgical resection of their non-small cell
             lung cancer.

          -  All patients must give informed consent indicating they are aware of the
             investigational nature of this treatment.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients may not have received radiation therapy for their non-small cell lung cancer.

          -  Patients may not have received chemotherapy for their non-small cell lung cancer.

          -  Women must be surgically sterilized or post-menopausal or women of childbearing
             potential must be using an adequate method of contraception. Women of childbearing
             potential must be using at least one of the following: oral, implanted, injectable
             contraceptive hormones, or mechanical products such as an intrauterine device or
             barrier methods (diaphragm, condoms, spermicides) to prevent pregnancy or practicing
             abstinence or have a partner that is sterile (e.g., vasectomy). Women of childbearing
             potential must have a negative serum or urine pregnancy test within 72 hours prior to
             start of study therapy.

          -  Women who are pregnant or breast-feeding will be excluded.

             including uncontrolled high blood pressure, unstable angina, congestive heart failure,
             myocardial infarction within the previous 3 months or serious cardiac arrythmias will
             be excluded. Dementia or significantly altered mental status that would prohibit the

          -  Patients with active HIV, HCV or HCB infection.

          -  No prior treatment with HDAC inhibitors. Valproic acid is acceptable if not used as
             anticancer therapy and a 30-day wash-out period is allowed.

          -  Exposure to other investigational agents within 30 days of study inclusion

          -  Patients with a &quot;currently active&quot; second malignancy, other than nonmelanoma skin
             cancer and carcinoma in situ of the cervix, should not be enrolled. Patients would not
             be considered to have a &quot;currently active&quot; malignancy if they have completed therapy
             for a prior malignancy, are disease free from prior malignancies for &gt;5 years or are
             considered by their physician to be at less than 30% risk of relapse.
