    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of the Boomerang
      percutaneous closure device following diagnostic cerebral angiography or neurointerventional
      procedures.

      Background:

      Very few publications have evaluated this relatively novel percutaneous closure device.

      The purpose of this study is to document our experiences using the Boomerang closure device.
      Several different closure devices are used in the department of Radiology. A closure device
      is something that is placed in the artery in the leg just prior to removing the catheters
      from your leg at the end of the imaging or treatment procedure that is to be performed in the
      Department of Radiology. The devices used are all FDA approved. This study will compare the
      Boomerang device (a newer FDA approved device) to the other older devices currently being
      used. You may not have the Boomerang device used in your procedure; however, the Boomerang
      device is used in almost all of our patients undergoing a neuro imaging or treatment
      procedure. The neuroradiologist will determine which device if any is best for you based on
      the size of your artery, your medical condition etc. We will only collect data about you and
      your procedure if the Boomerang device is used.
