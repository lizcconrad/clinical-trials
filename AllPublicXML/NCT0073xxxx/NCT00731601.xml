  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A large dose of PPI is effective in preventing peptic ulcer rebleeding. The investigators
      hypothesize that 40 mg/q6h pantoloc is equivalent to 8mg/h pantoloc in preventing rebleeding.

      A bleeding peptic ulcer remains a serious medical problem with significant morbidity and
      mortality. Endoscopic therapy significantly reduces further bleeding, surgery, and mortality
      in patients with bleeding peptic ulcers and is now recommended as the first hemostatic
      modality for these patients.

      In the past few years, adjuvant use of a high-dose proton pump inhibitor (PPI) after
      endoscopic therapy has been endorsed in some studies, two consensus statements and two
      meta-analysis. In our previous experience, we used omeprazole 160 mg /day infusion instead of
      8 mg/h in these patients and obtained a good result .

      The objectives of this study are to assess the outcomes of two different regimens of high
      dose of intravenous pantoprazole after endoscopic therapy in patients with peptic ulcer
      bleeding.
