      RATIONALE: Learning about young adults' knowledge and perceptions about risk factors for the
      human papilloma virus and cervical cancer may help doctors learn more about how to prevent
      human papilloma virus infection and cervical cancer in the future.

      PURPOSE: This clinical trial is studying knowledge and perceptions of the risk factors for
      human papilloma virus infection and cervical cancer in young adults.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Describe the socio-demographic context of college students in an urban Midwestern
           setting.

        -  Assess knowledge of the human papillomavirus (HPV) and cervical cancer in these
           participants.

        -  Assess the population's perception of HPV risk.

        -  Assess the prevalence of risk behaviors that may place this population at risk for HPV.

        -  Identify the best predictors of HPV knowledge and cervical cancer knowledge.

        -  Assess vaccine knowledge and acceptance in these participants.

      OUTLINE: Participants complete the Young Adult Survey online documenting demographic data;
      sexual history (i.e., whether they ever had sex, age of first sexual encounter, number of
      life time partners, condom use, sexually transmitted diseases [STDs], and pregnancy history);
      cigarette use; current and past drug use; knowledge of human papillomavirus (HPV) and
      cervical cancer; past history of Pap tests and STD screenings; attitudes towards HPV testing;
      vaccine knowledge and acceptability; sources of information about HPV; source of information
      about cervical cancer; identification of common STDs; perceived risk of acquiring STDs;
      perceived risk of acquiring HPV; social support; and religion.
