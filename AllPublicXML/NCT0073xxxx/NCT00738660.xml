      Hypothesis:

      The angiotensin receptor blocker telmisartan is effective at reduction of albumin excretion
      rate(AER) in patients with type1 diabetes and micro or macroalbuminuria. Dual blockade with
      the addition of ramipril an angiotensin receptor blocker gives added efficacy for reduction
      of AER. ARB telmisartan gives a 24 hr BP lowering effect.

      Summary:

      This is an open label cross over study involving 30 patients who were initially treated with
      Telmisartan 80 mg for eight weeks followed by addition of Ramipril 10 mg for a further eight
      weeks. Albuminuria reduction and BP reduction with both clinic and ambulatory BP records were
      studied at the end of each phase.

      To evaluate the antialbuminuric efficacy of an angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) telmisartan
      and the combination of telmisartan and ramipril in patients with type1 DM and either micro or
      macroalbuminuria.To evaluate the same drugs for their antihypertensive efficacy and their
      influence on dipping patterns using ambulatory BP monitoring.

      Methods:

      Open label cross over study involving 30 patients who were initially treated with telmisartan
      80 mg for eight weeks followed by addition of ramipril 10 mg for a further eight weeks.
      Albuminuria reduction and BP reduction with both clinic and ambulatory BP records were
      studied at the end of each phase Overnight urine samples of nine hours duration were
      collected . The volume of urine was verified by measurement in a jar with accuracy of 50ml by
      the study investigator on every occasion. . Albuminuria was estimated by immuno-turbidimetry
      Hemocue albumin system Angelholm AD, Sweden (inter assay CV 4.3% ). The albumin excretion
      rate(AER) at baseline evaluation was determined as the mean AER of the positive urine
      samples. During subsequent evaluations at the end of 8weeks and at the end of 16 weeks the
      mean albumin excretion rate from two successive overnight urine samples was taken as the mean
      .Ambulatory BP (ABP) measurement :ABP was measured using Spacelabs device 90207 Spacelabs
      inc. use of which is described before(14) .A uniform protocol of inflation once in every 30
      min was used. Cuff was applied to the nondominant arm. Recordings were started in all
      patients between seven and ten AM.
