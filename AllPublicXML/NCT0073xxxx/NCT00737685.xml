  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Anti-thymocyte globulin (ATG) has been used in severe aplastic anemia as a part of the
      conditioning regimen. Among the many kinds of ATG preparations, thymoglobulin had been found
      to be more effective in preventing GVHD and rejection of organ transplants. As the
      fludarabine based conditioning regimens without total body irradiation have been reported to
      be promising for BMT/PBSCT from alternative donors in SAA, thymoglobulin was added to
      fludarabine and cyclophosphamide conditioning to reduce GVHD and to allow good engraftment in
      UBMT/UPBSCT.
