  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Survival for one of the most complex forms of congenital heart disease, hypoplastic left
      heart syndrome (HLHS), has improved dramatically. However, little is known about family
      stress, coping and outcomes following the diagnosis of HLHS. It is expected that families
      face emotional, social and financial stressors. Health care professionals have a unique
      opportunity to positively influence how families interpret and adapt to these stressors. The
      specific aims of the study are to describe perceived stress, and coping skills utilized, in
      parents of children with HLHS and their impact on family outcomes measured as well-being,
      adaptation and caregiver/family quality of life, and to describe changes in stress, coping,
      and adaptation and differences in perceptions of mothers versus fathers of children with HLHS
      over the first 14 months of life. The Resiliency Model of Family Adjustment and Adaptation
      (McCubbin, Thompson, &amp; McCubbin, 1996) is the theoretical framework that guides this
      research.

      Hypotheses:

        1. Family perception of stress, and coping skills utilized, will have an impact on family
           outcomes measured as well-being, adaptation, and caregiver/family quality of life.

        2. Variables influencing perception of stress and variables influencing family coping will
           be significant predictors of family adaptation outcomes.

        3. Perceptions of stress, coping skills utilized, and family adaptation outcomes will
           improve during the first 14 months of life with an infant with HLHS.

        4. Mothers and fathers will report different perceptions of stress, coping skills utilized,
           and family adaptation outcomes during the first 14 months of life with an infant with
           HLHS.

    <description>Family adaptation will be measured with the general functioning scale of the Family Assessment Device (FAD) (Miller, Epstein, Bishop &amp; Keitner, 1985) at T1, T2 and T3. The FAD provides an overall measure of family functioning; 12 items, reliability alpha = .83-.86.</description>

        Parents of all patients diagnosed with complex congenital heart disease requiring
        hospitalization or intervention during the neonatal period will be eligible to participate.
        Parents unable to speak or read English will be excluded. An attempt will be made to obtain
        consent for participation from both the mother and father of the affected infant. If no
        father is involved in the care of the infant, measures will be obtained from mothers alone.
        The model will be tested using mothers' reports of family variables. Single parents will be
        able to participate but will not be included in comparisons between mothers and fathers.
        Nurse coordinators at participating centers will conduct subject screening and consenting.
