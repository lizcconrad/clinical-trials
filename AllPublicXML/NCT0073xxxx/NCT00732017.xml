  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators hypothesis is that HVPC with negative polarity diminishes local
      post-traumatic edema in ankle sprains. Therefore, the objective of this study was to analyze
      the effect of HVPC on edema secondary to ankle sprains in humans.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Most studies have investigated the effects of HVPC on edema in animals and only one in humans
      was identified. The studies had showed that HVPC had some advantages for controlling edema in
      animals but there are not yet conclusive results on the effect of this intervention in
      humans.For this reason, we proposed a randomized controlled double-blinded clinical trial
      with three groups of intervention. In our study compared the effects of standard physical
      therapy treatment with the HVPC with negative and positive polarity.

    <description>A high voltage stimulator with positive polarity was used with a direct pulsed monophasic current, double peak, 5 and 8micros duration and separated by a pulsate interval of 75micros and monopolar application with a dispersive electrode in the lumbar region and two transarticular active electrodes. The intensity of the current was under motor level, that is, just before a visible motor response could be observed. The frequency used was 120pps, in a continuous mode and was applied once a day with thirty-minute duration.</description>

    <description>Initial phase: Application of crushed ice on the ankle for 20 minutes. The subject performed isometric and active exercises of the ankle in all freedom degrees, with no weight bearing.
Intermediate phase: Application of cryotherapy continued and once mobility was completed and painless, progressive use of weight and reeducation of the walking pattern were initiated. Then, exercises with manual resistance of muscles of ankle and balance in stable surfaces were done.
Advanced phase: Balance exercises on unstable surfaces as well as strengthening ankle muscles with proprioceptive neuromuscular facilitation techniques and elastic band were performed. At the end, the patient did activities like trotting in S or Z and jumping in all directions.</description>
