    <textblock>
      The sequential administration of endocrine therapies to patients with advanced breast cancer
      requires the availability of therapies with different modes of actions, so that tumours
      developing resistance to one agent are not cross resistant to another. Because of its
      mechanism of action, fulvestrant is distinct from other hormonal therapies, which therefore
      limits the possibility of cross-resistance with other therapies such as tamoxifen and the
      aromatase inhibitors (AIs)

        -  In this way, patients may benefit from an extended period of endocrine treatment, which
           has considerable tolerability and quality-of-life advantages over cytotoxic
           chemotherapy.

        -  In Belgium, fulvestrant is indicated for treating postmenopausal women with hormone
           receptor-positive locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer with recurrence during or
           after adjuvant anti-oestrogen therapy or disease progression during anti-oestrogen
           treatment. However, little information is currently available on how fulvestrant is
           actually being used by physicians in Belgium. The optimum sequence of endocrine
           treatment for advanced breast cancer has yet to be defined and may depend on certain
           patient or disease characteristics.

      Fulvestrant has been granted reimbursement by the Belgian Health authorities (RIZIV/INAMI)
      with the recommendation to collect the real life data necessary to assess the patients'
      breast cancer treatment history that may influence the actual endocrine treatment sequence
      according to physicians current clinical practice..
