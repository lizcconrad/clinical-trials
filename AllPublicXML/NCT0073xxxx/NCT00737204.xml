      This study will determine whether armodafinil (Nuvigil), an FDA approved medication, is
      effective in reducing fatigue in adults with HIV/AIDS.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Fatigue is a common problem for many people with HIV/AIDS, interfering with daily activities
      and serving as a significant barrier to working among those whose health is otherwise stable
      or restored by antiretroviral (ARV) medication. Fatigue in HIV is associated with disability
      and diminished quality of life. It may be caused by ARVs or by the virus itself. A related
      study tested whether modafinil, of which armodafinil is an r-isomer, could reduce fatigue in
      HIV/AIDS patients. Armodafinil, believed to have a longer duration and greater effect than
      modafinil, will be tested on the same criteria.

      Participants will be randomly assigned to receive either armodafinil or a placebo daily for 4
      weeks. Participants randomized to active medication and who show improvements in symptoms
      will be offered armodafinil for an additional 12 weeks. For them, the study duration is 16
      weeks. Participants who did not receive armodafinil will be offered armodafinil for 16 weeks.
      For these participants, the study duration is 20 weeks. Participants who did not benefit from
      armodafinil will receive alternate treatment options. All participants will have weekly study
      visits for the first 4 weeks of the study and biweekly visits for the remainder of the study.
      At each visit, participants will complete various tasks to determine cognitive function, and
      self-report scales will be used to determine symptoms of depression and fatigue. After
      completion of 16 weeks, participants responding to armodafinil will be transitioned to the
      publicly available modafinil over the course of 2 weeks.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Fatigue Severity Scale(FSS) Outcome</measure>
    <time_frame>Measured at baseline and Weeks 4</time_frame>
    <description>The FSS is a 9-item self-report scale that measures the impact of fatigue on everyday functioning. Each item is rated on a scale of 1 to 7. Total scores range from 9-63, with a higher score indicating greater impairment due to fatigue.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Role Function Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Measured at Baseline and Week 4</time_frame>
    <description>The Role Function Scale includes 10 items drawn from the Short Form 36-item Survey (SF-36) and other SF versions. It is intended to assess the extent to which fatigue has a behavioral impact on daily activities. Scores of frequency in the past week, on a 5-point scale, are summed with higher scores signifying greater role impairment. Scores range from 10-50.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>CD4 Cell Count</measure>
    <time_frame>Measured at baseline and Week 4</time_frame>
    <description>Cd4 cell count is a laboratory marker providing an indication of immune system functioning. Blood samples were drawn for this measure at baseline and week 4. The reference range for CD4 cell count is 490-1740, and a clinically significant change is defined as a change of &gt;=100 cells. A higher number is associated with better immune functioning.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>HIV Viral Load</measure>
    <time_frame>Measured at baseline and Week 4</time_frame>
    <description>HIV RNA viral load assay is a laboratory measure indicating viral activity. Because of the large range of possible values (50 - 100,000 copies), this measure is transformed to log10 values. We entered the log10 value of 1.69 when the laboratory result stated &quot;under 50 copies,&quot; which was the assay's lowest limit of detectability during the study.</description>
