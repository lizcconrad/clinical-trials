  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is being done to compare two commonly available types of body contouring,
      VASER-Assisted Lipoplasty (VAL) and Suction-Assisted Lipoplasty (SAL), and to decide if one
      procedure is preferred by patients and/or surgeons over the other. Participants will have VAL
      on one side of their body and SAL on the opposite side.
