      The purpose of this study is to compare progression-free survival (PFS) of patients with
      advanced, recurrent or metastatic endometrial cancer who have received one, but not more than
      two, prior lines of chemotherapy either as adjuvant therapy or treatment for advanced
      disease, and then when treated with ridaforolimus or the investigators' choice of progestin
      or chemotherapy.
