  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of the proposed research is to develop new diagnostic modalities based on
      optical spectroscopy (auto fluorescence, absorption, and scattering) for the diagnosis of
      breast cancer and test its performance as an adjunct to core needle biopsy. For the surgery
      part of the study, all patients scheduled to have a mastectomy or lumpectomy for the
      treatment of breast cancer will be asked if they would be willing to participate in this
      study. For the core needle biopsy part of the study, patients with a higher pre-probability
      of cancer (based on mammography) will be recruited to increase the number of patients with
      malignant lesions and enrolled in this investigation.
