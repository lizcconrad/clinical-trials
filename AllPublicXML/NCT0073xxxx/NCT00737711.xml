  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This single arm study will evaluate the hemoglobin (Hb) increasing effect, safety and
      tolerability of two-weekly intravenous administration of Mircera in dialysis patients with
      chronic renal anemia not currently treated with ESAs. Patients will receive intravenous
      Mircera 0.6 micrograms/kg every 2 weeks for 16 weeks with follow up 2 weeks after the last
      treatment visit. The anticipated time on study treatment is 3-12 months, and the target
      sample size is 100-500 individuals.
