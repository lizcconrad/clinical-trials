    <textblock>
      Heart valve replacement surgery has been proved to be an effective method in treating both
      regenerative and rheumatic valve disease. Current studies showed that cardiopulmonary bypass
      (CPB) and operation related myocardial injury, as indicated by the release of perioperative
      cardiac enzymes, is associated with worse patient morbidity and mortality after elective
      valve replacement surgery. Although the actual mechanism is still unclear, it has been shown
      that ischemic preconditioning is one potential strategy for reduction of myocardial injury in
      open heart surgery. Recently, Electro- acupuncture (EA) was proved to produced cerebral
      protective and antiarrhythmic effects by mimicking ischemic preconditioning. This study aims
      to assess whether electroacupuncture preconditioning is also effective in reducing myocardial
      injury in adults with acquired heart valve disease undergoing elective valve replacement
      surgery.
