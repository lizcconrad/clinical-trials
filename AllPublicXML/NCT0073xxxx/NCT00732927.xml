  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Retinal vein occlusion (RVO) is the second commonest retinal disease after diabetic
      retinopathy, and is a common cause of unilateral visual loss. There are two aims in the
      management of RVO: the identification of modifiable risk factors and their medical management
      and the recognition and management of sight-threatening complications. The management of the
      disease includes laser therapy and the control of systemic associated diseases. Many other
      treatments have been proposed but there is no evidence on their efficacy in modulating the
      outcome of branch or central RVO. There are currently no adequate clinical trials that have
      evaluated the efficacy and safety of antithrombotic agents in this setting. Antiplatelet
      agents are frequently used in clinical practice. Anticoagulant drugs, either heparins or
      coumarins, are also used in this setting as they represent the first line therapy for the
      treatment of venous thromboembolism. Aim of this randomized controlled study is to to compare
      the efficacy and safety of aspirin and of a low molecular weight heparin, parnaparin, in the
      treatment of RVO. Study treatment is administered for 3 months. Primary end-point of the
      study is the incidence of functional worsening of the eye with RVO at 6 months. Secondary
      efficacy outcomes are the following: proportion of cases requiring laser treatment because of
      the extension of the ischemic lesion and/or the presence of neovascularisation and/or macular
      oedema, incidence of recurrent RVO objectively documented by fluorescein angiography. Safety
      outcomes are defined by the incidence of major and minor bleeding events.
