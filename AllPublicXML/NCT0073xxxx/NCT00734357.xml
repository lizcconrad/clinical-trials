      The purpose of this study is to determine if one CT contrast agent (medication injected into
      a vein; used in CT examinations to help produce clearer images) is safer to use than another.
      This study will compare the safety of two widely-used, U.S. FDA approved contrast agents,
      Isovue and Omnipaque. The investigators hypothesize that there is no significant difference
      in the rates of contrast-induced nephrotoxicity (CIN) between these agents when the overall
      population consists of low-risk patients.

    <textblock>
      For patients without known kidney disease, it is exceptionally rare for the administration of
      CT contrast agents to injure the kidneys, and those rare injuries that do occur are almost
      always temporary (a week or two) and heal. Indeed, significant injuries are so rare that the
      kidney function in patients is not routinely checked after they receive CT contrast agents.
      There are many brands of contrast media in common use across the United States, and it has
      been thought in the past that all are similarly low in risk. The purpose of this study is to
      examine whether two different contrast materials might differ in their risk to the kidneys.
      We will perform a direct comparison of Omnipaque-300 (iohexol, 300 mg I/ml) and Isovue-300
      (Iopamidol, 300 mg I/ml) low osmolality contrast agents to determine their relative CIN rates
      (as measured by serum creatinine concentration) in low-risk patients.

    <description>Prior to having the clinically scheduled CT examination the subject will have blood work drawn. This blood work will give the investigators a baseline value of the basic kidney function of the subject. They will then have blood work done again at 2 days and again at 3 days following the CT examination. Some patients, based on their blood work obtained at 2 and 3 days after the CT examination, will be asked to have blood work performed at 7 days after their CT examination.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients 18 years of age and older

          -  Patients referred for a contrast-enhanced CT examination. Such contrast- enhanced CT
             examinations include, but are not limited to, certain examinations of the head, neck,
             chest, abdomen, pelvis, etc.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients less than age of 18 years of age

          -  Pregnant patients

          -  Patients unable to provide written informed consent

          -  Patients in whom there are contraindications to the administration of intravenous
             contrast material (as detailed in out Department of Radiology intravenous contrast
             material use guidelines), including renal contraindications (such as a University of
             Michigan laboratory record of most recent serum creatinine concentration of &gt;1.5 mg/dl
             or an estimated glomerular filtration rate (EGFR) &lt;60 ml/min); if no serum creatinine
             is available, patients will be receive contrast material based on departmental
             guidelines

          -  Patients who are undergoing therapy with agents purported to reduce the risk of CIN
             (such as acetylcysteine, theophylline, or intravenous hydration)

          -  Patients who are unable to provide the follow-up serum creatinine concentration
             measurements

          -  Patients undergoing CT examinations that utilize a higher concentration of iodine (for
             example, 370 mg I/ml contrast material)

          -  Patients who have experienced allergic-like reactions to contrast; including patients
             who receive corticosteroid/antihistamine premedication to reduce the risk of an acute
             allergic-like reaction

          -  Patients who do not receive the study criterion for dose of contrast material; and
             patients in whom a contrast extravasation of more than 5 ml occurs (so that it is not
             possible to determine how much contrast material the patient received as a direct
             intravenous injection)

          -  Patients participating in other investigational drug, contrast material, or device
             trials
