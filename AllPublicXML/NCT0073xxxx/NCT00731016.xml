  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      We suggest treating the Hutchinson-Gilford Progeria Syndrome by two molecules (zoledronic
      acid and pravastatin).The therapeutic approach which we propose has for objectives to reduce,
      to prevent or to delay the gravest infringements of the disease, to prolong the life of the
      children, and in a more general way, aim at improving their living conditions.
