      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy work in different ways to stop the growth of cancer
      cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Monoclonal antibodies,
      such as rituximab, can block cancer growth in different ways. Some block the ability of
      cancer cells to grow and spread. Others find cancer cells and help kill them or carry
      cancer-killing substances to them. Radiolabeled monoclonal antibodies, such as yttrium Y 90
      ibritumomab tiuxetan, can find cancer cells and carry cancer-killing substances to them
      without harming normal cells. Giving combination chemotherapy together with rituximab and
      yttrium Y 90 ibritumomab tiuxetan may kill more cancer cells.

      PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying giving combination chemotherapy followed by
      rituximab and yttrium Y 90 ibritumomab tiuxetan to see how well it works in treating patients
      with relapsed stage II, stage III, or stage IV follicular non-Hodgkin lymphoma.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  To evaluate the 1-year progression-free survival of patients with relapsed stage II-IV
           follicular non-Hodgkin lymphoma treated with ESHAP chemotherapy for cytoreduction
           followed by yttrium Y 90 ibritumomab tiuxetan radioimmunotherapy.

        -  To evaluate the median time to progression in these patients.

      Secondary

        -  To evaluate the overall and complete response rates in patients treated with this
           regimen.

      OUTLINE:

        -  ESHAP chemotherapy: Patients receive ESHAP chemotherapy comprising etoposide IV over 1
           hour, methylprednisolone IV, cisplatin IV on days 1-4, and cytarabine IV over 2 hours on
           day 1. Treatment repeats every 28 days for 2 courses in the absence of disease
           progression or unacceptable toxicity.

        -  Radioimmunotherapy: Between 4-6 weeks after completion of ESHAP chemotherapy, patients
           receive rituximab IV followed by indium In 111 ibritumomab tiuxetan IV over 10 minutes
           on day 1. Patients with &lt; 25% bone marrow involvement and expected biodistribution
           proceed to treatment. Patients receive rituximab IV followed by yttrium Y 90 ibritumomab
           tiuxetan IV over 10 minutes on day 7, 8, or 9.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically.
