  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      We are inviting you to participate in a study of how people who have had genetic counseling
      for breast/ovarian cancer risk feel about certain reproductive technologies, preimplantation
      genetic diagnosis (PGD) and prenatal genetic diagnosis (PND), that may reduce the chances of
      passing increased risk onto one's children. We would also like feedback from patients who
      have been to our clinic in the past on the best ways to talk about PGD and PND during genetic
      counseling sessions. We are seeking both the opinions of people who are interested in these
      technologies and those who are not. It does not matter whether you have heard of PGD or PND
      before - you can still participate. Your past experience with genetic counseling is valuable
      to us in deciding how to communicate this information during sessions.

    <description>You will be asked to make a one-time visit to MSKCC. At that research visit, you will be asked to complete a short questionnaire about your knowledge of various reproductive technologies relevant to individuals at hereditary risk. Then you will watch a short presentation about these reproductive technologies and complete a second brief questionnaire to assess your understanding of the presentation. Afterwards, you will meet with an interviewer one-on-one for about one hour, during which time you may share your thoughts and feelings about the use of these reproductive technologies.</description>
