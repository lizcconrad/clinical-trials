  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      An observational study to gather information about people who may have certain abnormalities
      in skin microcirculation and muscle metabolism and to determine whether these abnormalities
      affect wound healing. The study also examines the association of a specific type of cell with
      the rate of wound healing.

      An observational study which entails: medical history; physical examination; blood tests;
      MRI; microcirculation tests (two noninvasive tests: 1) a procedure that measures the resting
      blood flow of the skin and 2) a technique that introduces acetylcholine and sodium
      nitroprusside in the skin and measures the ability of the skin's vessels to dilate and
      increase blood flow); and macrocirculation tests (noninvasive ultrasound of arm). This study
      also involves 2 Visits to the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston, MA.
      (Joslin-Beth Israel Deaconess Foot Center, Lowry Outpatient Laboratory, MRI Suite).
