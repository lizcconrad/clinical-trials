  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Procedurally Virtual reality exposure therapy (VRET) is quite similar to models of extinction
      of conditioned fears. Recent advances in animal research have identified pharmacological
      agents that appear to both accelerate and consolidate extinction learning. One of these
      cognitive enhancers is Yohimbine. An interesting finding in animal literature is that the
      administration of Yohimbine during extinction trials accelerates fear reduction and may
      convert ineffective exposures in to successful ones. It is thought that the mechanism of
      enhanced emotional memory is through elevated norepinephrine in the prefrontal cortex.
      Therefore, we propose to extend these studies by combining VRET with Yohimbine. In this pilot
      study with a between groups design 20 participants with a fear of flying will be treated with
      VRET plus Yohimbine or VRET plus placebo. This between groups design was chosen to further
      characterize the differential within and between trial extinction. Outcome will be measured
      by self-report, behavioral, and psychophysiological assessments at pre- and post-treatment.
      In addition, we will examine extinction parameters during exposures.
