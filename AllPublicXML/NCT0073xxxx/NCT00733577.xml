             conditions other than T2DM, as determined by a responsible physician, based on a
             medical evaluation including medical history, physical examination, laboratory tests
             and ECGs. A subject with a clinical abnormality or laboratory parameters that meets
             exclusion criteria but is outside the reference range for the population being studied
             may be included only if the Investigator and the GSK Medical Monitor agree that the
             finding is unlikely to introduce additional risk factors and will not interfere with
             the study procedures.

          -  BMI (body mass index) within the range 25-35 kg/m2, inclusive.

          -  T2DM diagnosed at least 3 months prior to Screening

             combination with other agent(s) on this list at half maximal dose or less, Exenatide,
             either as monotherapy or in combination with other agent(s) on this list All doses of
             anti-diabetic medication must have been stable for at least 3 months prior to
             Screening, and the subject must be willing to wash out from their antidiabetic
             medications from Day -7 through Day 7.
