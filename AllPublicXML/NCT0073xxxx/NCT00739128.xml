  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Celiac disease and infection with hepatitis B virus (HBV) are very prevalent worldwide and
      carry a high morbidity rate. It has been recently shown that patients with celiac disease
      very often fail to develop immunity after standard vaccination for HBV during infancy. In
      this study, we will evaluate whether a second vaccination series via a different route of
      administration (into the skin rather than the muscle) results in a better immunological
      response in celiac patients. Eligible patients will be randomized to receive a 3-dose
      vaccination series into the skin or to the muscle. Rate of responders and level of immunity
      will be compared. This study will facilitate better protection of celiac patients to this
      potentially deadly virus.

    Believed that a better study was to compare the response to engerix B vs Sci-B-Vac vaccine in
    this patient group.
