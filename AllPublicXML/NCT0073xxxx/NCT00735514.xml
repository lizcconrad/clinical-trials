      RATIONALE: Understanding how well patients comply with their treatment regimen may help
      doctors determine best treatment and ongoing care for future patients.

      PURPOSE: This phase I study is looking at compliance with vaginal dilation therapy in women
      who have undergone radiation therapy for stage IB, stage IIA, stage IIB, stage IIIA, or stage
      IIIB cervical cancer or stage IA, stage IB, stage IIA, or stage IIB endometrial cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  To determine adherence to vaginal dilation therapy after radiotherapy in patients with
           early-stage IB grade 2-IIIB cervical cancer or stage IA grade 3-IIB endometrial cancer.

        -  To identify demographic, medical, and psychosocial factors associated with adherence to
           recommendations for vaginal dilation in these patients.

        -  To describe the sexual, marital, and non-marital dyadic functioning of these patients.

      OUTLINE: Patients from the IMPAC registry in Radiation Oncology at the University Hospitals
      Case Medical Center, Ireland Cancer Center complete questionnaires online or by mail.
      Questionnaires include the Vaginal Dilation Adherence questionnaire, the Sexual
      Function-Vaginal Changes Questionnaire, the Dyadic Satisfaction questionnaire, and the
      Physician/Nurse Recommendation of Vaginal Dilation questionnaire.
