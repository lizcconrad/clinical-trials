  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an observational study that involves subjects with full-thickness rotator cuff tears
      treated by means of arthroscopy surgical repair, also known as arthroscopic surgery. The
      primary objective of this study is to observe the timing and rate of tendon retear in those
      subjects.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Subjects will be recruited from each surgeon's surgical practice. They will be reviewed to
      assure they meet all eligibility criteria prior to enrolling them into the study.
