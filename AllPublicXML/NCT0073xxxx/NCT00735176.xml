  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study will compare cervical arthroplasty with cervical discectomy and fusion, in the
      treatment of cervical radiculopathy. The 0-hypothesis is that there is no difference between
      the two methods, when comparing primary and secondary outcome variables.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Anterior discectomy and fusion (ACDF) is in Norway currently the most common operative method
      against cervical radiculopathy, caused by disc herniation and/or spondylosis. In the last
      decade cervical arthroplasty has emerged as a new alternative operative method. Arthroplasty
      is claimed to preserve the natural motion of the spine, thereby preventing adjacent level
      disc disease and providing better clinical results. However, this hypothesis has not yet been
      adequately proven. In our study, we will prove if there is any real difference in terms of
      clinical effect between cervical arthroplasty and ACDF.We will also compare the overall costs
      of the two methods, including cost-utility analyses. Moreover, we will study the development
      of adjacent level disease by use of MRI scans, and analyze cervical spine motion and disc
      height by use of Distortion Compensated Roentgen Analysis (DCRA).
