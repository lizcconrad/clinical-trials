      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the long-term clinical and functional performance of
      the P.F.C. Sigma Rotating Platform TC3 knee system in revision knee surgery and to determine
      whether the implant design results in a longer-lasting knee replacement.

      Primary outcome: Implant survival at 5 years Secondary Outcomes:Evidence of clinical and
      functional outcome determined by the Knee Society Score, anterior knee pain (Patellar Score).
      Evidence of health related quality of life determined by WOMAC OA index. Patient satisfaction
      at 1 and 5 years. Radiographic analysis according to Knee society guidelines. Implant
      survival annually to 15 years.

          -  Subjects whose primary diagnosis includes non-inflammatory or inflammatory
             degenerative joint disease.

          -  Subjects who require revision of any previous knee arthroplasty.

          -  Subjects who, in the opinion of the Clinical Investigator, are considered to be
             suitable for treatment with the investigation device, according to the indications
             specified in the package insert leaflet.

          -  Subjects who require revision of the femoral and/or tibial components. (Both

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects who, in the opinion of the Investigator, have an existing condition that

             could affect follow-up care or treatment outcomes.

          -  Subjects who have participated in a clinical study with an investigational product in
             the last 60 days (excluding any primary knee replacement study).

          -  Subjects who are currently involved in any injury litigation claims.

          -  Subjects with global instability, deficient extensor mechanism or severe bone loss
             (eg. due to fracture or tumour resection).

          -  Subjects who have had their contralateral knee replaced within the previous 6-month
             period.
