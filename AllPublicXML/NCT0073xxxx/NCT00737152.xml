    <textblock>
      Rationale: RAS 130 is an anti-diabetic agent used to lower the blood glucose level in Type II
      Diabetes mellitus (non-insulin-dependent diabetes) patients with proper diet and exercise.
      RAS 130 works by restoring proper response to insulin in the body. RAS 130 acts primarily by
      increasing insulin sensitivity which improves glycemic index. It is presumed that RAS 130
      does not cause cardiovascular side effects if it is given to Type II diabetes mellitus
      patients leading a healthy life style. Specifically, controlling diet is done according to
      American Diabetic Association &amp; American Heart Association guidelines and also through doing
      aerobic exercises. Guideline for aerobic exercise is given in the design of the study.

      Exercise is helpful in controlling body weight which can lower the risk for heart disease.
      Diabetes itself is one of the compounding factors for heart diseases. Exercise helps lowering
      the LDL cholesterol and raising the HDL cholesterol which is required to prevent heart
      diseases and achieve a better quality of life.

      Purpose: The aim of this study is to prospectively assess and evaluate the cardiovascular
      side effects and reduction of blood glucose levels in the Type II Diabetes mellitus patients
      treated with RAS 130, who either met, or failed to meet criteria for diet and exercise.

      Objectives:

      Primary Objective:

      To determine the relatedness of cardio toxicity as a side effect in subjects with DM II who
      are treated with RAS 130 who either met, or failed to meet the criteria for diet and
      exercise.

      Hypothesis I: There will be no evidence of cardiovascular side effects in subjects who are
      determined to have maintained proper diet and exercise &quot;healthy lifestyle&quot; throughout the
      study.

      Hypothesis II: There may be evidence of cardiovascular side effects in subjects who are
      determined to neglect proper diet and exercise &quot;unhealthy lifestyle&quot; throughout the study.

      Secondary Objective:

      To determine the effectiveness of RAS 130 on the reduction of blood glucose levels in
      subjects with DM II.

      Hypothesis III: RAS 130 will be effective in reducing blood glucose levels as a single agent.

      Hypothesis IV: RAS 130 will be effective in reducing blood glucose in combination with other
      anti- diabetic agents.

    <description>Entire population, which will also include existing patients, will be treated with RAS 130 along with diet and exercise. By the end of 6 months: 3 months of study and 3 months of follow-up, the entire population will be divided into two groups which will be determined through endpoints. The first group will be subjects with diet and exercise and the second group will be subjects without diet and exercise. The endpoints for the division of the groups are given in the design of the study.</description>
