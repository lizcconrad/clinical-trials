  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Children with cancer need a long term tunnelled central venous catheter (TCVC) for the entire
      duration of their treatment. TCVCs are locked with heparin when not in use. The most frequent
      complications of long term TCVC are catheter related blood steam infections. Taurolock is a
      new lock that is claimed to prevent the formation of luminal biofilm in TCVCs and has been
      demonstrated to eradicate infected CVCs. In this study the investigators will compare TCVCs
      locked with heparin with TCVCs locked with Taurolock. Hypothesis: Taurolock will diminish the
      number of CRBSI in children with cancer compared with children with heparin lock of their
      CVC.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The most frequent complications of long term TCVC are catheter related blood steam
      infections(CRBSI)often caused by microorganisms located in the biofilm formed on the inner
      surface of the TCVC after a short time. CRBSI may be lifethreatening, will need long term
      intravenous broad spectrum antibiotic therapy possibly combined with intraluminal antibiotic
      lock therapy. In spite of this CRBSI may often lead to the premature removal of the TCVC.

      Several methods to prevent the occurrence of intraluminal microbial colonization have been
      investigated with no single method standing out as the optimal one.

      There is a need for a simple and safe method of reducing the occurrence of CRBSI in
      immunocompromised children receiving chemotherapy for malignant diseases. Various catheter
      lock solutions in stead of using heparin have been investigated in experimental models.
      Taurolidine is a chemically modified amino acid with broad spectrum antimicrobial activity in
      vitro. It is claimed to prevent the formation of luminal biofilm in TCVCs in a CVC model and
      it has been demonstrated to eradicate infected CVC in a three reports with a total of 18
      patients.

      In a 24 months study of routine use of Taurolidine 1,25%/Sodium-Citrate 4% (TaurolockTM) a
      reduction of gram-positive CVC associated infections was demonstrated. The findings were not
      statistically significant due to relatively few patients.

      There is a need of a larger study with more patients receiving Taurolock for locking the TCVC
      between use in order to test for a significant reduction of the occurrence of CRBSI.
      Furthermore there is a need for an in vivo demonstration of the reduction of biofilm
      formation in TCVCs locked with taurolock compared with TCVCs locked with heparin.
