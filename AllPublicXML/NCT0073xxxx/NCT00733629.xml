  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hereditary Haemorrhagic Telangiectasia (HHT, also known as Osler-Weber-Rendu Syndrome) is an
      disease that leads to the development of dilated and fragile blood vessels. We propose to
      culture endothelial cells from patients with HHT, to culture cells that express the proteins
      mutated in HHT, namely endoglin and ALK-1. We will study the properties of these cells which
      will involve their growth in different conditions and anticipate that DNA, mRNA and proteins
      will be extracted from these cells for study of cell responses and association with
      expression levels of endoglin and ALK-1. We hypothesize that these cells which express
      &quot;half-normal&quot; endoglin or ALK-1 will show altered protein synthetic differences when compared
      to normal white blood cells. We anticipate that that these findings may help to explain
      aspects of the HHT disease phenotype.
