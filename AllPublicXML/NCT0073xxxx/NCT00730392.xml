      The investigators hypothesized that the administration of Etanercept to children newly
      diagnosed with T1DM may be able to interdict the progression of T1DM. The aim of this study
      is to evaluate the feasibility and safety of Etanercept administration to pediatric patients
      recently diagnosed with type 1 DM.
