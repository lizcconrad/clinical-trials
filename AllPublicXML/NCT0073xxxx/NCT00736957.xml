      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of tramadol hydrochloride
      plus acetaminophen (JNS013) with long term administration in participants with chronic pain.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label (both physician and participant know the name of the study drug),
      non-randomized, multicenter (when more than one hospital or medical school team work on a
      medical research study) and long-term efficacy and safety study of JNS013 (combination of
      tramadol hydrochloride (TRAM) with acetaminophen [APAP]) in participants with chronic pain
      (aching sensation that persists for more than a few months. It may or may not be associated
      with trauma or disease, and may persist after the initial injury has healed. Its
      localization, character, and timing are more vague than with acute pain). This study consists
      of 4 periods; screening period: 1 week, treatment period I: 4 weeks, treatment period II: 48
      weeks and follow-up period: 1 week. During Treatment Period I, restrictions on concomitant
      treatments will be established and the participants will be treated with one or two tablets
      of JNS013, four times daily for four weeks. During Treatment Period II, the participants will
      be treated for 48 weeks using the same dosing method and dose level for JNS013 as was used
      during Treatment Period I, permitting modifications to the concomitant drugs/therapies as
      during normal medical care. Throughout both Treatment Period I and Treatment Period II, the
      decision will be made to permit the participants to select to use either one or two tablets
      of JNS013 per dose according to the extent of the participant's pain and tolerability. The
      total duration of treatment period will be of 52 weeks. Efficacy will be assessed using
      change from baseline in Visual Analogue Scale for pain (VAS24) score at the pre-defined time
      point until Week 52. Participants safety will be monitored throughout the study.

    <description>Pain over the last 24 hours was assessed by using VAS score ranges from 0 millimeter (mm)=no pain to 100 mm=worst possible pain. An increase in score from baseline represented disease progression and decrease represented improvement.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 52</time_frame>

    <measure>Number of Participants With Improvement From Baseline in VAS24 Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 4 and 52</time_frame>
    <description>Pain over the last 24 hours was assessed by using VAS score ranges from 0 mm=no pain to 100 mm=worst possible pain. An increase in score from baseline represented disease progression and decrease represented improvement.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Pain Intensity Difference (PID) at Week 4</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 4</time_frame>
    <description>PID is defined as the amount of change in the pain intensity at each evaluation time point (at 2 and 4 hours after the study drug dosing) from the baseline for each participant. Pain Intensity was evaluated on a 4-stage scale ranging from 3=severe pain to 0=no pain. PID ranges from -3 (the worst) to +3 (the most improved).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Pain Relief (PAR) Score at Week 4</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 4</time_frame>
    <description>Pain relief was evaluated based on a 5-stage scale from 4 (complete relief) to 0 (no relief). An increase in score represented improvement and decrease represented disease progression</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Pain Relief Combined With Pain Intensity Difference (PRID) at Week 4</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 4</time_frame>
    <description>PRID was sum of the PID and PAR for each participant at each evaluation time point (2 hours after dosing, 4 hours after dosing). Pain Intensity was evaluated on a 4-stage scale ranges from 3=severe pain to 0=no pain and PID ranges from -3 (the worst) to +3 (the most improved). PAR ranges from 0 (no improved) to +4 (the most improved). PRID ranges from -3 (the worst) to +7 (the most improved).</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in Short Form-36 (SF-36) Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 4 and 52</time_frame>
    <description>SF-36 is a metric for general health and Quality of Life (QOL), consists of 8 sub-scale indices related to health and QOL (physical functioning, role-physical, bodily pain, general health, vitality, social functioning, role-emotional, mental health). Each of the sub-scale scores ranged from 0 to 100, where higher values indicate a better health status or a better mental status.</description>

        <description>PRID was sum of the PID and PAR for each participant at each evaluation time point (2 hours after dosing, 4 hours after dosing). Pain Intensity was evaluated on a 4-stage scale ranges from 3=severe pain to 0=no pain and PID ranges from -3 (the worst) to +3 (the most improved). PAR ranges from 0 (no improved) to +4 (the most improved). PRID ranges from -3 (the worst) to +7 (the most improved).</description>

Participants showing a Pain Intensity (PI) value of 0 prior to dosing at each evaluation time point were not included in the analysis.</population>
