    <textblock>
      phase 2 study. Target disease: Crohn's disease.

      Rational and relevance to IBD patients:

      Copaxone is known for its high safety profile and for acting as an effective immunomodulatory
      agent for the treatment of MS. . In experimental models of IBD, a beneficial effect of
      Copaxone was demonstrated where significant amelioration of macroscopic colonic damage,
      preservation of the microscopic colonic structure, reduced weight loss, and improved
      long-term survival in treated compared with untreated mice was demonstrated. In addition,
      Copaxone suppressed the proliferation of local mesenteric lymphocytes to syngeneic colon
      extract, significantly reduced the overall secretion of TNF-α and induced the secretion of
      transforming growth factor (TGF)-β. The ability of Copaxone to effectively modulate the
      clinical manifestations and the detrimental immune response involved in experimental colitis,
      together with its high safety profile support its potential effect as a new treatment for CD.

      Patients: patients with moderately active Crohn's disease as indicated by a CDAI 220 - 450,
      whose diagnosis was done more than 3 months before enrollment.

      Study objectives: to test the efficacy and safety of Copaxone in CD patients.

      Study design: This will be a single center, randomized, double blind placebo controlled phase
      2 study.

      Subjects will be assessed for study eligibility 1 to 2 weeks prior to baseline Eligible
      patients will be enrolled into the study after signing an informed consent form and allocated
      in a 1.5:1 ratio to receive either Copaxone or placebo. A total of 50 patients will be
      recruited.

      Subcutaneous injections (Copaxone or Placebo) will be administered daily through week 12.
      Patient assessment of safety and efficacy will be made at weeks 0,4,8,12 and 16.

      At week 12 non-responders would be offered an open label arm with daily Copaxone 20mg for the
      next 12 weeks

      Data evaluation: Evidence of therapeutic benefit and safety will be evaluated by the
      following assessments:

      Clinical assessments:

        -  Crohn's disease activity will be assessed by components of the CDAI.

        -  Mucosal healing will be assessed by VCE (data will be quantitated using the Lewis
           score). Patients requiring colonoscopy according to Physicians decision would also be
           offered to participate in an endoscopic mucosal healing evaluation substudy. Patients
           participating will undergo colonoscopy and biopsies at the beginning (screening±1 week)
           and the end (week 12±1 week) of the treatment period. Endoscopic damage will be assessed
           using the CDEIS

        -  Mean (median) doses of corticosteroids and the average total aggregate dose of
           corticosteroids received per patient during the trial will be assessed.

        -  Quality of life will be assessed by components of the Inflammatory Bowel Disease
           Questionnaire(IBDQ).

      Safety:

        -  AE incidence

        -  Physical examination

        -  Clinical laboratory values

        -  Vital signs

      Tolerability and Safety:

        -  Adverse events, dropout rate will be registered.

        -  Proportion of subjects who prematurely discontinue the study.

        -  Proportion of subjects who prematurely discontinue the study due to Aes

        -  Time to premature discontinuation

        -  Time to premature discontinuation due to Aes.

      Immunologic assessment (including lymphocyte proliferation and cytokine secretion assays)
      will be performed at the baseline visit as well as weeks 4 and 12 and 16. Serum samples for
      cytokine studies 24 hours after first injection would also be collected.
