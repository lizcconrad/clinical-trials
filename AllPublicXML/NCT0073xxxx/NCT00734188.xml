    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, dose-escalation study to determine the safety, maximum tolerated dose
      (MTD) and dose-limiting toxicities (DLT) of 188Re-PTI-6D2 in patients with metastatic
      melanoma.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with confirmed Stage III (unresectable) or Stage IV melanoma who meet all
      eligibility criteria will undergo thorough physical examination and baseline tumor imaging to
      document baseline tumor measurements. Patients will be allowed to check in to the study
      center either the evening prior to dosing (Study Day 0) or the day of dosing (Study Day 1)
      based upon the principal investigators (PIs) discretion. All patients will be dosed and
      monitored as inpatients during the study.

      Patients will receive an intravenous (IV) infusion of 188Re-PTI-6D2. Patients will undergo
      serial gamma scans at specified time points. Blood samples will be obtained prior to dosing
      and at specified intervals for PK measurements of the mAb as well as for measurement of serum
      radioactivity. Urine will be collected to measure excreted radioactivity. Patients will be
      closely monitored for safety throughout the duration of the study. Patients will remain at
      the study center for 48-72 hours after infusion of the radiolabeled dose to allow adequate
      time for post-treatment safety observation and rhenium decay. No investigational or
      commercial agents or therapies other than the study agent may be administered with the intent
      to treat the patient's malignancy during the inpatient treatment period.

      After three evaluable patients have been followed for a minimum of 2-6 weeks after
      188Re-PTI-6D2 infusion, the Principal Investigator and the PTI Medical Monitor will review
      safety data for patients at the current dose level. If there is no evidence of a
      dose-limiting toxicity, the dose of 188Re-PTI-6D2 will be escalated for the next cohort of
      patients. Dose escalation of 188Re-PTI-6D2 will occur according to the following titration
      scheme:

      Level 1 = 20-30 mCi 188Re-PTI-6D2 / 10 - 50 mg of antibody

      Level 2 = 40-60 mCi 188Re-PTI-6D2 / 10 - 50 mg of antibody

      Level 3 = 75-100 mCi 188Re-PTI-6D2 / 50 - 100 mg of antibody

      Level 4 = 125-150 mCi 188Re-PTI-6D2 / 50 - 100 mg of antibody

      Level 5 = 175-200 mCi 188Re-PTI-6D2 / 50 - 100 mg of antibody

      Dose-limiting toxicity will be defined as the following: Grade 4 hematological toxicity; ≥
      Grade 3 non-hematological toxicity; or any adverse event that results in permanent
      discontinuation of the infusion. If at any time Grade 5 toxicity is observed, accrual will be
      suspended until further review. If 0 out of 3 patients experience DLT, the next cohort of 3
      patients will be enrolled at the next dose level. If 1 out of 3 patients experience a
      dose-limiting toxicity, an additional three evaluable patients will be enrolled at the
      current dose level.

      Dose escalation occurs until the maximum tolerated dose is determined. The MTD is defined as
      the dose preceding the dose at which 2 of 3 or 2 of 6 patients experience DLT.

      Safety will be evaluated by vital signs (blood pressure, heart rate, respiratory rate and
      temperature), physical examinations, electrocardiograms (EKGs), clinical laboratory tests and
      adverse event monitoring. Laboratory studies will include hematology, chemistry and
      urinalysis at baseline, at the end of the inpatient treatment period, and at 2 weeks and 6
      weeks after the infusion of the 188Re-PTI-6D2 dose. If hematological recovery has not
      occurred by week 6, patients will follow-up monthly until hematological recovery. In
      addition, thyroid function tests will be performed at baseline and at 6 weeks after infusion;
      then monthly until recovery (if has not occurred). Human anti-murine antibodies (HAMA) will
      be measured at baseline, 2 weeks, and 6 weeks after infusion .

      Biodistribution of 188Re-PTI-6D2 will be evaluated by whole body imaging with a gamma camera
      immediately after infusion (0 - 2 hrs.), at 2.5 - 5 hours, at 6 - 8 hours, and 24 hours
      post-infusion. Whole body imaging at 48 and 72 hours post-infusion may be conducted at the
      discretion of the PI. Urine will be collected to measure cumulative radioactivity excretion
      up to 48-72 hours post-infusion (depending on the hospital discharge date). Pharmacokinetics
      of the mAb and radioactivity will be determined from blood samples taken through 48-72 hours
      post-infusion (depending on the hospital discharge date). Dosimetry calculations will be
      performed to determine estimated absorbed radiation doses to critical organs and to tumor.

      Patients will be discharged from the study unit 48-72 hours after infusion with 188Re-PTI-6D2
      or later as determined by the Investigator's clinical judgment. Patients will be required to
      return for post-treatment follow-up visits approximately 2 and 6 weeks (± two days) after
      infusion for safety monitoring. Ongoing follow-up visits will continue until disease
      progression every 4 weeks. Tumor measurements will be performed at baseline, and all
      follow-up visits to assess for tumor response. Patients with unacceptable adverse events will
      have events followed until resolution.
