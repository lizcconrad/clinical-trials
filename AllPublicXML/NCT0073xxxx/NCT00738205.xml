  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an international, multicenter study involving children treated with Saizen®, a growth
      hormone, who will be trained to use easypod, a new electronic injector and will complete a
      questionnaire after 12 week of use.

      Both children naïve to growth hormone and dissatisfied with their current injection device
      will be recruited.

      An international, multicenter cross-sectional study (Observatoire des pratiques médicales®)
      involving a cohort of children treated with Saizen®, a growth hormone.

      The study does not require any changes to the usual medical management of these patients and
      should not be considered detrimental to their physical or psychological integrity. No
      specific procedures or examinations will be requested, nor does the protocol require any
      particular treatment or follow-up visits.

        Overall, 834 children using the electronic auto-injector were recruited. Of these, 824
        children were included in the evaluable population. Of the 824 evaluable children, 601 were
        treatment-naïve and 223 were treatment-experienced.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Already treated patients who are dissatisfied with their current self-injection
             device, or naïve pediatric patients, in cases for which this indication is validated
             (growth hormone deficiency, Turner's syndrome, chronic renal failure,
             small-for-gestational age [SGA] patients, based on RCP)

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Cases in which Saizen® is contra-indicated (based on local RCP)

          -  Children returning for consultation, who have not brought back their Easypod™
             electronic self-injector.

          -  Children who are participating in a therapeutic trial, or who have done so in the
             3-month period preceding their recruitment into this observational study
