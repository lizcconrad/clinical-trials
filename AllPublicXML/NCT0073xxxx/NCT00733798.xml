    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of 131I-TM601 in the
      treatment of adult patients with progressive and/or recurrent malignant melanoma.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a multi-center, Phase 1/2 study evaluating the use of multiple intravenous doses of
      131I-TM601 in adults patients with progressive and/or recurrent malignant melanoma (Stage
      IIIc or IV) with measurable disease who have failed first line/standard therapy.

      The study will be conducted in 2 phases. During the first, Dose Escalation Phase, eligible
      patients wil be assigned in groups of 3-6 (depending upon the treatment response seen at each
      dose) to dose cohorts of between 2-5 weekly IV doses of 131I-TM601. Escalation to the next
      highest dose during the Dose Escalation Phase will be dependent upon demonstrated tolerance
      in the previous dosing group. In the second, Efficacy Phase, all patients will be treated
      with the Maximum Tolerated Dose determined in the Dose Escalation Phase.

      Prior to initiating treatment, all patients will be administered a single imaging dose of
      131I-TM601, IV, as an Imaging Dose to evaluate tumor uptake. Only patients demonstrating
      tumor uptake will remain on the study.

      Patients in both study phases will have safety parameters evaluated continuously throughout
      the study. Clinical response to 131I-TM601 will be assessed in each study patient at 28 days
      following the final study dose, and then at 2-month intervals, starting at 3 months following
      the first study dose (during the first year of follow-up), and finally at 3-month intervals
      thereafter until disease progression.

    <description>After a single 20mCi/0.4 mg Imaging Dose of 131I-TM601, patients in the Dose Escalation Phase will be administered between 2-5 weekly doses of 131I-TM601 at 1.2 mCi/kg of lean body mass (specific activity of 131I-TM601 will be maintained at 50 mCi 131I/mg TM601 for all doses administered in this study.) Patients in the Efficacy Phase of the study will be treated at the Maximum Tolerated Dose established in the Dose Escalation Phase.</description>

             progression during or following the most recent prior melanoma therapy.

          4. Have measurable disease, defined as lesions that can be accurately measured in at
             least one dimension as &gt; 20 mm with conventional techniques (CT) or &gt; 10 mm with
             spiral CT scan or brain MRI.

          5. Have failed at least 1 prior therapy for melanoma or refused first-line, standard
             therapy.

          6. Have an ECOG performance status of 0 - 1.

          7. Have a life expectancy, based on the Investigator's judgment, of &gt; 3 months.

          8. On screening ECG, have a QTc interval of &lt; 450 ms.

             Imaging Dose.

         10. Have recovered from the toxicity of all previous therapy prior to enrollment. If the
             patient has undergone recent major surgery, an interval of at least 3 weeks must have

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Patient May Not:

             ability of the patient to receive the treatment outlined in this protocol with
             reasonable safety. Examples of medical illnesses include, but are not limited to, the
             following: uncontrolled hypertension, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable
             angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, known history of HIV, Hepatitis B or Hepatitis C
             infection, or psychiatric illness/social situation which would limit compliance with
             study requirements.

          2. Have CNS metastases, unless, in the PI's judgment, the CNS involvement is stable and
             not likely to require further palliative therapy to the CNS during the course of the
             treatment protocol. If previous treatment has included radiotherapy, CNS disease
             should be stable at least 6 weeks from receipt of previous radiotherapy.

          3. Have a prior malignancy with less than 3-year disease-free interval, except for

             (Imaging Dose).

          5. Have previously received radiation to ≥ 25% red bone marrow.

          6. Have received any cytotoxic chemotherapy, hormonal therapy, or immunotherapy, whether
             conventional or investigational, &lt; 4 weeks prior to receiving the first study drug

             six months of study enrollment.

             = 81 mg/day, low-dose warfarin &lt; 1 mg/day, or low-dose heparin for IV catheter patency
             is allowed).
