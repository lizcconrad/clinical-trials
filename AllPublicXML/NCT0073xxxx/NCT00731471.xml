    <textblock>
      This is an open Phase I study of a candidate TB vaccine, MVA85A, in healthy subjects who are
      infected with HIV. It is designed to study the safety and immunogenicity of the vaccine.

    <textblock>
      This study is designed to evaluate the safety of MVA85A in healthy volunteers in Senegal who
      are infected with HIV. In phase I studies, a single vaccination with MVA85A, when
      administered at a dose of 5 x 107pfu intradermally, has been shown to be safe in both
      mycobacterially naïve individuals, those previously vaccinated with BCG and latently infected
      individuals. We will use 1 x 10^8 pfu MVA85A intradermally in this study. A trial in BCG
      vaccinated subjects showed that the higher dose (1 x 10^8 pfu MVA85A) induced a significantly
      higher immune response but did not have a higher AE profile. In addition, because of a
      variable immune response, the trial in HIV positive subjects in the UK is split into two
      groups, the first getting 5 x 10^7 pfu and the second getting 1 x 10^8 pfu MVA85A. It has,
      therefore, been decided to use the higher dose in order to maximise the immune response
      whilst maintaining a good safety profile.

          -  Willingness to allow the investigators to discuss the volunteer's medical history with
             the volunteer's HIV lead physician

          -  Willing to use effective contraception throughout duration of study (if female)

          -  Arm 2: Undetectable HIV viral load

          -  Written informed consent

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Any clinically significant abnormal finding on screening biochemistry or haematology
             blood tests or on urinalysis

          -  Group 1 only: Any ARV therapy within the past 6 months

          -  Previous history of TB disease and/or treatment

          -  Any AIDS defining illness

          -  Group 1: CD4 count nadir &lt;300

          -  Group 2: CD4 count nadir &lt;100

          -  CXR showing TB or evidence of other active infection
