    <textblock>
      The purpose of this clinical research study is to learn if BMS-512148 (Dapagliflozin) can
      help reduce the blood sugar levels in subjects with Type 2 Diabetes who are not well
      controlled on diet and exercise alone. The safety of this treatment will also be studied

    <measure>Adjusted Mean Change From Baseline in Hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) at Week 24 Last Observation Carried Forward (LOCF) - All Randomized Participants</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Day 1), Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>Adjusted mean change in HbA1c from baseline at Week 24, or the last post-baseline measurement prior to Week 24 if no Week 24 assessment was available was determined(LOCF). HbA1c was measured as percent of hemoglobin by a central laboratory. Data after rescue medication (metformin) was excluded from this analysis. Baseline was defined as the last assessment prior to the start date and time of the first dose of the double-blind study medication. In cases where time of the first dose or time of the assessment was not available, baseline was defined as the last assessment on or prior to the date of the first dose of the double-blind study medication. HbA1c values were obtained at enrollment, lead-in, and at Day 1, Weeks 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, and 24 in the double-blind period.</description>

    <measure>Adjusted Mean Change From Baseline in Effect on 2-hour Post Liquid Meal Glucose at Week 24 (LOCF) - Randomized Participants</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Day 1), Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>Liquid meal tolerance tests (MTTs) were scheduled to occur at Day 1 visit (MTT was to be completed 2 hours prior to first dose of treatment) and at Week 24 / End of treatment visit, or Rescue visit for participants meeting criteria for rescue due to lack of glycemic control. At Week 24, study treatment was given 1 hour before MTT was administered. Participant fasted for at least 10 hours (h) prior to both visits and abstained from tobacco, alcohol, and caffeine for 24 h prior to the MTT. The liquid meal supplement was administered over 10 minutes, starting immediately after Time 0 blood sample was drawn. Blood samples for post-liquid meal Glucose were obtained at 30, 60, 120, and 180 minutes after ingesting the liquid supplement. Glucose was measured in milligrams per deciliter (mg/dL) by a central laboratory. Baseline was defined as the last assessment prior to the start date and time of the first dose of double-blind study medication.</description>

        <description>Adjusted mean change in HbA1c from baseline at Week 24, or the last post-baseline measurement prior to Week 24 if no Week 24 assessment was available was determined(LOCF). HbA1c was measured as percent of hemoglobin by a central laboratory. Data after rescue medication (metformin) was excluded from this analysis. Baseline was defined as the last assessment prior to the start date and time of the first dose of the double-blind study medication. In cases where time of the first dose or time of the assessment was not available, baseline was defined as the last assessment on or prior to the date of the first dose of the double-blind study medication. HbA1c values were obtained at enrollment, lead-in, and at Day 1, Weeks 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, and 24 in the double-blind period.</description>

          <description>Adjusted mean change in total body weight from baseline at Week 24, or the last post-baseline measurement prior to Week 24 if no Week 24 assessment was available LOCF was determined. Data after rescue medication (metformin) was excluded from this analysis. Baseline was defined as the last assessment prior to the start date and time of the first dose of the double-blind study medication. In cases where time of the first dose or time of the assessment was not available, baseline was defined as the last assessment on or prior to the date of the first dose of the double-blind study medication. Body weight was measured in kilograms (kg) at qualification, lead-in, Day 1, Weeks 1, 2, 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, and 24 during double-blind period.</description>

At Week 24, study treatment was given 1 hour before MTT was administered. Participant fasted for at least 10 hours (h) prior to both visits and abstained from tobacco, alcohol, and caffeine for 24 h prior to the MTT. The liquid meal supplement was administered over 10 minutes, starting immediately after Time 0 blood sample was drawn. Blood samples for post-liquid meal Glucose were obtained at 30, 60, 120, and 180 minutes after ingesting the liquid supplement. Glucose was measured in milligrams per deciliter (mg/dL) by a central laboratory.

        <title>Mean Change From Baseline in Seated Systolic and Diastolic Blood Pressure at Week 24, Including Data After Rescue - Treated Participants</title>
        <description>Blood pressure values were obtained on Day 1, Weeks 1, 2, 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, and 24 in the double blind period, after the participant was seated for quietly for 5 minutes; the same arm (right or left) was used consistently through out the study. Measurements were taken at least 10 hours after the last ingestion of caffeine, alcohol, or nicotine. Blood pressure was measured in millimeters of mercury (mmHg). Data after rescue were also included. Baseline was defined as the last assessment prior to the start date and time of the first dose of the double-blind study medication. In cases where time of the first dose or time of the assessment was not available, baseline was defined as the last assessment on or prior to the date of the first dose of the double-blind study medication.</description>

        <title>Number of Participants With Marked Laboratory Abnormalities in 24 Week Double Blind Treatment Period - Treated Participants</title>
        <description>Safety laboratory measurements were obtained at Day 1, Weeks 1, 2, 4, 8, 12, 20, and 24 in the double blind Period. Baseline was defined as the last assessment prior to the start of the first dose of the double-blind study medication.
