    <textblock>
      Pyoderma gangrenosum (PG) is an uncommon dermatosis that consists of nodules and pustules
      that ulcerate. PG can occur anywhere on the body. Lesions often progress in size and may be
      multiple. There is no universally accepted treatment for PG. In mild disease, therapy
      consists of local wound care and topical or intralesional corticosteroids. For more severe
      disease, systemic agents are necessary. Systemic corticosteroids are often effective, but
      large doses are required leading to serious long-term side effects. Other immunosuppressives
      have been reported to be successful in individual case reports and small case series.
      However, they too are associated with significant toxicities.

      Infliximab is an antibody directed against TNF-α. It had been used in success for treatment
      of PG. Adalimumab (Humira) is a fully human antibody directed against TNF-α. Given that
      adalimumab has the same target as infliximab, one would expect that adalimumab may also be
      effective in the treatment of PG. Treatment with adalimumab may be advantageous over
      infliximab because it can be given at home, whereas infliximab is delivered intravenously in
      the office. Additionally, because adalimumab is fully human, patients would be less likely to
      form antibodies against the medication. Purpose of this study is to determine the safety and
      efficacy of Humira in the treatment of pyoderma gangrenosum.
