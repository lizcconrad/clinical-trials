      given to adults with HPP.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Asfotase alfa was formerly referred to as ENB-0040

      Hypophosphatasia (HPP) is a life-threatening, genetic, and ultra-rare metabolic disease
      characterized by defective bone mineralization and impaired phosphate and calcium regulation
      that can lead to progressive damage to multiple vital organs, including destruction and
      deformity of bones, profound muscle weakness, seizures, impaired renal function, and
      respiratory failure. There are no approved disease-modifying treatments for patients with
      this disease. There is also limited data available on the natural course of this disease over
      time, particularly in patients with the juvenile-onset form.

    <description>Cohort 2 will begin when the safety and PK data for Cohort 1 weeks 1-4 has been reviewed by the DSMB. Cohort 2 will enroll 3 HPP patients and will receive a higher dose level than Cohort 1. Cohort 2 patients will have a single IV dose and three weekly SC doses of Asfotase Alfa .

    <description>The initial IV dose to be administered to patients was set at one-tenth the no adverse effect level (NOAEL) as determined by one month toxicology studies in animals in which Asfotase Alfa was administered as a single weekly IV dose. The SC doses to be administered are lower than the IV doses and are thought to be near or at the anticipated daily efficacious dose. Dosing will be as follows:
Cohort 1: In Week 1, patients will receive an IV infusion of Asfotase Alfa at a dose of 3 mg/kg. In Weeks 2, 3 and 4, patients will receive weekly SC injections of Asfotase Alfa at a dose of 1 mg/kg SC.</description>
