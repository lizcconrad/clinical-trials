          -  Healthy subjects who are capable of being vaccinated and subjects with primary
             diseases (cardiovascular conditions, metabolic conditions such as diabetes mellitus,
             respiratory diseases) who are capable of being vaccinated and aged over 18 years who
             want to be vaccinated against influenza or for whom the doctor considers prophylactic
             influenza immunisation to be indicated.

             preferred.

          -  Written consent to vaccination must be available after the subjects have been briefed
             on the study in understandable language.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Use of study or unlicensed medication or administration of a vaccine other than the
             study vaccine within 30 days preceding vaccination and/or during the study period

          -  Acute disease at the beginning of the study

          -  Acute clinically significant changes in the lungs, cardiovascular system, liver or
             kidney function, identified by physical examination or laboratory tests

          -  Pregnancy

          -  Women who would like to fall pregnant during the period from the day of vaccination to
             1 month thereafter
