    <textblock>
      This study is an interventional study which was conducted in the field. The investigators
      intended to develop an efficient and economically valuable method which can decrease the risk
      factors for prevention of cardiovascular diseases. Effective control of cardiovascular
      diseases necessitates a salutogenetic approach to develop efficient and cheap methods to
      decrease risk factors.

      In this study, the aim of preparing the Group II training material was to enable the
      individual to see his or her risks as unique, and to proceed with life by adapting personal
      behaviors. Group II's training material was formatted as a prescription. Because giving a
      prescription for a doctor is very important in low socioeconomical group person.

      This study showed that social programs oriented towards individual behavioral changes assume
      an important role in decreasing cardiovascular risk factors.

      Background:

      Effective control of cardiovascular diseases necessitates a salutogenetic approach to develop
      efficient and economical methods to decrease risk factors.

      Methods:

      This study was conducted in three stages in a semi-rural region of Eskisehir, Turkey. In the
      first stage, individuals selected by random sampling were evaluated in terms of
      social-demographic characteristics and the risk factors present for cardiovascular diseases.
      A scale comprised of 19 questions was implemented for data assessment. In the second stage,
      training materials were randomly distributed. Group I's training material consisted of a
      brochure containing pictures and general information on heart disease; Group II members
      additionally received a personalized letter that further explained their individual risk
      factors and suggested measures for increased protection and prevention - in short, Group II's
      training material was formatted as a prescription. In the third stage, the subjects were
      screen against the cardiovascular risks factors one year later to assess and determine if
      there had been any changes in their attitudes towards the dangers of the cardiovascular
      diseases.

    <description>Group I's training material consisted of a brochure with the information we wanted the public to know about heart disease. The brochure had such titles as &quot;Cardiovascular Diseases, let us protect our hearts, the importance of cholesterol in preventing heart diseases, watch out for blood pressure, quit smoking for your health, weight watching, nutrition, food to avoid in cardiovascular disease, an easy method: exercise and exercise control, and an appropriate body weight vs. height chart for adults&quot;</description>

    <description>The Group II training material document was a letter in the form of a prescription in which the individual was addressed by name, the risk factors established at the first stage were explained, and the suggested measures for protection from such risk factors were indicated.</description>

    <description>The training materials were randomly distributed to study participant groups. The list of names was systematically divided into two groups: odd-numbered individuals were given brochures only, and even-numbered individuals were given both letters and brochures. Since we could not have prevented an illustrated material to be passed by in a closed environment, it was deemed appropriate to distribute both the letter and brochure instead of just the brochure.</description>
