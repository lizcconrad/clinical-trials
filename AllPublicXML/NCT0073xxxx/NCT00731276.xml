      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as irinotecan, work in different ways to stop the
      growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing.

      PURPOSE: This phase I trial is studying the side effects and best dose of irinotecan in
      treating Asian patients with solid tumors.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  To determine the dose-limiting toxicity and maximum tolerated dose of irinotecan
           hydrochloride according to the genotype status of Asian patients with solid tumors.

      Secondary

        -  To investigate the pharmacokinetics of irinotecan hydrochloride and its metabolites
           SN-38 and SN-38G.

        -  To evaluate time to tumor response, response duration, and time to progression in these
           patients.

      OUTLINE: Patients are stratified according to genotype status (UGT1A1*28 vs UGT1A1*6)

      Patients receive irinotecan hydrochloride IV once weekly for 3 weeks. Treatment repeats every
      4 weeks for up to 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients undergo blood sample collection periodically for pharmacogenetic, pharmacokinetic,
      and pharmacodynamic studies.

    <description>The study has four type of regimens, and dosing of irinotecan depends on genotype of patient.
Four Regimens are:
Weekly Irinotecan (Irinotecan given at day 1, 8 and 15) every four weekly
Weekly Xeliri ( Irinotecan given at day 1, 8 and 15)+ (Xeloda tabs 2000mg/m2 consumed over 14 days) every three weekly
Three-weekly Xeliri (Irinotecan given at day 1 only) + (Xeloda tabs 2000mg/m2 consumed over 14 days) every three weekly
Two-weekly FOLFIRI (Irinotecan given at day 1 only) + (CI Fluorouracil 600mg/m2 over 22hrs, IV Folinic Acid 200mg/m2 over 2hrs and IVP Fluorouracil 400mg/m2) every two weekly</description>
