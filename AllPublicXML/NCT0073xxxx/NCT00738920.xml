  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary goal of the proposed trial is to assess the short- and long-term efficacy of
      cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) for irritable bowel syndrome using two treatment delivery
      systems (self administered, therapist administered). Secondary aims seek to specify the
      conditions under which CBT may (or may not) achieve its effects (moderator questions), why
      and how these effects are achieved (mediator questions) and at what economic cost. Long term
      project goals are to develop an effective self-administered behavioral treatment program that
      can enhance the quality of patient care, improve clinical outcomes, and decrease the economic
      and personal costs of one of the most prevalent and intractable GI disorders.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a chronic, prevalent, often disabling, GI disorder for
      which there is no reliable and satisfactory medical option for its full range of symptoms
      (abdominal pain, bowel dysfunction). An accumulating body of evidence indicates that a
      specific psychosocial treatment called cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is associated with
      significant reductions in IBS symptoms and related difficulties. Despite its apparent
      efficacy, CBT's clinical effectiveness (i.e., its generalizability, feasibility, cost
      effectiveness) has not been adequately established due partly to its duration, cost, and
      limited accessibility. As the &quot;second generation&quot; of IBS treatments undergo development and
      validation, it has become increasingly clear that efficacy demonstration is a necessary but
      not sufficient condition of treatment viability. In a pilot study funded under NIDDK's R03
      mechanism, we addressed these problems by developing a briefer, largely self administered
      version of CBT that requires only 4, 1 hr clinic visits. Our RCT data showed that a 10
      session version of CBT can be translated into a 4 session version without compromising
      patient acceptability or short term efficacy. It is unclear whether treatment effects are
      maintained long term (out to 12 months), due to theoretical change mechanisms (vs.
      nonspecific factors common across different forms of therapy), are more pronounced among
      specific subgroups of patients, or, generalize to a large sample of Rome III diagnosed
      patients treated by different investigative sites. We seek to address these questions by
      conducting a larger, more definitive, multisite RCT that will recruit from 2 treatment sites
      480 patients with moderate to severe IBS and assess their acute and long term response to
      brief (4 session) CBT, extended (10 session) CBT, or a credible education/support condition.
      We will use the first year to develop a clinical infrastructure to ensure the success and
      integrity of the proposed trial. In the short term, a successful trial will lend empirical
      validation to a self administered version of CBT that retains the efficacy of standard CBT
      but is more transportable, accessible to patients outside of research protocols, and less
      costly to deliver. In the long term, we hope to show that a self guided behavioral treatment
      program is an effective and efficient treatment delivery system that can enhance the quality
      of patient care, improve clinical outcomes, and decrease the economic and personal costs of
      one of the most prevalent and intractable GI disorders.

             days per week);

          -  Ability to understand and provide informed consent;

          -  With the exception of antibiotics, participant is willing to remain on a stable dose
             only through the 4-week pretreatment baseline period prior to randomization;

          -  Participant either not taking medications or if taking medications willing to suspend
             starting any new medications only during the initial 4-week pretreatment baseline
             period;

          -  Participant demonstrates an ability to speak understand and read, English a the sixth
             grade level or higher;

          -  Willingness to be randomized to CBT or Support/Education to which s/he has been
             assigned to to adhere to protocol requirements;

          -  Participant is willing to attend regularly scheduled therapy session during active
             phase of the trial;

          -  Participant is willing to be contacted and scheduled for follow-up assessment at week
             12 and 3, 6, 9, and 12 months after the conclusion of acute treatment phase;

          -  Participant is willing and able to enter symptom information into an assigned portable
             computer and complete questionnaires through treatment and at regularly scheduled
             follow ups

          -  Participant has access to a telephone; and

          -  Participant is willing and able to provide adequate information for locator purposes.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Evidence of current structural or biochemical abnormalities or medication use that
             better explain the participant's IBS symptoms (e.g. IBD);

          -  Evidence of a current infection or infection of any type within the 2 weeks prior to
             the study gastroenterologists' evaluation which would obscure the presentation of IBS
             symptoms. In such cases the baseline can be delayed until 2 weeks after complete
             recovery.

          -  Participant has received antibiotics (e.g. rifaximin and or neomycin) specifically
             targeted to treat IBS symptoms within the past 3 months. In this instance eligibility
             will be suspended for 12 weeks from the initial date the antibiotic was consumed.

          -  Participant has undergone previous abdominal surgery that would have caused
             significant alternation of the anatomy/physiology of the digestive/GI tract, which
             adequately explains GI symptoms;

             the exception of localized basal or squamous cell carcinomas of the skin;

             foreseeable treatment needs (e.g., hospitalization, conflicting physician visits)
             would realistically interfere with study demands (e.g., consistent attendance at
             treatment sessions and/or ability to participate in telephone interventions) or may
             affect the interpretation of clinical efficacy data;

          -  Participant has a major psychiatric disorder, which in the opinion of the senior
             clinical staff may impede conduct of the clinical trial. These disorders include but
             are not limited to major depression diagnosis with a high risk of suicidal behavior
             (i.e. intent or plan), alcohol or substance abuse/dependence within the past year, a
             lifetime history of schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder or gross cognitive
             impairments;

          -  Participant has other conditions which in the opinion of the senior clinical staff
             would influence negatively the conduct of the clinical trial;

          -  Participant is currently receiving targeted psychotherapy for IBS and is unwilling or
             unable to discontinue his/her treatment for the acute treatment phase of this study;
