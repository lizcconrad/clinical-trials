      The secondary objective of this investigation is to evaluate the long-term survivorship and
      performance of the LCS Complete mobile-bearing total knee system and surgical instrumentation
      using the American Knee Society Score (AKS) the Oxford Knee Score (OKS), SF-12 and
      survivorship analysis.
