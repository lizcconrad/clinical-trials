      The objectives of this study are to determine the clinical performance of zirconia-based
      dental prostheses and their related properties.

    <textblock>
      Zirconia has been used in dentistry since 2000 for constructing fixed partial denture. Its
      advantages are high fracture resistance, excellent biocompatibility, moderate opacity, etc.
      Because the increase in demand for more esthetic restoration, zirconia becomes more popular
      for use as a core material for all-ceramic systems. Its properties have been investigated
      extensively in many in vitro studies. However, clinical performance of zirconia-based
      restorations would require a period of time before the results can be assessed. Currently,
      there are not much results regarding clinical performance of zirconia-based prosthesis and
      more information are required for future research.
