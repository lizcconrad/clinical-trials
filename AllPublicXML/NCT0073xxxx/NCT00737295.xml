  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, non-randomized study of 50 people with suspected biliary dyskinesia.
      The purpose of this study is to investigate if it is possible to use ultrasound to make a
      diagnosis of a condition called biliary dyskinesia. The investigators null hypothesis is that
      there will be no statistical difference between the proposed experimental test (Ultrasound)
      and the HIDA scan (a nuclear medicine hepatobiliary system scan) in the diagnosis of biliary
      dyskinesia.

    <description>All subjects, whether they participate in this study or not, will undergo the HIDA scan as this is the accepted standard of care for diagnosing biliary dyskinesia. If a given subject agrees to participate in this study, he/she will be asked to undergo the following study procedures:
If a pregnancy test has not already been done, a urine pregnancy test will be done for women of childbearing potential.
An intravenous line (IV) will be inserted (if not already in place), and a standard dose of CCK (Kinevac®- 0.02 µg/kg) will then be injected according to the package insert. Ultrasound will be used to measure dimensions of the gallbladder (length, width and height) every minute for 35 minutes following injection of the CCK. This will be done by applying ultrasound jelly to the upper part of the abdomen and ultrasound probe will be used to obtain optimal images for three dimensional analysis of the subject's gallbladder.</description>
