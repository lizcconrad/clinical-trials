    <textblock>
      Warfarin is a medication typically referred to as a blood thinner and is used to prevent the
      formation of blood clots, and hence prevent life-threatening events such as strokes and clots
      on the lungs (known as pulmonary emboli). This therapy is only safe and effective if the
      degree of blood thinning is kept within a narrow window - if the blood is &quot;too thick&quot; clots
      may form but if the blood is &quot;too thin&quot; the risk of bleeding increases. Complicating the
      control of warfarin is that different people require different amounts of it to have an
      appropriate degree of blood thinning, and once this amount is determined for a patient, it
      may be changed by factors that are encountered on a daily basis (i.e., diet, acute and
      chronic diseases, alcohol, medications, etc.). As such, regular monitoring is necessary to
      confer the benefits of this medication. Our Anticoagulation Management Service (AMS) has
      demonstrated really good control of blood thinning therapy by working with patients to inform
      them of the rationale for this medicine, the factors having the ability to impact its
      control, and encouraging the patient to be involved in their care (via provision of tools to
      document test results, one-on-one education and access to our program at any time with
      questions, etc.) Currently, our AMS has to limit the volume of patients seen due to resource
      limitations. As such, it is imperative that we investigate alternate strategies to manage
      these patients. Paramount, however, is that any long-term strategy must not confer inferior
      control of warfarin. The purpose of this study is to determine if the impact of AMS Care is
      sustained following the transfer of anticoagulation management to the family doctor.
      Operationally, the results of this study will guide future management of patients. If control
      of warfarin therapy declines with family doctor management, alternate strategies, such as
      patient self-management, will need to be investigated in a larger scale trial.
