    <description>The study will start with AZD8055 formulated in a liquid solution prior to the tablet formulation becoming available. The tablet formulation will be introduced in Part A at the beginning of a new cohort at an appropriate dose, no higher than the dose of the liquid formulation in the last completed evaluated cohort. Oral solution or tablet, single dose on Day 1 Part A, twice daily ascending dosing from day 8 onwards (until maximum tolerated dose is reached), cycles of 28 days treatment.</description>
