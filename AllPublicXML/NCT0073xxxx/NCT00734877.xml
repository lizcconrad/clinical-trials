  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Toward improving the therapeutic index of standard TT3 (S-TT3), the investigators will employ
      a randomized Phase III trial design to determine whether S-TT3 treatment-related toxicities
      can be reduced by 50% in TT3-Lite (L-TT3).

      Note: Randomization has been discontinued and accrual is closed to the L-TT3 arm. This trial
      is currently enrolling as a single-arm trial for patients to receive S-TT3.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The major treatment-related toxicities in TT3 pertained to the high-dose melphalan 200mg/m2
      (MEL200)-based tandem transplant approach, consisting of mucosal and other toxicities.

      For the TT4 trial, we are proposing to compare standard TT3 (S-TT3) to TT3-Lite (L-TT3).
      L-TT3 will employ various strategies aimed at improving the therapeutic Index of S-TT3 by
      reducing toxicities while maintaining the superior results reported for S-TT3 in terms of
      frequency and duration of CR, EFS, and. The following strategies will be utilized in L-TT3:

        -  Applying only 1 instead of 2 cycles of induction and consolidation therapy prior to and
           after tandem transplant. This is supported by the well known association between prior
           exposure to mucotoxic therapies4, 5 and worse post-transplant mucositis, particularly
           when etoposide is used in the mobilizing regimen6 such as in VDTPACE.

      Note: Randomization has been discontinued and accrual is closed to the L-TT3 arm. This trial
      is currently enrolling as a single-arm trial for patients to receive S-TT3.

             If the patient is unable to complete pulmonary function tests due to MM related pain
             or condition, exception may be granted if the principal investigator documents that
             the patient is a candidate for high dose therapy.

          -  Patients must have signed an IRB-approved informed consent indicating their
             understanding of the proposed treatment and understanding that the protocol has been
             approved by the IRB.

             congestive heart failure, uncontrolled hypertension, or difficult to control cardiac
             arrhythmias.

          -  Evidence of chronic obstructive or chronic restrictive pulmonary disease.

          -  Patients must not have light chain deposition disease or creatinine &gt; 3 mg/dl

             cell skin cancer, in situ cervical cancer, or other cancer for which the patient has
             been disease free for at least three years. Prior malignancy is acceptable provided
             there has been no evidence of disease within the three-year interval or if the
             malignancy is considered much less life threatening than the myeloma.

          -  Pregnant or nursing women may not participate. Women of childbearing potential must
             have a negative pregnancy documented within one week of registration. Women/men of
