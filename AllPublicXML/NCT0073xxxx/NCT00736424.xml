      The purpose of this study is to collect subject data to evaluate the rate of sudden
      unexplained death in epilepsy (SUDEP) with bilateral neurostimulation of the anterior nucleus
      of the thalamus in people diagnosed with refractory epilepsy. The data obtained from the
      physician initiated studies will be pooled with data collected in Medtronic-sponsored studies
      to assess SUDEP risk.

      Medtronic is conducting a pivotal clinical trial entitled Stimulation of the Anterior Nucleus
      of the Thalamus in Epilepsy (SANTÉ). One of the requirements of the SANTÉ study is to
      evaluate the rate of sudden unexplained death in epilepsy (SUDEP). Medtronic is aware of
      approximately 18 subjects with various types of epilepsy that have been treated with
      neurostimulation of the anterior nucleus of the thalamus outside the SANTÉ trial under five
      physician-sponsored studies. This protocol will initially collect information regarding the
      physician-sponsored study subjects' status. The goal of this study is to pool these data with
      the SANTÉ data for the purpose of estimating the SUDEP rate.

      This is a multi-center, retrospective and prospective clinical study in patients previously
      implanted with devices that provide bilateral neurostimulation of the anterior nucleus of the
      thalamus during non-Medtronic-sponsored studies.
