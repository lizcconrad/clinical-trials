    <textblock>
      This clinical trial will study the use of ridaforolimus in metastatic breast cancer subjects
      whose tumors have shown a resistance to trastuzumab (herceptin). The goal of this study is to
      find out if subjects treated with ridaforolimus in combination with trastuzumab have a
      positive response to the treatment, and if treatment with ridaforolimus in combination with
      trastuzumab prolongs survival.
