    <textblock>
      After medication abortion, women may quickly become pregnant again and therefore need an
      effective birth control method right away. Intrauterine devices (IUDs) are very effective for
      preventing pregnancy. IUDs are usually placed more than a month after abortion. This study
      will randomly assign women having a medication abortion to two groups, either having the IUD
      inserted one week after medication abortion or having the IUD inserted more than four weeks
      later. Women will be followed for six months to compare how many return for IUD placement in
      the two groups, how many are using the IUD after six months, experience with pain, bleeding,
      and cramping, how easy or difficult it is to insert the IUD, how many IUDs are expelled or
      removed, and how many women are using any birth control six months after the abortion.

      Women presenting for medication abortion are highly motivated to initiate contraception and
      are also at high risk for repeat pregnancy. Intrauterine devices (IUDs) are among the most
      effective reversible methods. IUD insertion is routinely planned for at least four weeks
      after medication abortion. This leaves women vulnerable to pregnancy while waiting for IUD
      placement, and many will not return for this visit. While immediate IUD insertion after
      surgical abortion is known to be safe and effective, it has not been studied after medication
      abortion.

      This study will recruit women undergoing medication abortion at Special Gynecology Services
      who desire an IUD for contraception. Women will be randomized to two groups: immediate
      insertion of the copper IUD at the routine one week follow up visit, or delayed insertion of
      the copper IUD at least four weeks after the medication abortion.

      The primary objective of this study is to compare six month IUD prevalence between the
      immediate and delayed IUD insertion groups. Secondary outcomes include comparison of IUD
      insertion rates, continuation rates, expulsion and removal rates, and use of any
      contraception at six months. Pain experienced during insertion and provider ease of insertion
      will be recorded. A diary collected for four weeks following medication abortion will reveal
      the impact of early IUD placement on bleeding and cramping. Lastly, we will correlate
      endometrial stripe thickness and IUD position to outcomes of interest: continuation,
      expulsion, and removal rates.

      <recruitment_details>Women presenting to Columbia University's Special Gynecology Services for medication abortion will receive comprehensive contraceptive counseling. Those interested in the Intrauterine Device (IUD) for contraception will be offered study participation. Those who accept enrollment in the study and sign consent will be randomized into 1 of 2 groups.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>For both groups, the routine 1 week follow-up visit will confirm a successful medication abortion by passage of gestational sac on sonogram. Endometrial stripe thickness will be also be noted. For both groups a transvaginal sonogram will be performed immediately after IUD insertion to confirm IUD position.</pre_assignment_details>
