  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Several lines of evidence have suggested that Advanced Glycation End-products (AGEs) play a
      role in the development and progression of heart failure. The AGE-crosslink breaker
      Alagebrium improved cardiac function and symptoms in experimental preclinical and small human
      heart failure studies. These results have not yet been confirmed in a randomized controlled
      clinical trial. Objective: to evaluate the safety and efficacy of alagebrium in subjects
      diagnosed with heart failure. This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial to
      assess the effects of 400 mg (2 x 100 mg bid) of alagebrium versus placebo over 9 months. 100
      subjects will be studied (50 per treatment group) in approximately 6 centers. Procedures:
      exercise testing (VO2 max; the primary variable), ECGs and blood sampling.
