      To better understand surgeon preference when using synthetic, absorbable, monofilament suture
      by comparing two similar appearing FDA-approved sutures, Monosyn (Aesculap) and Monocryl
      (Ethicon).

    <textblock>
      Physicians have used suture to close wounds for at least 4,000 years. Archaeological records
      from ancient Egypt show that Egyptians used linen and animal sinew to close wounds. In
      ancient India, physicians used the pincers of beetles or ants to staple wounds shut. They
      then cut the insects' bodies off, leaving their jaws (staples) in place. Other natural
      materials used to close wounds include flax, hair, grass, cotton, silk, pig bristles, and
      animal gut.

      The fundamental principles of wound closure have changed little over 4,000 years. Successful
      closure of wound involves surgical techniques coupled with knowledge of the physical
      characteristics and handling of the suture and needle. The selection of proper suture
      material in closing any surgical defect is important in wound healing, minimizing infection,
      and achieving optimal cosmetic and functional results.

      A great deal of progress has been made since Egyptian times with regard to suture materials
      and manufacturing processes. Today, sutures are available with a wide variety of
      characteristics, configuration, manipulability, coefficient of friction, solubility,
      strength, and immunogenic properties. Yet, sutures are currently rather crudely classified
      based on a numeric scale according to diameter and tensile strength; descending from 10 to 1,
      and then descending again from 1-0 to 12-0. This study aims to explore the factors that are
      important to a surgeon when choosing sutures via evaluating surgeon preference for two types
      of synthetic, absorbable, monofilament sutures: Monosyn and Monocryl. We hope to initiate a
      more nuanced exploration of how suture characteristics influence surgeon preference, beyond
      filament type and size, and how makers of suture may better report and represent these
      factors.

    <description>Subjects were randomized to Monosyn vs. Monocryl suture arms. The designated skin lesion was removed surgically. The surgical repair of the defect was performed by dividing the wound in half by a single Prolene suture. The appropriate suture was opened by the Study Coordinator and passed sterilely to the surgical technician. The surgical technician loaded the suture, and passed it in a blinded fashion to the physician who closed the appropriate half of the surgical defect. One half of the wound was closed with one suture and the other half was closed with the other suture. Each patient served as their own control, as both sutures were used in each study patient.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Specific eligibility requirements included surgical defects that are linear, without
             curvature, 3.0 cm in length or greater and extending into the subcutis or fascia.

          -  All surgical defects were required to be closed primarily (that is without flaps or
