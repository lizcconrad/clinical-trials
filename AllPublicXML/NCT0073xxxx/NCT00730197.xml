          2. Sex: Male and/or non-pregnant, non-lactating female.

               1. Women of childbearing potential had a negative serum beta human chorionic
                  gonadotropin (β-HCG) pregnancy test performed within 21 days prior to the start
                  of the study and on the evening prior to each dose administration. An additional
                  serum (β-HCG) pregnancy test was performed upon completion of the study.

               2. Women of childbearing potential were required to practice abstinence or use an
                  acceptable form of contraception throughout the duration of the study. No
                  hormonal contraceptives or hormonal replacement therapies were permitted in this
                  study. Acceptable forms of contraception included the following:

                    1. intrauterine device in place for at least 3 months prior to the start of the
                       study and remaining in place during the study period, or

                    2. barrier methods containing or used in conjunction with a spermicidal agent,
                       or

                    3. surgical sterilization (tubal ligation, oophorectomy or hysterectomy) or
                       postmenopausal accompanied with a documented postmenopausal course of at
                       least one year.

               3. Women were not considered of childbearing potential if one of the following was
                  reported and documented on the medical history:

                    1. postmenopausal with an absence of menses for at least one (1) year, or

                    2. bilateral oophorectomy with or without a hysterectomy and an absence of
                       bleeding for at least 6 months, or

                    3. total hysterectomy

               4. During the course of the study, from study screen until study exit - including
                  the washout period, all men and women of childbearing potential must use a
                  spermicide containing barrier method of contraception in addition to their
                  current contraceptive method.

          3. Weight: At least 60 kg (132 lbs) for men and 48 kg (106 lbs) for women with all
             subjects having a Body Mass Index (BMI) less than or equal to 30 but greater than or
             equal to 19.

          4. All subjects were judged normal and healthy during a pre-study medical evaluation,
             (physical examination, laboratory evaluation, Hepatitis B and Hepatitis C tests, HIV
             test, 12-lead ECG, and urine drug screen including amphetamine, barbiturates,
             benzodiazepines, cannabinoid, cocaine, opiates, phencyclidine, and methadone)
             performed within 21 days of the initial dose of study medication.

        II. Exclusion Criteria:

        Subjects who met any of the following criteria were excluded from the study:

          1. Institutionalized subjects were not used.

          2. Social Habits:

               1. Use of any tobacco-containing products within 1 year prior to dosing.

               2. Use of any hormonal contraceptives or hormone replacement therapy within 3 months
                  prior to study medication dosing.

               2. Abnormal and clinically relevant ECG tracing.

          6. Donation or loss of a significant volume of blood or plasma (&gt; 450 mL) within 28 days

             dose of study medication.

          8. Allergy or hypersensitivity to nisoldipine, any of the inactive ingredients, or other
             calcium channel blocker products.

         11. Average sitting pulse rate less than 55 beats per minute after a five minute rest at
             screening or prior to Period I Day 1 dosing. Pulse rate measurements were taken in
             triplicate with at least two (2) minutes elapsed in-between readings.

         12. Average sitting systolic blood pressure less than 90 mmHg or average sitting diastolic
