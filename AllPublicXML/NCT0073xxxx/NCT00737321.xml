  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This pilot study is designed to assess the impact of ischemia/ diminished wound
      vascularization and stress on wound healing by comparing patterns of gene expression in
      specific cell types critical to wound healing biology, e.g. macrophages or endothelial cells.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Chronic wounds affect approximately 2% of the U.S. population at any given time. Animal
      models can not simulate the complex set of pre-existing conditions in each individual that
      results in failed wound healing. Therefore, human subjects must be used to obtain valid data.
      Adequate wound vascularization that permits blood vessels to deliver oxygen to the wound is a
      requirement for wound healing to occur. This protocol will attempt to gain greater
      understanding of the mechanisms of chronic wounds through 3 specific aims: 1) identify the
      angiogenic mechanisms in wound site macrophages, which are required for healing, 2) determine
      the impact of stress and glucocorticoid resistance on endothelial cell and macrophage biology
      and ultimately wound healing outcomes, 3) identify patterns of gene expression in wound
      endothelial cells that are found in healing versus non-healing wounds. This data will be
      correlated with the wound oxygenation status to determine the impact of wound vascularization
      on the observed biological responses.

    <description>Wound tissue biopsies, saliva, serum samples and wound sponges will be obtained at an initial time point, at the midpoint of the study and near the end of wound closure over a 12 week window. If the wound closes quickly, i.e. less than 4 weeks then only 2 biopsies will be obtained.</description>
