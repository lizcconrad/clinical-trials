  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the highest dose of a ABI-007 that can be given
      with cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil without causing intolerable side effects in patients with
      advanced head and neck cancer.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (HNSCC) is the 9th most common malignancy
      diagnosed in Canadians. In the year 2007, there was an estimated 4,350 new cases diagnosed in
      Canada, with approximately 1,600 deaths attributable to HNSCC[Canadian Cancer Statistics
      2007]. In the United States there is an annual incidence of approximately 40,000 newly
      diagnosed cases of head and neck cancer [US Cancer Statistics 2006]. Primary treatment for
      newly diagnosed localized (stage I-II) HNSCC is surgery and/or radiotherapy. The majority of
      patients (70%) however present with locally advanced HNSCC (Stage III or IV). Treatment of
      locally advanced HNSCC generally consists of either concurrent chemotherapy and radiation or
      surgical resection followed by adjuvant radiation or adjuvant concurrent chemotherapy and
      radiation. Unfortunately despite aggressive treatment with combined modality therapies
      approximately 40-50% of cases recur, with the majority recurring at the primary site and/or
      regional nodes. Except for a small minority of patients in whom salvage surgery or
      radiotherapy can be delivered, the prognosis for the majority of these patients is poor and
      further treatment is generally considered palliative.

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Previously untreated squamous cell carcinoma of the oral cavity, oropharynx,
             hypopharynx, or larynx. Histological or cytological confirmation is required. The
             disease must be considered to be potentially curable by combined chemoradiation.
             Patients with nasopharynx, paranasal sinus, skin or unknown primary sites are not
             eligible.

          2. Non-metastatic, stage III or IV disease (UICC/AJCC classification, 6th edition)

          3. Age ≥ 18.

          4. ECOG performance status of 0 or 1.

          5. Patients must have adequate hematological function:

               -  absolute granulocyte count &gt; 1.5 x 109/L

               -  platelet count &gt;100 x 109/L

               -  hemoglobin &gt; 90 g/L

          6. Must have adequate renal and hepatic function:

               -  serum bilirubin &lt; 1.5x UNL and AST/ALT &lt;2.5x UNL

               -  serum creatinine &lt; 1.25 x UNL or a calculated creatinine clearance of &gt; 60 ml/min

          7. Signed written consent.

          8. Availability for follow-up for up after treatment.

             children and will use adequate contraception (oral contraception, IUD, diaphragm and
