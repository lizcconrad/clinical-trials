  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      High blood glucose levels in surgical patients with and without diabetes are associated with
      increased risk of medical complications and death. Over the short-term, high blood glucose
      can adversely affect fluid balance, impair immunologic response to infection, and promote
      inflammation and endothelial dysfunction (blood vessel function). Blood glucose control with
      intensive insulin therapy in patients with critical illness (very sick patients in intensive
      care unit) reduces the risk of multiorgan failure and systemic infections, and decreases
      short- and long-term mortality. High blood glucose has also been associated with poor outcome
      in non-critically ill patients admitted to general surgical and medical wards; however,
      intensive glycemic control is not aggressively pursued because of fear of hypoglycemia. A
      computerized search of biomedical journal literature from MEDLINE, PubMed, and Ovid from 1966
      to 2008 provided very little information on the prevalence and outcome of high blood glucose
      during the perioperative period (before and after surgery) in non-critically ill patients.
      Therefore, the present study aims to evaluate the impact of high blood glucose, in large
      number of subjects with and without diabetes, during general (non-cardiac) surgery.

      We will perform a retrospective chart review of all patients who underwent non-cardiac
      surgery from 01/01/07 to 06/30/07 at Emory University Hospital as inpatient.
