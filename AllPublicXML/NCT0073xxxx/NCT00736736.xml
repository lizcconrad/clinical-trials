  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The first purpose was to compare the difference between leg press exercise(LPE) and
      additional hip abductor and external rotator muscle strength training to leg press
      exercise(LPE+HAE) in muscle strength, hip kinematics during step down, pain severity and
      function for patients diagnosed with patellofemoral pain syndrome. The second one was to
      discover the relationship between the change in muscle strength performance and the
      difference of hip joint kinematics post treatment.
