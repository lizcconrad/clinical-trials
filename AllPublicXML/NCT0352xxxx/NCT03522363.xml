  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pilot study with healthy subjects to test the in vivo potential colonization ability of S.
      dentisani. Phase I, exploratory, prospective, mechanistic pilot clinical trial with two
      parallel follow-up groups. Probiotic will be applied topically as an adhesive gel with a
      dental splint under different dosing regimes. Saliva and plaque samples will be obtained at
      day 0, 14 and 28.

    <textblock>
      Phase I study, exploratory, prospective, mechanistic, to evaluate the capacity of

      Streptococcus dentisani CECT 7746 of colonizing the tooth surface. The study will be carried
      out with 10 healthy subjects divided into two groups (n = 5 per group) that differ in the
      number of applications of probiotic:

      Group A: participants who will receive a single application of the product during the initial
      visit Group B: participants who will receive 7 applications on consecutive days, with the
      first in the start visit. Probiotic will be applied topically as an adhesive gel with a
      dental splint under different dosing regimes.The total dose received will be the same for
      both groups, and the total duration of the follow-up will be of 4 weeks from the first
      application also for both groups.

      On day 0: Participants who meet the inclusion and exclusion criteria will be randomized in
      one of the two groups. Saliva and plaque samples will be obtained by the dentist, and all the
      participants will receive an professional teeth cleaning in one half of the mouth (quadrants
      1-4). Afterwads, treatment will be applied by the dentist according to assigned group, and
      the randomized participants in the multiple-dose group will be explained how to perform the
      six successive applications at home every 24 hours.

      On day 14: follow-up visit, saliva and plaque samples will be obtained from all participants.
      Patient assigned to the multi-dose group will return the used material On day 28th: final
      visit, saliva and plaque samples will be obtained.
