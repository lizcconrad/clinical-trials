      The primary objective of this study is to analyse medication data from the BioCog Study with
      the ApoMining-Database and to determine the positive and negative predictive value from the
      ApoMining-Database for prediction of postoperative delirium (POD).

    <textblock>
      From 2014-2017 the BioCog Study (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT02265263) collected data
      from 439 perioperative elderly patients in Campus Virchow - Klinikum, Universitätsmedizin
      Berlin. According to the study protocol, a delirium assessment was performed each day after
      operation until the 7th postoperative day. At this time, it is known which patients developed
      postoperative delirium (POD) and which did not. Additionally, from each patient data on
      long-term medication before operation and applied medication during operation and in the
      recovery room were collected. In this study, the investiagtors analyse the long-term
      medication and the perioperative medication from BioCog-Study patients with the
      ApoMining-Database (http://www.apothesen.de/index.php?id=878; ApoThesenGmbH; Bad
      Münstereifel; Germany). The ApoMining-Database is a medication database, which analyse
      tolerability and risks of medications for the elderly. The database generates a hit once a
      medication reveal a risk for delirium. Additionally, the database can calculate the
      anticholinergic burden of the medication according to the prescribing information. Whereas
      the investigators already know, which patient developed a POD, they will determine positive
      and negative predictive value from the ApoMining-Database for prediction of postoperative
      delirium.
