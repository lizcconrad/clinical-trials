  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will investigate the safety, feasibility, and immune response associated with
      cryoablation of early invasive breast cancer prior to lumpectomy. Based on mouse models, the
      investigators believe that cryoablation will initiate a stronger immune response relative to
      the control group.

      Consenting patients will be randomized to one of two arms: standard of care (control) or
      cryoablation (intervention). Participants will undergo a blood draw at the time of consent.
      Those in the control arm will continue with their standard of care lumpectomy. The
      intervention arm will receive cryoablation 2 weeks before their scheduled lumpectomy and
      undergo a second blood draw before the lumpectomy.

    <intervention_name>Cryoablation</intervention_name>
    <description>Cryoablation is a non-surgical, minimally invasive freezing procedure used to destroy tumors. In the breast, cryoablation is performed under ultrasound guidance. Due to the analgesic properties of freezing, no IV sedation or anesthesia is required. After administration of local anesthetic, the physician makes a 2-3 mm incision and inserts needle-like cryoprobes into the tumor, commencing a number of freeze-thaw cycles. Then the probe is removed, pressure is applied to the area, and a bandage is placed. The patient leaves the office without stitches and minimal, if any, pain. Any residual pain after the procedure is routinely treated with over the counter analgesics such as acetaminophen.</description>
