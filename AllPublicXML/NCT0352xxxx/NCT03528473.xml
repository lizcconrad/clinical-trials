  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to investigate the effect of a 6-months program of Adapted Physical
      Activity (APA) on body composition, insulin resistance and adipokines, oxidative stress and
      microcirculatory haemodynamics in post-menopausal, physically inactive breast cancer patients
      in oncological follow-up with or without hormone therapy that had completed adjuvant
      treatment (radiotherapy and/or chemotherapy).

      Furthermore, the study will determine the impact of APA on functional capabilities, on
      self-reported physical activity, quality of life and psychic health.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an interventional, comparative, single group assignment study including
      post-menopausal, physically inactive breast cancer patients in oncological follow-up with or
      without hormone therapy (within one-three months of the beginning of treatment), that had
      completed adjuvant post-surgical treatment (radiotherapy and/or chemotherapy).

      All patients will be first assigned to the control group and, after 3-month interval with no
      physical training, will be shifted into the 6-months exercise intervention group. Thus, the
      patients act as their own control at the end of the study.

      The duration of the study is 1 year (with 3-, 9-,12- and 18- months follow-up) during which
      the patients will follow APA program of mild to moderate strength and aerobic exercises.

      Physical activity will be adapted according to arm and shoulder morbidity, after fracture
      risk assessment. Exercise will be concentrated solely on leg muscles (pedalling on a cycle or
      bed ergometer) in individuals with limitations in the range of motion of the arms (eg, due to
      breast, axillary, or thoracic surgery). In patients experiencing ataxia, dizziness, or
      peripheral neuropathy, walking outdoors and mostly cycle-ergometry training will be preferred
      to other activities that also involve large muscle groups but require additional balance and
      coordination (eg, treadmill walking, outdoor cycling).

      Exercises will be performed at the Unipolar Spinal Unit of &quot;S. Maria della Misericordia&quot;
      Hospital, Perugia.

      The aim of the study is to confirm the positive effect of APA on metabolic stress, body mass
      composition, functional capacity and quality of life in breast cancer patients in oncological
      follow-up.

      Currently, only few data are available about the relationship between physical activity and
      microcirculatory hemodynamics that, together with oxidative stress, could be involved in
      genesis and progression of breast cancer.

    <description>The exercise intervention consists of 60 minutes sessions, divided into 40 minutes of aerobic exercise and 20 minutes of circuit training for muscular strength and flexibility exercises.
Aerobic exercise is performed using treadmill, exercise bikes, syncro and arm-ergometers, gradually increasing the exercise intensity, after a 10 minutes period of warming-up, to 60-80 % of Maximum Heart Rate.
Resistance training consists of resistance exercises for large muscle groups, performed with body weight-exercises and isotonic machines.</description>
