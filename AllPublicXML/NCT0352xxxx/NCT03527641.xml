  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study pilots the feasibility and acceptability of a family-based lifestyle intervention
      for decreasing diabetes risk called &quot;Salud sin Barreras&quot; (meaning, &quot;Health without Barriers&quot;)
      delivered in the community to Latino teens at risk for type 2 diabetes. This program combines
      traditional lifestyle intervention to change eating and physical activity with learning
      mindfulness-based stress reduction tools. We also are exploring how Salud sin Barreras lowers
      stress and improves insulin resistance in Latino teens, as compared to lifestyle-only
      intervention, the &quot;La Vida Saludable&quot; (meaning, the Healthy Living Program; HeLP).

      This study is a comparative effectiveness pilot trial to evaluate the feasibility and
      acceptability of a 12-session community-delivered, family-based type 2 diabetes preventative
      lifestyle intervention, delivered over 6 weeks, that includes mindfulness-based stress
      reduction training - &quot;Salud sin Barreras&quot; (meaning, &quot;Health without Barriers&quot;) - in up to 50
      Hispanic/Latino adolescents who are at-risk for developing type 2 diabetes. We also will
      estimate the effectiveness of Salud sin Barreras for lowering perceived stress and improving
      insulin resistance as compared to a time-matched lifestyle-only intervention, the &quot;La Vida
      Saludable&quot; (meaning, the Healthy Living Program; HeLP) in Hispanic/Latino adolescents at-risk
      for type 2 diabetes. In addition, we will estimate the impact of the Salud sin Barreras
      program, relative to HeLP, on the secondary outcomes of mindfulness, depressive symptoms,
      disinhibited eating behavior, sleep quality, physical activity, cortisol, and perceived
      impact of discrimination.

    <description>Salud sin Barreras is a manualized community-delivered program tailored for Latino families and their adolescent children at-risk for type 2 diabetes. Salud sin Barreras is based upon a lifestyle intervention called the Healthy Living Program (HeLP), which includes 6 weekly 2-hour nutrition/cooking sessions and 6 weekly 2-hour Multidisciplinary Sessions that include parent education on nutrition, fitness, goal-setting, parenting, and a brief mindfulness curriculum, a teen group physical fitness class, and a teen mindfulness curriculum called Learning 2 BREATHe. In between sessions, participants are encouraged to practice brief mindfulness skills in their daily lives and to complete the &quot;homework&quot; assignments, such as an audio-guided body scan. Participants have access to home-practice audio-recordings and will be queried about their completion of home-practice assignments.</description>
