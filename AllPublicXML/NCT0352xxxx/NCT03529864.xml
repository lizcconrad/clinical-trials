  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main objective was to determine the efficacy and safety of a therapeutic exercise program
      for students. Secondary objectives, determine the prevalence and intensity of musculoskeletal
      pain (MSP), disability, Health-Related Quality of Life (HRQOL), and satisfaction and
      perceived improvement with program.

      Methodology: randomized, controlled, open clinical trial. Subjects were recruited from
      students of Degree of Physiotherapy. Inclusion and exclusion criteria were established.
      Physical Component Summary (PCS) of SF36, as primary outcomes, was taken to the sample size.
      Randomization was single-blind. Secondary response variables were measured through the Nordic
      Musculoskeletal Questionnaire, Visual Analogue Scale, Oswestry Disability Index, Neck
      Disability Index, trunk flexor endurance test and finger-floor distance test. An assessment
      pre and post intervention was performed. This consisted of a therapeutic exercise program
      based on the stabilization, 9 sessions of 1 hour. For statistical analysis, the Shapiro-Wilk
      test, Student's t test or test MannWitney, the statistic (X2) chi-square or Fisher's exact
      test were applied. The level of significance was taken as p &lt;0.05. Information sheet and
      informed consent model was delivered.

    <intervention_model_description>Why: The design of the intervention took into account the available evidence for the prevention and treatment of neck and low back pain.
What: Materials: mats, fit-balls, TheraBands, towels, Dyn-Air cushions, chairs, stretchers.
Procedures: 3 levels of exercises of increasing difficulty. Standing warm-up exercises. Exercises involving: body scanner and breathing pattern re-education (4 minutes), neutral lumbar-pelvic position control in all directions (6 minutes); transverse abdominis activation (4 minutes); neutral cervical position control (2 minutes); global stabilizer activation exercises for the lumbar-pelvic and cervical-scapular regions (4 minutes); low back flexibility (2 minutes); and muscular strengthening and stretching (12 minutes).
Who provided: Physiotherapist. How: Face to face, group with 8-9 participants.</intervention_model_description>
    <primary_purpose>Prevention</primary_purpose>
    <masking_description>This study was single-blind, parallel-group, and participants were randomly assigned to either the experimental (EG) or the control group (CG). Randomization was designed after initially evaluating the participants. The EG participated in the progressive exercise therapy program. In contrast, the CG did not receive any type of information or instructions apart from the general information sheet on the progress of the study, attached to the informed consent form.</masking_description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>SF-36v2 Health Survey</measure>
    <time_frame>7 min</time_frame>
    <description>This is self-administered and consists of 36 items that assess the state of health in 8 dimensions: physical function (PF), role-physical (RP), bodily pain (BP), general health (GH), vitality (VT), social function (SF), role-emotional (RE) and mental health (MH). These dimensions may be reduced to 2 scores: Physical Component Summary (PCS) and Mental Component Summary (MCS). In order to interpret the results, standardized scores are obtained with the values for the reference population standards, whereby a score of 50 (SD = 10) represented the mean for the general population, and a score of 10 was one standard deviation. Values over or below 50 have to be respectively interpreted as better or worse than those of the reference population.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Nordic Musculoskeletal Questionnaire (NMQ-E)</measure>
    <time_frame>4 min</time_frame>
    <description>It collects information regarding the onset, prevalence, and consequences of musculoskeletal pain. It inquires about ''ache, pain or discomfort'' and 9 body regions are visually depicted on a body chart. In total, it is comprised of 11 questions, equating to 99 data items generated by the tool. With the exception of age data, all response options are dichotomous (yes/no). Questions are ordered in such a way that those relating to the respondents' lifetime (''ever'') are asked first, followed by prevalence questions, and lastly items relating to consequences of pain in the previous year. Respondents are asked to answer all questions for a body region before progressing to the next region (horizontally). In 2 instances (specifically, questions relating to lifetime and annual prevalence of trouble), if the respondent answer no, they are directed to go on to the next body region and all remaining questions for that region are automatically coded as negative responses.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Visual Analogy Scale (VAS)</measure>
    <time_frame>2 min</time_frame>
    <description>The pain VAS is a single-item scale. It is a continuous scale comprised of a horizontal line, 10 centimetres (100 mm) in length, anchored by 2 verbal descriptors, one for each symptom extreme: &quot;no pain&quot; (score of 0) and &quot;worst imaginable pain&quot; (score of 100 [100-mm scale]). Although there are no normative values, the recommended cut-off points were used to interpret the score obtained on this scale: no pain (0-4 mm), slight pain (5-44 mm), moderate pain (45-74 mm) and severe pain (75-100 mm) (Hawker GA et al. 2011).</description>
