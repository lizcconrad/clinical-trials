      Daily Symptoms Report will be filled at the start and at end of the study (before and after
      performing swimming exercise) Females in group I will be instructed to engage into 12 classes
      of 60-minute Zumba® fitness over an 8-week period Each class was one hour in length and a
      recovery period of at least 48 hours will be taken between classes. The Zumba® fitness
      scheduling of sessions will be self-selected by the participants. The Zumba sessions will be
      conducted at a ﬁtness center (SAMIA ALLOUBA gym and fitness center) and will consist of
      continuous dance movements to Latin music with varying intensity level throughout the
      sessions. Each session will be initiated with low-intensity movements for the ﬁrst 5 min,
      followed by an increasing intensity throughout the workout. At the end of the training
      session, the intensity will be gradually reduced. The Zumba sessions will be supervised by
      three certiﬁed Zumba instructors, each responsible for regular sessions per week.
