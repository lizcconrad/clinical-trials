      A cross-sectional study was performed from 2017 to 2018. Consecutive Crohn's disease patients
      diagnosed in the Inflammatory bowel disease center of the Sixth Affiliated Hospital of Sun
      Yat-sen University were recruited. All patients underwent upper gastrointestinal endoscopy
      and biopsy by two defined endoscopists and two pathologists, the basic information were
      collected at the same time, in order to assess the prevalence of upper gastrointestinal
      involvement, and determine the role of upper gastrointestinal endoscopy in adult Crohn's
      disease patients, irrespective of upper gastrointestinal symptoms.
