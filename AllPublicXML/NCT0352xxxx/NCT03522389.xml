    <textblock>
      This study will investigate the effect of Action Observation Teaining (AOT) on gait variables
      and global cognitive functions in older adults with mild cognitive impairment (MCI).

      The specific objectives are 1) to compare gait variables and global cognitive functions among
      the AOT with gait training, gait training, and control groups at before training, after
      training, and follow up and 2) to compare gait variables and global cognitive functions among
      before training, after training, and follow up in each of the groups.

      Participants in this study will be older adults recruiting from the Physical Therapy Center
      of Mahidol University, Siriraj hospital, and community at Phuttamonthon area (n = 39).

      They will be diagnosed as a MCI, using core clinical criteria of the National Institute on
      Aging and the Alzheimer's Association by a physiotherapist. Prior to participate in the
      study, participants will be informed the details of the study and sign the informed consent.
      All participants will be recorded the demographic data and will be assessed visual acuity,
      hearing, sensation and muscle strength of lower extremity, balance, gait variables, and
      global cognitive function.

      Participants who pass the criteria will be randomly assigned to either the AOT with gait
      training group (n = 13), the gait training group (n = 13), and the control group (n = 13) by
      stratified randomization.

      Gait variables will be collected by the Force Distribution Measurement platform during
      walking at comfortable speed (single task) and during counting backwards from 100 by sevens
      (dual tasks). Global cognitive function will be assessed by the Montral Cognitve Assessment
      (MoCA).

      All varaibles will be assessed 3 times which will be at before training, after 4-week of
      training, and 4-week follow-up.

    <description>AOT with gait training composes of program of watching video in different views of normal walk for 5 min.
After that, participants will receive gait training program. The program consists of warm-up, gait training, cool-down, and stretching. Gait training is classified into the different levels of difficulty in each week. The 1st week will be walking over the markers followed by 100 steps/min of metronome. The second week will be walking over the markers followed by 120 step/min of metronome. The 3rd week will be walking followed by 120 step/min of metronome but not has the markers. The 4th week will imagine and imitate the walking in the 2nd week but not has the markers and metronome.</description>
