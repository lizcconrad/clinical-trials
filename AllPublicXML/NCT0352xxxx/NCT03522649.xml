    <description>Napabucasin 240 mg will be administered orally, twice daily, with doses separated by approximately 8~12 hours (480 mg total daily dose). FOLFIRI chemotherapy infusion will start at least 2 hours following the first daily dose of Napabucasin and will be administered every 2 weeks. Irinotecan 180 mg/m^2 together with leucovorin 400 mg/m^2 will be administered intravenously, over approximately 90 minutes and 2 hours, respectively, starting on Day 1 of Cycle 1, at least 2 hours following the first daily dose of Napabucasin. Fluorouracil 400 mg/m^2 bolus will be administered intravenously immediately following irinotecan/leucovorin infusion, followed by fluorouracil 1200 mg/m^2/day (total 2400 mg/m^2) continuous infusion. This regimen will be repeated on Day 1 of every 14 day cycle.</description>
