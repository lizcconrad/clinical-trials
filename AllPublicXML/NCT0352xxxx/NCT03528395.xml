  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Stroke creats dependancy of patients due to various associated impairments. The use of
      low-cost technologies for neurological rehabilitation may be beneficial for the treatment of
      these patients.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      To determine the effectiveness of a structured protocol using semi-immersive virtual reality
      with commercial videogames for balance, postural control, functional independence, quality of
      life and motivation in patients who have suffered an ischemic and / or hemorrhagic stroke in
      subacute phase and are being treated in a mid-stay hospital.

      Patients and methods: Randomized Controlled Trial. Simple blind. Control group will receive
      conventional therapy (physical therapy and occupational therapy) intervention being based on
      a task-oriented approach, with five weekly sessions of Physical Therapy and Occupational
      Therapy with duration of 45 minutes per session.

      The experimental group will receive in addition to the above an experimental intervention
      during 8 weeks providing additional treatment using virtual reality semi-immersive complement
      is added by means of commercial video games implemented with the Xbox 360º video game console
      in conjunction with the Kinect device.

    <intervention_model_description>Patients will be randomly distributed to a control group or experimental group using the QuickCalcs application of GraphPad Software.
The following considerations will be taken into account:
Control group: 8 weeks of conventional rehabilitation based on a task-oriented approach. Consisting of five weekly sessions of physical therapy and of occupational therapy, lasting 45 minutes each.
Experimental group: 8 weeks of conventional rehabilitation provided identically as in the control group, plus virtual reality semi-immersive sessions. VR sessions will be applied following a protocol using commercial video games, three days a week (Monday, Wednesday and Friday) after the conventional rehabilitation sessions.</intervention_model_description>
