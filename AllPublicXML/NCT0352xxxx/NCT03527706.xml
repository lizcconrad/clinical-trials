      To identify predictors for postoperative health related quality of life after elective
      sigmoidectomy for diverticular disease.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      According to current international guidelines, indications for surgical treatment of
      diverticular disease are inhomogeneous. To date, the measurement of pre- and postoperative
      quality of life (QoL) is underrepresented. To ensure an individually tailored therapeutical
      approach, and to avoid unnecessary surgery as well as the risk of a hazardous chronification
      of the disease, QoL importantly needs to be focused within the decisional process for the
      best treatment option. The aim of the PREDIC DIV-Study is, to identify predictors for a
      better postoperative quality of life in patients who undergo elective sigmoidectomy for
      diverticular disease. PREDIC DIV is a prospective observational study.
