  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Prescription opioid overdose represents a public health crisis. A number of efforts have been
      implemented to address opioid prescribing and opioid risk mitigation strategies for
      prescribers, but relatively few efforts have sought to address this problem directly with
      individuals who use opioids. This gap likely fails to fully address the inherent reinforcing
      nature of the medications that make it challenging to reduce use.

      The specific aim of this study is to pilot test a toolkit that pairs an intervention with the
      distribution of naloxone. External facilitation (supervision check-ins) will aid translation
      to delivery by non-research staff. Firstly, data will be collected from participants over
      time as a control group, prior to training site staff. Next, non-research staff will be
      trained on the intervention. Staff at the site will use the online &quot;toolkit&quot; developed in the
      beginning of this project to deliver the interventions and naloxone to their clients/patients
      as part of usual care. After staff at the site(s) are trained, additional data will be
      collected from participants during the intervention period and after 3-months.

      Based on feedback from non-research site staff, the OPT-IN Project implementation package was
      tailored for optimal delivery in the site setting. The translation strategy will be evaluated
      using the RE-AIM framework, which includes Reach (e.g., number of individuals receiving
      intervention), Effectiveness (e.g., patient/client outcomes), Adoption (e.g., numbers
      trained), Implementation (e.g., fidelity of intervention delivery) and Maintenance (e.g.,
      sustained in routine practice over time) with mixed qualitative and quantitative methods with
      intervention recipients.

    <description>The ORB measures change over time for prescription opioid use, specific to type of opioid use, combination with other substances, route, and if they use alone. This scale is a total sum of 9 items assessing participant's self-report of engaging in behavior that increases risk for overdose. Higher scores indicate greater risk for overdose. The range for this measure is 0 to 32 in one assessment.</description>

    <description>A private one-on-one brief motivational interviewing intervention administered by non-research staff at community organizations. This will take up to 30 minutes to complete. The goal of the intervention is to improve opioid safety and reduce related overdoses among those who has a history of misusing opioids (prescription and illicit). The session will use techniques to change behavior in a respectful, non-confrontational, and non-judgmental manner. This intervention will also seek to empower participants by providing content on bystander response as well as peer outreach, which emphasizes ways to discuss overdose risk with others at risk for overdose.</description>
