  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this clinical trial is to investigate the efficacy (by monitoring overall
      improvement of EB symptoms) and safety (by monitoring adverse events) of three doses of
      allo-APZ2-EB administered intravenously to patients with recessive dystrophic epidermolysis
      bullosa (RDEB).

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an interventional, single arm, non-randomized, open label, phase I/IIa clinical trial
      to investigate the efficacy and safety of the IMP allo-APZ2-EB in patients with RDEB.

      Patients will undergo treatment with the IMP (three repeated intravenous applications) and
      will be followed up for efficacy for 12 weeks. To assess long-term safety of allo-APZ2-EB one
      follow-up visit at Month 12 post IMP applications is included.

      Determination of the EB linked symptoms and quality of life will be assessed by using the
      EBDASI score, the iscorEB, the change in pain and itch perception, and patient's quality of
      life in EB. The wound healing process will be documented by photography.
