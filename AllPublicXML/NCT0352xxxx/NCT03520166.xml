  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to assess the effectiveness of medium frequency electrotherapy
      (interferential currents) treatment for overactive bladder (OAB), lower urinary tract
      symptoms (LUTS) and pelvic pain

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study consists of 100 women, complaining of increased bladder sensation and urgency with
      or without incontinence as principal symptomatology and who had not received previous
      pharmacological treatment. Group-A was used as a control group (n = 50). Group-B patients
      received 18 sessions of medium frequency electrotherapy during 9 weeks, 2 weekly sessions

    <description>Treatment with medium frequency electrotherapy, interferential currents between 5500 Hz and 8500 Hz (Combi-200®, Gymna®), was performed using transvaginal application. The frequency was increased progressively over the first six sessions (twice a week), starting with a frequency of 5500 Hz until reaching a frequency of 8500 Hz, which remained until the end of treatment.</description>
