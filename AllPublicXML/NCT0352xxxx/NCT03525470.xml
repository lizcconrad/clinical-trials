  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The influence of relatively small decreases in hydration status have been little studied. On
      two occasions subjects will be allowed to lose about 0,5% of their body weight and one
      occasion 300ml of water will be consumed. Functional MRI will be used to monitor brain
      functioning when performing a mental arithmetic task. Heart rate variability will be
      monitored and related to differences in brain functioning when water has and has not been
      drunk

    <textblock>
      On two mornings twelve male participants will be exposed to a temperature of 30oC for four
      hours and either drink or not drink two 150ml glasses of water during that time. The subjects
      the participate in an fMRI protocol during which they complete a modified version of the
      Paced Auditory Serial Addition Test (PASAT): a challenging arithmetic task designed to elicit
      autonomic arousal.

      Throughout the morning subjects will their heart rate variability (HRV) monitored. At
      periodic intervals subjects will rate their thirst and mood by visual analogue scales and at
      the end of the PASAT task they rate its difficulty. Changes in body temperature and fluid
      loss (perspiration and urine) and urine osmolality will be monitored.

    <description>Participants will be presented with an arithmetic task, modified for use in the scanner, similar to the Paced Auditory Serial Addition Task: a 'stressful' task that measures calculation ability and is known to elicit an autonomic response 35. Pairs of two digit numbers appeared on a screen in red and participants will be required to mentally add or subtract the numbers. After 2 seconds the screens will be removed and a second screen appeared containing a correct and an incorrect answer. Participants will be required to press either a left or right button to indicate which answer was correct ). The speed of presentation is designed to be just at the level that it is possible to perform the task although it required mental effort and was 'stressful'.This allows investigation of areas of the brain associated with working memory but also those associated with emotional arousal.</description>
