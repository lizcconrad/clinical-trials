  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Unicompartmental knee arthroplasty (UKA) is the principal surgical alternative to the total
      knee arthroplasty (TKA) in patients with end-stage unicompartmental tibiofemoral
      osteoarthritis (OA) of the knee. The current comparative randomized study aims to evaluate
      the fixation of cemented and cementless designs of GMK-UNI unicompartmental knee prosthesis
      over a 5-year time period.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The Primary objective is to compare the quality of fixation of cemented and cementless
      designs of GMK-UNI unicompartmental knee replacement at 2 years of follow-up.

      The Secondary objectives include the evaluation of the patient improvement (subjective and
      objective) using the new Knee Society Score (KSS); the patient's anterior pain following UKA
      and any eventual patella-femoral disorder; Implant survival rate using the Kaplan Meier
      analysis; Post-op radiological findings and Adverse Events.

      The Primary outcome aims to compare the occurrence of radiolucency's lines (both partial and
      complete) between the two study groups. Secondary outcomes include New KSS, OKS, Kaplan Meier
      analysis and stability and fixation of UNI prosthesis.

      All patients who meet the inclusion criteria to take part in the current clinical study will
      be invited to participate before the surgery.

      Subjects will be randomized during the screening; half of them will receive the cemented
      GMK-UNI anatomical UKA and the other half the cementless GMK-UNI anatomical UKA.

      Clinical data will be recorded on CRF at those time-points:

        -  Before the surgery

        -  During the surgery

        -  After the surgery at 3 months, 1, 2, 3 and 5 years.

    <time_frame>pre-op; 3months;1,2,3,5 yrs</time_frame>
    <description>It's a 13-item knee specific self-report questionnaire. It documents response to 6 activities associated with anterior knee pain as well as symptoms such as limp, inability to weight bear through the affected limp, swelling...). It asks about duration of symptoms and limbs affected. Max score is 100 and lower scores indicate greater pain/disability. Scoring is hierarchical using various types of categorisation including &quot;no difficulty-unable &quot; and &quot;no pain-severe pain&quot;. It is easy to understand and takes few minutes to complete.It has a good test-retest reliability.</description>

    <description>The Oxford Knee Score (OKS) is a 12-item patient-reported PRO specifically designed and developed to assess function and pain after total knee replacement (TKR) surgery (arthroplasty).Each question is scored from 1 to 5, with 1 representing best outcome/least symptoms. Scores from each question are added so the overall score is from 12 to 60 (12 being the best outcome). The overall score for the OKS is acquired by simply summing the scores received for individual questions.</description>

    <measure>New Knee Society Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Pre-op:3months;1,2,3,5 yrs</time_frame>
    <description>The new KSS System is a validated and responsive method for assessing objective and subjective outcomes after total and partial knee arthroplasty.It includes versions to be admninstered pre-op and post-op.It has an initial assessment of demographic deatils. The objective knee score includes VAS score of pain walking on level ground and on stairs or inclines, as well as ROM, an assessment of alignment, ligament stability along with deductions for flexion contracture or extensor lag. Pts then record their satisfaction, functional activities and expectations. It consists of 4 subscales: 1) objective knee score (7 items;100 points); 2) Satisfaction Score (5 items; 40 points);3) Expectation Score (3 items; 15 points); 4) Functional Activity Score (19 items; 100 points)</description>
