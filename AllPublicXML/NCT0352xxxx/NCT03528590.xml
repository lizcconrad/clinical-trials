  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Currently, the main method for selecting an i-gel® size is based on the body weight
      recommendation (30-60 kg for size 3 and 50-90 kg for size 4) according to the manufacturer's
      recommendation. However, there is an overlapping in size selection in people weighing between
      50 and 60 kilograms. We widely use the laryngeal mask airways for breast surgery, and this
      patient cohort is often weighed between 50-60 kilograms in our hospital. Therefore, in this
      randomized clinical trial, we will compare the ventilation efficacy of size 3 and size 4
      i-gel® in anesthetized, paralyzed female patients weighing 50 to 60 kilograms who undergo
      breast surgery. Also, we will record any side effects of size 3 and size 4 i-gel® in this
      cohort.

      With the introduction of the laryngeal mask, it has been widely used for the management of
      airway during general anesthesia. Compared to the endotracheal tube, it has the advantages of
      easier and faster placing, reducing the proportion of a sore throat and other benefits. The
      i-gel® is a second-generation of the laryngeal mask. Compared to the classic laryngeal mask,
      it provides higher sealing pressure and better airway protection to reduce respiratory
      complications.

      Choosing an appropriate size laryngeal mask is an important issue. Trauma during placing or
      positive ventilation failure may occur if the wrong size is selected. Currently, the main
      method for selecting an i-gel® size is based on the body weight recommendation (30-60 kg for
      size 3 and 50-90 kg for size 4) according to the manufacturer's recommendation. However,
      there is an overlapping in size selection in people weighing between 50 and 60 kilograms. We
      widely use the laryngeal mask airways for breast surgery, and this patient cohort is often
      weighed between 50-60 kilograms in our hospital. Therefore, in this randomized clinical
      trial, we will compare the ventilation efficacy of size 3 and size 4 i-gel® in anesthetized,
      paralyzed female patients weighing 50 to 60 kilograms who undergo breast surgery. Also, we
      will record any side effects of size 3 and size 4 i-gel® in this cohort.
