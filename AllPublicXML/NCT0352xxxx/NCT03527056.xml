  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Carbapenem-Resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE) are bacteria that have become resistant to
      carbapenems by producing enzymes that break down carbapenems. The prevalence of CRE continues
      to rise globally but the treatment options are extremely limited. In case series, isolation
      of CRE from any site, whether there is clinical infection or not, has been associated with
      all-cause hospital mortality ranging from 29% to 52%. There are no known methods for reliably
      decolonizing gastrointestinal (GI) CRE. In rare case reports, fecal microbiota transplant
      (FMT) has successfully eradicated gastrointestinal colonization of CRE, but there has been no
      larger study further investigating this. FMT via oral capsules is the least invasive method
      and has demonstrated efficacy and short-term safety in treating patients with recurrent
      Clostridium difficile infections. Therefore, the investigators propose this pilot study to
      determine the effectiveness of oral capsule fecal transplantation in the decolonization of
      gastrointestinal CRE.
