  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal is to achieve the maximal radiotherapy tumor dose while sparing the health tissue
      and critical structures. On-board cone-beam CT (CBCT) scans are routinely acquired prior to
      dose delivery and matched with simulation CT at the planned treatment positions. Thus, setup
      or motion errors can be detected and corrected. However, CBCT is not available for situations
      with gantry collisions such as WBI and TSEB. More importantly, CBCT cannot reveal any
      irregular respiration or body movement during beam-on time. Thus, it is essential to develop
      a real-time image system that can detect organ/body motion during beam-on time, and correlate
      simulation-planning images with prior treatment CBCT images.In this proposed clinical trial,
      we will cooperate with a 3D camera company (Xigen LLC) to develop novel 4D video imaging
      techniques and validate the feasibility and accuracy of 4D video image guidance in
      correlation with 4D CT/CBCT useful for advanced IGRT.
