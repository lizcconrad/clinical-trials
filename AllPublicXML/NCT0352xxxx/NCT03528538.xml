  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      1. The problem: There is limited research on the use of herbal supplements in general, and
           fenugreek specifically, to improve male health, particularly to increase testosterone
           levels. As well, no located studies have examined the effects of fenugreek
           supplementation on healthy men's health-related quality of life, anxiety levels, and
           body composition.

        2. Relevant research examined the effects of fenugreek supplementation with healthy men
           aged between 43 and 70 years of age. The researchers found that both total serum
           testosterone and free testosterone increased compared to placebo after 12 weeks of
           active treatment. The researchers concluded that fenugreek supplementation was a safe
           and effective treatment for reducing symptoms of possible androgen deficiency, improves
           sexual function and increases serum testosterone in healthy middle-aged to older men.
           Another study found that fenugreek supplementation improved aging male symptoms and
           testosterone levels remained in a normal range in healthy men aged 25 to 45 years.

        3. The importance of this study: The importance of this study is to help determine if
           fenugreek supplementation affects testosterone levels, body composition, health-related
           quality of life, anxiety, and aging symptoms in healthy men aged 21 - 45 years.

    <intervention_model_description>Subjects will complete 3 assessments during the study at Day 0, Week 4, and Week 8. At each assessment, they complete the following: self-report inventories (e.g., Aging Male Symptoms Questionnaire, Trait Anxiety Inventory, Health-related Quality of Life), body composition via BOD POD, heart rate, blood pressure, and blood draws. The subjects will be randomized to one of the following three conditions: (1) AlphaFenTM fenugreek (400 mg/d), (2) AlphaFenTM fenugreek (500 mg/d), or (2) placebo control. The subjects will be asked to take one capsule of the fenugreek supplement or placebo daily for eight weeks.</intervention_model_description>

    <measure>Health Related Quality of Life Questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) Health-related Quality of Life measure will be used to assess health-related quality of life. This scale has excellent psychometric properties. The HRQoL assesses the positive and negative aspects of a person's life such as satisfaction or distress and the impact of these factors to their perceived health and life experience. This questionnaire is a valid and reliable measure than can be used to evaluate the individuals physical and mental perceptions.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Aging Male Symptoms Questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Aging Male Questionnaire consists of 17 questions in 3 sub-scales (i.e., psychological, somatic and sexual) that assesses symptoms of aging specific for men. These sub-scales as well as the total score were used to assess symptoms. Having symptoms from the AMS questionnaire merely suggests a male may have deficiencies but blood samples are the best determinants of this condition. The higher the score, the worst the outcome.</description>

    <description>The BODPOD machine is considered the gold standard for body composition as it has a range of error between Â± 1 to 2.7% and is easier to complete than underwater weighing. The BODPOD was used to observe body composition at each assessment</description>
