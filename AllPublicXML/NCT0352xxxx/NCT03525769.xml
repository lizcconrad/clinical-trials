  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is aimed at calculating the incidence of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD),
      non- alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) cirrhosis and advanced fibrosis in patients with type 2
      diabetes in China, evaluating the diagnostic efficacy of FibroTouch for hepatic steatosis and
      fibrosis in these patients, analyzing the long-term prognosis and screening potential risk
      factors in patients with both type 2 diabetes and NAFLD.

      This study will use FibroTouch to screen NAFLD, NASH cirrhosis and advanced fibrosis in
      patients with type 2 diabetes, compare the results with liver tissue biopsy to assess the
      clinical value of FibroTouch for the screening of NAFLD in diabetics, then investigate the
      clinical significance of FibroTouch in assessing the long-term prognosis of patients with
      diabetes and NAFLD in a prospective cohort, screen risk factors for diabetes with NAFLD and
      advanced fibrosis.

      This study is a multicenter, prospective, observational cohort study. We plan to include
      10,000 patients with type 2 diabetes, and use FibroTouch to screen for NAFLD, NASH cirrhosis
      and advanced fibrosis in these patients. In the group of patients who experienced liver
      biopsies in clinical practice, we compare their FibroTouch results and liver biopsy pathology
      results, to evaluate the clinical value of FibroTouch in diagnosing NAFLD, NASH cirrhosis and
      advanced fibrosis in diabetics. We will calculate the incidence and analyze risk factors of
      NAFLD, NASH cirrhosis and advanced fibrosis in patients with type 2 diabetes. All patients
      will be followed-up for 5 years (once a year for patients without cirrhosis, twice a year for
      patients with cirrhosis), to observed endpoint events. This study will explore the
      significance of FibroTouch result and other clinical indicators in assessing the long-term
      prognosis of diabetic patients with NAFLD.

    <description>FibroTouch is a non-invasive image-guided integrated detection system, providing an integrated detection and comprehensive evaluation program for hepatic fibrosis and hepatic steatosis.
The FibroTouch is a completely non-invasive liver testing device that can obtain the following results: 1. Liver Fibrosis: quantitative results of hepatic fibrosis; 2. Fatness: quantitative result of hepatic steatosis; 3. Liver tissue morphology: detected by ultrasound imaging.</description>
