    <textblock>
      Patients with immunodeficiencies are at increased risk of developing persistent HPV infection
      and as such HPV-related disease (genital warts and cancer).

      In this study HIV-patients and SOT-patients will receive 3 doses of Gardasil®9. Safety,
      tolerability and immunogenicity will be evaluated up to one month following the 3rd and last
      dose of Gardasil®9.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-center, open-label study on safety, tolerability and immunogenicity of
      Gardasil®9 in 18 to 45 year-old HIV patients, in 18 to 55 year-old solid-organ transplant
      (SOT) patients.

      This study will enrol 140 HIV patients with CD4+ (cluster of differentiation 4) count of
      &gt;200cells/mm² and 170 SOT patients, all of whom have not yet received a prophylactic HPV
      vaccine. The 170 SOT patients will be equally divided over 3 different SOT patient groups,
      namely heart, lung and kidney transplant patients. Therefore the target is to include
      approximately 57 heart transplant patients, 57 lung transplant patients and 57 kidney
      transplant patients. Enrolment in a SOT subgroup will be stopped when 57 patients have been
      included unless recruitment cannot be achieved within one of the other SOT-patient
      population.

      All enrolled subjects will receive a 3-dose regimen (Day 1, Month 2, and Month 6) of
      GARDASIL®9. Serum samples will be collected on Day 1 and Month 7 for anti-HPV 6, 11, 16, 18,
      31, 33, 45, 52, and 58 antibody determination.. The time point for comparison of immune
      responses will be Month 7, or approximately 4 weeks after the administration of the third
      dose. The safety/tolerability profile of the vaccine will be evaluated in all subjects in the
      study. Safety information will be collected on Day 1 through 1 month following the third
      vaccination or for a total of approximately 7 months for each subject.

      The immunogenicity and the safety data will be analyzed per group of patients. More
      specifically a separate analysis of HIV and SOT patients is planned, since it is expected
      that the immunosuppressive therapy of SOT patients might have a more profound effect on
      immunogenicity following vaccination.

      This study will provide a comparison of immunogenicity of Gardasil ®9 in immunocompromised
      patients, with historical controls (15, 18). The number of subjects to be enrolled in the
      study was determined based on the primary immunogenicity objective.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Independent Ethics Committee (IEC)-approved written informed consent form (ICF) must
             be obtained from the subject prior to any study-related procedures (including
             discontinuation of prohibited medication, if applicable) by the subject is given as
             required by local law.

          2. Subject (man or woman) is between the age of 18 years and 0 days and 45 years and 365
             days for HIV patients, between 18 years and 0 days and 55 years and 365 days for
             transplant patients at time of signing the ICF

          3. Subject is able to understand and adhere to the study procedures (e.g., is not
             planning to relocate far from the investigational centre during the study period); is
             able to read, understand, and complete the vaccination diary; is able to understand
             the risks involved with the study; and voluntarily agrees to participate in the study
             by giving written informed consent.

          4. * Since the first day of their last menstrual period through Day 1, female subjects
             have not had sex with males or has had sex with males and used effective contraception
             with no failures (an example of a failure is a male condom that ruptures during sexual
             intercourse). Effective contraception is defined as a marketed, approved contraceptive
             product that the subject has used per the manufacturer's instructions with every act
             of sexual intercourse. The subject understands and agrees that during the Day 1
             through Month 7 period, she should not have sexual intercourse with males without
             effective contraception. The use of the rhythm method alone, withdrawal alone, and
             emergency contraception, are not acceptable methods per the protocol. Subjects who
             have reached menopause, undergone hysterectomy, bilateral oophorectomy, or bilateral
             tubal ligation are eligible without the use of contraceptives. Postmenopausal status
             is defined as: (1) No menses for &gt;1 year but &lt;3 years and confirmed by follicle
             stimulating hormone (FSH) levels elevated into the postmenopausal range, or (2) no
             menses for at least 3 years.

          5. * Subject has had no temperature ≥37.8°C within 24 hours prior to the first injection.

          6. Patient considerations

                  than 12 months ago).

               -  SOT patients received their organ transplantation ≥12 months prior to vaccination
                  and has been stable in the past 6 months (i.e. no acute rejection or other
                  immunological reactions).

          7. Apart from having HIV or received a solid organ transplant, the subject is in stable
             condition (i.e. no graft-versus-host disease or other immunological reactions) and is
             judged to be in good physical health on the basis of medical history, physical
             examination (if deemed necessary), and laboratory testing

          8. Subject agrees to provide study personnel with a primary telephone number as well as
             an alternate telephone number for follow-up purposes.

                  arthritis, juvenile rheumatoid arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease, or other
                  autoimmune or immunosuppressive condition, or has a history of any disease,
                  which, in the investigator's opinion, may confound the results of the study or
                  pose an additional risk to the subject.

                  globulin, antilymphocyte sera, or other therapy known to interfere with the
                  immune response. With regard to systemic corticosteroids, a subject will be
                  excluded if she is currently receiving steroid therapy, has recently (defined as
                  within 2 weeks of enrolment) received such therapy, or has received 2 or more
                  courses of high dose corticosteroids (≥20mg/day of prednisone [or equivalent]
                  orally or parenterally) lasting at least 1 week in duration in the year prior to
                  enrolment. Subjects using inhaled, nasal, or topical corticosteroids are
                  considered eligible for the study

               2. Exclusion criterion only for SOT patients: Subject is receiving or has received
