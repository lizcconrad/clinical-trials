  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      RAPID-VT Pilot is a single centre prospective cohort pilot study to assess the feasibility,
      safety and efficacy of catheter ablation of ventricular tachycardia (VT) guided by a novel
      real-time software to localize the origin of VT during the ablation procedure.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Consecutive patients with ischemic heart disease and clinical indication of VT ablation will
      undergo baseline clinical evaluation, echocardiography and cardiac CT imaging using a
      contrast-enhanced cardiac-gated method with a 64-section scanner. Trans-axial CT images
      comprising the whole heart volume will be exported in DICOM format. CT image processing will
      be performed and will be used to delineate the LV endocardial and/or epicardial geometries.
      These data will be imported into the RAPID-VT software and the 3D-electranatomical mapping
      system for image integration.

      During the VT ablation procedure, VT(s) induction will be performed. The VT(s) 12-lead ECG
      will be acquired by the RAPID-VT software and will be localized to the scar margin using the
      RAPID-VT software. Catheter ablation will be attempted at software-determined sites.

      Post procedure, patient will be followed up for a minimum of 6 months. That will include
      Remote ICD follow-up and telephone study visits. Follow-up at 6 months will include a clinic
      visit for assessment of heart failure status, ECG, ICD interrogation and changes in
      antiarrhythmic drug therapy.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients will be eligible for inclusion if they fulfilled VANISH inclusion criteria by
             having both of:

               1. Prior myocardial infarction (pathological Q waves or imaging evidence of regional
                  myocardial akinesis/thinning in the absence of a non-ischemic cause)38 and

               2. One of the following VT events within the last 6 months while on Amiodarone or
                  another class III or class I antiarrhythmic drug:

        A: Sustained monomorphic VT documented on 12-lead ECG or rhythm strip requiring termination
        by pharmacologic means or DC cardioversion, B: ≥3 episodes of symptomatic VT treated with
        anti-tachycardia pacing (ATP), C: ≥1 appropriate ICD shocks, D: ≥3 VT episodes within 24
