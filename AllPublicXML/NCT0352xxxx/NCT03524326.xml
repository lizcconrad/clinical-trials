    <textblock>
      This is a phase I study, which tests the safety of different doses of lenvatinib in
      combination with cetuximab, to see which dose is the safest in people. This study will help
      find out if lenvatinib and cetuximab is a safe and useful combination for treating patients
      with HNSCC and cSCC.

    <description>A 3+3 dose de-escalation design for three dose levels of lenvatinib combined with cetuximab will be used. A DLT will be defined as any toxicities of grade 3 or higher (per CTCAE v4 criteria) felt to be possibly, probably, or definitely related to lenvatinib, as well as grade 4 toxcities related to cetuximab, which occurs within 28 days following the first dose of lenvatinib in combination with cetuximab.</description>
