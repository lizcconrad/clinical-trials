      The study aims to evaluate the effects of a single intra-articular injection of
      micro-fragmented adipose tissue obtained with the Lipogems® system in patients affected by
      knee chondropathy. End-points were determined by evaluating the patients in terms of
      improvement in symptoms, functional recovery and radiographic appearance compared to
      baseline.

      Background: The social impact of degenerative diseases is steadily increasing, because of the
      continued rise in the mean age of the active population. Articular cartilage lesions are
      generally associated with disability and symptoms such as joint pain and reduced function,
      and remain a challenge for the orthopaedic surgeon. Several non-invasive solution have been
      proposed, but the results achieved to date are far from being completely satisfactory.
      Recently, new therapeutic approaches, such as the use of mesenchymal stem cells, have been
      developed. Among the many sources, the adipose tissue is nowadays considered one of the
      smartest, due to its abundance and easy access.

      The aim of this retrospective study is to explore whether patients affected by symptomatic
      knee osteoarthritis treated with micro-fragmented adipose tissue associated with a chondral
      shaving procedure experience an improvement in symptoms and function.

      Methods: Thirty-eight consecutive patients affected by symptomatic knee osteoarthritis were
      treated in 2015 with an arthroscopic procedure associated with an injection of autologous and
      micro-fragmented adipose tissue. Micro-fragmented adipose tissue was obtained using a minimal
      manipulation technique in a closed system. Clinical outcomes were determined at 1, 3, 6, and
      12 months follow-up using Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score questionnaire and
      direct physical examination. Safety of the procedure, recording type and incidence of any
      adverse event, was also assessed.
