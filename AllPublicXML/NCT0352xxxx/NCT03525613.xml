  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

        The study eye must meet all inclusion criteria. If both eyes meet the inclusion criteria,
        the eye with the worst visual acuity at the screening visit will be designated as the study
        eye. If both eyes have the same visual acuity, the Investigator will determine the study
        eye.

        Ocular- specific inclusion criteria apply to the study eye only, unless otherwise
        specified.

          1. Age ≥ 60 years.

          2. Normal Luminance best corrected visual acuity (NL-BCVA) of 24 letters or better using
             Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) charts (approximately 20/320
             Snellen equivalent).

          3. Clinical diagnosis of GA of the macula secondary to AMD as determined by the
             Investigator and confirmed by the Reading Center.

          4. The GA lesion must meet the following criteria as determined by the central reading
             center's assessment of Fundus Autofluorescence (FAF) imaging at screening:

               1. Total GA area must be ≥ 2.5 and ≤ 17.5 mm2 (1 and 7 disk areas [DA] respectively)

               2. If GA is multifocal, at least one focal lesion must be ≥ 1.25 mm2 (0.5 DA), with
                  the overall aggregate area of GA, as specified above in 4a.

               3. The entire lesion must be completely visualized on the macula centered image. GA
                  must be able to be imaged in its entirety and not contiguous with any areas of
                  peripapillary atrophy.

               4. Presence of any pattern of hyperautofluorescence in the junctional zone of GA.
                  Absence of hyperautofluorescence (i.e. pattern = none) is exclusionary.1

          5. Adequate clarity of ocular media, adequate pupillary dilation, and fixation to permit
             the collection of good quality images as determined by the Investigator.

          6. Female subjects must be:

               1. Women of non-child-bearing potential (WONCBP), or

               2. Women of child-bearing potential (WOCBP) with a negative pregnancy test at
                  screening and must agree to use protocol defined methods of contraception for the
                  duration of the study and refrain from breastfeeding for the duration of the
                  study.

          7. Males with female partners of child-bearing potential must agree to use protocol
             defined methods of contraception and agree to refrain from donating sperm for the
             duration of the study.

          8. Willing and able to give informed consent and to comply with the study procedures and
             assessments.

        Note: If both eyes meet the inclusion criteria, the eye with the worst visual acuity at the
        screening visit will be designated as the study eye. If both eyes have the same visual
        acuity, the Investigator will determine the study eye.

        Microperimetry Criteria Note: If a subject is not eligible for the microperimetry portion
        of the study, this does not exclude them from participation in the rest of the study
        provided they meet the entry criteria. Subjects must meet all study eligibility criteria
        (inclusion/ exclusion criteria) in addition to the criteria below in order to participate
        in the microperimetry portion of the study.

        Inclusion Criteria

          1. Must be able to detect fixation target.

          2. Total elapsed time to complete the 10-2 68 point exam is ≤ 30 minutes in duration.

          3. Reliability test ratio must be ≤ 20%.

          4. Subject is willing and able to undertake microperimetry assessment in the opinion of
             the investigator.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Ocular specific exclusion criteria apply to the study eye only, unless otherwise specified.

          1. GA secondary to a condition other than AMD such as Stargardt disease, cone rod
             dystrophy or toxic maculopathies like plaquenil maculopathy in either eye.

          2. Spherical equivalent of the refractive error demonstrating &gt; 6 diopters of myopia or
             an axial length &gt;26 mm.

          3. Any history or active CNV, associated with AMD or any other cause, including any
             evidence of retinal pigment epithelium rips or evidence of neovascularization anywhere
             based on SD OCT imaging and/or fluorescein angiography as assessed by the Reading
             Center.

          4. Presence in either eye of an active ocular disease that in the opinion of the
             Investigator compromises or confounds visual function, including but not limited to,
             uveitis, other macular diseases (e.g. clinically significant epiretinal membrane
             (ERM), full thickness macular hole or uncontrolled glaucoma/ocular hypertension.
             Benign conditions in the opinion of the investigator such as peripheral retina
             dystrophy are not exclusionary).

          5. Intraocular surgery (including lens replacement surgery) within 3 months prior to
             randomization.

          6. History of laser therapy in the macular region.

          7. Aphakia or absence of the posterior capsule. Note: YAG laser posterior capsulotomy for
             posterior capsule opacification done at least 60 days prior to screening is not
             exclusionary.

          8. Any ocular condition other than GA secondary to AMD that may require surgery or
             medical intervention during the study period or, in the opinion of the Investigator,
             could compromise visual function during the study period

          9. Any contraindication to IVT injection including current ocular or periocular infection

         10. History of prior intravitreal injection in the study eye.

         11. Prior participation in another interventional clinical study for intravitreal
             therapies (including subjects receiving sham).

         12. Participation in any systemic experimental treatment or any other systemic
             investigational new drug within 6 weeks or 5 half-lives of the active (whichever is
             longer) prior to the start of study treatment. Note: clinical trials solely involving
             observation, over-the-counter vitamins, supplements, or diets are not exclusionary.

         13. Treatment for active systemic or localized infection.

         14. Medical or psychiatric conditions that, in the opinion of the investigator, make
             consistent follow-up over the 24-month treatment period unlikely, or would make the
             subject an unsafe study candidate.

         15. Any screening laboratory value (hematology, serum chemistry or urinalysis) that in the
             opinion of the Investigator is clinically significant and not suitable for study
             participation.

         16. Known hypersensitivity to fluorescein sodium for injection or hypersensitivity to
             APL-2 or any of the excipients in APL-2 solution.

        Microperimetry Criteria Note: If a subject is not eligible for the microperimetry portion
        of the study, this does not exclude them from participation in the rest of the study
        provided they meet the entry criteria. Subjects must meet all study eligibility criteria
        (inclusion/ exclusion criteria) in addition to the criteria below in order to participate
        in the microperimetry portion of the study.

        Exclusion Criteria

        1. Unable to perform the test reliably in the opinion of the investigator.
