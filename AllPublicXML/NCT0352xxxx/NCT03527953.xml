    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to evaluate the clinical performance of three different bulk-fill
      restorative resin materials; a bulk fill resin composite, a flowable bulk fill resin
      composite and a fiber-reinforced resin in Class II restorations over a period of 24 months.

      The objective of this study is to evaluate the 24-month clinical performance of three
      different bulk-fill restorative resin materials in Class II restorations. Forty patients with
      at least three approximal lesions in premolar and molar teeth will be participated in the
      study. A total of 120 Class II cavities will be restored using Tetric EvoCeram Bulk Fill
      (n=40), SureFil SDR flow + Ceram X mono (n=40), and everX Posterior + G-aenial Posterior
      (n=40) with their respective adhesives according to the manufacturers' instructions. All
      restorations will be placed by one operator. The restorations will be evaluated at baseline
      and at 6, 12, 18, and 24 months using modified USPHS criteria by one examiner. The
      restoration groups for each category will be compared using Pearson's chi-square test, while
      Cochran's Q test will be used to compare the changes across different time points within each
      restorative material (p&lt;0.05).

    <description>The preparation will be etched with 37% phosphoric acid. It will be then rinsed with an air-water spray and dried, leaving the dentin slightly moist. An etch-and-rinse adhesive, ExciTE F, will be applied and agitated on the prepared surfaces for at least 10 seconds. The adhesive will be air-thinned and light-cured for 20 seconds with an LED curing unit. The sectional matrix will be placed and fixed with wooden wedges. Then the bulk-fill resin composite, TBF, will be placed in bulk in about 4-mm thickness and then will be cured for 20 seconds.</description>

    <description>The preparation will be etched. A two-step etch-and-rinse adhesive, Prime&amp;Bond NT will be applied to all enamel/dentin surfaces, air-dried for 5 seconds, and will be light cured for 10 seconds. After the sectional matrix will be placed, the flowable bulk-fill resin composite, SureFil SDRâ„¢ flow (Dentsply Caulk, Milford, DE, USA), will be placed in a 4-mm bulk increment in the dentinal part cured for 20 seconds and will be followed by a covering layer of the nanohybrid resin composite, Ceram.X Mono that will be cured for 20 seconds.</description>

    <description>The enamel will be etched with 37% phosphoric acid for 10 seconds, then will be rinsed, and dried with an air/water syringe for at least 5 seconds. Self-etch adhesive, G-aenial Bond (GC Co., Tokyo, Japan), will be applied to all enamel/dentin surfaces and gently air thinned and then will be light cured for 10 seconds. After the matrix will be placed and wedged, mesial or distal walls will be built with 1-2-mm layers of G-aenial Posterior resin composite. The fiber-reinforced composite, everX Posterior, will be placed into the cavity in approximately 4-mm thickness. The last 2 mm of the cavity will be restored using the G-aenial Posterior composite as an overlay layer. Each increment will be light cured for 20 seconds using an LED unit.</description>
