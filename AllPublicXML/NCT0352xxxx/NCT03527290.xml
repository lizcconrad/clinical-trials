  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This pilot study aims to recruit 30 adults with abdominal obesity, without major chronic
      disease, and test whether clinical dietary advice that is solely focused on the timing of
      eating (time restricted eating), has an effect on cardiometabolic health compared to standard
      dietary advice for cardiometabolic health, which is focused on content. The goal of this
      pilot study is to develop and hone dietary counseling approaches for time restricted eating
      for RD's in a clinical practice paradigm, and collect data on testing this intervention
      compared to standard dietary counseling approaches for cardiometabolic health.

    <description>Participants will be instructed and counseled to incorporate a 12-hour Time Restricted Eating (TRE) regimen that begins upon waking and concludes within a 12-hour period (e.g. if wake at 6:30 AM then all caloric intake occurs between 6:30 AM and 6:30 PM). Water and non-caloric beverages (e.g. herbal tea) outside the period are encouraged as desired. There are no specific content or energy intake changes to the diet counseled or recommended as the focus of the counseling in this arm is timing of eating with innate circadian patterns and developing plans and approaches to follow this plan.</description>

    <description>Participants will be instructed and counseled with standard clinical dietary guidance for improving cardiometabolic health, where the focus is on the content, specifically a dietary pattern that emphasizes vegetables, fruits, whole grains, legumes, nuts/seeds, low fat dairy, seafood, lean poultry and meat and avoidance of foods with high levels of sodium, added sugars, saturated fats, and trans fats. There is no prescription to reduce energy intake.</description>

    <description>The intervention is delivered in a paradigm in which an individual with abdominal obesity would be referred by their physician to receive dietary counseling from a Registered Dietitian (RD). The aim of the intervention is to improve cardiometabolic health and assist with weight management via 4, individualized counseling sessions over the course of 8 weeks. Participants are educated on basic concepts related to circadian rhythms, metabolism and TRE; and the evidence demonstrating benefit of TRE in animal models and humans. The goal is provide rationale for the potential benefits of a TRE approach. In addition, the RD sessions focus on developing a plan for successfully implementing a TRE approach, identifying challenges for adherence, and a plan for dealing with real or potential challenges. The counseling is focused the TRE concept, with no specific direction or counseling related to modifying the content of the participant's diet or any prescription to reduce energy intake.</description>

    <description>The intervention is delivered in a paradigm in which an individual with abdominal obesity would be referred by their physician to receive dietary counseling from a Registered Dietitian (RD). The aim of the intervention is to improve cardiometabolic health and assist with weight management via 4, individualized counseling sessions over the course of 8 weeks. Participants are educated on basic concepts and known benefits related to eating a diet for cardiometabolic health and weight management recommended by the American Heart Association and the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics as a standard of practice for dietitians in healthcare settings. The RD sessions focus on adopting a dietary pattern aligned with this approach, identifying challenges to adopting this dietary pattern, and education and plans for dealing with real or potential challenges. The counseling gives no direction related to modifying the timing of dietary intake or any prescription to reduce energy intake.</description>
