  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this multicenter prospective study is to determine if the decision of
      transient circulatory support (TCS) in cardiogenic shock is relevant. TCS is a recommended
      treatment of refractory cardiogenic shock but precise indications are not definitively
      founded. Some studies described patients with TCS in order to establish mortality predictive
      scores (ENCOURAGE, SAVE), but no study has assessed the clinical relevance of the TCS
      decision yet. Therefore, The investigators propose to compare the characteristics and the
      follow-up of patients in acute cardiogenic shock, once TCS implantation was decided or not by
      the heart team.

      This French multicenter prospective observational study is aimed at determining if the
      decision of transient circulatory support (TCS) in cardiogenic shock is pertinent, i.e. at
      least as effective as the medical treatment.

      All patients with cardiogenic shock for whom indication of TCS was discussed within the
      multidisciplinary heart team (cardiologist, intensivist and cardiac surgeon) are
      consecutively included in the study.

      Two groups of patients are defined:

        -  Patients with cardiogenic shock treated by medical treatement

        -  Patients with cardiogenic shock treated by TCS (extracorporeal circulatory life support
           and/or Impella).

      The main objective is to compare mortality between the 2 groups. Secondary objectives are ICU
      follow-up characteristics and quality of life questionnaire at day 180.

      Statistical analysis will include a propensity-matched method to compare the groups to avoid
      confounding factors. The number of necessary subjects (n=240, 120 in each group) was
      calculated assuming that TCS has a superiority of 20% in comparison with medical treatment in
      severe cardiogenic shock, with a study power of 80%, and an alpha risk of 5%.

The RAND 36-Item Health Survey (Version 1.0) taps eight health concepts: physical functioning, bodily pain, role limitations due to physical health problems, role limitations due to personal or emotional problems, emotional well-being, social functioning, energy/fatigue, and general health perceptions. It also includes a single item that provides an indication of perceived change in health. Each item is scored on a 0 to 100 range so that the lowest and highest possible scores are 0 and 100, respectively.</description>
