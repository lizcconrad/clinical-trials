  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a single site, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. The trial
      will assess the safety, tolerability, immunogenicity and vaccine efficacy (VE) of PfSPZ
      Vaccine in Gabonese children that are naturally exposed to malaria parasites. Healthy
      children aged 1- 12 years living in the surrounding areas of Lambaréné and/or Fougamou
      Province in Gabon will be eligible for participation.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The trial will be performed in 200 healthy Gabonese children, recruited across three
      age-strata: 7-12, 3-6 and 1-2 years (12-35 months). Within each age-stratum, volunteers will
      be randomized in a 2:1 ratio to receive three doses via direct venous inoculation (DVI) of
      either PfSPZ Vaccine (0.9x10^6) or normal saline (NS) on days 0, 7 and 28 respectively; a
      minimum of 40 and a maximum of 100 volunteers are included in each of these age-strata.

      In total, approximately 133 children will receive PfSPZ Vaccine and approximately 67 children
      will receive placebo. Randomization will be by block within each age-stratum (block sizes of
      20). The start of inclusion into each age-stratum will be staggered, such that immunization
      of the first 3-6-year-olds will not commence until two weeks after start of immunization in
      the first 7-12-year-olds, and immunizations in the first 1-2-year-olds will not commence
      until two weeks after start of immunization in the first 3-6-year-olds. All volunteers will
      receive presumptive treatment with artemether-lumefantrine two weeks prior to final
      immunization (day 14). All volunteers will receive presumptive treatment with
      age-standardized 3-day course of oral artemether-lumefantrine (AL) ~two weeks prior to first
      immunization and again two weeks prior to final immunization.
