    <textblock>
      Dietary intervention study in healthy adult males to evaluate concentration of flavanol
      metabolites in plasma and urine after single acute intakes of flavanols from different
      fruit-based drinks.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Flavonoids, including the sub groups of Flavanols (F) are plant-derived compounds commonly
      present in the human diet. Examples of F-containing foods and beverages are apples,
      chocolate, tea, wine, berries, pomegranate and nuts. The consumption of F-containing foods
      and beverages has been associated with improvements in cardiovascular health. In this
      context, there exists a great interest in describing the absorption, metabolism and excretion
      of F in humans, as it is thought that F-derived metabolites present in circulation are the
      mediators of F-beneficial effects in humans. Recently, the investigators described a series
      of F-derived metabolites in circulation that are present after the consumption of a single
      acute intake amount of F in humans as well as F-metabolites derived from the metabolic
      activity of the gut microbiome. A key question, however, is if the metabolites we observed
      after a single acute feeding are the same as those that occur in individuals who consume
      F-rich diets on a regular basis. Studies investigating the metabolism of numerous other
      xenobiotics have shown that the profile of metabolites can greatly vary over time, as well as
      with the amount of the xenobiotic ingested. In this context, the investigators submit it is
      important to assess whether or not there are food matrix-dependent effects on the levels and
      profile of F-derived metabolites in humans. The investigators suggest the information that
      will be obtained from the outlined work will be particularly timely given ongoing discussion
      concerning the possible generation of dietary recommendations for F-rich foods and increasing
      interest in the putative health effects of F intake in humans.

      This study consisted of two parts. One part investigated flavanols absorption and metabolism
      from different fruit-based drinks and other food matrixes. The second part investigated
      flavanol absorption and metabolism after the intake of a flavanol drink alone and
      simultaneously consumed with a banana-based drink.
