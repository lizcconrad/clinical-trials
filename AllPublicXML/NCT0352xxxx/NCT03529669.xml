    <textblock>
      This is a feasibility study testing the use of the Cytosponge™ device in patients with known
      oesophageal cancer treated with pre‐operative or definitive chemoradiation. All participants
      will receive one Cytosponge™ procedure at one time‐point within 4‐16 weeks after completion
      of chemoradiotherapy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In this feasibility study, we are investigating a novel way to test for remaining or
      reoccurring oesophageal cancer following chemoradiotherapy. The technique used to test this
      is called a Cytosponge™. We will be testing the use of the Cytosponge™ to determine
      completion rate, safety and acceptability of the procedure.

      Cytosponge™ is a capsule‐sized device which contains an expandable, spherical mesh which is
      attached to a string. The capsule dissolves in the stomach after swallowing, releasing the
      sponge which is then retrieved by gently pulling the string after five minutes. As the sponge
      is pulled out it collects the cells from the lining of the gullet.

      The Cytosponge™ will be processed for evidence of residual cancer through analysis of
      cellular atypia and molecular biomarkers. Where available, the results will be compared with
      histology.

      Fifty patients will be recruited to the trial across approximately 10 sites.

    <description>The proportion of consented, evaluable patients successfully undergoing Cytosponge™ will be presented, with the corresponding 95% confidence interval.

    <description>Quality of material obtained from Cytosponge™ test will be centrally analysed at Cambridge (cellularity, yield and quality of extracted DNA will be used as measure of quality).

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Male or female, Age &gt;/=16 years who

               1. have undergone pre-operative CRT as treatment for oesophageal cancer and due to
                  undergo oesophagectomy or

               2. have undergone definitive CRT as treatment for oesophageal cancer

          2. 4‐16 weeks post completion of CRT

          3. Dysphagia score 0‐2 (Mellow Scale)*

          4. Able to swallow tablets

          5. Physiologically fit for endoscopy

          6. Written (signed and dated) informed consent

          7. The patient is willing and able to comply with the protocol for the duration of the
             study, and scheduled follow‐up visits and examinations.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Known to have oesophageal varices, stricture or requiring dilatation of the
             oesophagus.

          2. Unable to temporarily discontinue anticoagulation therapy/medication prior to their
             procedure*

          3. Oesophageal stent

          4. Other psychological, social or medical condition, physical examination finding or a
             laboratory abnormality that the Investigator considers would make the patient a poor
             study candidate or could interfere with protocol compliance or the interpretation of
             study results.

               -  Patients on anti‐coagulation therapy are eligible for the study as long as they
                  are considered suitable candidates for endoscopic biopsy (follow local hospital
                  procedures for management of patients on anticoagulation due to undergo
                  endoscopy). If temporary discontinuation of anticoagulation is required, this
                  should be after consultation with the patients clinical care team.
