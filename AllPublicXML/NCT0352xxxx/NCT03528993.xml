  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Stroke,one of the leading cause of death, is caused by ischemia or hemorrhage. It results in
      neurological deficits such as hemiplegia. Hemiplegia show disability characterized loss of
      motor, sensory and cognitive function. Reduced postural control and balance stability results
      gait disturbances such as asymmetric weight bearing, risk of falling and imbalances. It also
      shows increased energy expenditure, decreased independence on quality of life and limited
      mobility. Physical therapy can be effective method for solving these problems. Hippotherapy,
      also known as horseback riding therapy, is a form of physical therapy strategy that uses
      equine movement. The concept of hippotherapy is to use a horse as a therapeutic tool, and it
      is based on similarities in gait between the human and horse. The horse's gait provides
      patients having motor disabilities with rhythmic and repetitive movements similar to human
      walking, thereby giving them training opportunities to improve posture, balance, and
      strength. Even though it has many effect on solving these problems, hippotherapy centers are
      not enough. Due to climate and environmental situations, hippotherapy devices were improved
      and had similar effects on patients with stroke. In literature, these device mostly used on
      cerebral palsy, but investigator wants to use hippotherapy device on patient with Hemiplegia.
      For these reasons, the effects of exercises by mechanical hippotherapy device on postural
      control and balance will be investigated.

      Investigator will randomly allocate 30 patients with hemiplegia to two groups; Control group
      (n=15), experimental group(n=15).The control group will receive conventional rehabilitation
      for 45 min/day, following by postural control exercises 15 min/day 5 times/week for 4 weeks,
      while the experimental group receive conventional rehabilitation for 45 min/day following by
      use of a hippotherapy device for 15 min/day, 5 times/week for 4 weeks. Assessment procedure
      will be held at the beginning and 4th week of study. Assessment procedure will be held at the
      beginning and 4th week of study. All subjects will be assessed by berg balance scale and
      BIODEX primarily while Timed up and go test, SF-36, Functional reach test, functional
      independence measurement(FIM), Trunk Impairment Scale (TIS), Trunk Control Test (TCT),

    <measure>Berg balance scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline to week 4</time_frame>
    <description>The Berg Balance Scale (BBS) was developed to measure balance among older people with impairment in balance function by assessing the performance of functional tasks. It is a valid instrument used for evaluation of the effectiveness of interventions and for quantitative descriptions of function in clinical practice and research. The BBS has been evaluated in several reliability studies. A recent study of the BBS, which was completed in Finland, indicates that a change of eight (8) BBS points is required to reveal a genuine change in function between two assessments among older people who are dependent in ADL and living in residential care facilities. 14-item scale designed to measure balance of the older adult in a clinical setting. Equipment needed: Ruler, two standard chairs (one with arm rests, one without), footstool or step, stopwatch or wristwatch, 15 ft walkway Completion Time: 15-20 minutes</description>

    <measure>BIODEX balance systems</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline to week 4</time_frame>
    <description>Biodex Balance System (BBS), a commercially available balance device, Biodex Medical Systems, Shirley, NY, USA) will used to assess fall risk and balance. It consists of a movable balance platform which provides up to 20° of surface tilt in a 360° range of motion and the platform is interfaced with computer software (Upper display module-firmware version 1.09, Lower control board-firmware version 1.03, Biodex Medical Systems) that enables the device to serve as an objective assessment of balance and fall risk. The system had various difficulty levels which range from 1 (most difficult) to 12 (the easiest). two settings will be used to assess the dynamic balance and the fall risk;the postural stability test (PST) and the fall risk test (FRT).</description>

    <measure>SF-36 (The Short Form Health Survey)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline to week 4</time_frame>
    <description>The Short Form-36 (SF-36) is a 36 item questionnaire which measures Quality of Life (QoL) across eight domains, which are both physically and emotionally based. The eight domains that the SF36 measures are as follows: physical functioning; role limitations due to physical health; role limitations due to emotional problems; energy/fatigue; emotional well-being; social functioning; pain; general health. A single item is also included that identifies perceived change in health, making the SF-36 a useful indicator for change in QoL over time and treatment.</description>

    <measure>Functional Reach Test</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline to week 4</time_frame>
    <description>The Functional Reach Test was first developed by Pamela Duncan and colleagues in 1990. It is a quick and simple, single-task dynamic test that defines functional reach as &quot;the maximal distance one can reach forward beyond arm's length, while maintaining a fixed base of support in the standing position&quot;. It is a dynamic rather than a static test and measures a person's &quot;margin of stability&quot; as well as ability to maintain balance during a functional task. The test has been shown by Duncan to be predictive of falls in older adults.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Functional Independence Measurement(FIM)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline to week 4</time_frame>
    <description>The Functional Independence Measure (FIM) is an 18-item of physical, psychological and social function. The tool is used to assess a patient's level of disability as well as change in patient status in response to rehabilitation or medical intervention. Tasks that are evaluated using the FIM include bowel and bladder control, transfers, locomotion, communication, social cognition as well as the following six self-care activities: Feeding,Grooming, Bathing, Upper Body Dressing, Lower Body Dressing,Toileting</description>

    <measure>Fugl-Meyer Assessment of Motor Recovery after Stroke</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline to week 4</time_frame>
    <description>The Fugl-Meyer Assessment (FMA) is a stroke-specific, performance-based impairment index. It is designed to assess motor functioning, balance, sensation and joint functioning in patients with post-stroke hemiplegia. It is applied clinically and in research to determine disease severity, describe motor recovery, and to plan and assess treatment. The scale is comprised of five domains and there are 155 items in total: Motor functioning (in the upper and lower extremities), Sensory functioning (evaluates light touch on two surfaces of the arm and leg, and position sense for 8 joints), Balance (contains 7 tests, 3 seated and 4 standing), Joint range of motion (8 joints), Joint pain.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>The Trunk Control Test (TCT)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline to week 4</time_frame>
    <description>The Trunk Control Test can be used to assess the motor impairment in a patient who has had a stroke. It correlates with eventual walking ability. It has 4 items: 1) Rolling to weak side 2) Rolling to strong side 3) Balance in sitting position 4) Sit up from lying down. Total score range: 0 (minimum) to 100 (maximum, indicating better performance). Score of each item: (0, 12 or 25). 0 = unable to perform movement without assistance. 12 = able to perform movement, but in an abnormal style 25 = able to complete movement normally. For the sitting balance item, a patient scores 12 if they need to touch anything with their hands to stay upright, and 0 if they are unable to stay up (by any means) for 30 seconds.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Trunk Impairment Scale (TIS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline to week 4</time_frame>
    <description>Trunk Impairment Scale (TIS) measures the motor impairment of the trunk after a stroke through the evaluation of static and dynamic sitting balance as well as co-ordination of trunk movement. The static subscale investigates: (1) the ability of the subject to maintain a sitting position; (2) the ability to maintain a sitting position while the legs are passively crossed, (3) the ability to maintain a sitting position when the subject crosses the legs actively. The dynamic subscale contains items on L. flexion of the trunk and unilateral lifting of the hip. To assess the coordination of the trunk, the subject is asked to rotate the upper or lower part of his or her trunk 6 times, Scores range from a minimum of 0 to a maximum of 23. If patient scores 0 on the first item, the total score on the TIS is 0.</description>
