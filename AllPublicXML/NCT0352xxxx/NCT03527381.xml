      This prospective randomized study evaluates the nephroprotective effects of exogenous nitric
      oxide delivered to the extracorporeal circulation circuit during cardiac surgery with
      cardiopulmonary bypass.

      The aim of this work is to study nephroprotective effects of nitric oxide (NO) supply to the
      cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) circuit during cardiac surgery with normothermic CPB in adult
      patients. The prospective randomized study is performed in the settings of Federal Cardiology
      Center. A total of 71 adult patients who underwent cardiac surgery with CPB are enrolled in
      the study. Patients are randomized to two groups: main group receive NO treatment; control
      group undergoes sham procedure. In the main group, NO is supplied to the CPB line in a dose
      of 40 ppm throughout the entire CPB period. The primary endpoint is the frequency of acute
      kidney injury (AKI). The secondary endpoints are the diuresis during CPB and the level of
      urine neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (uNGAL) four hours after surgery. Cumulative
      hydrobalance, diuresis, and Lasix doses are assessed within the first 48 h of the
      postoperative period. The dynamics of serum creatinine is assessed during the first week
      following the intervention.
