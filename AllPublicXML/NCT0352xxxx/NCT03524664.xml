  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to learn about the emotion regulation skills of children with
      fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD) and different strategies that may improve these
      skills. This study is also testing whether a training program taught to caregivers is
      helpful.

      Children will be asked to:

        -  Complete a brief measure of verbal and nonverbal problem-solving skills.

        -  Play two computer games.

        -  Have their heart rate measured while completing a task that is designed to be mildly
           disappointing. Two ECG pads are placed on the chest with a small recorder.

        -  Play or relax with study staff while you are finishing caregiver activities.

      Caregivers will be asked to complete interviews and questionnaires about:

        -  the child's background, including any past stressful experiences

        -  the child's behavior and how s/he handles emotions

        -  caregiver views on the child's emotions and their own

        -  caregiver relationship with the child

        -  Stress caregivers experience as a parent

    <measure>mean change in parent awareness of own emotion score for sadness</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline to 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The meta emotion interview is a semi-structured interview administered to parents about their own experience of anger and sadness and their feelings, attitudes, and behaviors toward their children's anger and sadness. Interviews are audiotaped and transcribed verbatim. Interviews can be analyzed quantitatively using a checklist rating system. The Revised Meta-Emotion coding system uses a 5-point Likert scale (1= strongly disagree to 5= strongly agree) with which coders rate each item based on both the content and the way parents talk about emotions. The scores range from 1-5 with 5 indicating better outcome.</description>

    <measure>mean change in proportion of observed emotion coaching statements using the Family Narrative Task</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline to 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Family Narrative Task is a parent-child interaction task assessing how parents communicate about emotions with their children. Parents are instructed to engage the child in a conversation about three emotional events in turn: a positive family experience, a difficult family experience, and a time when the child misbehaved. Interactions are videotaped and coded for content and function using the Family Emotion Communication Scoring System, Revised. Emotion coaching (e.g., &quot;I could tell you were mad because you walked away,&quot; &quot;How did you feel when that happened?&quot;) and dismissing (e.g., &quot;It wasn't anything to get upset over,&quot; abrupt change in topic) will be coded. Number of emotion coaching statements versus total statements will be calculated.</description>

    <measure>mean change in child emotion regulation using the Emotion Regulation Checklist</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline to 20 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Emotion Regulation Checklist is a 24-item parent report questionnaire assessing children's affect lability (e.g., &quot;exhibits wide mood swings,&quot; &quot;is easily frustrated&quot;) and emotion regulation (e.g., &quot;is empathetic towards others,&quot; &quot;can say when s/he is feeling sad, angry, fearful, or afraid&quot;). This assessment is 24 items rated by the parent on a 4 point scale of never to always given at baseline, 8 and 20 weeks. There are 12 items of lability and 12 items of emotion regulation. For emotion regulation the score ranges from 12-48 with higher scores reflecting better emotion regulation.</description>

    <description>ActiveWave Cardio is an ambulatory single channel ECG waveform recorder that will be used to measure baseline levels and changes in respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA) in response to the Disappointment Task. The change in RSA will be measured before and after the disappointment task. The change over time will be calculated.</description>

    <measure>mean change in intensity of negative emotion during the disappointment task</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline to 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Disappointment Task measures children's intensity of negative affect (5-point Likert scale) and is coded in response to a disappointment. The range in score is 1-5 with 1 being less intense negative emotions</description>

    <measure>mean change in intensity of disruptive behaviors using the Eyberg Child Behavior Inventory</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline to 20 week.</time_frame>
    <description>The Eyberg Child Behavior Inventory is a 36-item scale assessing the intensity of disruptive behaviors in children. Parents rate each item on a 7 point scale. This is then converted into a standardize score with a T score with mean of 50 and standard deviation of 10 with higher scores reflecting more problems. This is given at baseline, 8 and 20 weeks.</description>
