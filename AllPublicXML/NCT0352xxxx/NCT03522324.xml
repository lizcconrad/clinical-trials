      This study tests the effects of cannabinoid levels in blood on pain relief, inflammation, and
      cognitive dysfunction in chronic pain patients who choose to use edible cannabis. Over a
      two-week period, participants use an edible product of their choice. Blood levels of
      9-delta-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and cannabidiol (CBD) will be measured before, during, and
      after the two-week exposure period to determine whether there are associations with pain,
      inflammation, sleep, physical activity, anxiety/depression, and cognitive dysfunction. After
      the two-week self-administration period, participants will be followed for six months to
      collect self-report data on cannabis use, pain levels, sleep quality, and mental health
      symptoms.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The National Center for Health Statistics reports that approximately 76 million Americans
      suffer from chronic pain, affecting the lives of more Americans than cancer, diabetes, and
      heart disease combined. Perhaps because of its ubiquity and the challenge to its treatment,
      relief from chronic pain is by far the most commonly cited condition by patients for use of
      marijuana, with 87%-94% of medical marijuana users reporting using for relief of a pain
      condition.

      Although the mechanisms are still unclear, marijuana and its constituent cannabinoids,
      including 9-delta-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), are thought to be involved in reducing pain and
      associated inflammation. However, THC is also associated with harm in the form of cognitive
      dysfunction. Synergistic interactions of multiple cannabinoids are believed to produce
      different effects on both pain relief and cognitive function as compared to THC alone. For
      example, cannabidiol (CBD) is another primary cannabinoid that may work synergistically with
      THC in a multi-target analgesic approach.

      This study examines the effects of cannabinoids in edible form on pain relief, inflammation,
      and cognitive dysfunction in chronic pain patients who choose to use marijuana in the context
      of a short-term (2 weeks), patient-oriented, observational design and a mobile pharmacology
      and phlebotomy lab.
