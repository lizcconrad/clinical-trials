  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, multi-site, single-arm Phase 2 study of adjuvant nivolumab combined
      with ipilimumab for the treatment of adult subjects with completely treated high-risk ocular
      melanoma, as defined in eligibility criteria, without evidence of metastatic disease. All
      patients enrolled to the study will be treated with nivolumab 240 mg IV every 2 weeks plus
      ipilimumab 1mg/kg IV every 6 weeks. 1 cycle = 6 weeks. Treatment will continue until disease
      progression, unacceptable toxicity, patient request to discontinue or completion of
      treatment. Subjects may receive up to 25 doses of nivolumab and 8 doses of ipilimumab

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Written informed consent and HIPAA authorization for release of personal health
             information prior to registration. NOTE: HIPAA authorization may be included in the
             informed consent or obtained separately.

          2. Age ≥ 18 years at the time of consent. No dosing or adverse event data are currently
             available on the use of ipilimumab in combination with nivolumab in patients &lt; 18
             years of age.

          3. ECOG Performance Status of 0-1 within 28 days prior to registration.

          4. Patients must have clinically confirmed ocular melanoma diagnosed by a retinal
             specialist or ocular oncologist. NOTE: Patients with cutaneous melanoma, acral
             melanoma, mucosal melanoma, or conjunctival melanoma are ineligible.

          5. Patients must have ocular melanoma that is considered high-risk for recurrence as
             defined by one of the following criteria:

               -  Gene Expression Profile using 15-gene panel (Castle Bioscience) and be classified
                  as Class 2, or

               -  3-year recurrent risk of more than 50% as defined by Impact Genetics, or

               -  Monosomy of chromosome 3 with apical tumor height &gt; 8mm (53).

          6. Archival tumor tissue is required for subjects that have had enucleation; subjects
             that have had enucleation but do not have available archival tissue are not eligible
             for participation. Archival tissue is required if available for subjects that have not
             had enucleation; if not available these patients are still eligible.

          7. Patients must have undergone an adequate treatment for the primary ocular melanoma
             deemed appropriate by the treating physician.

          8. All disease must be treated with no clinical, or radiologic evidence of residual
             ocular melanoma. All participants must have disease-free status documented by a
             complete physical examination and imaging studies within 4 weeks prior to
             registration. Imaging studies must include CT or MRI scans of the chest, abdomen, and
             pelvis. Brain MRI should be performed only as clinically indicated. NOTE: Participants
             with equivocal nodes ≥ 10 mm and &lt; 15 mm in a short axis may be eligible after if
             confirmation with histology/cytology is available. If risk of biopsy is too high or
             biopsy is not feasible, two sequential CT or MRI scans should be available and showing
             no signs of progressive and measurable disease or PET/CT demonstrating no FDG uptake.
             The second scan should occur at least 4 weeks after the initial scan. Lymph nodes ≥ 10
             mm in a short axis are defined as pathological. Nodes that have a short axis &lt;10 mm
             are considered non-pathological.

          9. Patients must be registered within 180 days of the last treatment performed to render
             the patient free of disease.

         10. Patient may have received prior radiation therapy to the primary site, including after
             the surgical resection. No systemic radiation for metastatic ocular melanoma is
             permitted.

         11. Subject re-enrollment: This study permits the re-enrollment of a participant who has
             discontinued the study as a screen failure. If re-enrolled, the participant must be
             re-consented

         12. Demonstrate adequate organ function as defined in the table below. All screening labs
             to be obtained within 28 days prior to registration.

                  g/dl is acceptable)

               -  Serum creatinine ≤ 1.5 x institutional upper limit normal (IULN) OR eGFR &gt;
                  30mL/min for participant with creatinine levels &gt; 1.5 x ULN

               -  Bilirubin ≤ 1.5 x IULN (except subjects with Gilbert Syndrome who can have total
                  bilirubin ≥ 3.0 mg/dL)

               -  Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) ≤ 3.0 x IULN

               -  Alkaline phosphatase ≤ 2.5 IULN

         14. Females of childbearing potential must have a negative serum pregnancy test at
             screening and within 24 hours prior to initiation of study treatment. NOTE: Females
             are considered of child bearing potential unless they are surgically sterile (have
             undergone a hysterectomy, bilateral tubal ligation, or bilateral oophorectomy) or they
             are naturally postmenopausal for at least 12 consecutive months.

             contraception from the time of informed consent until 5 months after last dose of
             study drug (females) and 7 months after last dose of study drug for (males). The two
             contraception methods can be comprised of two barrier methods, or a barrier method
             plus a hormonal method.

         16. As determined by the enrolling physician or protocol designee, ability of the subject
             to understand and comply with study procedures for the entire length of the study

             to enroll.

          5. Subjects with a condition requiring systemic treatment with either corticosteroids (&gt;
             10 mg daily prednisone equivalents) or other immunosuppressive medications within 2

             replacement doses &lt; 10 mg daily prednisone equivalents are permitted in the absence of
             active autoimmune disease.

          6. Participants with previous malignancies are excluded unless a complete remission was
             achieved at 12 months prior to study entry and no additional therapy is required or
             anticipated to be required during the study period (exceptions include but are not
             limited to, non-melanoma skin cancers; in situ bladder cancer, in situ gastric cancer,

             infection (requiring systemic therapy), symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable
             angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that
             would limit compliance with study requirements.

         12. Patients known history of positive test for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) or
             known acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). Note: Testing for HIV must be
