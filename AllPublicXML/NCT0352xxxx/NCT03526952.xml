  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study investigates the feasibility and efficacy of an Internet-delivered intervention
      for the sexual and intimate re-adjustment of couples in which one partner is living with a
      permanent ostomy (e.g., colostomy, ileostomy) following treatment for colorectal cancer. The
      two session intervention will be delivered via online videoconferencing and will focus on
      facilitating couples' communication around their sexual and intimate relationship. Exercises
      from sex therapy will be used to scaffold conversations about motivations for having sex,
      intimacy and sensual pleasure, and relational strengths for coping. The intervention aims to
      enhance couples' ability to cope with the changes in their sexual and intimate relationship.
      A group of couples receiving written educational material only will be used as a comparison
      group to measure change in sexual and intimate adjustment over time .
