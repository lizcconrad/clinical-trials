    <textblock>
      The study evaluates the general anesthesia management with BIS monitorization in terms of
      hemodynamic stability, drug concentrations and drug consumption in patients who underwent
      surgery due to intracranial pathology and who were divided in three different GCS groups.

      BIS monitoring is mostly used for anesthesia depth and sedation level follow-up, however it
      can also be used for monitoring consciousness after resuscitation of cases with acute brain
      injury and cardiac arrest. It is not always possible to monitor and objectively measure the
      changes in the level of consciousness in clinical practice. Therefore, device-based methods
      have been introduced in monitoring the state of consciousness. Bispectral index (BIS)
      monitoring may be preferred in follow up of the state of consciousness in critical patients
      such as those with acute brain injury, in terms of ease of use, ability to obtain numerical
      results and continuous monitoring. BIS monitoring is mostly used for follow up of anesthesia
      depth and sedation level, while it can also be applied for monitoring state of consciousness
      following resuscitation in cases with acute brain injury and cardiac arrest.In this study, we
      aimed to investigate general anesthesia management performed by bispectral index monitoring
      in patients who underwent surgery due to intracranial pathology and with different Glasgow
      Coma Scales.
