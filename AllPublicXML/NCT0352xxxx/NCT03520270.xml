      It is known that patients in the terminal period will not benefit mostly from the treatment
      of intensive care units (ICU). However, life saving treatments are being performed. The
      treatments, which will not change the outcome but increase burden are named as potentially
      inappropriate treatments. These treatments wastes valuable ICU resources. In Turkey due to
      ethical and legal concerns potentially inappropriate treatments are prevalent.

      This study is an observational, one day, point prevalence study; Primary outcome is the
      incidence of patients in intensive care units in Turkey in the terminal phase, Secondary
      purpose; to compare the resource use at the terminal and non-terminal patients, and to
      investigate the reliability of END-of-Life Scoring System (ENDING-S) by Curtis et al.
