    <textblock>
      The primary outcome measure of the study is to demonstrate the safety and tolerability of
      GSK1070806 in the Behcet's disease population at 24 weeks, with biochemical and clinical
      efficacy and mechanistic studies to further explore the pathogenesis of Behcet's disease
      important secondary and exploratory outcomes.
