  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      PSMA PET/CT has demonstrated higher sensitivity in detecting metastases than current imaging
      standard of care (CT and bone scan). [18F]DCFPyL is a promising high-sensitivity second
      generation PSMA-targeted urea-based PET probe. The hypothesis is that definitive radiotherapy
      (RT) informed by PSMA-PET findings will lead to improved cancer control outcomes compared to
      RT guided by conventional staging only. This study utilizes cmRCT design in companion to PERA
      (Partnership initiative for the Evaluation of technological innovation in Radiotherapy).

If no additional lesions detected: RT as planned per standard care.
If PSMA-PET/CT imaging consistent with oligometastases (1-5 lesions): all lesions must be treated with definitive RT.
If PSMA-PET/CT imaging consistent with widely metastatic disease (&gt;5 lesions): treatment of all detected disease with RT is not recommended, but treatment of the primary site as initially planned is encouraged.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Enrolled in PERA (CHUM CER 17.0.32) and consented to contact for investigational
             trials.

          2. Histological diagnosis of prostate cancer planned for curative-intent radiotherapy.

          3. ECOG 0-1

          4. Charlson Cormobidity Index ≤ 4

          5. High-risk of distant metastases as defined by any of:

               1. Oligometastases (≤5) (regional or distant) identified on conventional staging,
                  with ≤ 3 metastasis in any non-bone organ. For a spine metastasis, direct
                  involvement of adjacent spinal segments would still be considered as &quot;one&quot;
                  tumour. For nodal metastases, more than one involved lymph node in the same
                  ipsilateral nodal region/chain would still count as &quot;one&quot; tumour. Defined nodal
                  regions for this protocol include inguinal, external iliac, internal iliac,
                  common iliac, retroperitoneal, hilar/mediastinal, anterior cervical, posterior
                  cervical, and axillary. Metastases in all other organs that are within 1cm of
                  each other will be considered as &quot;one&quot; tumour.

               2. Subjects with newly diagnosed high-risk (NCCN) localized prostate cancer and
                  CAPRA score 6-10.

               3. Subjects with a prior history of treated prostate cancer (RP or RT), and
                  biochemical failure (Phoenix-RT or&gt;0.2ng/ml-RP)

          6. Standard staging (bone scan, CT pelvis) within 12 weeks of consent.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Prior androgen deprivation therapy terminated &lt; 12 months prior to enrollment.

          2. Prior or planned PET scan.
