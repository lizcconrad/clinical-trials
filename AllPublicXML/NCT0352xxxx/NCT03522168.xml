  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose is to evaluate the long-term pathologic weight changes associated with multi-year
      risperidone or aripiprazole therapy in 3 - &lt;18-year-old children, who have varying durations
      of prior antipsychotic drug exposure from the start of study Month 0 (M0). This is critical
      because children appear to have greater vulnerability to antipsychotic-associated weight gain
      than adults, and obesity has significant effects on morbidity and mortality.

      Prospective, multi-site, Phase 4, observational study designed to systematically collect
      longitudinal post-marketing safety data. Assessments will occur every 3 months for up to 36
      months with in-person, clinic-based assessments at months 0, 6, 12, 18, 24, 30, and 36,
      alternating with remote interim visits occurring at months 3, 9, 15, 21, 27, and 33. The
      remote interim assessments may be collected using electronic patient-reported outcome via an
      electronic device, paper (sent to site), or a phone call with the site staff. The
      participant, his/her guardian, and the participant's personal psychotropic-prescribing
      medical provider (PPPMP) will make any and all decisions related to antipsychotic
      medications; any other medications; and the participant's current mental state,
      developmental/psychiatric condition, and level of risk for potential harm to self or others
      independent of the study procedures and assessments. Study staff (SS) will share lab results,
      medically concerning changes in AEs and the participant's clinical presentation as assessed
      during in-person visits, and positive responses to key safety questions from the remote
      interim assessments with the participant's PPPMP and guardian (at in-person assessments). If
      an emergency safety concern is evident during a clinic visit, the study medical clinician
      (SMC) will immediately assess the participant, following medical standard-of-care procedures,
      to determine whether the participant is safe to leave the clinic or requires additional
      emergency care. If new or worsening symptoms are reported by the participant or guardian
      during remote interim assessments, guardians will be instructed to contact their PPPMP
      directly.

The 23-item PedsQL Generic Core Scales were designed to measure the core dimensions of health as delineated by the World Health Organization in individuals aged 2 years and older. The main scales include physical functioning, emotional functioning, social functioning, and school functioning. Summary scores can also be utilized to measure change over time on a five point scale for 0 = &quot;Never a Problem&quot; to 5 = &quot;Almost Always a Problem&quot;. The guardian will be asked to complete the parent version for reporting on their child's quality of life.</description>

    <description>Relationship of risperidone or aripiprazole therapy to adaptive functioning and quality of life as assessed by the Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scale standard scores and changes in the intensity or frequency of pre-existing behavioral problems indicated at M0 (baseline). The Vineland-3 contains five overarching domains: communication, daily living skills, socialization, motor skills, and maladaptive behavior (optional). The domain scores yield an adaptive behavior composite score, which will be the main measure of functional change. Children who are continuing on a normal developmental trajectory would not be expected to show any change in standard scores in each of the domains, whereas those who had developmental delays related to an underlying mental illness may show increased standard scores if treatment allows them to begin to make greater developmental progress than prior to treatment.</description>

The DTFS is a uni-dimensional, single item scale that will be used to assess the participant's perceived life quality. Faces expressing various feelings are depicted, and the participant is asked which face comes closest to expressing how he/she feels about his/her life over the past month. The participant can then select from the range of seven categorical faces depicting from one-delighted to seven-terrible expressions. This scale is included because it can be easily completed by participants with limited verbal and cognitive abilities as well as by very young children.</description>

    <description>Relationship of risperidone or aripiprazole therapy to adaptive functioning and quality of life as assessed ) by the Caregiver Strain Questionnaire (CSQ) and changes in the intensity or frequency of pre-existing behavioral problems indicated at M0 (baseline). This is a 21-item questionnaire with a categorical scale ranging from 1 (not at all a problem) to 5 (very much a problem) that assesses the caregiver's quality of life. It asks specifically about the caregiver's quality of life by assessing the impact of caring for a child with emotional and behavioral problems. The questions include information about disruption of family life and relationships; demands on time; negative, mental, and physical health effects for any family member; financial strain; feelings of sacrifice; disruption of social/community life; worry/guilt; fatigue/strain; and embarrassment.</description>
