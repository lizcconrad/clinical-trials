  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Investigators will conduct a randomized trial to determine if providing patient-specific life
      expectancy estimates during treatment counseling via a targeted, patient-centered
      communication approach improves shared decision making and reduces rates of overtreatment of
      genitourinary malignancies.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Subjects in the intervention arm will be provided with life expectancy estimates specific to
      their age and health status. Life expectancy estimates for prostate and kidney cancer
      patients will be estimated by age and Charlson comorbidity score cutoffs (1,2), and life
      expectancy for bladder cancer patients will be determined using definitions as noted by Cho
      et al (3). Talking points will be provided to counseling physicians on how to meaningfully
      communicate life expectancy data. Subjects will also complete a computer-based conjoint
      analysis exercise prior to the counseling visit; results will be used to help physicians
      understand how the subject values life expectancy compared with other decision attributes
      (4). The control arm will consist of the current standard of care for treatment counseling.

      The intervention will be randomized at the level of the patient after stratification by type
      of cancer.

      All participants will be asked to fill out a validated questionnaire to measure decisional
      conflict at the conclusion of their counseling visit (5). Investigators will audiotape
      treatment counseling visits to allow for qualitative analysis of the quality of communication
      of life expectancy information. Treatment choice will be documented to assess rates of
      aggressive versus non-aggressive treatment among patients with limited life expectancy.

    <intervention_model_description>This randomized controlled trial will involve two arms: (1) an intervention arm consisting of a patient-centered communication strategy for life expectancy and (2) standard of care treatment counseling. The intervention will be randomized at the level of the patient to balance study arms in terms of measured and unmeasured patient characteristics.</intervention_model_description>
