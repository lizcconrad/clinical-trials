  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase I trial studies how well ibrutinib and nivolumab work in treating participants
      with solid tumors that have spread to other places in the body. Ibrutinib may stop the growth
      of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Monoclonal antibodies,
      such as nivolumab, may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Giving
      ibrutinib and nivolumab may work better in treating participants with solid tumors.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Evaluate the effect of the ibrutinib therapy on circulating levels of myeloid derived
      suppressor cells MDSC.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Assess safety of the study combination in study subjects.

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Evaluate the effect of the ibrutinib/nivolumab therapy on circulating levels of MDSC.

      II. Evaluate the effect of the ibrutinib and ibrutinib/nivolumab therapy on the
      immunosuppressive function of circulating MDSC by measuring their ability to inhibit T cell
      proliferation and natural killer cell mediated antibody dependent cell cytotoxicity.

      III. Study the effect of ibrutinib and ibrutinib/nivolumab therapy on levels of circulating
      innate and adaptive immune cells such as natural killer cell and T lymphocyte subsets.

      IV. Study circulating MDSC levels at the time of disease progression. V. Evaluate in a
      preliminary fashion the effect of the regimen on progression-free survival.

      OUTLINE:

      Participants receive ibrutinib orally (PO) daily for 15 days. After 7 days receiving
      ibrutinib, participants receive nivolumab intravenously (IV) over 60 minutes on days 1 and
      15. Courses with nivolumab repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or
      unaccepted toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, participants are followed up every 3 months.

    <time_frame>Up to 2 years</time_frame>
    <description>Will be summarized using descriptive statistics (N, mean, standard deviation, median, minimum, and maximum) and/or frequency and percentages for medically relevant categories.

    <measure>Progression free survival</measure>
    <time_frame>Interval from study enrollment to first documented disease progression according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors 1.1 or death from any cause (whichever occurs first), assessed at 1 year</time_frame>
    <description>One year progression free survival will be defined as proportion of patients who are free of disease progression or death (whichever occurs first) after 1 year of follow up. Progression free survival will be summarized using Kaplan and Meier methods, where patients who are event-free at the time of their last evaluation will be censored at that time point.</description>

  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Biomarker analysis</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 2 years</time_frame>
    <description>Will assess the association between the clinical responses and biomarkers/immune cell populations of interest will be identified using conventional techniques. These analyses will be primarily exploratory and hypothesis-generating. Will study the biomarker association with clinical outcomes using descriptive statistics, graphical methods and statistical modeling where appropriate. T-tests (continuous variables), chi-square or Fisher?s Exact tests (categorical variables), logistic regression models or Cox proportional hazard models will be used to explore associations between biomarkers/immune cell populations and clinical responses, whichever is appropriate. Pre and post treatment biomarkers will be compared using either paired t-tests or non-parametric tests if necessary.</description>
