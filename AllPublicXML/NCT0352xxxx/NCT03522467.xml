  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This project represents a first systematic, prospective, single-arm cohort study of a safe
      and effective dosing regimen of an orally administered cannabis oil formulation in a cancer
      subject population with poorly controlled pain.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Over a 1-2 year period, 40 cancer patients experiencing poorly controlled pain will be
      enrolled in to a prospective single-arm cohort study, in which they will receive an orally
      administered cannabis oil formulation as an add-on therapy to current treatment regimens.
      Subjects entering the acute study phase will be titrated to a tolerated dose at which a
      sustained pain response is reached, and may subsequently enter a 12 week chronic phase during
      which safety and durability of pain response will be assessed at their stable dose.
