  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Nearly 1 in 10 older Americans have dementia, which is a devastating condition that leads to
      a progressive loss of independence and functional status. Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is
      an intermediate stage between the expected cognitive decline of normal aging and the
      more-serious decline of dementia. The investigators have developed a novel, integrative
      exercise program called Preventing Loss of Independence through Exercise (PLIE) that
      incorporates elements from Eastern and Western exercise modalities and is designed to build
      and maintain the capacity to perform basic functional movements while increasing mindful body
      awareness and enhancing social connection. Pilot study results suggest that PLIE is
      associated with meaningful improvements in physical function, cognitive function and quality
      of life in individuals with dementia, as well as reduced caregiver burden. The goal of the
      current study is to perform a randomized, controlled trial to test the efficacy of PLIE in
      older adults who have MCI but who do not yet have dementia. The investigators will also
      investigate the neural mechanisms underlying PLIE by acquiring brain imaging measures.

      The goal of the proposed study is to perform a randomized, controlled trial (RCT) to test the
      efficacy of a novel integrative exercise program called Preventing Loss of Independence
      through Exercise (PLIE) on function and quality of life in older adults living in the
      community with Mild cognitive impairment (MCI), which is an intermediate stage between the
      expected cognitive decline of normal aging and the more-serious decline of dementia.

      Because current dementia medications have minimal impact on function and quality of life and
      do not stop or slow the disease course, it would be desirable if there were an intervention
      that could prevent or delay the onset of full-blown dementia. Moreover, there is growing
      evidence that behavioral interventions such as exercise have a variety of beneficial effects
      in individuals with dementia and MCI.

      PLIE was developed based on recent discoveries in neuroscience and experimental psychology
      that have found that, although explicit memory (the ability to consciously recall new
      information) is impaired in individuals with dementia, implicit memory (unconscious learning
      that typically occurs through repeated exposure) is relatively preserved. Therefore, PLIE
      focuses on training procedural memory (unconscious learning of procedures) to build the
      strength and capacity to perform the movements that are most needed for daily function (e.g.,
      transitioning safely from sitting to standing). In addition, to maximize the benefits of the
      training, PLIE integrates elements of Eastern and Western exercise modalities to develop
      mindful body awareness and enhance social connection.

      The investigators have completed a pilot study of the PLIE program at an adult day center in
      San Francisco, CA. Results suggest that PLIE was associated with clinically meaningful
      improvements in cognitive function, physical performance and quality of life as well as
      reduced caregiver burden when compared with usual care at the facility. The current study
      will enable the investigators to build on this pilot study results by performing a RCT of
      PLIE for individuals who have MCI but who do not yet have dementia.

      Study participants will be randomly assigned to receive the PLIE intervention program (1
      hour, 2 days/week, 4 months) or Usual Care (UC) control (standard senior center activities, 1
      hour, 2 days/week, 4 months) (N=40, 20/group) using a wait-list design. The co-primary
      outcomes are 4-month change in physical function (Short Physical Performance Battery, SPPB),
      cognitive function (Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale - cognitive subscale, ADAS-cog) and
      quality of life (Quality of Life in Alzheimer's Disease, QOL-AD). The investigators will also
      look at the 4-month change in the following neuroimaging measures: brain volume with
      structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), functional connectivity with resting-state
      functional MRI, cerebral perfusion with arterial-spin labeled MRI. To account for the
      wait-list design, all outcomes will be assessed at baseline, 4 months and 8 months.

      The proposed project will address a critically important health problem related to optimizing
      functional status and quality of life in older individuals with MCI. The current study will
      utilize rigorous research methods to test the efficacy of an innovative and promising new
      program for older adults with MCI. If the program is successful, the investigators will work
      with VA and community-based organizations to implement PLIE more broadly.

    <measure>Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB)</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline to 4 months</time_frame>
    <description>The SPPB was developed by the National Institute on Aging to provide an objective tool for measuring physical performance in older adults. Lower body strength is assessed based on time to complete 5 chair stands without using arms. Balance is assessed based on the ability to hold different stands for 10 seconds, including the side-by-side, semi-tandem and full tandem stands. Mobility is assessed based on usual walking speed over a 3-meter walking course. The total SPPB score is the sum of the 3 component scores and may range from 0 to 12. Prior studies have found that the SPPB is valid and reliable and associated with important outcomes including disability and mortality. A recent systematic review concluded that the SPPB was one of the best tools available to measure physical performance in older adults based on reliability, validity and responsiveness.</description>

    <description>The Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale - cognitive subscale (ADAS-cog) is one of the most commonly used outcome measures in dementia drug treatment trials and is one of the measures considered by the Food and Drug Administration for approval of dementia medications. It includes direct assessment of learning (10-word list), naming (objects), following commands, constructional praxis (figure copying), ideational praxis (mailing a letter), orientation (person, time, place), recognition memory and remembering test instructions and is scored on an 80-point scale with higher scores reflecting worse cognitive function. Prior studies have found the ADAS-cog to be valid and reliable with Cronbach's alpha greater than 0.8 and test-retest reliability above 0.9</description>

    <time_frame>baseline to 4 months</time_frame>
    <description>The Quality of Life Scale in Alzheimer's Disease (QOL-AD) is a standard quality of life measure that asks parallel questions of affected individuals and caregivers. Current quality of life is rated as poor (1 point), fair (2 points), good (3 points) or excellent (4 points) in 13 areas: physical health, energy, mood, living situation, memory, family, marriage, friends, self as a whole, ability to do chores around the house, ability to do things for fun, money, and life as a whole. Scores may range from 13 to 52 with higher scores reflecting better quality of life. Prior studies have found that the QOL-AD is a valid and reliable measure, with Cronbach's alpha of 0.84 for patient reports and 0.86 for caregiver reports and interrater reliability based on Cohen's kappa values &gt;0.70.</description>
