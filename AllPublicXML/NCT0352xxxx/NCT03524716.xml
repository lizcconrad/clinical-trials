  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There is a critical need for physical activity interventions in CRC. The investigators have
      developed a digital health physical activity intervention, Smart Pace, which includes a
      wearable tracker (Fitbit) and text messaging and aims to have patients build up to 150 min/wk
      of moderate activity. In this study, the investigators propose to expand and improve Smart
      Pace, including: 1) enrolling patients during chemotherapy; 2) tailoring text messages to
      individual preferences and treatment timing; and 3) adding resources to support home-based
      exercise. The study is a 12-week pilot randomized controlled trial (RCT) to evaluate the
      feasibility of this novel digital health physical activity intervention among 48 CRC patients
      on chemotherapy. The specific aims are to: 1) Determine the feasibility of the intervention
      via adherence and attrition, and determine the acceptability of the intervention via
      questionnaires and semi-structured interviews . 2) Estimate the effect of the intervention
      vs. usual care on physical activity, QOL, and symptoms at 12-weeks . And 3) Explore the
      impact of the intervention vs. usual care on fitness, weight, waist circumference, and blood
      pressure at 12-weeks.
