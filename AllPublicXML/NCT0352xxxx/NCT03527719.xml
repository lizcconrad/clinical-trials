    <textblock>
      China Rural Hypertension Control (CRHC)Project is a cluster randomized trial to test the
      effectiveness of a standard treatment protocol on hypertension control and stroke events.The
      investigators will select a total of 332 villages in China: 232 in the northeastern, 40 in
      eastern, 40 in central, and 20 in western China.The investigators will recruit 36,520
      participants with hypertension (110 participants per village) who are aged 40-years and
      older. The study villages will be randomly assigned to the standard protocol treatment group
      (166 villages) or the usual management group (166 villages). The village doctors in the
      intervention group will be trained to manage hypertension using a standard protocol based on
      the new hypertension treatment guideline and those in the control group will not receive
      training on the standard treatment protocol. The standard treatment protocol is based on the
      2017 ACC(American College of Cardiology)/AHA(American Heart Association) hypertension
      treatment guideline and our previous experience in hypertension management and treatment
      strategies in rural China. Blood pressure and other clinical outcomes will measurement every
      six months. The project will have two phases. The first one will last for 12 months and blood
      pressure control is the primary outcome. The phase 2 will last for 36 months and
      cardiovascular event rate is the primary outcome.

    <description>Through the provision of preferential anti-hypertensive drugs to the participants in the intervention group, the increase of Medicare reimbursement proportion for hypertension is simulated to provide affordable, effective free antihypertensive drugs to the participants with poor economic conditions in the management population. Through the measures above, the participants' compliance with medication will be improved.
The project will select the best antihypertensive drugs for rural patients, and to implement preferential policies for buying gifts. At the same time, inexpensive and effective free antihypertensive drugs including nitrendipine tablets, captopril tablets and indapamide tablets will be supplied to the impoverished hypertensive patients free of charge.</description>
