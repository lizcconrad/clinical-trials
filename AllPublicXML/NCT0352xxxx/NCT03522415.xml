      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Subjects who are voluntary to participate in the study and sign a written ICF, and
             willing and able to follow the study protocol (e.g. able to understand and complete
             the questionnaire, follow the visit plan and use the drug).

          2. 18 years ≤ age ≤75 years, male or female.

          3. Subjects who are diagnosed with moderately to severely active RA with a course of
             disease of at least 6 months, DAS28 CRP &gt; 3.2 at Screening, and at least 6 swollen
             joints (based on 66 joints) and 6 tender joints (based on 68 joints) at Screening and
             Baseline (Day 1) visit. If a joint has both swollen and tender symptoms, then this
             joint should be included in both the SJC and TJC (except for artificial joints).

          4. MTX-IR: Subjects must be currently receiving MTX 10-25 mg/week for at least 12 weeks
             and have been on a stable dose for at least 4 weeks prior to study entry (Day 1). MTX
             needs to be given at a stable dose throughout the study, unless dose adjustments are
             made for safety reasons.

          5. The accepted RA treatment must meet the following conditions:

               1. Subjects are willing to receive oral folic acid therapy (at least 5 mg/week or at
                  a dose determined based on local medical practice) or equivalent medications
                  (combination medications necessary for MTX therapy) during the entire study, and
                  the dose of folic acid or equivalent medications should be stable for a minimum
                  of 4 weeks prior to the start of study treatment (Day 1).

               2. If the subject has been previously treated with traditional disease-modifying
                  anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs) other than MTX: leflunomide should be discontinued
                  at least 8 weeks prior to the start of study treatment (Day 1), but if they have
                  received standard cholestyramine elution treatment for 11 days, leflunomide will
                  need to be discontinued at least 4 weeks prior to the start of study treatment
                  (Day 1); other DMARDs will need to be discontinued at least 4 weeks prior to the
                  start of study treatment (Day 1). These drugs are not allowed to be used
                  throughout the study.

                  * Standard cholestyramine elution treatment: cholestyramine 8 g orally, three
                  times daily for 11 consecutive days.

               3. If the subject is being treated with Tripterygium wilfordii, the drug should be
                  discontinued at least 2 weeks prior to the start of study treatment (Day 1) and
                  is not allowed to be used throughout the study.

               4. If the subject is receiving oral glucocorticoid treatment, the dose should not
                  exceed prednisolone 10 mg/day (or equivalent dose of other glucocorticoids), and
                  the dose should have been stable for at least 4 weeks prior to the start of study
                  treatment (Day 1) and remain stable throughout the 24-week treatment period
                  (except for those receiving rescue treatment); if already discontinued, oral
                  glucocorticoids should have been discontinued for at least 2 weeks prior to the
                  start of study treatment (Day 1).

               5. Glucocorticoid treatment via intra-articular or injection administration is not
                  allowed within 6 weeks prior to the start of study treatment (Day 1) and during
                  treatment (until Week 24), except for methylprednisolone 80 mg intravenously
                  administered prior to study drug infusion (as this is part of the study process).

               6. Any non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) must have been on a stable
                  dose for a minimum of 2 weeks prior to the start of study treatment (Day 1) and
                  remain on a stable dose throughout the 24-week treatment period (except for those
                  receiving rescue treatment); if already discontinued, NSAIDs should have been
                  discontinued for at least 2 weeks prior to the start of study treatment (Day 1).

          6. Eligible subjects must meet the following screening criteria for tuberculosis:

               1. The subject has no active tuberculosis.

               2. The subject has no occult tuberculosis infection.

               3. QUANTIFERON®-TB Gold test is negative at Screening.

               4. If the QUANTIFERON®-TB Gold test result is indeterminate, a repeat test is
                  needed. If it is still indeterminate upon retest, the Investigator should make a
                  comprehensive judgment based on the subject's symptoms and signs, history of
                  exposure to TB patients and chest X-ray examination. If active tuberculosis is
                  excluded, the subject can be enrolled.

          7. Women of childbearing potential * must agree to take reliable contraceptives during
             the study and 12 months following trial completion or termination (e.g., hormonal

             Subjects without childbearing potential refer to female subjects who have been
             menopausal for at least 2 years or have undergone total hysterectomy, bilateral tubal
             ligation or bilateral salpingo-tubal resection and/or bilateral ovariectomy, or who
             have congenital infertility.)

          8. Men whose partners are women of childbearing potential are required to take reliable
             contraception during th study and 12 months following trial completion or termination,
