      Primary objective:

      To evaluate the efficacy of subcutaneous (SC) administration of tralokinumab compared with
      placebo in treating adolescent subjects (age 12 to &lt;18 years) with moderate-to-severe AD.

      Secondary objectives:

      To evaluate the efficacy of tralokinumab on severity and extent of AD, itch, and
      health-related quality of life compared with placebo.

      To investigate the safety, immunogenicity, and tolerability of SC administration of
      tralokinumab compared with placebo when used to treat adolescent subjects (age 12 to &lt;18
      years) with moderate-to-severe AD.

    <masking_description>Neither the subject nor any of the investigator or LEO staff who are involved in the treatment or clinical evaluation and monitoring of the subjects will be aware of the treatment received. The packaging and labelling of the investigational medicinal products (IMPs) will contain no evidence of their identity. Since tralokinumab and placebo are visually distinct and not matched for viscosity, IMP will be handled and administered by a qualified, unblinded healthcare professional at the site who will not be involved in the management of trial subjects and who will not perform any of the assessments.</masking_description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Investigator's Global Assessment (IGA) score of 0 (clear) or 1 (almost clear) at Week 16.</measure>
    <time_frame>16 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The IGA is an instrument used in clinical trials to rate the severity of the subject's global AD and is based on a 5-point scale ranging from 0 (clear) to 4 (severe).</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>At least 75% reduction in Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI75) at Week 16.</measure>
    <time_frame>16 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The EASI is a validated measure used in clinical practice and clinical trials to assess the severity and extent of AD. The EASI is a composite index with scores ranging from 0 to 72, with higher values indicating more severe and/or more extensive condition.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Scoring Atopic Dermatitis (SCORAD) from baseline to Week 16.</measure>
    <time_frame>16 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The SCORAD is a validated tool to evaluate the extent and severity of AD lesions, along with subjective symptoms. The maximum total score is 103, with higher values indicating more severe disease.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Reduction of Adolescent Pruritus numeric rating scale (NRS) (weekly average) of at least 4 from baseline to Week 16.</measure>
    <time_frame>16 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Adolescent Pruritus NRS is used by subjects to assess their worst itch over the past 24 hours using an 11-point NRS with 0 indicating 'no itch' and 10 indicating 'worst itch possible'.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Children's Dermatology Life Quality Index (CDLQI) score from baseline to Week 16.</measure>
    <time_frame>16 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The CDLQI is a validated questionnaire with content specific to those with dermatology conditions. It consists of 10 items addressing the subject's perception of the impact of their skin disease on various aspects of their quality of life over the last week such as dermatology-related symptoms and feelings, leisure, school or holidays, personal relationships, sleep, and the treatment. Each item is scored on a 4-point Likert scale (0 = 'not at all'; 1 = 'only a little'; 2 = 'quite a lot'; 3 = 'very much'). Item 7 (on school time) has one additional response category 'prevented school', which is also scored '3'. The total score of the CDLQI is the sum of the 10 items (0 to 30); a high score is indicative of a poor quality of life.</description>
