  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, double-blind, 3-arm, parallel-group single-dose study to compare the
      PK, PD, safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of LusiNEX (Mycenax tocilizumab) versus
      RoActemra (EU tocilizumab) and Actemra (US tocilizumab) after a single IV infusion of 4 mg/kg
      in healthy volunteers (hereafter referred to as subjects). The therapeutic dose of
      tocilizumab starts with 4 mg/kg and ranges to 12 mg/kg, considering 4 mg/kg is the lowest
      dose, the same has been selected for the study.

    <description>Tocilizumab is a recombinant human monoclonal antibody of the immunoglobulin G1 subclass, directed against the IL-6 ligand specific receptor. By preventing the binding of IL-6 to its receptor, tocilizumab inhibits the biological activity of IL-6. Tocilizumab was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (4 mg/kg with an increase to 8 mg/kg based upon clinical response) for the treatment of adult patients with moderate to severe active rheumatoid arthritis, who have had inadequate response to one or more tissue necrotizing factor (TNF) antagonist therapies. Tocilizumab is currently approved in 95 countries for the treatment of adult onset moderate to severe rheumatoid arthritis.</description>
