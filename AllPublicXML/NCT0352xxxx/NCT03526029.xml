    <textblock>
      The Swiss Conference of Cantonal Health Directors has transferred the planning of highly
      specialized medicine to a specialized body under the direction of the Swiss Academy of
      Sciences. This specialist body has defined the treatment of critically ill as part of highly
      specialized medicine and founded the Swiss Trauma Registry at 12 hospitals in Switzerland.
      The registry is designed to provide a consistent and standardized approach and treatment
      outcomes in the short and long term quality control and as a basis for planning highly
      specialized medicine.
