  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Anaphylaxis is an acute serious allergic reaction, with multi-organ system manifestations
      caused by the release of chemical mediators and it is potentially fatal [1, 2].

      Between 5% and 14% of patients may experience a recurrence of anaphylaxis 8-12 hours after
      the initial presentation, called biphasic (late-phase) [14].

      The mainstay of treatment for children experiencing anaphylaxis remains adrenaline and
      H1-antihistamines. Corticosteroids are not life-saving and do not have an immediate effect on
      the symptoms of anaphylaxis but may help reduce or prevent a biphasic &quot;late phase&quot; reaction
      (24.26).

      The aim of this study is to compare the efficacy of oral glucocorticoids in prevention of the
      second phase or biphasic reaction of anaphylaxis, as compared to placebo in children,
      presenting to the pediatric emergency department (PEC Al-Sadd) with mild to moderate
      anaphylaxis (Prospective Study).

      Patients will be randomized to either one of the two treatment:

      Treatment 1: Dexamethasone 0.6mg/kg oral. Treatment 2 : Placebo All patients will be urgently
      treated for anaphylaxis according to guideline protocol. Enrolled patients will be given one
      of the study medications orally, and he /she will observe in the observation room with
      cardiac monitor and close monitoring by nurse.

      The treating physician will discharge patient when he/she looks well, breathing comfortably,
      has oxygen saturation &gt;94%, stable blood pressure and no gastrointestinal or neurological
      manifestation.

      Discharge patients will be sent home on anti-histamine (cetirizine) for 5days. All patients
      will be followed up for one week post discharge by a phone call asking about the general
      condition, relapse of symptoms, or need for readmission.

      Anaphylaxis is an acute serious allergic reaction, with multi-organ system manifestations
      caused by the release of chemical mediators [1,2]. It requires immediate recognition and
      intervention.

      The estimated rate of anaphylaxis in children was 10.5 per 100,000 persons-years [3].
      Although the Rochester Epidemiology Project showed a rate of 75.1 per 100,000 person-years in
      children aged 9 years and 65.2 per 100,000 person-years in children aged 10-19-years old (4).

      In the state of Qatar with approximately 280,000 visits annually to Pediatric Emergency
      Center (PEC), there were 171 cases of anaphylaxis seen at the facility from September 2015 to
      September 2016.

      Anaphylaxis is a clinical diagnosis based on typical systemic manifestations, due to exposure
      to a causative agent. There are many possible triggers, including food, medication, insect
      venoms, rubber latex and vaccines (5, 6). In some individuals, anaphylaxis is idiopathic (7).
      Both IgE and non-IgE activation of mast cells and basophils that results in the release and
      production of several inflammatory and vasoactive substances, these substances most commonly
      involve the skin, respiratory, cardiovascular, and gastrointestinal systems. As a result,
      urticarial, angioedema, bronchospasm, laryngospasm, increased vascular permeability and
      decreased vascular tone (8).

      Anaphylaxis involves a range of signs and symptoms from hives, wheezing and angioedema to
      cardiovascular collapse and death [9,10]. More than 80% of the patients will present with
      flushing, itching, hives, angioedema, or other skin or mucosal symptoms. Generally up to 70%,
      at least 2 organ systems (skin, respiratory, cardiovascular, gastrointestinal systems) are
      involved; however, only 10-45% have cardiovascular symptoms, including chest pain,
      hypotension, or shock (11,12,13). Between 5% and 14% of patients may experience a recurrence
      of anaphlactoid reaction 8-12 hours after the initial presentation, called Biphasic
      (late-phase) [14,15]. Most of these reactions are mild or moderate (16-17). Risk factors for
      biphasic reactions include a severe initial reaction; presence of laryngeal edema or
      hypotension; delay in the administration of adrenaline (epinephrine); too small a dose of
      adrenaline; and a history of a previous biphasic reaction (18-19). Delayed symptoms can
      develop despite treatment [20].

      The mainstay of treatment for children experiencing anaphylaxis remains adrenaline 1:1000
      intramuscularly (IM) (11-21). H1-antihistamines are also commonly administered in
      anaphylaxis. The combination of H1 and H2 antihistamines appears to be more effective,
      especially for cutaneous symptoms [8, 22, 23]. The onset of activity of these agents is
      slower than epinephrine and is considered next-in-line treatment.

      International guidelines consider antihistamines and glucocorticoids as second-line [24, 25,
      26]. Corticosteroids are not life-saving and do not have an immediate effect on the symptoms
      of anaphylaxis, since it takes 4-6 hours to work. (24.26,27,28) Glucocorticoids are
      administered to 50% of individuals with anaphylaxis, despite a lack of compelling evidence
      supporting their use.(29) Recent retrospective study in emergency department, evaluated the
      association between glucocorticoids administration and prolonged length of stay. In 4years
      retrospective chart review study on anaphylaxis patient, 70% of study patients received
      glucocorticoids as part of their treatment. Glucocorticoids were not found to reduce follow
      up revisit in the three days post discharge. And it didn't decrease the likelihood of extra
      epinephrine need for flare of symptoms, and only found to decrease length of stay in severe
      anaphylaxis.(29)

      The existing evidence for the use of glucocorticoids appears to consist mainly of
      retrospective studies, case reports, and other descriptive literature. The need exists,
      however, for a prospective study on the use of glucocorticoids in the treatment of
      anaphylaxis and its effectiveness in prevention of biphasic reaction. The objective of the
      current study, therefore, is to complement the current research on anaphylaxis and to
      investigate if glucocorticoids are effective in the treatment of anaphylaxis and if it can
      prevent or limit biphasic reaction.

      This will be the first randomized controlled trial to look at steroid use in anaphylaxis and
      its impact on anaphylaxis treatment on a prospective fashion which will be used to help
      standardize care in the use of steroid for this common condition.
