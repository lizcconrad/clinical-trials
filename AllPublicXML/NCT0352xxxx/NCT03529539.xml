  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A single patient protocol for intermediate grade nonfunctional metastatic pancreatic
      neuroendocrine disease that has exhausted all standard therapy having progressed on
      chemotherapy and immunotherapy.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This patient will receive intratumoral injection of an oncolytic virus called PSV2 (short for
      Personalized Virus-2) every other week until the occurrence of immune related RECIST
      progression, intolerable toxicity, change to another anti-cancer treatment due to lack of
      apparent benefit, or personal choice.
