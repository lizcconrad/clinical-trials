  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The World Health Organization recommend all stable low birth weight neonates to have
      Skin-to-skin-Contact (SSC) after birth. Intermittent SSC is used in Sweden in neonatal units.
      Observations indicate that SSC makes neonates feel good. However, there is limited research
      done on SSC treatment on neonates born prior to week 33.

      The aim of this study is to investigate whether Skin-to-skin-Contact (SSC) leads to an
      improved physiological stabilization, altered epigenetic profile and improved longterm
      psychomotor outcome in neonates born in gestation age between week 28+0 - 32+6. This is a
      parallel, two-arm, multicentre, randomized controlled superiority trial. The two arms to be
      compared are a) immediate SSC with one parent/caregiver continous during the first 6 hours
      after birth and as much as possible during the first 72 hours, and b) conventional method of
      care during the same time.
