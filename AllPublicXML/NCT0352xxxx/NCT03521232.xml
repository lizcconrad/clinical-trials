  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This will be a phase I/IIa, open-label, three-stage, single center study aimed at
      investigating the safety, the efficacy (clinical and endoscopic effects) and the
      pharmacokinetics of Niclosamide enema 150 mg/60 ml and 450 mg/60 ml in subjects with
      mild-to-moderate UP and UPS, defined as a Modified Mayo Score (MMS) ≥ 4 and &lt; 8, with a stool
      frequency subscore (SFS) ≥ 1, a rectal bleeding sub-score (RBS) = 1 or 2, and an endoscopic
      subscore (mucosal appearance) = 1 or 2. At the endoscopic sub-score any degree of friability
      will be classified as having a sub-scale score of 2.
