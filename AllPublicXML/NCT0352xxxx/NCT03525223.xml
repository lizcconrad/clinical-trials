  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Salt (NaCl) intake is implicated in causing hypertension and cardiovascular disease, the
      commonest cause of death worldwide. The investigators recently established that Na+ is stored
      in tissues, bound to glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) in skin and muscle. The resulting local
      hypertonicity leads to immune cell-driven induction of local tissue electrolyte clearance via
      modulation of cutaneous lymph capillary density. To visualize these complex processes in man
      directly, the investigators established Na+ magnetic resonance imaging (23Na-MRI) and
      investigated Na+ stores in hemodialysis (HD) patients. Hemodialysis patients were
      sodium-&quot;overloaded&quot; and HD treatment lowered tissue Na+ stores in this study. The observed
      effects were highly variable and independent of Na+ or water removal from the body during a
      dialysis session. Tissue Na+ mobilization correlated with circulating vascular endothelial
      growth factor-C (VEGF-C). The investigators believe that excessive Na+ storage is a
      reversible condition and therefore susceptible for therapeutic interventions. The
      investigators hypothesize that lowering dialysate Na+ concentration may favorably affect
      accelerated tissue Na+ accumulation in hemodialysis patients. Besides, improved tissue Na+
      storage, osmostress-induced as well as pro-inflammatory immune cell response should be
      affected by such a revised dialysis management.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      To evaluate effects of moderate reduction of dialysate Na+ concentration on tissue Na+
      content the investigators intend to recruit 40 hemodialysis patients, who will be offered a
      therapeutic change of their dialysate Na+ concentration. After detection of tissue Na+
      content using 23Na-MRI technique, the applied dialysate [Na+] will be initially increased
      stepwise by 2 mmol/l per week from 138 to 142 mmol/l and maintained for a period of 5 weeks.
      After another 23Na-MRI measurement, dialysate [Na+] will then be lowered stepwise by 1-2
      mmol/l per week to a minimum of 135 mmol/l, which will be also maintained for a period of 5
      weeks followed by a final 23Na-MRI assessment.

      Hypothesis: Reduction of dialysate Na+ concentration will decrease tissue sodium storage.

      Additionally, the investigators will assess changes in body fluid distribution by
      bioimpedance spectroscopy. Furthermore, vascular compliance in response to the modulation of
      dialysate [Na+] and its correlation with tissue Na+ will be assessed. To investigate the
      immune response to tissue Na+ accumulation, the osmostress-induced as well as
      pro-inflammatory immune cell response of isolated monocytes will be quantified.
