    <measure>Wrinkle Severity Rating Scale (WSRS) Evaluation for the nasolabial folds</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline at month 1, 6 and 12</time_frame>
    <description>The Wrinkle Severity Rating Scale (WSRS) is a 5-point reference scale with photographs that classifies deep facial wrinkles (Nasolabial Folds). The grading is performed on both sides to give a reliable and reproducible gradation of the depth of the folds. The grading of the wrinkles is made by the investigator according to the following grades:
Grade 1 No visible nasolabial folds; continuous skin line Grade 2 Shallow but visible nasolabial folds with a slight indentation Grade 3 Moderate deep nasolabial folds; visible at normal appearance Grade 4 Very long and deep nasolabial folds; prominent facial feature ;&lt; 2mm visible fold if stretched Grade 5 Extreme deep long nasolabial folds; 2-4mm V shaped fold if stretched</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Global Aesthetic Improvement Scale (GAIS) Evaluation</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline at month 1, 6 and 12</time_frame>
    <description>The GAIS scale (&quot;Global Aesthetic Improvement Scale&quot;) is a judgment scale noting the apparent overall aesthetic improvement, in comparison with the aspect observed before the injection (on a photograph taken during the day of inclusion). Rating categories are: &quot;Worse&quot;; &quot;No change&quot;; &quot;Slightly improved&quot;, &quot;Much improved&quot;; &quot;Very much improved&quot;.
Evaluations are carried out by the investigator but also by the subject himself according to the same criteria.</description>
