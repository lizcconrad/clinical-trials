  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The scope of this study is to compare the efficacy of the new oral formulation of Fe-ASP to
      oral ferrous sulfate in patients with iron deficiency anemia (IDA) for the restoration of
      decreased circulating Hb. The improvement of symptoms of anemia, the restoration of
      biomarkers of iron deficiency into the normal range and the incidence of GI tract side
      effects are the study secondary endpoints.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Anemia is a major problem in the general population affecting 5.6% in the United States. Iron
      deficiency is the most common cause of anemia. Although traditionally considered to be mainly
      a problem of underdeveloped countries, a recent epidemiological survey reported high
      incidence of iron deficiency anemia (IDA) in Europe in 2011. The incidence rate measured per
      1,000 person-years was 8.18 in Belgium, 8.93 in Italy, 12.42 in Germany and 14.14 in Spain.
      Women were affected four-times more than men. The major causes of IDA are chronic blood loss,
      chronic disorders and excess needs.

      The cornerstones of management of IDA are recognition and management of the cause of iron
      loss and efficient iron supplementation. Iron supplementation is usually done through oral
      formulations of iron. Three oral iron preparations are broadly used: ferrous sulfate, ferrous
      gluconate, and ferrous fumarate. The usual dosage is 325 mg (corresponding to 65 mg of
      elemental iron) two times a day. One major limitation with oral iron supplementation is GI
      side effects observed in almost 40% of cases. These are gastric discomfort, nausea, vomiting
      and constipation and they are caused due to the oxidation of ferrous irons in the stomach by
      acidic gastric fluid into insoluble salts.

      A new formulation of iron conjugated to one N-acetyl-aspartylated derivative of casein
      (Fe-ASP) has recently been developed. Due to the casein coating, it is anticipated that iron
      is converted to a smaller extent in the stomach into insoluble salts. In this way, more iron
      reaches the duodenum to become absorbed whereas GI side effects are less often. In parallel,
      animal studies have shown that casein itself primes the expression of enzymes that facilitate
      the absorption of iron across the duodenal mucosa.

      This formulation is anticipated to be better tolerated for oral ingestion since iron is
      readily absorbed in the duodenum. The aim is to compare the efficacy of the new oral
      formulation of Fe-ASP to oral ferrous sulfate in patients with IDA for the restoration of
      decreased circulating Hb.

    <description>The primary study endpoint is the comparative increase of baseline Hb in each study group after the first 4 weeks of treatment. Since the daily amount of elemental iron delivered with the ferrous sulfate regimen is 94 mg and with the Fe-ASP regimen 80 mg, the increase of baseline Hb will be adjusted per mg of delivered elemental iron.</description>
