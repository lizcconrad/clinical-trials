  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Wisconsin Healthcare-Associated Infections in Long-Term Care Coalition has developed a
      toolkit of evidence-based best practices to improve the management of urinary tract infection
      (UTI) in Wisconsin nursing homes (NHs). The theory and evidence supporting the individual
      improvement strategies promoted in the &quot;Wisconsin UTI Improvement Toolkit&quot; are strong but
      their combined impact on antibiotic prescribing in Wisconsin NHs is not known. Moreover, many
      Wisconsin NHs lack the internal resources and expertise to successfully implement and sustain
      the change interventions recommended in the toolkit. Consequently, there is a critical need
      to identify effective strategies to support implementation of best practices in this setting.
      The investigators hypothesize that an externally-facilitated implementation based on coaching
      and peer-to-peer learning will result in superior toolkit adoption and reduced rates of
      antibiotic utilization compared to a standard implementation.

      To test these two hypotheses, the investigators are proposing a hybrid type 2
      effectiveness-implementation randomized clinical trial in 20 Wisconsin NHs. Facilities
      randomized to the standard implementation approach will participate in a kickoff meeting and
      have access to a variety of online implementation resources. Facilities randomized to the
      enhanced implementation approach will have access to the same resources but will also be
      assigned a clinical coach and be invited to participate in ongoing collaborative learning
      sessions. The clinical coach will meet regularly with NH staff to guide the facility through
      implementation of the toolkit, including assembling a change team, performing an assessment
      to identify baseline barriers and facilitators of change, and ongoing integration of the
      toolkit practices into existing workflows. The learning collaborative will bring NH
      participants together to share change and improvement strategies with each other. UTI
      prescriptions per 1,000 resident-days in the study arms will be compared using generalized
      linear mixed models. A mixed methods evaluation structured around the REAIM framework (Reach,
      Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation and Maintenance) will be employed to assess
      differences in toolkit implementation among facilities in both arms of the study.

    <description>Study NHs randomized to the control arm will participate in kickoff meetings introducing the different UTI toolkit components. The meeting will also cover topics on how to assemble a change team, how to use the different tools in the UTI toolkit, and how to track process and outcome measures to monitor progress. NHs assigned to the control arm will have access to a web-based data tracking tool that will allow them to trend a number of study outcomes (e.g., number of monthly urine cultures and UTI treatment events) in their facility over time. Instructions and educational tools will be made available as an online resource but otherwise NHs in the control arm will be expected to implement the Wisconsin UTI Improvement Toolkit using existing internal resources.</description>
