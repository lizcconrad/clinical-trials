  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall objective of the proposed research is to improve HbA1c, adherence to treatment
      plans, and family communication surrounding adolescents' self-management of T1D. The
      investigators will test the efficacy of the MyT1DHero app against an attention control group.
      This will allow investigators to better understand the health and psychosocial improvements
      being made through the app.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This research seeks to realize the potential and test the efficacy of MyT1DHero to improve
      adolescent users' glycemic control and adherence to blood glucose monitoring. The
      investigators' goal is to help families receive more social support, and to improve diabetes
      knowledge, self-efficacy, family communication, and quality of life. The investigators
      further seek to decrease family conflict among children with T1D and their parents. In a
      12-month RCT, investigators will randomize 166 adolescents and their parents to one of two
      groups: (1) attention control, or (2) the MyT1DHero app. Adolescents enrolled in the study
      will be 10-15 years old, and will have been living with T1D for &lt;1 year or &gt;5 years at the
      start of the study. The primary outcome will be a change in the participants' HbA1C from
      baseline levels at the start of the study, to levels measured after 12 months.

    <description>MyT1DHero is an app with two separate interfaces, one for the parent and one for the child, that work together to help them communicate about diabetes management. The child receives system reminders to enter their blood glucose numbers, and parents receive a notification about each blood glucose test their child enters. Parents are also able to use the app to communicate with their child about their plan for care. The app has customizable blood glucose reminders and ranges, videos of support from other adolescents with T1D, snack lists, and other educational information on T1D.</description>
