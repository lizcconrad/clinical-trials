  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Prior research in Dr. Siegle's lab has shown a novel intervention Tuned Vibroacoustic
      Stimulation (TVS), can have a calming and positive effect. Here, the investigators will
      continue to evaluate the extent to which TVS, capitalizing on a preserved neurocircuitry for
      sympathetic and parasympathetic system activity, can be used to modify arousal responses,
      increase positive affective emotions, overriding otherwise prepotent negative stress
      reactions. Mindfulness is a popular intervention for stress. Yet it does not work for
      everyone. The investigators suggest this is because mindfulness relies on interoception which
      is not strong (or not sufficiently practiced) in everyone. Here the investigators provide an
      extroceptive cue (TVS) which increases activity in the same networks tapped by mindfulness.

      The investigators will show that this cue, which is physiologically reactive, decreases
      stress and increases physiological indicators of emotion regulation, and further show that it
      will do this during mindfulness yielding increased effects of mindfulness, to the extent that
      some individuals will experience heightened states of awareness, often described by advanced
      practitioners with thousands of hours of meditation. 100 individuals will be assessed
      physiologically during active intervention. Mechanisms of attentional focus on tasks will be
      assessed. Success will suggest that a dynamic intervention is possible without effort,
      medication or psychotherapy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      For the past decade, prospective studies have shown that positive emotions have been
      correlated with physical health and longevity. Those who experience more positive emotions
      have fewer colds, reduced inflammation, and can recover from stress more effectively.
      According to the Fredrickson's broaden and build theory, positive emotion such as joy,
      interest, love and contentment can broaden an individual's thought-action repertoire and
      build on that individual's personal resources, which should lead to an upward spiral of
      positive emotion that can counter downward spirals of negativity and stress. Induction of
      positive emotion has been shown to broaden scope of attention using a global-local visual
      processing task, increase breadth of thought-action repertoire using a thought listing task,
      and result in faster recovery from cardiovascular sequelae of negative emotions. Perceived
      positive social connections increase positive emotions, an effect moderated in part by
      baseline vagal tone.

      Mindfulness interventions also have physical and mental health benefits. Mindfulness can be
      defined as moment-to-moment awareness in one's present experience and adopting an attitude of
      openness or acceptance toward one's experience. Standard protocol for Mindfulness-Based
      Stress Reduction (MBSR) consists of 8 weekly 2.5-hour group sessions and has been applied to
      many populations including those with depression and anxiety. There are also brief
      experimental mindful attention inductions that have been developed although these approaches
      appear to have small and transient effects. Positive predictors of mindfulness include
      individuals with higher self-esteem, autonomy and competence. Negative predictors of
      mindfulness include individuals with higher levels of neuroticism trait, anxiety, depression,
      and negative affectivity. However, studies have also shown that mindfulness is less effective
      when individuals behave compulsively or automatically, without awareness or attention to
      one's behavior.

      Prior research has shown that mindfulness do affect markers of calmness and stress, including
      heart rate variability (HRV), galvanic skin response (HRV), and EEG. Stress is characterized
      by hyper-reactivity in the sympathetic nervous system which is associated with increased
      arousal and vigilance, and compromised reactivity of the parasympathetic nervous system,
      which helps to regulate emotion and stress responses. HRV is widely used as a biomarker for
      the coordinated activity of the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous symptom. A calmer,
      less stressful state is typically marked by increased HRV, likely attributed to respiration
      based parasympathetic stimulation. GSR is also a reliable index for sweat gland activity and
      changes in activation level of the sympathetic nervous system, and GSR usually increases with
      higher levels of stress. EEG changes, such as elevated prefrontal gamma and theta, have also
      been associated with state of relaxed alertness.

      Large scientific literature supports the role of vibration in regulating physiology. Based on
      literature, slow whole-body vibration, in the 0.01 to 0.3 Hz range, is associated with
      increased ratings of pleasantness and increased parasympathetic tone. Stimulation at about
      100 Hz has been shown to activate the posterior insula which is associated with increased
      attention to interoception, as promoted in many meditative traditions. Transcutaneous targets
      for the vibration frequencies have also been identified, including stellate ganglion and
      vagus nerve. Currently, in Dr. Siegle's lab, TVS has been shown to reduce subjective stress,
      increase positive affect, along with increases in behavioral performance. The investigators
      hypothesize that TVS added to mindfulness will increase positive emotions and heighten state
      of awareness, leading to broadening of perspectives in individuals.
