  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Metabolic surgery, as a recognition treatment option for patients with clinical morbid
      obesity, is gaining increasing appreciation. In addition to substantial weight loss, emerging
      studies have highlighted that metabolic surgery can substantially ameliorate obesity-related
      metabolic diseases, including but not limited to type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM),
      hypertension, dyslipidemia, obstructive sleep apnea-hypopnea syndrome (OSAHS) and polycystic
      ovary syndrome (PCOS)in severely obese patients. However, further investigations with larger
      sample size and longer observation time still needed to clarity the efficacy and safety of
      metabolic surgery in Chinese patients with obesity and encouraging future research in this
      field.
