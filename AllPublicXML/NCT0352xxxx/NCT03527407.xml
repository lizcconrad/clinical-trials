  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Swiss legislation requires health service providers to collect such information. of medical
      quality indicators as part of the quality and performance audit (Article 22a KVG). In
      addition, comparisons of clinics or specialist specialists on cost and quality of results are
      required (Art. 49 (8)).

      Currently, the quality of a medical therapy is evaluated rather negatively on the absence (or
      occurrence) of complications. In contrast, however, the goal of therapy must be to improve or
      maintain the health-related quality of life (HRQoL). Accordingly, the Swiss Society of
      Surgery (SGC-SSC), in collaboration with the Association for Quality Assurance in Surgery
      (AQC), has developed a minimum dataset designed to assess the quality of life of patients
      after surgical intervention. In order to enable Switzerland to be comparatively independent
      of the discipline, generic (in the Research Plan - MIDAS -V2, date 24.05.2017 Page 5/57
      Contrary to disease-specific) survey instruments proposed that cover the general quality of
      life in its different facets, regardless of the function of individual organ systems. The
      complication documentation was not completely abandoned in this proposal, but is only a
      quality indicator among many due to patient-related outcome measurements.

      However, the development of a minimal data set with quality indicators that are applicable
      across all surgical sub-disciplines for evaluating the quality of treatment of acute and
      chronic diseases raises a number of fundamental questions that can only be answered to a
      limited extent without empirical studies. Five essential questions are:

      I. Is it sufficient to work with generic quality of life tools or is it necessary to use
      disease / indication specific instruments or functional tests? II. Which is the best, solid
      time for a follow-up? III. Is it possible and useful to make a third-party determination of
      the quality of life in patients with limited cognitive abilities? IV. Which preoperative risk
      factors should be documented so that sufficient adjustment for case mix differences in
      hospital comparisons can be made? V. Which perioperative and postoperative factors, in
      particular complications, must be raised beyond the quality of life, as they reflect an
      independent aspect of quality?

        The current study has been designed to support decisions on how to define a minimal data
        set and how to organize data collection to obtain valid data. Two patient groups will serve
        as an example:

          1. patients with arthritis of the hip joint and indication for total prosthetic joint
             replacement surgery

          2. patients with acute femoral neck fracture and indication for partial or total
             prosthetic joint replacement surgery

        Inclusion Criteria:

        - Standard therapy of one of the following diagnoses

          -  Femoral neck fracture after low-energy trauma (implantation of a head endoprosthesis)

          -  Coxarthrosis (implantation of a total hip prosthesis)

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Rejection of study participation or standard therapy

          -  Patients who are unlikely to attend routine follow-up (e.g., tourists)

          -  Patients in palliative care

          -  Malignancy (known or diagnosed in the course of time)

          -  Patients with a limited knowledge of German, who can answer the questionnaire even
             with the help of a study nurse seems unrealistic

          -  Participation in an interfering clinical intervention study within the last three
             months

          -  persons unable to consent (long-term incapacity to consent)
