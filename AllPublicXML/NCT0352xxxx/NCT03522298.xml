    <textblock>
      This protocol has a 2-part design:

      The phase 2a study component is an open-label, multicenter, phase 2a dose-escalation and
      expansion study to assess the safety, tolerability, recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D),
      pharmacokinetics (PK) and clinical activity of GDC-0084 in patients with newly-diagnosed
      glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) with unmethylated MGMT promoter status as adjuvant therapy
      following surgical resection and initial chemoradiation with temozolomide (TMZ). The phase 2a
      study is fully detailed in this submission.

      The phase 2b study component comprises an evaluation of clinical activity of GDC-0084
      compared to TMZ in as adjuvant therapy following surgical resection and initial
      chemoradiation with TMZ and will be initiated following the determination of RP2D in the
      phase 2a study (Part 1). The phase 2b component will be will be further detailed in an
      amendment to this submission.

      Phase 2a study - Stage 1 Dose-Escalation and Maximum Tolerated Dose The dose-escalation
      portion of the study (Stage 1) will use a standard &quot;3 + 3&quot; design to determine the MTDs for
      QD and intermittent dosing schedules.

      The MTDs for QD and intermittent dosing of GDC-0084 will be determined in 3 steps: QD (Step
      1), QOD (Step 2) and daily dosing for 3 consecutive days of the week (3 days on/4 days off)
      (Step 3). All 3 steps will follow the same dose-escalation rules as described below. Each
      step and each dose cohort within each step will consist of newly recruited patients with all
      patients receiving the dose to which they are originally assigned.

      Approximately 6 - 12 patients with newly diagnosed GBM will be enrolled in Step 1; the number
      of patients recruited to assess the intermittent dosing MTDs in each of Step 2 and Step 3 is
      assumed to be approximately the same (6 - 12 patients). However, numbers may vary for all 3
      steps, depending on the outcome of the dose-escalation of each step.

      Step 1 The MTD for QD dosing will be determined. The initial dose level for QD dosing will be
      60 mg (Dose Level 0). This dose is based on the phase 1 findings outlined in the rationale in
      the protocol, adding 1 dose level to test for a potential MTD increase. When the MTD for QD
      dosing has been determined, Step 2 and 3 will be initiated in parallel.

      Step 2/3 Once the MTD for QD has been determined, the QD MTD will be used as the initial dose
      level for the assessment of the QOD MTD in Step 2 and as the initial dose level for the
      assessment of the intermittent 3 days on/4 days off MTD in Step 3.

      Dose-escalation will occur in Stage 1:

        -  The initial dose (Dose Level 0) for QD MTD determination in Step 1 will be 60 mg. Dose
           levels will increase in 15 mg steps;

        -  The dose-escalation portion of the study (Stage 1) will use a standard &quot;3 + 3&quot; design to
           assess the safety, tolerability, and PK of GDC-0084 administered orally in 28-day
           cycles;

      Decisions regarding dose-escalation and selection will be made by a Cohort Review Committee
      (CRC).

      All AEs, including DLTs, will be reported, with severity assessed according to National
      Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE), version 4.03.

      After determination of the MTD, patients continue to receive their protocol-assigned dose
      levels of GDC-0084 until progression of their disease or an unacceptable toxicity, whichever
      occurs first.

      Phase 2a study - Stage 2 Expansion stage (2) of the study will be a three-arm, randomized,
      open-label expansion study to further characterize the safety, tolerability and PK of
      GDC-0084 as well as to provide a preliminary assessment of single-agent activity of GDC-0084
      in patients with GBM and to compare intermittent dosing MTDs vs. QD MTD in regard to safety
      and clinical activity. Approximately 30 patients will be enrolled in the expansion cohort in
      3 treatment arms (10 per am), according to the defined study eligibility criteria.

      Stage 2 of the study will be initiated with recruitment of new patients as soon as the MTD
      for intermittent dosing schedules has been determined (Stage 1, Step 3).

      Patients enrolled in Stage 2 may continue the study at the dose allocated until disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

    <description>This is an open-label study.
Patients in Stage 1 will be enrolled and sequentially assigned to a dose cohort.
The initial cohort will receive an oral dose of 60 mg GDC-0084 QD (4 x 15 mg capsules). Patients of future dose cohorts will receive GDC-0084 at increasing levels with 15 mg steps until a dose-limiting toxicity occurs (DLT) occurs. The dose level where &lt;1/3 of the patients exhibit a DLT will be determined the Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD).
Dose escalation will occur for three separate dose schedules including QD, every other day (QOD) and 3 times a week on consecutive days (3 days on/4 days off), i.e. an MTD will be established for three different dose schedules.
In stage 2, the expansion phase, patients will receive doses of oral GDC-0084 at the MTD established for each of the three dosing schedules until disease progression or an unacceptable toxicity, whichever occurs first.
Patients will be randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio to one of the three dose schedules.</description>
