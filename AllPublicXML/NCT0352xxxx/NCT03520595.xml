      Introduction:

      Homeopathy is a deep healing, comprehensive and distinct system originally developed by
      Samuel Hahnemann about 200 years ago. Small doses of specially prepared (&quot;potentized&quot;)
      remedies which set the body's systems back in order and stimulate a body's own energies
      toward a natural healing process. It is entirely distinct in both theory and in practice from
      other healing systems from ordinary or main-stream (&quot;allopathic&quot;) medicine, but also from
      acupuncture, naturopathy, chiropractics, etc., although some homeopathy often finds its way
      into these other fields of practice.Homeopathy is based on the concept &quot;similia similibus
      curentur&quot; which means symptoms, caused by the original substance in healthy subjects, can be
      reversed by the homeopathic remedy in patients having similar symptoms.Homeopathy has the
      advantages such as it is inexpensive (the only expense is the homeopath's time and training -
      the remedies themselves cost practically nothing), non-toxic (although &quot;side affects&quot; which
      reflect the body's own healing processes may occur - such as fever, discharge, rash, etc.)
      and non-intrusive (the remedies are carried on tiny sugar granules which are dissolved in
      water or in the mouth, or swallowed).Arnica is one of the most popular medications in
      homeopathy medicine. This remedy can be extracted from several plant species belonging to the
      Aesteraceae family including Arnica montana, Arnica fulgens, Arnica cordifolia, Arnica
      chamissonis and Arnica sororia, and it is widely sold as tincture, ointment, cream, gel, and
      tablet. It has been used for the treatment of numerous pathological conditions, including
      pain, swelling and stiffness associated with trauma, contusions, sprains, myocarditis, angina
      pectoris, cardiac insufficiency, arteriosclerosis, postoperative clinical conditions, and for
      symptomatic relief in osteoarthritis.Conventional NSAIDs work by inhibiting cyclooxygenase
      (COX) and prostaglandin synthesis as well as by other less understood mechanisms. Onset of
      analgesia occurs rapidly with all NSAIDs, usually within one hour.Diclofenac is one of
      potent, standard and most unique NSAID for the therapy of postoperative pain. Diclofenac
      inhibits the lipoxygenase pathways, which reduces the formation of the leukotrienes (also
      pro-inflammatory autacoids) and also inhibit phospholipase A2. These actions explain the high
      potency of diclofenac.NSAIDs cause a variety of side effects including nausea, diarrhea,
      constipation, dizziness, headache, confusion, edema, rash, and pruritis. They can also cause
      more serious toxicities such as gastrointestinal (GI) ulceration/bleeding, hematologic
      disturbances, bronchospasm, angioedema, renal dysfunction, and hepatotoxicity. Many of these
      side effects are due to NSAID inhibiting prostaglandin synthesis other than at the desired
      site of action.Arnica being clinical efficient and high tolerable makes it a potential
      therapeutic alternative target to non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs.In this study
      investigator will compare and evaluate the efficacy of Arnica as a substitute for analgesics
      such as Diclofenac Sodium, through which side effects of NSAIDS can be avoided and get the
      same analgesia effect through Arnica without any of the undesirable effects for minor
      surgical procedures.

      AIM:

      To compare and evaluate the analgesic effect of Arnica Montana with Diclofenac sodium after
      crown lengthening procedure with ostectomy.

      Objectives:

      To assess the analgesic effect on crown lengthening procedure with ostectomy patients of
      Arnica Montana and Diclofenac Sodium.
