      The purpose of this study is to collect additional safety data until apalutamide is
      commercially available for participants with non-metastatic castrate-resistant prostate
      cancer (NM-CRPC).

    <description>An adverse event (AE) was any untoward medical occurrence in a participant who received study drug without regard to possibility of causal relationship. A serious adverse event (SAE) was an AE resulting in any of the following outcomes or deemed significant for any other reason: death; initial or prolonged inpatient hospitalization; life-threatening experience (immediate risk of dying); persistent or significant disability/incapacity; congenital anomaly. Treatment-emergent were events between administration of study drug and up to 1 year that were absent before treatment or that worsened relative to pretreatment state.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Participants with confirmed prostate cancer, with evidence of castration resistance,
             with a rising prostate-specific antigen (PSA) while on androgen deprivation therapy
             (ADT), and for whom the treating physician believes additional therapy is indicated in
             the non-metastatic castrate-resistant prostate cancer (NM-CRPC) setting

             a) Willingness to continue gonadotropin releasing hormone analog (GnRHa) throughout
             study if the participant is medically castrated

          -  Must sign an informed consent form (ICF) (or the participant's legally acceptable
             representative must sign) indicating that the participant understands the purpose of,
             and procedures required for, the study and is willing to participate in the study

          -  To avoid risk of drug exposure through the ejaculate (even participants with
             vasectomies), participants must use a condom during sexual activity while on study
             drug and for 3 months following the last dose of study drug. Donation of sperm is not
             allowed while on study drug and for 3 months following the last dose of study drug

          -  Willingness and ability to comply with prohibitions and restrictions specified in this
             protocol, scheduled visits, treatment plans, laboratory, and other study procedures,
             including ability to swallow study drug tablets

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Previously enrolled in another apalutamide study or eligible for enrollment in another
             ongoing clinical study of apalutamide

          -  Enrolled in another interventional clinical study of anti-neoplastic agents

          -  Ongoing grade greater than (&gt;) 1 acute toxicity due to prior therapy or surgical
             procedure

          -  Concurrent therapy with medications known to lower the seizure threshold must have
             been discontinued or substituted at least 4 weeks prior to study entry

          -  Current or prior treatment with anti-epileptic medications for the treatment of
             seizures. History of seizure or condition that may predispose to seizure (including,
             but not limited to prior cerebrovascular accident, transient ischemic attack, or loss
             of consciousness within 1 year prior to randomization; brain arteriovenous
             malformation; or intracranial masses such as a schwannoma or meningioma that is
             causing edema or mass effect)
