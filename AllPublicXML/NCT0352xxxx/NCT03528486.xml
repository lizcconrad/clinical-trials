  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Different cognitive intervention approaches have been developed to attenuate decline (e.g.,
      cognitive engagement, training, or stimulation), but it is not clear which approaches are
      efficacious. It is also not clear when, along the continuum of normal cognitive aging to mild
      cognitive impairment (MCI-a transitional stage before dementia onset), it is most efficacious
      to intervene. This randomized clinical trial will determine the efficacy of a novel cognitive
      engagement intervention approach (music training) as compared to cognitive stimulation (which
      will serve as a stringent, active control). Grounded in theory, the central hypothesis is
      that interventions enhancing central auditory processing (CAP), a strong, longitudinal
      predictor of MCI and dementia, will improve cognition. Music training is increasingly
      recognized as a feasible means to attenuate age-related cognitive decline. Prior research and
      preliminary data suggest that intense piano training enhances CAP and is likely more
      effective than cognitive stimulation. Correlational studies indicate superior CAP, executive
      function, and other cognitive abilities for adults with formal music training compared to
      non-musicians. The specific aims of the study are to examine the efficacy of music training
      relative to cognitive stimulation (active controls) to improve CAP, cognition, and everyday
      function among older adults with and without MCI. The efficacy of music training will be
      established and moderating effects of MCI status will be examined. The proposed study further
      aims to elucidate the underlying mechanisms of effective cognitive intervention approaches by
      exploring mediators of training gains. The proposed study is the first phase II randomized
      trial of music training to enhance older adults' cognition. Mediation analyses will elucidate
      the underlying mechanisms of intervention effects.

      Interventions to Attenuate Cognitive Decline: Keys to Staying Sharp.

      The primary objectives is to examine the efficacy of music training to improve central
      auditory processing (CAP), cognition, and everyday function among older adults.

      The secondary objectives are:

        -  To examine the moderating effects of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) on music training
           efficacy.

        -  To explore mediators of intervention effects.

      Design The design is a two arm randomized clinical trial examining the efficacy of music
      training to improve CAP, cognition, and everyday function in older adults with and without
      MCI across two time points (baseline and immediate post-test).

      Outcomes The effects of of music training on CAP, cognition, and everyday functional
      performance will be quantified.

      CAP processing measures will include: Time Compressed Speech 65%, Words-in-Noise, Dichotic
      Digits Test, Dichotic Sentence Identification, and Adaptive Tests of Temporal Resolution. A
      composite will be derived from principal components analyses.

      Cognition measures will include: Verbal Fluency Test (phonemic fluency, category fluency, and
      category switching), Trail Making Test, and Digit Coding. A composite will be derived from
      principal component analyses.

      Everyday Function measures will include: Timed Instrumental Activities of Daily Living and
      Test of Everyday Attention. A composite will be derived from principal component analyses.

      Interventions and Duration Two types of music training will be investigated. The two training
      conditions will be equivalent in terms of frequency and duration of each session (90 min/day,
      two days/wk, 10 weeks) and social contact (led by trainer and conducted in groups of up to 10
      persons).

      Sample Size and Population In-person screening of a maximum of 500 potential study
      participants are planned to enroll up to 400 participants. The goal is to have at least 200
      participants complete the study. Individuals with normal cognition and those with a clinical
      diagnosis of MCI will be included in the study.
