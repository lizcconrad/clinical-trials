      This is a multi‐center, Phase 1b, randomized, double‐blind, placebo‐controlled parallel‐group
      trial in adults with mild to moderate AD. The primary endpoint is the change from the
      baseline CSF Amyloid beta oligomer concentration after dosing with CT1812 versus placebo. The
      change from baseline will be measured through a number of exploratory endpoints as indicated
      below. For each subject, the baseline CSF oligomer concentration will be computed as the
      average of the measurements from hours -4, -3, -2 and -1 and 0.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

        Subjects may be included in the study only if they meet all of the following criteria:

          -  Men, and women of non-childbearing potential, 50-85 years of age inclusively, with a
             diagnosis of mild to moderate Probable Alzheimer's Disease Dementia according to the
             2011 NIA-AA criteria and at least a 6 month decline in cognitive function documented
             in the medical record.

          -  Neuroimaging (MRI) obtained during screening consistent with the clinical diagnosis of
             Alzheimer's disease and without findings of significant exclusionary abnormalities
             (see exclusion criteria, number 3).

          -  MMSE 16-26 inclusive. Subjects must, in the opinion of the investigator, be able to
             comply with study procedures and must understand the consent process. The investigator
             will use his or her clinical judgment in conjunction with the cognitive screening
             assessments to determine whether the subject meets these criteria in a manner that is
             consistent with local clinical practice and standards. Subjects with borderline low
             MMSE at screening may undergo repeat MMSE administration if extenuating circumstances
             were present at original assessment.

          -  A positive amyloid scan (florbetaben F18, florbetapir F18, or flutametamol F18) at
             screening or within prior 12 months, as read by the certified, site-designated PET
             scan reader.

          -  Must consent to apolipoprotein E (ApoE) genotyping

          -  Subjects must have a caregiver or study partner who can participate in all clinic
             visits.

          -  Patients living at home or in the community (assisted living acceptable)

          -  Able to swallow CT1812 capsules.

          -  Stable pharmacological treatment of any other chronic conditions for at least 30 days
             prior to screening.

          -  Subjects must be capable of providing written informed consent to the study procedures
             and for use of protected health information [Health Insurance Portability and
             Accountability Act (HIPAA) Authorization, if applicable]. Written informed consent
             also shall be obtained from the responsible caregiver or study partner. All consent
             processes must be undertaken in the presence of a witness and prior to any study
             procedures.

          -  Subjects shall be generally healthy with mobility (ambulatory or ambulatory-aided,
             i.e., walker or cane), vision and hearing (hearing aid permissible) sufficient for
             compliance with testing procedures.

          -  Must be able to complete all screening evaluations.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Hospitalization or change of chronic concomitant medication within one month prior to
             screening.

             hydrocephalus, space-occupying lesion (e.g. abscess or brain tumor such as
             meningioma). If a small incidental meningioma is observed, the medical monitor may be
             contacted to discuss eligibility.

          -  Clinical or laboratory findings consistent with:

               -  Other primary degenerative dementia, (dementia with Lewy bodies, fronto-temporal

                  heart disease of questionable clinical significance, the medical monitor may be
                  contacted to discuss eligibility.

               -  Bradycardia (&lt;50 beats/min.) or tachycardia (&gt;100 beats/min.). Otherwise healthy
                  subjects with borderline bradycardia may be discussed with the medical monitor to
                  determine eligibility.

               -  Poorly managed hypertension (systolic &gt;160 mm Hg and/or diastolic &gt;95 mm Hg) or
