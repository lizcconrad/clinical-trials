  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Insomnia is the most prevalent sleep problem in both the general and clinical populations.
      Insomnia symptoms, presented as the problems initiating sleep or maintaining sleep, have been
      reported in association with adverse outcomes in adolescents, including an increased risk of
      developing depression, anxiety, interpersonal problems, somatic health problems, self-harm
      and suicidal ideation. Moreover, adolescent insomnia has been found to predict the
      development of mental health problems in young adulthood.

      Currently there is no medication specifically approved for use as hypnotics in children under
      age 18 by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Although cognitive behavioural therapy
      for insomnia (CBT-I) has been regarded as the first-line treatment for insomnia in adults,
      there exists limited evidence for the efficacy of CBT-I among adolescents and young adults.
      Given the high prevalence and profound consequences of insomnia among youth, further research
      on the short-term and long-term effects of CBT-I for adolescents is warranted. To address the
      limitations of the existing literature, this randomised controlled trial aims to examine
      whether face-to-face (group-based CBT-I) versus self-help insomnia treatment benefit
      adolescents with insomnia, for improving sleep and other clinical and daytime symptoms as
      well as overall functional improvement in both the short and long term.
