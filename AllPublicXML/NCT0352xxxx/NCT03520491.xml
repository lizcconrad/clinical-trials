  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test if immunotherapy with nivolumab alone or in combination
      with ipilimumab is safe and does not delay the planned bladder cancer surgery. The
      investigators want to see if treatment with these drugs prior to surgery may decrease the
      size of the bladder cancer and thus could help make the surgery more successful.

             histology is acceptable if there is a predominant urothelial component.

          -  Cystoscopically and radiographically confirmed cT2-4a cN0 cM0 disease. Patients with
             cT4a disease invading into the prostatic stroma with no cystoscopic confirmation of

             to enroll.

          -  Women of childbearing potential (WOCBP) not using a medically acceptable means of
             contraception throughout the study treatment and for at least 23 weeks following the

             ovulatory cycle).

               -  WOCBP are defined as those who have experienced menarche and who have not
                  undergone successful surgical sterilization (hysterectomy, bilateral tubal
