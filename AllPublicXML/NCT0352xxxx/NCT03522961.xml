    <textblock>
      We aim to compare the effectiveness of cranberry capsules versus nitrofurantoin prophylaxis
      in preventing urinary tract infections (UTIs) after urogynecologic surgery by conducting a
      double-blinded randomized clinical trial involving women with pelvic organ prolapse and/or
      urinary incontinence scheduled to have surgery with the Urogynecologists who comprise the
      Brigham and Women's Urogynecology Group.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      We plan to conduct a double-blinded randomized clinical trial involving women who undergo
      surgery for pelvic organ prolapse and/or urinary incontinence.

      Participants who need transurethral catheterization postoperatively will be randomized to
      cranberry capsules or nitrofurantoin prophylaxis. Randomization will be performed the day of
      discharge. Both participants and surgeons will be blinded to treatment allocation. All
      participants will receive routine perioperative intravenous antibiotic prophylaxis.

      Participants who fail their voiding trial after surgery and require transurethral
      catheterization upon discharge from the hospital will be randomized to either one cranberry
      capsule (TheraCran one®, Theralogix, LLC, Rockville, Maryland) or one 100 mg capsule of
      nitrofurantoin by mouth daily beginning postoperative day #1. Participants randomized to the
      cranberry capsule group will continue to take one cranberry capsule daily for 28 days.
      Participants randomized to the nitrofurantoin group will continue to take 100 mg of
      nitrofurantoin each day transurethral catheterization is needed for up to 28 days. All
      participants will be scheduled for a repeat voiding trial within 48 hours to 1 week after
      discharge.

      All participants will complete a daily catheterization and medication diary to record the
      type of catheterization used (indwelling or intermittent) and to confirm they are taking the
      study medication for the duration of the study period. They will also be asked to record any
      urinary symptoms they experience and will be encouraged to contact the office immediately if
      they experience urinary symptoms consistent with a UTI.

    <measure>The primary outcome will be treatment for clinically suspected or culture-proven UTI in the cranberry capsule group versus the nitrofurantoin group within 4 weeks (28 days) after surgery.</measure>
    <time_frame>28 days</time_frame>
    <description>Clinically suspected treatment will include both empiric treatment based on the development of urinary symptoms alone (dysuria, urinary urgency, and/or urinary frequency) or prescribed based on symptoms suggestive of a UTI and the presence of nitrites and/or leukocyte esterase on urine dipstick analysis. Participants will fill out a daily catheterization and medication diary which asks about the presence or absence of UTI symptoms. They will be encouraged to call the office and/or come in for evaluation if they experience these symptoms. These participants may be treated based on their symptoms alone or based on their symptoms and the presence of nitrites and/or leukocyte esterase on urine dipstick analysis. A culture-proven UTI will be defined as a urine culture result with &gt;100,000 colony-forming units of a single organism.</description>

    <description>A daily catheterization and medication diary will be used to track whether or not participants took their study medication every day for 28 days. Participants will bring their study medication bottle to every study visit and the medication will be counted by study staff to ensure adherence to assigned treatment.</description>
