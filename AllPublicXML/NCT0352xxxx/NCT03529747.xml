  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is a pilot randomised controlled trial (RCT) comparing online self-help for
      parents of children with food allergies with a wait-list control. A battery of self-report
      measures will be administered online at baseline (week 0), post-intervention (week 5) and at
      follow-up (week 9).
