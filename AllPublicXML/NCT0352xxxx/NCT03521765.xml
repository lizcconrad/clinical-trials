      BACKGROUND:

      Colorectal cancer (CRC) and its treatment affect CRC survivors' quality of life (QoL),
      emotional distress and activities of daily living (ADL). It is assumed that occupational
      therapy interventions based on cancer education may be a feasible approach.

      Aim To examine the effect of using cancer education based on healthy lifestyle by
      occupational therapist on QoL, emotional distress, ADL and healthy lifestyle behaviors in CRC
      survivors.

      Methods Participants with CRC were designed as a two-group controlled trial, and a
      single-blind randomized controlled trial was conducted. These participants were randomly
      assigned to either an OT intervention or a non-intervention group (in a 1:1 ratio). Those
      participants in the OT intervention group were given a consultation based on a CRC education
      handbook by an occupational therapist for discharge preparation and on 1-month, 3-month
      follow-up clinic; the non-intervention group participants were given a CRC education handbook
      (the same handbook) only for discharge preparation. The primary outcome was the change in QoL
      measured using WHOOQOL-BREF. Secondary outcomes were changes in emotional distress, ADL and
      healthy lifestyle behaviors. Outcomes were examined in baseline (discharge preparation),
      1-month and 3-months follow-up clinic.

    <measure>WHOQOL-BREF(the World Health Organization Quality of Life-BREF)</measure>
    <time_frame>10 min</time_frame>
    <description>The WHOQOL-BREF questionnaire is a self-assessment instrument, which is has been translated into several languages (The WHOQOL Group, 1998). It includes four domains: physical health, psychological health, social relationships, and environment.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Brief Symptom Rating Scale (BSRS-5)</measure>
    <time_frame>3 min</time_frame>
    <description>The Brief Symptom Rating Scale (BSRS-5) is used for screening psychiatric symptoms, which is to be able to quickly understand the psychological care needs of subjects. This scale includes only five items (anxiety, hostility, depression, low self-esteem, and insomnia), thus, the administration time is short.</description>

    <measure>Barthel Index (BI)</measure>
    <time_frame>5 min</time_frame>
    <description>The Barthel Index (BI) measure the patients' performance on 10 ADL functions, and is commonly used scales which assess disability or dependence in activities of daily living for patients.</description>

    <description>Those participants in the OT intervention group were given a consultation based on a CRC education handbook by an occupational therapist for discharge preparation (about 30 minutes) and after each follow-up visit to the clinic (about 15-20 minutes); the non-intervention group participants were given a CRC education handbook (the same handbook) only for discharge preparation. For the first OT consultation, in the first 15 minutes, the occupational therapist educated the participants based on the CRC education handbook chapter by chapter. The next 15 minutes, the occupational therapist interacted with the participants and provided them customized lifestyle suggestions. For the each following (second and third) consultations, occupational therapists interacted with the participants and provided customized suggestions based on the participants' lifestyle at home.</description>
