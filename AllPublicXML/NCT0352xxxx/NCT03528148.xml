  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To investigate the effects of elliptical cross bike exercises combine conventional physical
      therapy on gait, postural control, balance, muscle tone, spasticity, quality of life, motor
      functioning, functional activity, and ADL in post stroke patients.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In a single-blind, randomized controlled intervention, patients were randomly assigned to an
      active cycling group (ACG, n=25) five times a week combine with conventional al physical
      therapy or a control group (CG, n=25) with conventional physical therapy 3 weeks of training
      in the center.

      All outcome measures were administered at the beginning of the study, at the end of the 1st,
      2nd, and 3rd week.

      All participants will be divided two groups. One group will be experiment with conventional
      physical therapy as control group (CG), the other group will active cycling as active cycling
      group (ACG) with elliptical Cross Trainer &amp; Exercise Bike after conventional physical
      therapy.

      Baseline assessment of muscle tone by Myoton-3, Modified Ashworth Scale used as a simple
      measure of spasticity; Barthel Index scale for performance in activities of daily living;
      Berg Balance Scale to measure balance; the upper and lower limb subscale of the Fugl-Meyer
      assessment for motor function of extremities; and BTS G-WALK was used to measure gait
      parameters. The data will be collect before session.
