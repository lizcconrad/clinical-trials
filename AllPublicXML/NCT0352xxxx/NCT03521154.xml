      A global study to assess the efficacy and safety of osimertinib following chemoradiation in
      patients with stage III unresectable Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor Mutation Positive
      non-small cell lung cancer
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase 3 double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, study to assess the efficacy
      and safety of osimertinib following chemoradiation in patients with stage III unresectable
      EGFR mutation-positive NSCLC, including the most common EGFR sensitising mutations (Ex19Del
      and L858R), either alone or in combination with other EGFR mutations. Chemoradiation may have
      been given either given concurrently or sequentially. Patients whose disease has not
      progressed following chemoradiation will be randomised within 6 weeks of completion of
      chemoradiation to receive osimertinib or placebo in a 2:1 ratio, and treatment will be
      continued until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity or other discontinuation criteria
      are met.
