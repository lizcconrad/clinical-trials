  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to estimate the effect of chewing gum after anterior cervical fusion
      surgery on decreasing the severity of dysphagia in patients with mild-moderate dysphagia.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Postoperative dysphagia is the most common complication of anterior cervical fusion surgery.
      Previous studies showed that chewing gum helped to improve swallow frequency and latency.
      However, its short-term effect on alleviating dysphagia symptom after anterior cervical
      surgery is still unknown. A randomized, parallel controlled, superiority trial is performed
      in patients with postoperative mild-moderate dysphagia. Dysphagia severity will be assessed
      using dysphagia short questionnaire (DSQ) score in the chewing gum group and control group
      during 7 days after surgery, and the changes in DSQ score between two groups will be
      compared, to estimate the effect of chewing gum on alleviating dysphagia symptom.

    <measure>Dysphagia Short Questionnaire (DSQ) score</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from the 1st day after surgery to the 7th day after surgery.</time_frame>
    <description>DSQ is designed for the evaluation of swallowing difficulty after anterior cervical spine surgery. It is calculated by summing up the points given for each item, from 0 point to a maximum of 18 points, where lower scores represent milder symptoms and vice versa.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Bazaz grading system</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from the 1st day after surgery to the 7th day after surgery.</time_frame>
    <description>Bazaz grading system is designed for the evaluation of swallowing difficulty after anterior cervical spine surgery. The patients are graded as having none, mild, moderate, or severe dysphagia based on their symptoms. A none or mild dysphagia is considered to be a better outcome.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Prevertebral soft tissue swelling</measure>
    <time_frame>The 3rd days after surgery.</time_frame>
    <description>The measurement of the soft tissue space is made on the line parallel to the upper end plate from the midpoint of the anterior surface of each vertebral body to the border of the airway shadow. This scale ranges from 0 to approximately 30 mm for each vertebra, where a lower value represents a milder soft tissue swelling.</description>

    <description>Patients who receive anterior cervical fusion and have mild or moderate dysphagia postoperatively, will be randomized into two groups. Subjects assigned to the Chewing Gum Group are asked to chew gum four times a day for 5 days (15 minutes each time) after surgery in addition to standard cares. Standard cares include cleaning the wound every 2 days, wearing a collar, pain management, and education.</description>

    <description>Patients who receive anterior cervical fusion and have mild or moderate dysphagia postoperatively, will be randomized into two groups. Subjects assigned to the Control Group receive standard cares and are asked not to chew gum within 5 days after surgery.
