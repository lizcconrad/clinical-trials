  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The PETHEMA Spanish group treats patients with high-risk Philadelphia chromosome-negative
      ALL, aged 18 to 55 years, based on the MRD clearance as assessed by flow cytometry at a
      centralised evaluation centre. Patients with MRD &lt; 0.1% (&lt; 1×10-3) after induction and &lt;
      0.01% (&lt; 1×10-4) after early consolidation are assigned to receive chemotherapy (late
      consolidation and maintenance).

      Early consolidation chemotherapy consists of three cycles including high doses of MTX, ARA-C
      and ASP, together with vincristine and dexamethasone. The same therapy is repeated in the
      late consolidation period if MRD after early consolidation is &lt; 0.01% (&lt; 1×10-4). Maintenance
      therapy is then administered for up to 2 years from the CR date. These patients do not
      receive allo-HSCT if they maintain adequate MRD clearance.

      Despite having adequate MRD clearance, a proportion of patients (around 25%) experience
      relapse, which makes other approaches necessary to try to decrease the relapse rate.
      Intensifying currently existing chemotherapy regimens is not likely to increase the cure rate
      and would likely significantly increase toxicity. The use of targeted immunotherapeutic
      agents such as blinatumomab, which has demonstrated efficacy and safety in patients with R/R
      ALL and in patients with ALL and MRD+, seems to be a promising option [30-33].

      Therefore, it would be interesting to assess the potential efficacy of using blinatumomab in
      CR patients to reduce the MRD more frequently and more intensely during the early and late
      consolidation period. Our hypothesis is that blinatumomab will further reduce the level of
      MRD and this could lead to a decrease in the relapse rate in these patients.

      This trial will replace the third early consolidation cycle with a cycle of blinatumomab, and
      the same will be done in the late consolidation period. We hope that this strategy will
      increase the extent of the MRD response and prevent relapses.

      Moreover, and as a secondary objective, we will investigate the safety of blinatumomab
      administration after the administration of high-dose chemotherapy including MTX, ARA-C and
      ASP

      In the pre-phase, patients receive treatment according to routine clinical practice at
      Spanish sites, in accordance with the PETHEMA protocol for patients with high-risk ALL
      (ALL-AR-11), with: Prednisone (PDN) 60 mg/m2, PO or IV until complete characterisation of the
      ALL, for a maximum of 7 days, Triple intrathecal therapy, Methotrexate (MTX) 12 mg, ARA-C: 30
      mg, Hydrocortisone 20 mg.

      Standard induction chemotherapy that these patients receive according to routine clinical
      practice at Spanish sites, in accordance with the PETHEMA protocol for patients with
      high-risk ALL (ALL-AR-11), consists of: Vincristine (VCR) 1.5 mg/m2 (maximum dose 2 mg) IV
      days 1, 8, 15 and 22,Daunorubicin (DNR) 45 mg/m2 IV days 1, 8, 15 and 22, prednisone 60 mg/m2
      per day, IV or PO, days 1 to 14,30 mg/m2 per day, IV or PO, days 15 to 21, 15 mg/m2 per day,
      IV or PO, days 21 to 28,E. coli L-asparaginase (L-ASP) (Kidrolase®) 10,000 IU/m2, IV, days
      16-20, 23-27,Intrathecal TIT chemotherapy day 1* (if not administered in the pre-phase) and
      22, Methotrexate (MTX) 12 mg, ARA-C: 30 mg, Hydrocortisone 20 mg, G-CSF (SC or IV) from day
      15 until neutrophils &gt; 1000/µl.

      Following the administration of induction therapy, a bone marrow analysis will be performed
      with morphological, genetic and molecular study if necessary, with a centralised MRD
      determination by MFC. In the case of a complete morphological response and MRD &lt; 0.1% (&lt;
      1×10-3), the patient will be enrolled in the trial and receive consolidation and maintenance
      treatment according to protocol.

      Consolidation - CYCLE 1 Early consolidation chemotherapy that the patients will receive in
      the first cycle (21 days) consists of: dexamethasone 20 mg/m2 per day, PO or IV days 1-5, 10
      mg/m2 per day, PO or IV day 6, 5 mg/m2 per day, PO or IV day 7, 2.5 mg/m2 per day, PO or IV
      day 8, Vincristine 1.5 mg/m2 per day, IV (maximum 2 mg) days 1 and 8, Methotrexare 3g/m2, IV
      in 24 hours, E. coli L-asparaginase (L-ASP) (Kidrolase®): 20,000 IU/m2, IV, day 3,Triple
      intrathecal therapy day 1.

      Consolidation - CYCLE 2

      Early consolidation chemotherapy that the patient will receive in the second cycle (21 days)
      consists of:

        -  Dexamethasone:

             -  20 mg/m2 per day, PO or IV days 1-5.

             -  10 mg/m2 per day, PO or IV day 6.

             -  5 mg/m2 per day, PO or IV day 7.

             -  2.5 mg/m2 per day, PO or IV day 8.

        -  ARA-C:

           - 2 g/m2 every 12 hours, over 3 hours, days 1 and 2. Halve the ARA-C for patients over
           50 years of age.

        -  E. coli L-asparaginase (L-ASP) (Kidrolase®): 20,000 IU/m2, IV, day 3. Halve the dose for
           patients over 50 years of age as the toxicity of any type of ASP increases with age.

        -  Triple intrathecal therapy day 4 (administered that day to keep the intrathecal therapy
           separate from the high-dose ARA-C).

      Consolidation - CYCLE 3 In the third early consolidation cycle, the investigational drug
      blinatumomab will be administered.

        -  Blinatumomab 28 μg/day as a continuous infusion, IV over 4 weeks.

        -  Triple intrathecal therapy day 1.

      Late consolidation Two weeks after completing the blinatumomab treatment, in the case of MRD
      &lt; 0.01% (&lt; 1×10-4), patients will receive 2 blocks of intensive chemotherapy (identical to
      those in early consolidation), separated by 3 weeks, followed by a treatment cycle with
      blinatumomab, the investigational medicinal product, for 4 weeks.

      After administering late consolidation therapy, a bone marrow study will be conducted. In the
      case of MRD &lt; 0.01% (&lt; 1×10-4), the patient will receive maintenance treatment. If this MRD
      level is not achieved, the patient will be withdrawn from the study and undergo a
      haematopoietic stem cell transplantation, according to routine clinical practice at Spanish
      sites.

      The maintenance therapy that patients will receive in this phase of the trial will consist of
      continuous chemotherapy administration (mercaptopurine and methotrexate) with reinductions
      for up to one year from CR

    <description>Blinatumomab is a bispecific monoclonal antibody designed to bind specifically to CD19, expressed on the surface of B-cells, and to CD3, expressed on the surface of T-cells. It activates endogenous T-cells by connecting the CD3 on the T-cell receptor complex (TCR) with the CD19 on the B-cells. The anti-tumour activity of blinatumomab does not depend on whether the T-cells carry a specific TCR or peptide antigens present in cancer cells, but it is polyclonal and independent of HLA on the target cells</description>
