    <textblock>
      This project examines the effects of cannabis on cognition and other domains of function and
      whether those effects are dependent upon the ratio of THC to CBD in the product. Current
      cannabis users are asked to stop using their typical product and to use cannabis containing
      different ratios of the cannabinoids THC and CBD. Participants complete baseline assessments
      including cognitive tasks, clinical measures, substance use history, and blood draw.
      Participants then acquire and use their study strain on their own, and after a period of use
      the mobile pharmacology laboratory goes to a location of their choosing. They complete
      cognitive, motor and blood-based assessments, then leave the mobile lab to use their study
      product one last time, returning to the mobile lab to complete cognitive, motor, and
      blood-based assessments immediately after use and one hour after use. A small subset of
      participants complete all of these procedures but use edible as opposed to flower-based
      products.

      Cannabis research can be dated back to the 1970's where standardized smoking of low potency
      cannabis in a laboratory setting has been the primary method used to understand the effects
      of the drug. The objective of this program is to use a naturalistic design to advance a more
      nuanced understanding of the potential outcomes associated with using different strains of
      marijuana. Researchers need to understand the effects of commonly used cannabis strains, as
      they are used in every day life. Commonly available strains of cannabis sold in dispensaries
      in Colorado have 3-5 times greater potency of cannabinoids, such as the psychoactive compound
      tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), than what has been used in laboratory settings. It is possible
      that laboratory based studies underestimate the effects of more potent strains that are
      widely available. Also, scientists have focused on the effects of THC while mostly ignoring
      other major cannabinoids (e.g. cannabidiol or CBD) and their synergistic relationship.

      The objective of this study is to observe how different strains of marijuana, based off their
      unique cannabinoid content, can influence your mental and physical state in real time. This
      program will allow researchers to observe these effects immediately before and after cannabis
      use. A participant will use cannabis in the comfort of their home, and will walk out their
      front door and into a mobile lab that will be parked outside of their house. In this study,
      there is no need to smoke and drive.

      Participation is this study involves one appointment at the laboratory facility in Boulder
      and one appointment in the mobile laboratory.
