  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the clinical impact of a combined protocol with cognitive-behavioral
      intervention and physiotherapy adjuvant to the standard medical treatment in patients with
      haemophilia that suffer from chronic pain
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to improve the perception of the experience of chronic pain, as
      well as functionality and quality of life in hemophilic patients with chronic pain

      Secondary objectives are:

        -  to change the perception that the patient has of their pain, to improve the coping
           strategies and to increase the perception of self-efficacy of patients in pain
           management.

        -  to increase the resources that allow a better self-regulatory of emotional, cognitive
           and competential of the pain experience, reverting in the emotional state of patients,
           particularly in levels of anxiety and depression.

        -  to improve functional capacity and musculoskeletal status.

        -  to improve quality of life.

        -  to determine whether changes / improvements are maintained over time 3 months after
           finishing the program

          -  Informed consent signed.

          -  Signs of arthropathy according to clinical criteria (score Gilbert) and / or
             radiological criteria (score Pettersson) in at least one of the six joints most

          -  Chronic pain (CP) defined as persistent pain lasting at least six months and resistant
             to conventional medical therapy. It differs from the acute pain not only in its longer

             cognitive and behavioral efforts made by the individual in order to manage internal
             and external demands generated by their chronic pain condition and that involve a
             challenge to their potential individual resources.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Presence of inhibitor to FVIII or FIX.

          -  Another haemostatic defect.

          -  Patients with severe cognitive deficits with which it is not possible a cognitive
             psychological intervention.

          -  The inability to attend physiotherapy sessions for 12 consecutive weeks (7 supervised
             and 31 self-monitored)

          -  Surgical procedures performed 6 weeks prior or during the intervention protocol.
