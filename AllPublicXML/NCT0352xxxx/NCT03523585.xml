  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is designed to compare DS 8201a versus standard of care (investigator's choice) in
      subjects with unresectable and/or metastatic breast cancer previously treated with T DM1.

      Primary Objective:

        -  To compare the progression-free survival (PFS) benefit of DS 8201a to investigator's
           choice.

      Secondary Objectives:

        -  To further investigate the efficacy of DS 8201a compared to investigator's choice on:

             1. Overall survival (OS);

             2. Objective response rate (ORR);

             3. Duration of response (DoR);

             4. Clinical benefit rate (CBR).

        -  To further determine pharmacokinetics (PK) of DS 8201a.

        -  To further evaluate safety of DS 8201a compared to investigator's choice.

        -  To evaluate Health Economics and Outcomes Research (HEOR) endpoints for DS 8201a
           compared to investigator's choice.
