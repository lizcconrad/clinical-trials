      The purpose of this study is to evaluate pharmacokinetics (PK) following a single dose and
      multiple dose treatment and the safety of apalutamide in Chinese participants with metastatic
      castration resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) at dose of 240 milligram (mg).

    <description>Participants will receive a single oral dose of apalutamide 240 milligram (mg) during pharmacokinetics (PK) Week Day 1 and will be monitored for one week (that is; PK Week) to assess PK and safety of drug. Subsequently, participants will further receive daily treatment of apalutamide from Cycle 1 Day 1 onwards until disease progression, withdrawal of consent, lost to follow-up, or the occurrence of unacceptable toxicity. Each treatment cycle consists of 28 days.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status less than or equal to
             (&lt;=) 2

          -  Histologically or cytologically confirmed adenocarcinoma of the prostate without
             neuroendocrine differentiation or small cell features

          -  Metastatic disease as documented by bone scan or metastatic lesions by computed
             tomography or magnetic resonance imaging scans (visceral or lymph node disease). Lymph
             nodes in the pelvis must measure at least 1.5 centimeter in a short axis to be
             considered target lesion according to the modified Response Evaluation Criteria in
             Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1 based on the Prostate Cancer Working Group 2 (PCWG2)
             criteria

          -  Castration-resistant prostate cancer (PC) demonstrated during continuous androgen
             deprivation therapy (ADT), defined as 3 rises of prostate-specific antigen (PSA), at
             least 1 week apart, with the last PSA greater than or equal to (&gt;=) 2 nanogram per
             milliliter (ng/mL)

          -  Prior hormonal interventions (including 1st generation antiandrogens [flutamide,
             bicalutamide, nilutamide], steroids, estrogens, finasteride, dutasteride) for PC are
             allowed. These therapies, except for gonadotropin releasing hormone analogs (GnRH)
             analogs and prednisone/prednisolone, must have been discontinued for minimally 4 weeks
             (2 weeks only for flutamide, nilutamide, or finasteride) before first dose of study
             drug

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Known brain metastases

          -  Chemotherapy, or immunotherapy within 2 weeks or 5 half-lives of the drug prior to the
             first dose of study drug, whichever is longer, with a maximum of 4 weeks.

          -  Prior treatment with second-generation anti-androgens (example [eg], enzalutamide)

          -  Administration of an investigational therapeutic within 2 weeks or 5 half-lives of the
             drug prior to the first dose of study drug, whichever is longer, with a maximum of 4
             weeks. And participant use radiopharmaceutical agents (eg, strontium-89) or
             investigational immunotherapy (eg, sipuleucel-T) within 12 weeks prior to the first
             dose of study drug

          -  Prior treatment with cytochrome 17 inhibitors (eg, abiraterone acetate, orteronel,
             galeterone, systemic ketoconazole)
