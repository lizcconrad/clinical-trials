    <textblock>
      This study will investigate the effect of teriflunomide in reducing cortical gray matter
      (CGM) atrophy and leptomeningeal (LM) inflammation over 24 months compared to dimethyl
      fumarate (Tecfidera®)

        Individuals diagnosed with MS who have used dimethyl fumarate or teriflunomide and had
        magnetic resonance imaging at baseline (before starting disease modifying therapy (DMT) in
        question), 12 months after starting DMT, and 24 months after starting DMT.
