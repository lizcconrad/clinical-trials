  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients who are Hepatitis C Negative (HCV negative) and are on the waiting list for a lung
      transplant at NYULH who consent to participate in this study will receive a lung transplant
      from a deceased donor that is HCV positive. Patients will initiate treatment for HCV with the
      pan-genotypic agent, Mavyret, on the day of surgery and will complete the full 8-week
      treatment course. Patients will be monitored post-transplant for the development of viremia,
      and for the time course of clearance of viremia among those who develop viremia.
