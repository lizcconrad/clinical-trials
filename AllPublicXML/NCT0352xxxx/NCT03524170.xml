  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this clinical research study is to find the highest tolerable dose of M7824
      (MSB0011359C) that can be given with radiation therapy to patients with estrogen and/or
      progesterone receptor (HR) positive, HER2-negative breast cancer that is metastatic (has
      spread). The safety and tolerability of MSB0011359C will also be studied.

      Researchers also want to learn more about how certain immune cells may change when
      MSB0011359C in given in combination with radiation therapy. The effect of the study treatment
      combination will also be studied.

      This is an investigational study. MSB0011359C is not FDA approved or commercially available.
      It is currently being used for research purposes only.

      Radiation therapy is part of standard of care for many breast cancer patients.

      The study doctor can describe how the study drug and radiation therapy are designed to work.

      Up to 20 participants will be enrolled in this study. All will take part at MD Anderson.

      Study Drug Administration:

      There are 28 days in every cycle.

      If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, you will receive 1 of 2 dose
      levels of MSB0011359C, based on when you join the study. The first 3 participants will
      receive the higher of the 2 dose levels. Each new group (of 3) will receive the same dose
      unless intolerable side effects are seen in a certain number of participants. If this occurs,
      the next groups will receive the lower dose level of MSB0011359C. If intolerable side effects
      are seen in a certain number of participants when using the lower dose, the study will be
      stopped.

      You will receive MSB0011359C by vein over about 1 hour every 14 days +/-3 days. You will be
      watched for side effects for 2 hours after each infusion. Radiation therapy will start within
      3 days after the second dose of MSB0011359C. Depending on the site of your disease, you will
      receive radiation 1 time a day for 5 days or 10 days.

      Length of Study:

      You may continue taking the study drug for as long as the doctor thinks it is in your best
      interest. You will no longer be able to take the study drug if the disease gets worse, if
      intolerable side effects occur, or if you are unable to follow study directions.

      If you cannot tolerate the study drug, your dose may be lowered or stopped.

      Your participation on the study will be over 90 days after you receive the last dose of
      MSB0011359C.

      Pharmacokinetic (PK) Testing:

      Blood (about 1 teaspoon) will be collected on Day 1 of Cycles 1 and 3, and before study drug
      infusion in Cycles 2 and 6 for pharmacokinetic (PK) testing. They may also be tested at the
      end of study visit. PK testing measures the amount of study drug in the body at different
      time points. The samples will also be tested to learn how the drug has changed inside your
      body. This will help the doctors decide if the daily dose of the study drug needs to be
      increased, decreased, or remain at the current level.

      Study Visits:

      On Day 1 of Each Cycle:

        -  You will have a physical exam.

        -  Blood (about 14 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests and to measure your blood
           sugar levels, blood clotting function, the amount of cholesterol in your blood, and your
           thyroid, liver, and kidney functions.

        -  You will have an EKG to check your heart function.

        -  If you can become pregnant, blood (about 1 teaspoon) or urine will be drawn for a
           pregnancy test.

      On Day 56:

        -  You will have a physical exam.

        -  Blood (about 14 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests, to measure the amount of
           cholesterol in your blood, and your liver and kidney functions.

        -  If you can become pregnant, blood (about 1 teaspoon) or urine will be drawn for a
           pregnancy test.

        -  You will have a CT scan, a PET/CT scan, and/or an MRI to check the status of the
           disease.

        -  You will have a tumor biopsy of 2 sites if possible (the site that received radiation
           and a site that did not) on Day 56 or within 7 days of Day 56 for immune system and
           biomarker testing, including genetic biomarkers.

      End-of-Study Visit (EOT):

      If the disease gets worse, you will have an end of study visit. At this visit you will have
      the following tests:

        -  Blood (about 14 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests and to measure your blood
           sugar levels, blood clotting function, the amount of cholesterol in your blood, and to
           test your thyroid, liver, and kidney function.

        -  You will have a core biopsy to find out if the tumor has grown due to problems with your
           immune system.
