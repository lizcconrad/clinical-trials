  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hypothermia is a frequent perioperative complication. Its appearance can have deleterious
      effects such as myocardial ischemia or perioperative bleeding. When the negative effects of
      anesthesia on temperature are aggravated by other factors, such as glycine infusion in
      transurethral resection, temperature can decrease even more. Once the temperature has
      decreased, its treatment is difficult. Preoperative warming prevents hypothermia, lowering
      the temperature gradient between core and peripheral compartments and reducing thermal
      redistribution. The most recent clinical practice guidelines advocate for active prewarming
      before induction of general anaesthesia since it is very effective in preventing
      perioperative hypothermia. However, the ideal warming time prior to the induction of
      anesthesia has long been investigated. This study aims to evaluate if different time periods
      of preoperative forced-air warming reduces the incidence of hypothermia at the end of surgery
      in patients submitted to transurethral resection. This is an observational prospective study
      comparing routine practice of pre-warming in consecutive surgical patients scheduled to
      undergo elective transurethral resection between March 2014 and April 2018. Three-hundred
      patients are included in this study and prewarming will be applied following routine clinical
      practice. The prewarming time will depend on the time the patient has to wait before entering
      in the operating theatre. Measurement of temperature will be performed using a tympanic
      thermometer. Patients will be followed throughout their hospital admission. Data will be
      recorded using a validated instrument and will be analysed using the statistics program R
      Core Team.

      Maintaining patient's temperature above 36 grades Celsius throughout the perioperative period
      is challenging. Thus, it is essential to monitor temperature in order to be able to take
      measures to avoid the appearance of hypothermia. Once the temperature has decreased, its
      treatment is difficult since the application of heat to the body surface takes a long time to
      reach the core thermal compartment. Intraoperative warming alone cannot avoid postoperative
      hypothermia. The application of forced-air warming system during the preoperative period has
      been shown to be the most effective measure to prevent hypothermia and maintain
      intraoperative normothermia. However, it would not be efficient to provide a long-time
      prewarming in short-term surgical procedures. Thus, the ideal warming time prior to the
      induction of anesthesia has long been investigated.

      Due to the searching of optimal prewarming time and the lack of evidence about the efficiency
      of prewarming in patients submitted to transurethral resection, the conductance of this study
      is justified.
