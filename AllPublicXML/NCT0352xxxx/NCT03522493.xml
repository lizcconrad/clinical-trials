  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      20 healthy young subjects and 20 healthy older subjects will go through a medical
      examination. Subjects will be asked for their medical history especially on respiratory and
      cardiac diseases. All subjects will go through a spirometry test to evaluate their
      respiratory function. After their medical clearance each subjects will be asked to wear a
      CBRN respirator for 45 minutes. 15 minutes without filter, 15 minute with 0.8 cmH2O
      resistance, and 15 minutes with 1.2 cmH2O resistance. Throughout the test, Pco2 AND PO2 will
      be measured. The investigator will evaluate the effect of resistance (filter resistance) and
      the age of the subject on CO2 accumulation in the mask.

      After signing the consent form, 20 healthy young subjects and 20 healthy older subjects will
      go through a medical examination. Subjects will be asked for their medical history especially
      on respiratory and cardiac diseases. All subjects will go through a spirometry test to
      evaluate their respiratory function. After their medical clearance each subjects will be
      asked to wear a CBRN respirator for 45 minutes. 15 minutes without filter, 15 minute with 0.8
      cmH2O resistance, and 15 minutes with 1.2 cmH2O resistance. Throughout the test, Pco2 AND PO2
      will be measured with mass spectrometer. Oxygen saturation, Pulse rate, and minute
      ventilation will also be monitored. The investigator will evaluate the effect of resistance
      (filter resistance) and the age of the subject on CO2 accumulation in the mask.
