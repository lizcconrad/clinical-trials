  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the present study is to increase the general understanding of lung PK of selected
      compounds by sampling epithelial lining fluid ELF and lung tissue.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will investigate drug levels of selected compounds at multiple sites in the lung
      and explore different innovative sampling methods to obtain information on lung PK. The aim
      of the study is not to generate safety or efficacy data of the selected licensed drugs. The
      choice of drugs is based on general considerations regarding therapy of airway diseases and
      the physical-chemical properties of the compounds. It is not driven by the compounds per se.

             predicted ≥ 80% and FEV1/Forced Vital Capacity (FVC) &gt; 70%.

             visit 3. These patients can be rescreened starting from visit 1.

          -  Any clinically relevant abnormal findings in physical examination, clinical chemistry,
             hematology, urinalysis, vital signs, lung function, or ECG at Visit 1, which, in the
             opinion of the investigator, may either put the subject at risk because of
             participation in the study, or may influence the results of the study, or the
             subject's ability to participate in the study

          -  History of drug or alcohol abuse

          -  Risk of non-compliance with study procedures

          -  Suspected inability to understand the protocol requirements, instructions and
             study-related restrictions, the nature, scope, and possible consequences of the study
