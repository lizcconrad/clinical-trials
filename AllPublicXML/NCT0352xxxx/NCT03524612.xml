  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will assess the ability of eltrombopag to induce sustained treatment-free
      remission in ITP subjects who relapsed or failed to respond to an initial treatment with
      steroids.

      There is limited, mainly retrospective evidence that earlier use of eltrombopag after ITP
      diagnosis, will allow a larger proportion of subjects to achieve sustained remission after
      tapering off drug. Clinically there is a need for a less toxic regimen that will provide
      responses and sustained remission with a shorter treatment interval. This trial is designed
      to assess this.

    <description>Sustained remission is defined as reach platelet count ≥ 100×109/L (complete response [CR]) and then maintain platelet counts around 100×109/L for 2 months (no counts below 70×109/L) AND then taper off the drug until treatment discontinuation while, maintain platelet count ≥ 30×109/L in the absence of bleeding (no bleeding AEs) or use of any rescue therapy until month 12.</description>

    <measure>Change from baseline in Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy-Fatigue (FACIT-Fatigue) questionaire</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to 3, 6, 9, 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>The Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy-Fatigue (FACIT-Fatigue) instrument is a 13-item validated tool used to measure an individual's level of fatigue during usual daily activities over the past 7 days (Cella 2002, Webster 2003). FACIT-Fatigue is a subscale of the FACIT measurement system. FACIT-fatigue is scored using a 4-point Likert scale (4=not at all fatigued to 0=very much fatigued) where the total possible score ranges from 0-5; higher scores represent better HRQoL.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from baseline in Functinal Assessment of Cancer Therapy- Thrombocytopenia (FACT-Th6) questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to 3, 6, 9, 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>FACT-Th6 instrument is used to measure worry/concern about bleeding and bruising, and the impact of this worry/concern on physical and social activity (Cella 2006). FACT-Th6 is a 6-item subset of the more detailed FACT-Th, which is an 18-item subscale of the validated FACT that specifically measures concerns related to thrombocytopenia in the past 7 days. The FACT-Th6 is scored using a 5-level Likert scale (0=not at all to 4=very much) and is calculated by summing scores for the 6-items; therefore, scores can range from 0-24, with higher scores representing better HRQoL</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from baseline in Short Form 36 Health Survey (SF-36v2) questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to 3, 6, 9, 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>SF-36v2 is a validated instrument used to measure general physical and mental health status (Ware 2000) via assessment of 8 domains—Physical Functioning, Role Physical, Bodily Pain, General Health, Vitality, Social Functioning, Role Emotional, and Mental Health—over the past 4 weeks or 7 days. The SF-36 is scored using norm-based scoring procedures and scores ranging from 0-100; higher scores represent better HRQoL</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Overall change from baseline of the overall impact of side effects on treatment via Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-G (GP5)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 12 months or end of study</time_frame>
    <description>The GP5 is a single question used to assess the overall bothersomeness of treatment side effects. The GP5 is scored using a 5-point rating scale (0 = not at all; 1 = a little bit; 2 = somewhat; 3 = quite a bit; and 4 = very much), where lower scores reflect less bothersomeness from treatment side effects.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Overall change of treatment satisfaction using Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire (TSQM-9)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 12 months or end of study</time_frame>
    <description>TSQM-9 will be used to assess treatment satisfaction with medication. The three scales of the TSQM-9 include the effectiveness scale, convenience scale, and global satisfaction scale</description>
