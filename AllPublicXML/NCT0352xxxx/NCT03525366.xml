  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose: To determine the safety and efficacy of Radiofrequency Ablation (RFA) HALO Ultra
      system in patients with Gastric Antral Vascular Ectasia patient cohort (GAVE).

      Research design: This is a prospective observational study. Procedure Used: Radiofrequency
      Ablation

      Risks and potential benefits:

      There are no risks associated with this study as it is a retrospective chart review.
      Potential benefits include the knowledge gained from this study which may be of help to
      patients in the future.

      Importance of knowledge that may reasonably be expected to result The knowledge gained from
      this study may be of help to other patients in the future.

      The purpose of this study is to see how well study device works at treating people with
      Gastric Antral Vascular Ectasia (GAVE). The device has already been approved by the Food and
      Drug Administration (FDA) and is a part of standard of care. You have been invited to join
      this research study because you require diagnostic or therapeutic evaluation of the Gastric
      Antral Vascular Ectasia by RFA.

      This is a single -site study being performed at the University of Texas Health Science
      Center. The study will enroll a total 1000 patients with GAVE. This study is purely
      observational and will collect clinical information regarding your GAVE
