  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This three year study explores the feasibility and acceptability of conducting a full
      randomized controlled trial (RCT) of a promising coaching intervention for improving and
      sustaining physical activity (PA) and healthy dietary habits in children with physical
      disabilities (CWPD).

      Thirty children (ages 10 - 18) will spend 12 months in the study. All will receive usual care
      and basic printed information about healthy lifestyles. In addition, 15 will receive a
      coaching intervention for the first six months. Pre-defined success criteria will assess the
      feasibility of trial processes.

      Acceptability of trial participation and impact of coaching will be explored qualitatively.
      Health indicators and psychosocial outcomes will be assessed four times, at the start of the
      trial, immediately post-intervention and at three and six months post-intervention.

    <textblock>
      The World Health Organization's Global Strategy on Diet, Physical Activity (PA) and Health
      Promotion highlights that PA and dietary habits are central to disease prevention and
      lifelong health. Canadian children have increased health risks as their activity levels are
      drastically lower than recommendations and ~26% are classified as overweight or obese. The
      situation is even more critical for children with disabilities; 4.2% of Canadian children
      have disabilities and this number is rising. Due to complex and intersecting factors,
      children with physical disabilities (CWPD) are more sedentary, have lower PA rates and poorer
      quality diets than their non-disabled peers. Annual health care costs of obesity related to
      disability are estimated at $44 billion in the US, supporting the need to start health
      promotion activities early in life. Despite the serious proximal and distal consequences of
      this health profile, the investigators lack robust evidence on effective strategies to foster
      and sustain health habits for CWPD.

      A new intervention paradigm that produces sustainable results without undue burden (on
      families or services) is therefore urgently required to address the health promotion needs of
      CWPD. The investigators propose that a strengths-based coaching approach may meet all of
      these requirements. Solution-Focused Coaching in Pediatric Rehabilitation (SFC-Peds) has been
      recommended as a coaching model for children with disabilities, for its strong theoretical
      basis and ability to be customized to children and families' resources, environmental
      settings, child age and developmental stage. Taking a strengths-based approach (such as
      SFC-Peds) is a departure from usual rehabilitation research and practice, which has largely
      been problem-focused (i.e. what a child can't do). A strengths-based approach can result in
      hope, motivation and action.

      Given that the investigators will be the first to use SFC-Peds to promote healthy habits with
      CWPD, a feasibility and acceptability study is essential. Evidence of feasibility is a
      critical prerequisite for a RCT, especially for complex interventions that have multiple
      interacting components and/or target multiple behaviours (such as SFC-Peds). Feasibility
      studies rigorously examine the processes (e.g. recruitment and retention), resources (e.g.
      personnel, time required to complete measures), management (e.g. coordination of research
      personnel, quality of data entry) and science (e.g. appropriate methodology and outcomes) of
      the intended RCT. It is also critical to evaluate the acceptability of interventions for the
      target population (e.g. satisfaction with duration, intensity, level of interest, perceived
      impact), as well as those allocated to the control arm (e.g. acceptability of not receiving
      coaching, perceived burden of assessments). Examining all of these issues before the efficacy
      trial begins increases the likelihood of success. Feasibility studies such as the one the
      investigators are proposing help ensure that resources are invested in efficacy trials likely
      to generate clinically meaningful results and therefore have maximum impact on health care
      knowledge and outcomes.

      Primary objective: To evaluate the feasibility (study design, methods, processes) and
      acceptability (family/child/clinician satisfaction, perceived usefulness) of conducting a
      randomized controlled trial (RCT) of a novel, brief, coaching intervention, solution-focused
      coaching in pediatric rehabilitation (SFC-Peds) for improving and sustaining physical
      activity (PA) and dietary habits in children with physical disabilities (CWPD).

      Secondary objective: To determine the responsiveness of selected outcome measures to SFC-Peds
      coaching over 12 months.

      Principal research question: &quot;Is an efficacy trial to evaluate a 6 month SFC-Peds
      intervention to improve PA and dietary habits feasible to implement and acceptable to CWPD
      and families?&quot;

      Physical, environmental and psychosocial restrictions mean that children with physical
      disabilities (CWPD) are adopting worrying physical activity (PA) and dietary habits. Despite
      this, the investigators currently have limited evidence to inform interventions that may
      enhance lifelong health in CWPD. The investigators suggest that a paradigm shift is needed,
      one that moves beyond traditional prescriptive programs to a strengths-based approach where
      intervention strategies enable new health habits to be integrated seamlessly into children
      and families' everyday lifestyles for long-term sustainability.

      Research such as our proposed study will ensure that this potentially transformative approach
      is rigorously examined and used in an evidence-based manner. As little is known about
      effective and acceptable behaviour change interventions for CWPD, this study's findings will
      make significant contributions to the field: i) Greater understanding of ecologically valid
      interventions that have the potential to enhance the long term health of CWPD; ii) Insight
      into how 2 different rehabilitation populations respond to SFC-Peds; and iii) Data on the
      responsiveness of outcome measures to a SFC-Peds intervention. These insights will enable us
      to design acceptable, feasible and rigorous interventions that will result in robust data for
      informing both research and clinical practice.

    <time_frame>At first coaching session (immediately post-study enrollment/randomization) and at Time 2 (immediately post-coaching), 3 (3 months post-coaching), 4 (6 months post-coaching)</time_frame>
    <description>The COPM is an evidence-based outcome measure designed to capture a participant's self-perception of performance in everyday living, over time.
Participants will identify occupational performance problems in the areas of SELF-CARE (personal care, functional mobility, and community management), PRODUCTIVITY (paid or unpaid work, household management, and school and/or play), and LEISURE (quiet recreation, active recreation, and socialization).
They will then rate each one in terms of its IMPORTANCE in their life on a scale of 1 (not important at all) to 10 (extremely important). Respondents will pick 5 problems and for each problem rate:
PERFORMANCE (how would you rate the way that you do this activity now?) on a scale of 1 (not able to do it at all) to 10 (able to do it extremely well) SATISFACTION (How satisfied are you with the way you do this activity now?) on a scale of 1 (not satisfied at all) to 10 (extremely satisfied).</description>

    <description>A measure of participant goal attainment by defining five levels of goal attainment, thus ensuring that all attainment levels are mutually exclusive and measurable. This is an objective measure of behaviour change. Participants will provide a goal statement for each level.
Scale ranges from:
2 present level or much less than expected
1 somewhat less than expected 0 expected level or program goal
1 somewhat better than expected
2 much better than expected A single GAS score is identified for a goal from the above 5 levels. Higher scores indicate better goal attainment.</description>

    <description>A child questionnaire estimating percent of time spent inactive, somewhat inactive, somewhat active, and very active on a typical school day and Saturday. Each question represents 1 time point in the day. Estimated percent ranging from 0-100% for all 4 activity levels must add up to 100% per question.
Activity Level Description
Inactive - lying down, resting
Somewhat inactive - activities that are mostly done sitting down.
Somewhat active - walking, shopping, light chores, playing with pet
Very active - require lots of movement and make you breathe/sweat hard
The questionnaire also asks participants to rate their:
Overall level of activity (very inactive to very active) on a typical school day/Saturday
How typical the school day/Saturday described was in the last 6 months (very much like most days to very different from most days)
Changes in a participant's activity level from 6 months on a school day/weekend (choice of much less active to much more active)</description>

    <description>A child questionnaire assessing self-determination. Only multiple choice domains 1 (autonomy), 3 (psychological empowerment), and 4 (self-realization) will used.
Domain 1 scores range from 0 (&quot;I don't even have a chance) to 3 (I do every time I have a chance) for each question (21 questions) and summed (max. score of 96). Higher scores indicate higher levels or autonomy.
Domain 2 scores are 0 or 1 (16 points total) depending on response. Answers reflecting psychological empowerment (e.g. beliefs in ability, perceptions of control, and expectations of success) are scored 1 and those that do not reflect a psychologically empowered belief or attitude are scored 0. Higher scores indicate more psychological empowerment.
Domain 3 scores are 0 (answer not reflecting positive self-awareness/knowledge) or 1 (answer reflecting positive self-awareness/knowledge) based on response (total 15 points). Higher scores represent greater self-realization.</description>

Participants rate each self-efficacy statement for healthy eating (e.g. If you wanted to, how sure are you that you could eat healthy foods when you are… at the mall.. with your friends..etc.) on a scale ranging from:
Not sure at all
Not sure
Neither sure nor unsure
Fairly sure
Very sure Higher scores indicate higher self-efficacy for healthy eating.</description>

    <description>This is a 32-item parent-report assessment to assess the health behaviours of family members as well as the nature of the home environment. Respondent rates each eating and activity habit for the participant and both parents as applicable. There are 4 sub-scales: Physical activity, eating habits and style, hunger and satiety cues, and obesogenic environment-exposure.
Individual scores range from 0 - 4. Sub-scale scores are calculated by summing individual scores in the sub-scale for each family member. A total score was generated by summing all individual scores for each family member. The total score is considered an index of overall inappropriateness of eating patterns, and the higher the score, the more obesogenic the environment.</description>
