    <textblock>
      The main purpose of this study is to model tissue specific kinetics of [11C]Yohimbine in
      healthy male participants by positron emission tomography (PET) and the appropriate arterial
      input function (part A) ; to determine the reproducibility of measures (classical test-retest
      study, part B1) and to measure the blocking of [11C]Yohimbine uptake in the brain following
      single oral dose administration of clonidine (part B2).

    <description>Each subject will receive an intravenous (IV) bolus injection of [11C]Yohimbine at a dose of 370 MegaBecquerel (MBq) ± 10% with concomitant arterial blood sampling. The distribution of [11C]Yohimbine in brain will be measured by dynamic PET scans obtained from the time of injection for up to 90 minutes along with measurement of the tracer input function with arterial samples for intact tracer and metabolites to establish the total and regional compartmental kinetics of [11C]Yohimbine.</description>

Part B2 : Occupancy of alpha2-adrenergic receptors in brain by clonidine will be evaluated by comparing the binding potential of [11C]Yohimbine (IV bolus injection of [11C]Yohimbine at a dose of 370 MBq ± 10%) after single oral dose of clonidine (0,15mg) to the binding potential of [11C]Yohimbine obtained at baseline (part A).</description>
