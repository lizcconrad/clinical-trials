      Randomized clinical trial that aims to determine the effectiveness of a counseling

      alcohol consumption) in patients candidates for scheduled surgery or diagnostic procedures at
      the Hospital Universitario de San Ignacio. Bogotá-Colombia

      Objective: to determine the effect in the behavioral change stage of an intervention to
      modify risk behaviors (smoking and risky alcohol consumption) in patients candidates for
      scheduled surgery or diagnostic procedures at the Hospital Universitario de San Ignacio.
      Design: controlled clinical trial with random assignment Population: patients candidates for
      scheduled surgery or diagnostic procedures in surgery rooms between 19 and 64 years attending
      the pre-anesthetic consultation of the Hospital Universitario de San Ignacio. Interventions:
      brief behavioral intervention to modify risk behaviors versus information material on healthy
      lifestyles. Measurements: the characteristics of the study population will be described and
      the intervention and control groups will be compared in their basic conditions. The level of
      advance in the stage of change in the intervention and control arm, the proportion of people
      with the presence of the risk factor, as well as the decrease in the consumption of tobacco
      and alcohol will be compared. Expected duration: 28 months. Financing: Hospital Universitario
      de San Ignacio and Pontificia Universidad Javeriana. Ethical aspects: the study is adjusted
      to international and national standards for research projects. Under this norm, it is
      classified in the category of minimum risk because it is a clinical experiment with a common
      intervention in clinical practice.
