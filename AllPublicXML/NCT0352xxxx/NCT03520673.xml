  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The PriMUS Study aims to develop a clinical decision support tool to help GPs more accurately
      diagnose and manage LUTS in men. The study will recruit 880 men across three research hubs in
      Bristol, Newcastle and Wales. Men will all receive a series of simple index tests in primary
      care (following NICE Clinical Guidelines) and a urodynamics reference test. The study will
      then compare which combination of the simple index tests give the best prediction of the
      urodynamics result, which can then be incorporated into the clinical decision support tool.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Men are more likely to experience bothersome Lower Urinary Tract Symptoms (LUTS) as they get
      older. GPs follow standard processes to investigate signs of cancer, or more serious
      conditions but do not have access to tools to identify and manage more common symptoms of
      LUTS. This means men are likely to be referred to a urologist in secondary care, where they
      will receive advice or treatment that could have been given in primary care if GPs had more
      access to better diagnostic tools. The PriMUS Study will compare the results of the simple
      index tests, with the results of the urodynamic reference test, to identify which combination
      of simple index tests give the best prediction of the urodynamics diagnosis. The top
      performing simple index tests will be incorporated into the clinical decision support tool so
      that GPs can manage patients without needing invasive urodynamics. Follow up will be
      conducted 6 months post involvement; collating the treatment and management decisions made as
      a result of these procedures. The study will also consider and explore practicalities and
      acceptability of the urodynamic procedure and clinical decision support tool for both
      patients and clinical staff by conducting separate qualitative work.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Men aged 16 years and over.

          -  Men able and willing to undergo all index tests and reference test, and complete study

               -  This would include men on current treatment, but who are still symptomatic

          -  Men with other contraindications to urodynamics e.g. Heart valve or joint replacement

          -  Men with indwelling urinary catheters or who carry out intermittent

               -  According to standard NHS cancer pathways. If later deemed unlikely, then
                  eligible for study participation.
