  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Metastatic pancreatic cancer is difficult to treat. Until recently, most patients would be
      offered treatment with a chemotherapy drug called gemcitabine. However, a large international
      trial showed that combining gemcitabine with a drug called nab-paclitaxel (or abraxane) was
      more effective compared with gemcitabine alone. The purpose of this study is to compare two
      different ways of combining gemcitabine with abraxane. Conventionally, both drugs are given
      on the same day via a drip into a vein in the arm but research suggests that giving abraxane
      24 hours in advance of gemcitabine could possibly be more beneficial.

      In this study, blood and tumour samples will be collected and analysed to try to confirm what
      has been seen in the laboratory studies. In addition, the investigators wish to find out
      whether certain tumour characteristics (called biomarkers) can be used to predict for
      response to chemotherapy.
