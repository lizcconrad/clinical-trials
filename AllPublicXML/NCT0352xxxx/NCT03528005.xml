  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This project aims to examine the effectiveness of the community-based integrated care service
      model , based on a multi-domain intervention program, among community-dwelling older adults.
      Moreover, the investigators use the value-based healthcare standard set as well as
      comprehensive geriatric assessment as outcome measures and to use the randomized controlled
      trial design to validate the clinical effectiveness.

    <textblock>
      Population aging and the progress of medical technology are two main causes for the increase
      of healthcare expenditure. Effective management of medical expenditure and maintenance of
      health care quality have become the most important task for the public health and clinical
      care services. Both United Kingdom and the World Health Organization proposed introducing
      interdisciplinary team care to improve health of older people and to maximize their
      independence. Prof Michael Porter has addressed the current difficulty of healthcare system,
      and proposed that healthcare system should pursuit long-term outcome to promote the value of
      health care. This project aims to echo the international trends, using Taiwan healthcare
      system as the basis to establish the community-based integrated care service model, and to
      use the randomized controlled trial design to validate the clinical effectiveness.
