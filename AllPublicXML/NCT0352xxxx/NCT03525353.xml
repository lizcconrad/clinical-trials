      Purpose: To compare the radiation exposure in patients during Endoscopic retrograde
      cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) done by Endoscopists formally trained in judicious use of
      fluoroscopy versus ERCPs done by Endoscopists without such formal training.

      Research design: This is an observational study to compare radiation exposure in patients
      during ERCPs based on formal training.

      Procedures to be used: None Risks and potential benefits There are no risks associated with
      this study as it is a retrospective chart review. Potential benefits include the knowledge
      gained from this study which may be of help to patients in the future.

      Importance of knowledge that may reasonably be expected to result The knowledge gained from
      this study may be of help to provide new insights and develop newer guidelines for radiation
      use in the future.

        Any indications for undergoing an ERCP. If a patient undergoes more than one ERCP then it
        shall be reported as such, as multiple data points.

        Only those ERCP cases will be included that have been exposed to fluoroscopy (X-ray
        radiation).

        Those in whom the biliary or pancreatic ducts are not cannulated and therefore who do not
        receive any fluoroscopy will be excluded.

        Adult populations will be included, all races and belonging to any gender will be included
