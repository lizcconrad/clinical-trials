  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Nephrotoxic medication (NTMx) exposure is one of the most commonly cited causes of acute
      kidney injury (AKI) in hospitalized children, and is the primary cause of AKI in 16% of
      cases. Through initial work at Cincinnati Children's Medical Center, NTMx exposure was found
      to be potentially modifiable and the associated AKI is an avoidable adverse safety event.
      Currently, only serum Creatinine monitoring is available to monitor for NTMx-associated AKI.
      The hypotheses of this NINJA NGAL study are that (1) urine NGAL is highly sensitive to detect
      NTMx-associated AKI, and (2) Bedside test of urine from high risk NTMx-exposed patients are
      adequate and reliable compared to urine NGAL measured from the clinical platform.
