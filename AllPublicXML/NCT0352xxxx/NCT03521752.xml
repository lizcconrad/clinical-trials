  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study has the objective to determinate the effectiveness of a specific exercise program
      on balance and functional capacity of the daily activities of institutionalized elderly.

      It was a randomized controlled trial with a total of 21 elderly that were randomly
      distributed into experimental (n = 11) and control groups (n=10). The experimental group
      performed a specific program exercises during 4 weeks, while the control group wasn't
      subjected to any intervention. Evaluations were carried out at the beginning and end of the
      exercise program, for both groups. After the intervention there were no statistically
      significant differences between groups in total balance and dynamic balance subscale, except
      static balance subscale.

    <description>Performance Oriented Mobility Assessment (POMA) This scale measures the static and dynamic balance, through the evaluation of some daily activities.
This scale's scores are between 9 to 28 points, when 9 means hig risk of falling, and 28 means low risk of falling.
It was used before and after the intervention.</description>

    <description>Timed up and Go (TUG) This scale measures the mobility and locomotor performance, through the timing of an activity (lift from a chair, walk 3 meters, change direction and return to starting position).
The cut-off points of the scale are divided into fully independent elderly (&lt;10 seconds), independent elderly (10-19 seconds), and elderly people with difficulties in the tasks of daily living (20-29 seconds).
It was evaluated before and after the intervention.</description>

    <description>4 weeks of exercise classes, 2 to 3 times a week for a total of 10 sessions. Classes last approximately 40 minutes. The sessions included balance training, motor strength, endurance and flexibility. The training sessions were divided into warm-up, main activity and finally relaxation.</description>
