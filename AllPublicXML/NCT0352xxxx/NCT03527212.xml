    <textblock>
      A double-masked, randomized, multi-center, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study in adult
      patients with Dry Eye Disease (DED). Patients will be randomly assigned to receive either
      SJP-0035 0.001% or placebo

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There are currently no approved products available anywhere worldwide for the treatment of
      Dry Eye Disease (DED) that directly affect the corneal epithelium. This study will evaluate
      the safety and efficacy of SJP-0035 0.001%, compared with a placebo, on corneal healing.
      Patients meeting the requirements of the inclusion/exclusion criteria will administer 1 drop
      of the study drug/placebo 4 times per day for 4 weeks.

             eyes.

          -  Has blurred vision caused by DED in both eyes.

          -  Women of childbearing potential must have negative serum pregnancy test results at
             Screening and Randomization and agree to use effective contraception throughout the
             study; post-menopausal women must have negative serum pregnancy test results at
             Screening and Randomization.

          -  Male participants must agree to use an acceptable form of contraception (i.e. a condom
             plus spermicide) and to refrain from sperm donation throughout the study.

          -  Has any corneal stromal or endothelial abnormalities in either eye.

          -  Has any active or chronic allergic, bacterial or viral infection of ocular adnexa and
             eye structures in either eye.

          -  Has had eye surgery (including cataract, vitreous or eyelid surgery) in either eye
             within the last 28 days prior to first dose of study drug.

          -  Has had refractive surgery (including eye surface laser surgery) in either eye within
             the last 180 days prior to first dose of study drug.

          -  Has used any eye medication in either eye within 14 days prior to first dose of study
             drug, or is anticipated to require such medications during the study.
             Preservative-free artificial tears may be used up to 72 hours prior to the first dose
             in either eye.

          -  Is a contact lens wearer and cannot discontinue use in both eyes from Screening
             through the duration of the study.

          -  Has previously received SJP-0035 (study drug) in either eye.

          -  Currently has punctal occlusions, of any type, inserted into both superior and
