    <textblock>
      This is a multi-site, randomized, prospective study designed to evaluate the safety and
      efficacy of the Votiva device headpieces through radiofrequency for vaginal rejuvenation. An
      anticipated 50 subjects will undergo 3 treatments of the vulvovaginal area using
      radiofrequency unit or radiofrequency placebo. Study duration for each subject is
      approximately six months (including screening, 3 treatment sessions 3-4 weeks apart and 2
      follow-up visit at 3 and 6 months post initiation of treatment (4 and 12 weeks after
      completion of last treatment). Efficacy will be measured and evaluated by validated
      questionnaires to include: The Vulvovaginal Symptoms Questionnaire, Vaginal Laxity
      Questionnaire (VLQ), Urogenital Distress Short Form (UDI-6) and Incontinence Impact
      Questionnaire Short Form (IIQ-7), Female Sexual Function Index (FSFI) and the Female Sexual
      Distress Scale-Revised (FSDS-R).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Vaginal rejuvenation is a catch-all term of aesthetic and functional procedures which claim
      to provide relief of many issues affecting women's health, ranging from postmenopausal
      vulvovaginal symptoms (i.e. dryness, burning, itching), stress urinary incontinence, sexual
      dysfunction or discomfort, vaginal laxity, and external labial appearance, amongst others.1,2
      Several companies have emerged with non-invasive or minimally-invasive technologies to
      alleviate these conditions which operate by radiofrequency (RF) delivery, Hybrid Fractional
      Laser, fractional CO2 laser3, or Er:YAG4. Votiva by InMode is unique in its usage as both an
      internal and external rejuvenating device.

      The RF technologies work theoretically by heating the connective tissue of the vaginal wall
      to 40 to 42°C thereby remodeling extracellular matrix configuration. Once optimal
      temperatures are reached, collagen contraction, neocollagenesis, vascularization, and growth
      factor infiltration could lead to durable vaginal wall changes with improvement in elasticity
      and moisture of the vaginal wall. Although numerous studies have demonstrated the therapeutic
      efficacy of energy-based devices in rejuvenation of the face, neck, and décolleté, their
      application in the vaginal canal is a fairly new concept that is currently being studied.11

      Given the paucity of data, this study aims to assess the utility and safety of the RF device
      Votiva in a two arm prospective case control trial for improvement in external labial
      appearance, vaginal laxity, sexual function and urinary incontinence.

One part of the system, the fractora handpiece, is approved for tissue coagulation for the purpose of skin rejuvenation. The Votiva has two hand pieces, Forma and Fractora, which have been cleared by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and are used during dermatological procedures.</description>
