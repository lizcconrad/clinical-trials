  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      56 patients with sarcoidosis will be selected to receive treatment of tranilast.The
      investigators can analyse the changes in the thickness and area of skin lesions before and
      after treatment as well as other involved organs nodule size changes to determine the
      efficacy and safety of drugs.

      56 patients with sarcoidosis will be selected. After the signing of the informed consent
      ,participants will be collected the initial lesions photos, the size of the lump by
      ultrasound, the forced vital capacity(FVC), and chemical examinations including blood routine
      examination, routine urine test, liver function, renal function. During tranilast treatment
      (0.1g each time, three times a day) , participants need regular follow-up (1 per month)
      including liver and kidney function, blood glucose level monitoring, every three months to
      retest ultrasound and the forced vital capacity(FVC). With 3 month as a time point,
      participants were observed for four points(one point if only skin invasion ).After the
      experiment, the experimental data will be arranged and the data will be statistically
      processed (t test) to determine whether it is meaningful.
