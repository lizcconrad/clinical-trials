      The main objective of the study is to explore firstly, then further evaluate and confirm the
      efficacy between Pramipexole Sustained Release (SR) versus Pramipexole Immediate Release (IR)
      on nocturnal symptoms (as measured by the change from baseline to the end of the maintenance
      period in Parkinson's Disease Sleep Scale 2nd version (PDSS-2) score) in L-dopa+ treated
      patients with advanced Parkinson's disease (PD).

             provided in the patient information.

          -  Signed and dated written informed consent in accordance with ICH-GCP and local
             legislation prior to admission to the trial.

             and/or symptomatic orthostatic hypotension (i.e. clinical symptoms of orthostatic
             hypotension associated with a decline ≥ 20 mmHg in systolic blood pressure and a

             antiemetics, etc.).
