      A randomised controlled trial to evaluate the role of IV fluids in renal colic.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A RCT (Randomized Controlled Trial)to evaluate the role of 0.9% NACL (sodium chloride) IV
      fluids during an acute renal colic. The 2 arms will include -

        1. 2 liters of 0.9% NACL IV fluids with pain killers

        2. only pain killers The object is to find out if the IV fluids has any advantage in the
           care of renal colic. Does it helps to relive the pain? Does the stone eject earlier?
           Will there be fewer interventions?

    <description>Has the stone ejected without intervention? 1 month after the first visit in the ER (Emergency Room) we will preform an US or CT exam to verified that the stone ejected. If the stone that was seen by the US or CT in the ER is not present after 1 month we will assume it was spontaneously ejected. we would like to find out if there is any differences between the 2 groups in matter of spontaneously stone ejection. (Yes or No)</description>

    <description>The need for urological intervention. 1 month after the visit in the ER we will check if the patient have gone through urological intervention such as urolithiasis. We would like to find out if there is any difference between the two groups in matter of urological intervention between 1 month after the visit in the ER. (Yes or No)</description>
