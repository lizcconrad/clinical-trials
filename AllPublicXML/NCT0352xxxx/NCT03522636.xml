      Trauma is a leading cause of death among people younger than 44 years. Five million people
      worldwide die from trauma annually. Uncontrolled haemorrhage causing traumatic-haemorrhagic
      shock (THS) is the leading cause of potentially preventable deaths from severe trauma.
      Uncorrected hypervolaemia and prolonged shock cause severe tissue hypoperfusion, vital organ
      ischemia and subsequently acidosis. In up to one third of trauma patients, laboratory
      findings suggest traumatic induced coagulopathy, which is further triggered by loss or
      dilution of coagulation factors. These patients have a significantly increased morbidity and
      mortality compared to patients with similar injury patterns without coagulopathy. Minimizing
      the time to surgical control of haemorrhage is key in order to improve outcome. However,
      immediate and goal directed volume and coagulation resuscitation including use of blood
      transfusion is crucial to enable survival until definitive hospital care. The primary
      objective of this study will be to evaluate feasibility of prehospital administration of 1
      unit of human plasma and 1 unit of red blood cells, and explore association of early
      prehospital transfusion with early outcomes in patients presenting with THS, severe bleeding
      or peri-arrest state who are matching indication criteria and are transported by Helicopter
      Emergency Medical Service. Results of clinical examinations and laboratory variables in a
      group of patients receiving prehospital transfusion will be compared to matched population of
      patients treated before blood has been available on board. Secondary aim of the study is to
      detect any potential logistical and/or organisational adverse effects, incl.
      cost-effectiveness, in a regional trauma system with prehospital times (time of injury to
      trauma centre) ranging from 45 to 75 minutes.

      Background and rationale of the project Trauma is a leading cause of death among people
      younger than 44 years. Five million people worldwide die from trauma annually. Uncontrolled
      haemorrhage causing traumatic-haemorrhagic shock (THS) is the leading cause of potentially
      preventable deaths from severe trauma. Uncorrected hypervolaemia and prolonged shock cause
      severe tissue hypoperfusion, vital organ ischemia and subsequently acidosis. Shock, acidosis
      and hypothermia are recognized drivers of anti-coagulant and fibrinolytic pathways. In up to
      one third of trauma patients, laboratory findings suggest traumatic induced coagulopathy,
      which is further triggered by loss or dilution of coagulation factors. These patients have a
      significantly increased morbidity and mortality compared to patients with similar injury
      patterns without coagulopathy. Minimizing the time to surgical control of haemorrhage is key
      in order to improve outcome. However, immediate and goal directed volume and coagulation
      resuscitation including use of blood product transfusion is crucial to enable survival until
      definitive hospital care.

      Role of HEMS in a trauma system. Helicopter Emergency Medical Services (HEMS) can rapidly
      deliver advanced medical care and speed up patient transport to designated trauma centres. In
      the Czech Republic, HEMS system has been developed since 1987. Today, physician staffed
      helicopters are located at 10 HEMS bases and dispatched to all administrative regions of the
      country. HEMS covers 76.5% of the area and 99.4% of the population of the Czech Republic
      within 20 minutes since the emergency call is received via Emergency Medical Dispatch Centre
      (EMDC). HEMS Hradec Kralove (callsign: Christoph 6) is one of the well-recognized systems in
      the country, which has been developed on principles experienced from the world leaders in
      aeromedical critical care medicine. Annually, medical teams of HEMS Hradec Kralove are
      treating 420 severely injured patients (10-year average 2006-2015), which is 63.5% of all
      HEMS missions. Its catchment area is 1.1 million inhabitants living in the Hradec Kralove and
      Pardubice regions. Trauma patients include 100-120 multiple trauma injuries and 50-60
      isolated traumatic brain injuries (TBI) annually. The role of HEMS for inter-hospital
      secondary transports has diminished, and majority of traumatic patients are treated during
      primary missions. In 2017, there were 95.9% primary flights (to the scene of accident), of
      which 81.9% take-offs were decided by EMDC dispatchers immediately after receiving an
      emergency call. Medical dispatchers are using prehospital trauma triage criteria, incl.
      mechanism of injury as described by bystanders. Introduction of such operating procedures and
      strict HEMS dispatch criteria allowing early HEMS dispatching resulted into reduction of
      prehospital time (time of injury - arrival at trauma centre) from 73 min in 2004 to 64 min in
      2006, and to approx. 60 min in 2015. These effectiveness indicators are better than those
      presented by other European HEMS systems, e.g. Copenhagen: mean prehospital time 219 min
      (59-925 min). The involvement of HEMS teams presents an opportunity to improve care at
      multiple points for life threatened trauma patients. Management of patients in THS requires
      early identification of the bleeding source, use of effective techniques to stop compressible
      haemorrhage, support of clot formation and minimisation of on-going blood loss in
      non-compressible haemorrhage, judicious fluid resuscitation with monitoring of effect, and a
      pre-alert system for damage control resuscitation or surgery at the receiving hospital. HEMS
      teams must be skilled to recognise and treat massive bleeding and acute traumatic
      coagulopathy in the pre-hospital environment.

      Diagnostics of THS. Haemorrhage leads to a fall in systemic filling pressure and venous
      return. The resulting decrease in cardiac minute volume, and therefore in oxygen and nutrient
      supply, sets off an endogenous stress response aiming to maintain perfusion pressure. Thus,
      blood pressure and heart rate must be interpreted with caution, and cardiac output might have
      dropped to some 60% until blood pressure will start to decrease. Although a systolic blood
      pressure &lt;90 mmHg is the typically considered as the leading symptom of hypovolemic shock,
      clinical assessment of trauma patients comprises on-going and repeated evaluation of the
      mental status, capillary filling time, clinical appearance, changes in heart rate, and
      mechanism of injury. Current literature suggests that the combined evaluation of heart rate,
      SABP, Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) and the ability to maintain a patent airway increases the
      predictability for advanced in-hospital interventions up to four times. This is of particular
      importance for an in-hospital blood transfusion request policy. Suitable triggers for
      preparation for massive transfusion are suspicion or evidence of active haemorrhage, incl.
      trauma triage criteria, systolic arterial blood pressure (SABP) &lt; 90 mmHg, failure to respond
      to a fluid bolus, heart rate &gt; 120/min, and penetrating injuries. Accordingly, physical
      examination on scene should focus on injury patterns known to cause haemorrhage such as
      penetrating trauma, pelvic or femoral fractures and blunt abdominal trauma.

      Prehospital treatment of THS. The up-to-date concept of initial trauma care is called damage
      control resuscitation, which comprises hypotensive resuscitation, haemostatic resuscitation
      and damage control surgery. Control of haemorrhage is crucial in order to interrupt the
      vicious circle of blood loss, hypervolaemia, hypoperfusion, acidosis and coagulopathy,
      finally resulting in therapy refractory shock and death. Basic techniques like direct
      compression, pressure dressings, tourniquets, traction devices and pelvic splints are used
      routinely in obvious or suspicious bleeding. The Crash 2 trial provided convincing evidence
      that early administration of tranexamic acid improves outcome in severely injured patients.
      In life threatening haemorrhagic shock, fluid resuscitation is still the main stem therapy.
      The primary and ultimate goal of pre-hospital fluid resuscitation is to prevent hypovolemic
      cardiac arrest and to minimize organ damage caused by prolonged or uncorrected hypotension
      causing organ ischemia. For this reason permissive hypotension should only be applied in the
      first hour after the insult. There are extensive side effects of fluid resuscitation in
      uncontrolled bleeding patients, namely inappropriate rise of blood pressure, dilution of
      coagulation factors and worsening of hypothermia must be considered. Inappropriate or
      over-infusion has been shown to harm and to worsen outcome. Hypotensive resuscitation is a
      temporary strategy for management of patients with uncontrolled blood loss until the source
      of bleeding is controlled. Fluid resuscitation should be spared or postponed in patients with
      uncontrolled haemorrhage, normal mental status and SABP &gt; 90 mmHg. Fluids should be titrated
      in uncontrolled bleeding patients without head trauma to a target SABP around 90 mmHg.
      However, it is noteworthy that the concept of hypotensive resuscitation must be tailored and
      adjusted to the patients need. In patients with severe traumatic brain injury higher SABP
      must be achieved with higher amounts of fluids and very seldom use of vasopressor drugs when
      necessary. There is an on-going debate which fluids and what amounts should be considered
      optimal for haemorrhagic shock management. Colloids did not show to improve outcome when
      compared with crystalloids. The same is true for hyperosmolar solutions. Artificial oxygen
      carriers have been shown to increase mortality due to an inappropriate rise in blood
      pressure. Compared to the United Kingdom, Scandinavia and other highly developed countries,
      there are no prehospital blood products currently available in Central, Southern and Eastern
      Europe, partially because of high logistic and material demands, risk of wasting, high
      expenses, and unproven benefit of prehospital use of red blood cells without plasma.

      Co-operation between HEMS and a trauma centre. The regional trauma system in the Hradec
      Kralove Region has been gradually developed during last couple of years. One of its main
      advantages is excellent long-term co-operation between EMDC, HEMS, and receiving trauma
      centre, incl. quality management. There are different triage tools used to help to outline
      patient routes to trauma centres. These latter can include immediate need for blood or life
      saving surgery. In Hradec Kralove, it was for the first time in the Czech Republic, when a
      new concept of trauma triage was implemented and improved on-scene triage. The triage
      criteria were adopted from the American College of Surgeons (ACS) and include: mechanism of
      injury (e.g. fall from height &gt; 6 m, person trapped in a vehicle), anatomical and
      physiological criteria, and selected special considerations (e.g. age, comorbidities). Its
      specificity is 8-10% and sensitivity 95-97%. The same triage system was later implemented
      into all other prehospital systems, integrated into the nation-wide recommendations of the
      Ministry of Health (Trauma Care in the Czech Republic) and Guidelines of the Czech Society
      for Emergency and Disaster Medicine ČLS JEP. Use of pre-hospital triage can predict risk of
      THS and need for specialized trauma care.

      Prehospital blood transfusion. Haemostatic resuscitation is the very early use of blood
      products as primary resuscitation fluid to prevent exsanguination by trauma-induced
      coagulopathy. The recommended ratio of packed red cells, fresh frozen plasma and platelets is
      1:1:1. In a few locations around the world (e.g. London, Sydney), physician led HEMS teams
      provide advanced medical interventions such as thoracotomy, resuscitative endovascular
      balloon occlusion of aorta (REBOA), and blood product (BP) transfusion which traditionally
      occurred in the highly specialized hospital centres. Administration of BPs in a helicopter
      has been studied in specific cohorts including either longer transport times to definitive
      treatment facility (Australia), high prevalence of penetrating thorax and epigastrium
      injuries (United Kingdom, USA), or war injuries with restricted medical care (e.g.
      Afghanistan). The potential role of packed red blood cells is yet to be identified, although
      many HEMS systems already demonstrated feasibility. Recent systematic review searching
      bibliographic databases to July 2015 did not identify any prospective comparative or
      randomized studies on prehopsital use of BPs. A single study showed improved survival in the
      first 24 hours, but vast majority of studies provided very low quality of evidence. None of
      these studies was performed on a cohort of patients similar to the population treated in our
      setting: blunt injuries and short prehospital times. Transfusion reactions were rare,
      suggesting the short-term safety of prehospital BP administration equal to those occurring at
      emergency departments. Current practice at the HEMS Hradec Kralove is to prealert the
      admitting facility and request blood products from the scene. These are available after
      helicopter arrival at hospital. Although a HEMS physician frequently requests massive
      transfusion protocol, initiation of BP transfusion is delayed. We calculated that
      availability of BPs on board would result in earlier BP transfusion for at least 20-30
      minutes compared to current situation.

      Hypothesis. Given evidence in support of massive transfusion protocol in hospitals, we
      hypothesize that early prehospital BP transfusion will be associated with lower risk of THS
      and coagulopathy on admission to the trauma centre, and during 24 hours after admission. We
      expect lower requirements for BP transfusion during 24 hours after admission, improved
      24-hour mortality, and outcome on discharge from hospital.

      Statistical analysis. Conditional logistic regression and mixed-effects linear regression
      will be used to determine the association of early administration of BP transfusion with
      outcome variables. We suppose that patients receiving BP transfusion will be more severely
      injured with a higher risk of mortality. Because of this, we cannot compare their outcome
      data to those of patients without prehospital BP transfusions, but with a retrospective
      cohort of patients who had received massive transfusion protocol already requested by HEMS
      from the scene during the period of previous 12/24 months before implementation of BP
      transfusion into HEMS. To prevent selection bias, the propensity score model will be
      developed to predict the likelihood of receiving BP transfusion based on several prehospital
      variables to allow appropriate matching of treated and control patients based on this
      probability of receiving BP transfusion. Covariates in the propensity score model will
      include age, SABP, heart rate, crystalloid volume before HEMS arrival (if given by a ground
      ambulance team), crystalloid volume during HEMS transport, type of injury (blunt vs.
      penetrating), prehospital time and distance to hospital. Covariates for 24-hour survival will
      include at least sex, Injury Severity Score (ISS), SABP, heart rate and Glasgow Coma Score
      (GCS) at admission, INR, rotational thromboelastometry (ROTEM) parameters (e.g. clotting
      time, alfa-angle), intensive care unit admission, days of mechanical ventilation, and need
      for surgery. Similar covariates will be used for THS and trauma induced coagulopathy
      indicators. Subgroup analysis will be performed for patients with traumatic cardiac arrest.
