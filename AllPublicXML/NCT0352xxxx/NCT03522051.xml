  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Many deep carious teeth are treated unnecessarily by root canal therapy, while with using
      current techniques and advances in compatible dental materials in addition to better
      understanding of biological response of the dental pulp, many can be treated conservatively
      via vital pulp therapy procedures.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Vital pulp therapy is recommended for teeth diagnosed with reversible pulpitis or partially
      inflamed pulps in which the remaining healthy tissue can be conserved and protected by a
      biologically active material to generate a hard tissue barrier that seals and protects the
      pulp from future microbial insult.

      The aim of this in vivo study is to clinically and radiographically assess the outcome of
      full pulpotomy using a calcium silicate based material (NeoMTA Plus) in permanent teeth with
      carious exposure.

      Ethics approval was obtained from the institutional ethics and research committee, and the
      patients were informed about details of the treatment and the possible complications. An
      informed consent was obtained. 120 patients meeting the inclusion criteria will be selected
      for this study and they will be subsequently followed up clinically and radiographically
      after 3 months, 6 months, 1 year and yearly afterward for 5 years.
