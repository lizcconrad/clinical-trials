  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of our study is to reveal the results of circuit training to be applied to the
      children with Cerebral Palsy (CP) for improving their muscular strength and trunk control and
      also to determine their effects in terms of activity limitations and participation limits.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      According the power analyzes totally 62 children, as 31 per each group, who were diagnosed
      with Spastic type CP and accepting participation for the study will be included in this
      study. For every case, socio demographic data and clinical features will be recorded. In the
      first session their gross motor function, muscular tonus in lower extremities, isometric
      strength of lower extremity muscles, functional muscular strength of the trunk and the lower
      extremities, walking speed and main mobility, functional motor performance will be assessed
      by a physiotherapist. Also satisfaction of children from the exercises, activity and
      participation level and quality of life will be evaluated. Then Covariant Focused
      Randomization Method will be used for having similarity in terms of factors such as; age,
      gender and motor function levels and also for having a balanced and equal case number of
      control and intervention group. The control group participants will continue to their own
      previous physiotherapy approaches (Bobath approach, traditional physiotherapy, etc.).
      &quot;Circuit exercise training&quot; will be given to the intervention group participants during 10
      weeks, 3 times a week and that changes 50-60 minutes. At the end of the 10 weeks, the above
      evaluation parameters will be repeated

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Gross Motor Function will be evaluated</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline GMFS at 10 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>As for the Gross Motor Function evaluation, the Gross Motor Function Scale (GMFS) will be used and only its D and E sections (standing, walking, running, jumping evaluation parts) will be used. By considering the instructions in to be tested parts in the scale, the case is expected to do the motor functions actively. Without the consideration of the quality of the movement, the case will be observed whether s/he started, was able to continue and completed the movement as well as whether s/he needed any support so that points between 0-3 will be given according to the level. The obtained total score determines the interaction severity of gross motor function</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Functional muscular strength of the trunk and the lower extremities will be evaluated.</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline Functional muscular strength at 10 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>In order to determine the functional muscular strength of the body and the lower extremities, the step number will be recorded by taking straight step to the stair test and taking side step to the stair test in 15 seconds.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Isometric strength of bilateral lower extremity muscles and trunk muscles will be evaluated.</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline isometric strength at 10 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>For the evaluation of isometric strength of bilateral lower extremity muscles and body muscles, a hand held dynamometer will be used which is in standard positions and independent from the gravity and the obtained measurement will be recorded by adjusting it to the body weight. The strength obtained by isometric contraction and by equipment resistance applied on key chosen muscles, will be recorded as a numerical value.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Muscular tonus in lower extremities will be evaluated.</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline muscular tonus at 10 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The muscular tonus in lower extremities will be evaluated as bilateral by Modified Ashworth Scale (MAS). The joint will be moved passively, fast and reverse to the muscular functions that will be tested in this scale -which is used for the determination of spasticity severity. According to the resistivity occurred, scoring is done between 0-4 points.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Walking speed and main mobility will be evaluated.</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline walking speed and main mobility at 10 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>For the determination of walking speed and main mobility; timed up and go (TUG) test will be used. 3 meter walking distance will be recorded.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Functional motor performance will be evaluated.</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline functional motor performance at 10 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>For the determination of functional motor performance; sitting and getting up test of Motor Assessment Scale will be used. Without a back and arm support, the chair sitting and getting up number in 1 minute will be recorded.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Satisfaction of children from the exercises will be evaluated.</measure>
    <time_frame>At 10 weeks.</time_frame>
    <description>For the measurement of satisfaction of children from the exercises to be applied, Physical Activity Enjoyment Scale (PACES) will be used. The children will be asked to mark the numbers suitable for themselves after reading child items in the 5 likert point scale. The points taken on the scale, change between 5 and 25.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Activity and participation level will be evaluated.</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline COPM at 10 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Canadian Occupational Performance Test (COPM) will be used in order to evaluate activity and participation level. COPM is an interview based method and the participant is asked to express the daily activities they needed, desired and they are not able to do. They are asked to express these activities under 3 headlines (self care activities, productivity and free time activities) and they are asked to determine these according to the priority for themselves. The first desire/problem is 10 points, and last is 1 point.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Quality of life will be evaluated.</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline LQSC at 10 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>For the evaluation of life quality; Life Quality Scale for Children (LQSC) will be used (PedsQL) (5-7 age SP family reported model,5-7 age SP model, 8-12 age SP model, 13-18 age SP model). 23 questions will be used for the case which consists of 0-4 points and Working/Job Functions, Social, Physical and Emotional Functions in the last one month. The obtained point gives information about the life quality</description>
