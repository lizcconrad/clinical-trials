  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The CIAKI,as the third complication of PCI, was associated with adverse cardiac events after
      procedure. Moreover, because the rate of periprocedure hydration is inadequate in STEMI
      patients before primary PCI, the incidence of CIAKI is higher significantly in these
      patients. The cardiovascular pleiotropic effects of statins in addition to lipid have been
      widely concerned. The previous studies demonstrated usage of statin in periprocedure could
      decrease the risk of CIAKI. Compared with hydration, the usage of statin to prevention CIAKI
      show the advantages in clinical practice, for example，there is no need to consider the
      cardiac function.The optimal strategies for preventting CIAKI in STEMI patients undergoing
      primary PCI needed further studies to explore. What's more, whether a synergistic effect of
      hydration and statin or not is unknown.
