  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Health education is now a major public health issue. In the field of perinatal care, the
      interests involved are the upgrading of the role of mother / father in the health education
      of their child and the disengagement of inappropriate pediatric consultations and emergency
      services in front of mothers who &quot; fail know how to &quot;. A recent review of the literature
      (Cochrane Library) on the effectiveness of parenting programs in the first 2 months of life
      of the newborn shows that parental education programs focusing on the explanation of newborn
      rhythms to young parents increased sleeping time to 6 weeks of life or a significant
      improvement in the prevention of domestic accidents (checking the water temperature and
      reducing the risk of burning, sleeping in the bed and preventing unexpected sudden death of
      the infant, position and respect of instructions during transport by car and prevention of
      road accidents). However, the authors of this meta-analysis concluded that new studies were
      needed to confirm the results already published.

      The main objective of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of an early parental
      education program in maternity both in terms of parental acquisitions and their
      implementation after leaving the service. These parental acquisitions relate, on the one
      hand, to the care to be given to the newborn child and, on the other hand, on the possible
      pathologies that he or she could have, and the best action to be taken by the parents to
      respond to them. The secondary objective is to evaluate the impact of this program on
      maternal anxiety in this special period of transition to the role of a parent.

      It is a prospective, monocentric, comparative, randomized, controlled, open study. The
      comparison will be made between two experimental groups. The first experimental group
      corresponds to the mothers who attended the education program during their maternity stay.
      The second control group corresponds to mothers who did not attend the training. The primary
      endpoint for measuring this effectiveness is maternal knowledge assessment using knowledge
      questionnaires that will be completed by mothers before (pre-test) and after (post-test) the
      educational program in the maternity unit. The secondary endpoints for assessing the primary
      objective of measuring this effectiveness are the maternal knowledge assessment 1 month after
      leaving the maternity, using a questionnaire (Recall-Test) and the assessment of the appeal
      to a medical consultation for the newborn child in the first month of life and the analysis
      of the relevance of this recourse to the care. The criterion of evaluation of the secondary
      objective to measure the impact of the educational program on maternal anxiety will be based
      on questionnaires tested regarding parental anxiety in the perinatal period (STAI-Etat)
      before and after the educational program.

      The investigators believe that this improvement in parental knowledge will have a positive
      impact on maternal anxiety in the first month of life and will lead to an improvement in the
      appropriateness of the use of care during the first month of life. If these results are
      confirmed, this educational program will have a real medico-economic impact (relieving
      emergency departments and improving the prognosis of newborns with severe pathologies and
      taken into care earlier by decreasing in parallel the duration of hospitalization).

      The impact of these results will allow to promote more widely the health education in the
      perinatal and neonatal period by generalizing this educational program in other maternities
      which could be interested. Also, it will allow to propose this educational program in
      prenatal (within the framework of session of preparation for the birth), after the release
      from the service, within the framework of structure of health such as the PMI, the community
      centers and medical structures, even the distribution of these educational program on a
      larger scale by means of media such as dedicated web site or smartphone applications.
