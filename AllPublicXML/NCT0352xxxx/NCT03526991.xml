  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Parkinson Disease (PD) patients experience a variety of motor issues such as walking
      difficulties, loss of balance, and freezing while walking, which impacts their quality of
      life. Some symptoms, like freezing of gait (FOG), do not respond to medications typically
      used to treat PD. Current surgical procedures used to alleviate PD symptoms also do not
      always improve FOG. Since many traditional therapies have failed for the treatment of FOG,
      researchers have proposed the use of newer treatments. Recent research in animal models and
      clinical human data using SCS has produced promising results, specifically showing
      improvement in FOG with the use of SCS in patients with PD.

      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of spinal cord stimulation (SCS)
      for the management of freezing of gait (FOG) that does not respond to conventional treatments
      in subjects with Parkinson's disease (PD). The investigators hypothesize that SCS
      significantly decreases FOG episodes in patients with PD.

      Aim 1: To assess the effectiveness of thoracic SCS for FOG in PD patients.

      Aim 2: To evaluate the effects of SCS in locomotion, appendicular motor manifestations, and
      frequency of adverse events in PD patients.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Freezing of gait (FOG) is a devastating motor phenomenon which may occur in patients with
      Parkinson's Disease (PD) and other neurodegenerative disorders. It is characterized by
      episodes during which patients cannot generate effective forward stepping movements in the
      absence of motor deficits.

      FOG leads to reduced mobility, loss of independence, social embarrassment, and caregiver
      stress. While most motor features of PD respond robustly to dopaminergic agents and deep
      brain stimulation (DBS), there are currently no effective treatments for FOG.

      Indirect evidence from case reports of PD patients undergoing spinal cord stimulation (SCS)
      for neuropathic pain, has consistently described a positive effect of SCS on FOG. In
      addition, two recent reports demonstrated that thoracic SCS improved locomotion and FOG in
      patients with advanced PD. The promising role of SCS for the treatment of FOG in PD has
      encouraged us to assemble a multi-disciplinary team for the systematic investigation of the
      motor effects of SCS on FOG, locomotion and other parkinsonian features.

      The current study integrates minimally invasive SCS and the use of robotic technology to
      determine objective gait parameters. The investigators propose a pilot study for the
      implantation of SCS to the spinal cord on PD patients with treatment-refractory FOG,
      including a longitudinal assessment of motor outcomes.

    <description>The SCS implantation technique consists of inserting epidural leads-containing multiple stimulating electrodes (4-16). Electrodes will be implanted percutaneously into the epidural space.
The implantable pulse generator (IPG) is a neurostimulation system designed to deliver low-intensity electrical impulses. The system is intended to be used with leads and extensions that are compatible with the system. This neurostimulation system is indicated (FDA approved) as an aid in the management of chronic, intractable pain of the trunk and/or limbs.
