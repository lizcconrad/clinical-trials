  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Oral nutritional supplements (ONS) are often prescribed for malnourished patients to help
      improve nutritional status. Commonly in cancer patients taste and smell alterations and side
      effects of treatment can affect the palatability and compliance to ONS. A variety of flavours
      and styles are available of ONS however research of the palatability of these in cancer
      patients is limited. This study aims to evaluate specific flavours created based on the taste
      changes occuring during treatment.

      We aim to evaluate the patient liking and evaluation of 5 flavors in 3 different types of
      flavour-sensations:

        -  Warming/spicy sensation: to trigger the senses and bring new sensations

        -  Cooling/fresh sensation: to have a fresh mouthfeel and lighter base perception

        -  Neutral: to avoid that patients experience additional flavour and let them the
           opportunity to mix it with other food

    <description>Each patient will taste 5 products, in sequential-monadic test, randomized, one by one.
Patients will take few sips of each study product, ideally in isolation (avoid influence of other patients)
For each product tasted the subjects will be asked to answer a questionnaire including 1 question on the palatability of the product using a 10-point hedonic scale and a more detailed organoleptic evaluation of the product.
Between product tastings, participants will have a 10 minutes break to rinse their mouth and fill in a questionnaire assessing sensory changes</description>
