  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to evaluate the technical feasibility of the new tube placement
      technology in healthy volunteers and, if proven feasible, in critically ill patients
      requiring placement of a feeding tube.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Enteral feeding is the preferred route of nutrient delivery in hospitalized patients who
      cannot eat sufficiently. Placement of enteral feeding tubes carries a risk of misplacement
      especially in patients who are unable to fully collaborate during the tube placement due to
      neurological impairment and/or the presence of an artificial airway. The misplacement of a
      feeding tube in the airways has a high risk of severe complications, including pneumonia,
      mechanical damage of airways and the lung, and death. The verification of correct tube
      placement can be done using radiography, or interventions aimed at confirming the location of
      the tube tip by aspiration of gastric contents, and by auscultation during injection of air.

      Approximately 20-25 % of patients treated in intensive care units are likely to need
      placement of a feeding tube, while undergoing mechanical ventilation and having an artificial
      airway. This high risk patient group would benefit from technologies allowing direct
      visualization of tube placement. It is also expected that direct visualization of tube
      placement will allow confirmation of tube placement and therefore eliminate the need of
      radiography (radiation).
