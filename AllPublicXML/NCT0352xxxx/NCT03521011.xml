  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The acute abdomen is one of the most frequent causes for presentation to the emergency
      department. Imaging plays an important role for an accurate diagnosis, which in turn
      diminishes morbidity and mortality Jastaniah and Salih demonstrate optimum CT aspects and
      emphasize on the important features of CT for those patients presenting with an acute
      abdominal pain at the Emergency Department. The reported data by this study are based on the
      author working experience, which forms a continuous protocol adjustment process. The present
      study provides evidence that CT would result in definite diagnosis of patients with abdominal
      pain in terms of the detection of some urgent conditions . The acute abdomen may be defined
      generally as an intra-abdominal process causing severe pain and often requiring medical or
      surgical intervention. The acute abdomen is a frequent entity at the Emergency Department,
      the acute abdomen may be life threatening and so rapid diagnosis of patients presenting with
      acute abdominal pain is required . Diagnostic work-up with imaging can consist of plain
      X-ray, ultrasonography (US), computed tomography (CT) and even diagnostic laparoscopy. During
      the last decade, a trend towards increased use of computed tomography in patients with
      abdominal pain can be seen. In general, acute abdominal pain is responsible for about 10% of
      total number of patients visiting the emergency. Quick and precise diagnosis for the urgent
      cases is usually vital for treatment. Medical imaging is commonly used for the diagnosis of
      most acute abdomen pain. Abdomen and pelvis are reviewed by CT scan. Specifically, in cases
      of acute abdomen complain.

      There is no gold standard for diagnosis of acute abdomen as it still a matter of cooperation
      between clinical data, radiological and laboratory worker. The aim of this study was to
      demonstrate optimum CT aspects and emphasize on the important features of CT for those
      patients presenting with an acute abdominal pain clinically suspected to have emergency
      operation .
