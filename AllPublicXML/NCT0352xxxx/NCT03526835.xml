    <textblock>
      This is a Phase I, open-label, multi-center, multi-national, dose escalation, single agent
      study to determine the recommended Phase II dose (RP2D) of MCLA-158 in metastatic colorectal
      cancer (mCRC). The study will assess the safety, tolerability, PK, PD, immunogenicity, and
      anti-tumor activity of MCLA-158 in mCRC and other advanced solid tumors.

      Study Design:

      This open label, multicenter, first-in-human study consists of 2 parts. Part 1 is a dose
      escalation to find the recommended Phase II dose (RP2D) of MCLA-158 studying patients with
      metastatic colorectal cancer. Part 2 is a dose expansion cohort studying MCLA-158 in
      colorectal cancer and other solid tumor indications.

      In the dose escalation part, patients with metastatic colorectal cancer previously treated
      with up to 4 lines of prior therapy in the metastatic setting including oxaliplatin-based and
      irinotecan-based chemotherapy, with or without an anti-angiogenic and with or without an
      anti-EGFR if RAS wild-type (RASwt).

      In the expansion part, MCLA-158 will be administered at the RP2D in metastatic colorectal
      patients and selected non-colorectal indications in advanced solid tumors. The expansion part
      will further characterize the safety, PK, immunogenicity and preliminary antitumor activity
      of single-agent MCLA-158 will be in all patients, and retrospective biomarker analyses
      including EGFR and LGR5 status will be performed.

      The study consists of three periods: Screening (up to 28 days prior to the first dose of
      study drug); Treatment (first dose of study drug with treatment cycles of 28 days); and
      Follow-up (through 30 days after the last dose and and quarterly checks for survival data up
      to 12 months).
