  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Red cell distribution width variations are increased in a variety of medical conditions such
      as congestive heart failure, acute myocardial infarction, pulmonary embolism, pneumonia,
      critical illness, and cardiac arrest , and is a predictor of mortality in the general
      population..

    <textblock>
      This study was done retrospectively on sepsis patients admitted to intensive care units. data
      will be retrieved from patient medical records. The primay end point will be occurrence of
      new-onset AF during ICU stay. The secondary outcomes will be 28-day mortality.

      The presence of anisocytosis or RDW variations has been classicaly used as a test for iron
      deficiency anemia. Increasing evidence points to its potential as a predictor for various
      conditions such as heart failure , malignancy, ischemic heart disease and sepsis.

      Study investigators will examine the relationship between RDW levels and incidence of atrial
      fibrillation in critically ill sepsis patients as well as 28-day mortality.
