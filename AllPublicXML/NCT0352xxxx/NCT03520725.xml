  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of the present study was to evaluate the impact of a snack bar on some health
      indicators associated with diet (plasma antioxidant capacity, lipid profile, vitamin A
      profile (retinol and carotenoids)) and on the nutritional status (impact on energy and
      nutrients consumed) in a group of upper level students.

      A blind randomized controlled clinical study of healthy adults, which was carried out with
      the approval of the ethics committee of the Centro de Investigación en Alimentación y
      Desarrollo, A.C. (CIAD, A.C.) with registration CE/001/2017. The intervention was carried out
      in a public university in Mexico from January to April 2017. Each subject signed an informed
      consent form. This study lasted 30 days (4 weeks), where each participant consumed daily a
      snack bar irradiated with UV-C. The participants were personally interviewed by the research
      team with a structured selection questionnaire. Thirty subjects who met the inclusion
      criteria were recruited, 15 of them men and 15 women. Through a simple randomization process,
      the participants were assigned in 3 groups of 10 people each with 5 women and 5 men,
      subsequently treatments (without treatment, pineapple snack bar, or mango snack bar) were
      randomly assigned. The outcomes between groups were analyzed with one way ANOVA, with a
      P-value of 0.05 or less when there was statistical significance, using statistical software.
      The participants, and the laboratory technicians were blinded to the treatment assignments
      until the conclusion of the trial.
