    <textblock>
      Introduction: In recent years, since the discovery of the cystic fibrosis (CF) transmembrane
      conductance regulator gene in human skeletal muscle, there appears to be growing interest in
      the measurement of muscle function in CF. One of the most used test in other chronic
      pulmonary diseases is the Sit-to-Stand test (STS) which consists of simply getting up from a
      chair. Although the main result of the STS test is the time developed during the task, the
      velocity and power generated during the task are considered very important variables to
      detect the functional decline. However, from our knowledge, no study has previously analyzed
      the differences in time, velocity and muscle power developed during the STS test in patients
      with CF and their respective healthy controls.

      Objectives: To compare the values gained from handgrip strength, walking speed and STS test
      (time, velocity, and muscle power) in a group of patients with CF and their respective
      healthy controls, and to analyze if these differences (if any) are associated with lung
      function in patients with CF.

      Methods: Cross-sectional study with a sample of 32 participants (16 patients diagnosed with
      CF and 16 healthy subjects) between 18-65 years old. The STS test will be measured through
      slow-motion video recording with a smartphone device (240 images per second) which will
      report the time, velocity and power generated during the test. Walking speed and handgrip
      strength will be also measured. Additionally, the relationship between the variables obtained
      during the test and the lung function of patients with CF will be analized.

    <description>The time to complete the sit-to-stand test will be measured using a smartphone (Sit-to-stand App version 1.1) installed on an iPhone 6 running iOS 11 (Apple Inc., USA).
To execute the test, subjects will sit on a rigid chair with their arms crossed over their chest with the hip, knee and ankle joints at approximately 90 degrees. The subjects will be instructed to stand-up as fast as possible. Participants will complete three STS repetitions to complete the test while standing without footwear.</description>

    <description>The leg power generated by the participants during the sit-to-stand test will be measured using a smartphone (Sit-to-stand App version 1.1) installed on an iPhone 6 running iOS 11 (Apple Inc., USA).
To execute the test, subjects will sit on a rigid chair with their arms crossed over their chest with the hip, knee and ankle joints at approximately 90 degrees.

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Handgrip strength</measure>
    <time_frame>Cross-sectional baseline (non intervention)</time_frame>
    <description>Handgrip testing will be performed in standing position with the arm at the side and the forearm and wrist placed into neutral. Using a digital hand dynamometer, subjects will squeez the device maximally. The test will be repeated two times on both the right and left hand with 30-s of rest between trials of the same hand. The greater of the two trials from the right and left side will be used and added together to give overall handgrip strength.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Walking speed</measure>
    <time_frame>Cross-sectional baseline (non intervention)</time_frame>
    <description>Self-selected walking speed will be determined by having participants walk at a pace they consider 'normal walking speed' over a distance of 8 m on a non-carpeted floor. To account for the time it will take participants to accelerate and decelerate, markers will be provided 2 m before and after the measured distance. Therefore, the total timed distance will be 4 m. The timed walking test will be completed twice to promote familiarity and improve accuracy.</description>
