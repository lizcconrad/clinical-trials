  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Due to an accident, pneumonia or surgery, patients can have severe shortness of breath or
      lung damage to such an extent that it compromises vital functions. At such times, mechanical
      ventilation can be lifesaving. The ventilator temporarily takes over the function of the
      respiratory muscles to ensure adequate uptake of oxygen and removal of carbon dioxide.
      Mechanical ventilation can usually be stopped quickly after the initial disease has been
      treated. Unfortunately, in up to 25-40% of ventilated patients it takes several days to weeks
      before mechanical ventilation can be discontinued, even after treatment of the initial
      disease. This phenomenon is termed weaning failure. Weakness of the respiratory muscles, such
      as the diaphragm, is one of the leading causes of weaning failure.

      Like other skeletal muscles, the diaphragm can become weakened if it is used too little. This
      happens often during mechanical ventilation because of excessive assistance provided by the
      ventilator or use of sedative medication. Excessive activity of the diaphragm can also lead
      to damage and weakness, just like in other muscles that have to perform excessive amounts for
      a prolonged period of time. Additionally, excessive work by the diaphragm might have a direct
      damaging effect on the lungs, which leads to a vicious cycle. As such, it is very important
      to find a balance between resting the diaphragm (which may lead to weakness) and placing
      excessive work on the diaphragm (which can damage the diaphragm and possibly the lungs).

      In this study, the investigators want to test whether insufficient activity and excessive
      activity of the diaphragm during mechanical ventilation can be prevented or reduced. The
      investigators plan to measure the diaphragm activity in 40 participants on mechanical
      ventilation. Participants will be randomly assigned to the intervention group or the control
      group. In the intervention group, ventilator support levels will be adjusted according to the
      observed diaphragm activity, in an attempt to ensure adequate diaphragm activity. The control
      group receives usual care. The hypothesis is that adjusting the level of support provided by
      the ventilator is a feasible method to improve the time that the diaphragm operates within
      acceptable levels of activity over a 24 hour period.
