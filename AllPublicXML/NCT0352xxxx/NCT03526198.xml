  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study developed a controlled soil reaction force platform that provided controlled
      mechanical stimuli to quantify the distribution of the center of mass as a function of the
      angular variation of the ankle in the elderly in the upright position.

      Usually the balance evaluation the center of mass displacement for the analysis of postural
      control is assessed by means of force platforms. However, most of these devices are
      stationary, that is the patient is the dynamic element which can generate an evaluation with
      high subjectivity index. Therefore, this study aimed at developed a reaction force to the
      ground platform which provides mechanical stimuli controlled to quantify the distribution of
      the mass center as a function of the angular variation in the elderly ankle in the upright
      position. The construction of the prototype was divided into 3 steps, based on the
      two-dimensional movement of the ankle joint. In the 1st stage the construction of the
      mechanical assembly; in the 2nd stage development of the electronics; and 3rd stage the
      development of the supervisory system (control system). The force plataform was evaluated
      following the engineering functional tests such as: characterization and calibration of the
      sensors, the definition of the transfer function and accuracy of tests of angular movements
      (+ 10 ° and -10 ° to the movements of inversion and eversion, + 15 and -15º to the movements
      of dorsiflexion and plantar flexion). For the tests with volunteers were selected 30
      volunteers.

    <description>Each volunteer stood on the platform. The duration of the tests was standardized at 10 seconds for each angulation variant of the test. The tilt variables occurred every 5 degrees oscillating in the two-dimensional movement of the ankle joint. The test was discontinued when the volunteer failed to remain balanced at the tested angulation for more than 10 seconds (thus shifting the foot (s) from the initial position or supporting with one and / or both arms at the therapist or at the support bars ) or when it reached maximum angulation</description>

    <description>Device: force plate An equipment model with the approach of providing the evaluated person with the movement that is closest to the biomechanical and functional reality of the ankle and foot joint and which could equalize the possible changes of the center of mass would contribute to the clinical evaluation and would provide a more efficient therapeutic reasoning rehabilitation.</description>
