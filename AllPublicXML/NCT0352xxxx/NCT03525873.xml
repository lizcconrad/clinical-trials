  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase III trial studies how well methylphenidate and physical activity works in reducing
      cancer-related fatigue in participants who are receiving anti-PD1 immunotherapy for melanoma
      that has spread to other places in the body. Central nervous systems stimulants, such as
      methylphenidate, may help to improve cognitive function. Physical activity uses techniques,
      such as aerobic and resistance exercises, which may help to improve quality of life. Giving
      methylphenidate and physical activity may help in reducing cancer-related fatigue in
      participants with metastatic melanoma who receive anti-PD1 immunotherapy.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the effects of methylphenidate plus physical activity (MP) compared to
      placebo plus physical activity (PL) in reducing cancer-related fatigue (CRF) in patients with
      metastatic melanoma scheduled to receive anti-PD1 immunotherapy, as measured by changes in
      Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy-Fatigue (FACIT-F) subscale scores after 2
      weeks of intervention.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To explore the effect of MP on anxiety (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale [HADS]),
      depressed mood (HADS), cancer symptoms (Edmonton Symptom Assessment Scale (ESAS), physical
      activity (mean day time activity as measured by actigraphy), and serum levels of inflammatory
      cytokines (IL-1beta, IL-1 RA, IL-6, TNF-alpha, IL-8, IL-10, and MCP1), before and after
      treatment.

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the frequency and factors associated with CRF as assessed by FACIT-F,
      Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System Fatigue (PROMIS-F), Multidimensional
      Fatigue Symptom Inventory-Short Form (MFSI-SF), actigraphy, Edmonton Symptom Assessment
      System (ESAS), and serum levels of inflammatory cytokines (IL-1beta, IL-1 RA, IL-6,
      TNF-alpha, IL-10, IL-8, MCP-1), before and during 4 initial doses of Immunotherapy.

      II. To explore the effects of MP on percentage (%) of patients with dose reduction and/or
      discontinuation anti-PD1 immunotherapy due to CRF.

      OUTLINE: Participants are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.

      ARM I: Participants receive methylphenidate orally (PO) twice daily (BID) for up to 2 weeks
      in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Participants also complete
      physical activity consisting of walking and resistance exercise over 25-40 minutes once daily
      (QD) 4 days a week. After 2 weeks, participants may continue methylphenidate at the
      discretion of the treating physician for up to 12 weeks in the absence of disease progression
      or unacceptable toxicity.

      ARM II: Participants receive a matched placebo PO BID and complete physical activity as in
      Arm I.
