    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to assess the feasibility of a Creative Artists Program
      intervention with epilepsy and headache patients admitted to Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical
      Center for care by the Department of Neurology.

      Qualifying patients admitted to Epilepsy monitoring or Headache treatment will be approached
      for participation in the study. Patients who consent to the study will be given a chance to
      work with one of three creative artists (visual artist, creative writer, therapeutic
      musician). The artist will be selected according to a pre-determined schedule, and the arts
      intervention may last up to 90 minutes. Subjects will be asked to complete study
      questionnaires before and after the arts intervention.

    <time_frame>Through study completion, approximately 1 year</time_frame>
    <description>The feasibility of the creative intervention will be determined by the completion rates of the initial intervention attempts. If less than 50% of patients complete the intervention it will be deemed unfeasible in the current format.</description>

    <time_frame>Each patient as-needed medication use will be assessed after the arts intervention and until discharge from the hospital (approximately Day 3 - 21).</time_frame>
    <description>As-needed pain medication utilization will be evaluated following the creative arts intervention through subject discharge.</description>
