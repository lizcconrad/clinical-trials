    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1/2, multi-center, open-label study of CPI-1205 + ipilimumab in patients with
      histologically or cytologically confirmed advanced solid tumors. This study is designed to
      determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of CPI-1205 +
      ipilimumab in patients with advanced solid tumors. Patients in Phase 2 will be treated at the
      RP2D of CPI-1205 + ipilimumab.

          -  Diagnosis and Prior Treatment:

          -  Phase 1: Patients with histologically or cytologically confirmed locally advanced
             (unresectable) or metastatic solid tumors and with progressive disease during or after
             treatment with a PD-1 or PD-L1-inhibitor who meet one of the following criteria:

               1. Relapsed following or progressed through standard therapy

               2. Have a disease for which no standard effective therapy exists (i.e., a therapy
                  that demonstrates a significant increase in survival)

               3. Not a candidate for standard effective therapy NOTE: In men with prostate cancer,
                  baseline testosterone levels must also be ≤50ng/dL (≤ 2.0nM) and surgical or
                  ongoing medical castration must be maintained throughout the duration of the
                  study.

             the following and with progressive disease during or after treatment with a PD-1 or
             PD-L1-inhibitor:

               1. Cohort A: unresectable or metastatic melanoma

               2. Cohort B: metastatic NSCLC

             neurologic dysfunction that would confound the evaluation of neurologic and other
             adverse events (AEs).

             via RECIST 1.1 is required for Phase 2 patients

             discontinuation of prior immunotherapy

          -  History of severe hypersensitivity reaction to treatment with another monoclonal
             antibody

             (including drug induced), organizing pneumonia (i.e., bronchiolitis obliterans,
             cryptogenic organizing pneumonia, etc.), or evidence of active pneumonitis on
             screening chest computed tomography (CT) scan; NOTE: history of radiation pneumonitis
             in the radiation field (fibrosis) is permitted.

          -  Active infection with hepatitis B virus (HBV) or hepatitis C virus (HCV)
