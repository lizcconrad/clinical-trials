  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Rational:Pancreatic cancer is a systemic disease at the time of diagnosis, even among
      patients with apparent localized disease. Surgical resection is the only potentially curative
      therapy for pancreatic cancer, but in patients who undergo surgery and postoperative therapy,
      metastatic relapse remains common and no more than 20% of patients achieve 5-year survival.

      Because of this aggressive biologic behavior, an increasing interest is growing about
      preoperative treatments in resectable pancreatic cancer.

      The combination chemotherapeutic regimen with irinotecan + 5-fluorouracil (5-FU)/leucovorin
      (LV) + oxaliplatin (FOLFIRINOX) is an effective choice for first line treatment in patients
      affected by advanced pancreatic cancer, and in this setting it achieved a Disease Control
      Rate of 70.2 % (10). In this regard, FOLFIRINOX is currently explored as preoperative regimen
      in a number of clinical trials in resectable pancreatic cancer.

      A critical challenge in this field remains the introduction in these combination treatments
      of the most novel and effective agents such as nalIRI, in order to obtain a more profound
      tumor shrinkage, to increase the rate of R0 resections, to allow an early treatment of occult
      micrometastatic disease, and eventually, to improve survival in patients with resectable
      pancreatic cancer.

      This study proposal is designed to address this challenge. Preliminary results, collected
      during the Part 1 Dose Escalation of a current clinical trial performed in mPDAC, show that
      dose of nal-IRI: 60 mg/m2, Oxaliplatin: 60 mg/m2, 5-FU/LV: 2400/400 mg/m2 is safe.

      This is a study to determine the proportion of patients affected by resectable pancreatic
      cancer who achieve R0 resection after a perioperative 6-cycle chemotherapy, 3 pre- and 3
      post-surgery, in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      All patients in the program will be identified by a unique identifier number assigned
      sequentially.

      Patients will receive a treatment scheme of nal-IRI, oxaliplatin, Levofolinic Acid and
      5-fluorouracil (5 -FU) on Day 1 and Day 15 of each 28 day cycles.

      C1D1 is a fixed day, C1D15 and Day 1 and Day 15 of all subsequent cycles should be performed
      with a window of ± 2 days.

      Patients achieving stable disease or better will undergo pancreatectomy 4-8 weeks after
      completion of first 3 courses of treatment. Within 4-8 weeks following pancreatectomy,
      patients will receive an additional 3 cycles of nal-IRI, oxaliplatin, Levofolinic Acid and
      5-fluorouracil (5 -FU) treatment in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity.

      Tumor responses will be assessed after 3 cycles of preoperative treatment and after 3 cycles
      of postoperative treatment or sooner if the treating physician suspects disease progression
      based on clinical signs and symptoms. All treatment decisions will be based on the local
      radiologist and/or treating physician assessment of disease status.
