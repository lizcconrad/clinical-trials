      clinical pharmacists in collaboration with multidisciplinary team.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The Hadassah Hebrew University Medical Centers' Clinical Pharmacy team initiated a
      hospital-wide program, in collaboration with the institutions' coagulation specialists,
      including two hematologists and a clinical pharmacologist, for monitoring and promoting safe
      and effective prescription of direct oral anticoagulants (DOAC) during hospitalization.
      Electronic medical records throughout the hospital are screened for DOAC orders. All DOAC
      orders are assessed by a clinical pharmacist for potentially-inappropriate prescribing. When
      potentially-inappropriate prescribing or a drug-related problem is identified, the clinical
      pharmacist provided consultation on management options. In specific cases, additional
      guidance is provided by coagulation specialists. Consultations are recorded in the electronic
      medical record. Performance measures are collected and summarized.
