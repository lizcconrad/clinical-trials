      The aim of the study will be to evaluate the quality of the GFR estimate of the two
      estimation equations (CKD-EPI and Cockcroft's formula) against the measured clearance of
      creatinine, which can be performed routinely in intensive care.

      To determine the proportion of patients with ARC under ECMO VV or VA and determine changes in
      renal vascular resistance index as a function of GFR level in patients with pulsatile cardiac
      output.

      Extracorporeal assistance is recommended for patients with a potentially reversible acute
      risk of life that does not respond to conventional treatments. Hypoxic refractory syndromes,
      such as acute respiratory distress syndrome, are referred to as veno-venous ECMO (for
      Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation) (ECMO VV), whereas terminal cardiac dysfunctions require
      veno-arterial ECMO (VA ECMO). recovery of function (cardiotropic intoxication), or in the
      most severe cases, pending transplantation or long-term assistance.

      This is a qualified pilot study, as it is the first one interested in evaluating the quality
      of the GFR estimate of the two estimation equations (CKD-EPI and Cockcroft formula) by
      relative to the measured clearance of creatinine, a method that can be performed routinely in
      intensive care, for resuscitation patients under veno-arterial or veno-venous ECMO.

    <description>In intensive care, some patients also have an often unrecognized increase in creatinine clearance. This entity named &quot;augmented renal clearance&quot; or ARC is defined by creatinine clearance&gt; 150 mL / min / 1.73 m² for a woman and&gt; 160 mL / min / 1.73 m² for a man. It is causing a decrease in the plasma concentration of certain drugs, especially antibiotics, which can lead to a therapeutic failure.
A poor evaluation of the renal function in the intensive care unit can lead to overdoses or to underdosages of the drugs, by phenomena of hypofiltration or on the contrary of renal hyperfiltration.</description>
