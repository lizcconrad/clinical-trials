      Primary Objective:

      To determine the effect of GZ/SAR402671 on the rate of total kidney volume (TKV) growth and
      eGFR in patients at risk of rapidly progressive Autosomal Dominant Polycystic Kidney Disease
      (ADPKD).

      Secondary Objectives:

        -  To determine the effect of GZ/SAR402671 on the rate of renal function decline (Stage 1)
           and on the rate of TKV growth (Stage 2).

        -  To evaluate the pharmacokinetics (PK) of GZ/SAR402671 in ADPKD patients (Stages 1 and
           2).

        -  Safety/tolerability objectives:

             -  To characterize the safety profile of GZ/SAR402671 (Stages 1 and 2).

             -  To evaluate the effect of GZ/SAR402671 on mood using Beck Depression Inventory II
                (BDI-II) (Stages 1 and 2).

             -  To evaluate the effect of GZ/SAR402671 on the lens by ophthalmological examination
                (Stages 1 and 2).

             -  To evaluate change in nocturia based on patient reported diary (Stages 1 and 2).

             -  To evaluate the effect of GZ/SAR402671 on kidney concentrating ability by assessing
                urine osmolality (in patients not on diuretic) (Stage 2 only).

          -  Liver enzymes (alanine aminotransferase [ALT]/aspartate aminotransferase [AST]) or
