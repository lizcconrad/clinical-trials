  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Subjects will place a surface electrode on their perineal area after a bladder-filling
      protocol. Transabdominal ultrasound will image the base of the bladder at rest, voluntary
      pelvic floor contraction, with the surface electrical stimulation and with a combined pelvic
      floor contraction and electrical stimulation active.
