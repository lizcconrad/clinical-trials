    <textblock>
      Patients with overactive bladder (OAB) will be randomly assigned (like a flip of a coin) to
      receive 100 units of onabotulinumtoxinA injected into the bladder at either 3 sites or 10
      sites. Patient satisfaction and the effectiveness of the medication will be evaluated.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Overactive bladder (OAB) is a common condition which often has a negative impact on health
      related quality of life. Primary and secondary treatments include behavior modification,
      pelvic floor physical therapy, and OAB medications. OnabotulinumtoxinA (BTX) is a
      well-established third line therapy for refractory OAB.

      BTX has transitioned over the years from a procedure conducted in the operating room to one
      that is commonly done in the clinic or physician office. While ten injection sites is
      commonly practiced, there has been continuing interest in reducing the number of injection
      sites to make the technique more tolerable and more efficient.

      In this study, refractory OAB patients will be randomized to receive 100 units of BTX over 3
      or 10 injection sites. We hypothesize that decreasing the number of injection sites may
      improve patient tolerability and satisfaction with this office-based procedure and
      potentially reduce the rates of adverse events including hematuria and urinary tract
      infection.
