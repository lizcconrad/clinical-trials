  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Although expert consensuses recommend the use of statins in the treatment of atherosclerotic
      renal artery stenosis, in patients with severe atherosclerotic renal artery stenosis
      undergoing stent placement, the related investigation focused on renal protection by
      intensive lipid-lowering therapy is scant , and the optimal target level for lipid reduction
      remain uncertain. Therefore, we hypothesized that intensive lipid lowering could offer more
      benefits with respect to renal function in the patients with percutaneous renal artery
      stenting. We conducted the prospective randomized unblinded trial to compare the
      renal-protective effect of intensive lipid lowering with that of conventional lipid lowering
      in patients underwent renal artery stenting (75 patients in each study group)
