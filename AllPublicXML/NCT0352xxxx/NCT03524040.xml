    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study was to investigate if reflectance confocal microscopy (RCM) and
      optical coherence tomography (OCT) could be used in combination to investigate the morphology
      of pilosebaceous units and acne lesions in healthy subjects and in acne patients.Furthermore,
      to investigate contrast effects, biodistribution and selective photothermolysis provided by
      gold microparticles and diode laser pulses, using RCM, OCT and histology.
