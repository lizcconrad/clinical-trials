      The individual adapted sport modalities concentrate most of the technological development for
      equipment and auxiliary devices, the collective modalities need implements that support, in
      the development of training and the game. It was developed equipment to assist in the
      training of technical fundamentals and to improve the efficiency of the motor gesture
      required for the practice of sitting volleyball in athletes with physical disabilities. Ten
      athletes, sitting volleyball players, were selected to perform a set of technical
      fundamentals and their variations. Lift the ball (with two variations), attack and serve, and
      reception. After the analysis of the movements the equipment was elaborated and constructed
      based on the measurements made with the athletes, such as contact height with the ball,
      perimeter, speed and parabola.

    <description>Were selected high performance athletes with various kinds of disabilities found in sitting volleyball functional classification. Three equipment was built to aid high-performance athletes. All the volunteers tested the survey training equipment, attack and serve training equipment and pass training equipment The motor sign captured footage of each athlete, lasted 30 minutes and the data collected provided the data for the construction of the equipment, later there was the interaction of the athletes with the equipment ready to test effectiveness.</description>
