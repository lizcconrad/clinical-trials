  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the role of propranolol as an alternative treatment
      for cavernous malformation in patients that may not be ideal candidates for surgery.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients between the ages of 1 and 80 years of age, that have been diagnosed with a spinal or
      cerebral cavernous malformation(s) that can not be surgically treated, will be enrolled in
      this randomized study. All eligible patients will be enrolled in one of two groups. Group 1
      will receive oral propranolol tablets 3 times a day for 36 months. Group 2 will receive oral
      placebo tablets 3 times per day for 36 months. Prior to beginning treatment, all imaging,
      including MRIs, will be evaluated. During the first visit a blood sample will be collected
      for genomic analysis. Patients will return to clinic every 6 months. Each time the patient
      returns to clinic monitoring of how the patient is feeling and evaluation of how the patient
      is tolerating the propranolol will take place. At the end of the three years, evaluators will
      determine if the propranolol was able to stop the growth of the cavernous malformation and
      change the imaging features of the lesion on MRI. Once the study is completed patients will
      no longer receive the study drug.

    <description>Using MRI imaging the size of the cavernous malformation will be measured. The primary outcome is the number of symptomatic and silent hemorrhages as assessed by review of a fine-cut, axial T2-weighted MRI obtained at each visit.</description>
