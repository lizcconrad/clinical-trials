      The primary focus of this randomized clinical trial is to assess the usefulness of urinalysis
      prior to in-office urology procedures.

      OVERVIEW:

      Current urology practice requires every patient to have a urinalysis lab done prior to any
      in-office procedures. If the patient's urinalysis is positive, they are then required to have
      a urine culture done, which takes 1-3 days to show results, and they may also be prescribed
      antibiotics. This practice may cause diagnostic delays, unnecessary cancellations of
      procedures, and the overuse of antibiotics. The aim of this study is to assess the usefulness
      of urinalysis labs and urine cultures in patients prior to in-office cystoscopies,
      intravesical BCG treatments, and prostate biopsies. We predict there is no difference in the
      number of cases of urinary tract infections in patients that undergo in-office procedures
      with or without a prior urinalysis. We purpose a change in protocol could allow for improved
      clinical efficiency, antibiotic stewardship, and be economically advantageous.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients will be randomly assigned to either have a urinalysis or urine culture performed
      before their in-office procedure. They will have follow up questionnaires seven days and
      thirty days after their procedure.

    <description>The control group will have a urine sample taken for a urinalysis prior to their procedure. The results of the urinalysis will be reported to the doctor performing the procedure, who may run a urine culture on the urine sample depending on the results of the analysis. This may require patients to take antibiotics and/or delay their procedure until the results of the urine culture are available.</description>

    <description>The experimental group will have a urine sample taken for a urine culture. The results of the urine culture will not be available to the doctor before the patient's procedure. If the urine culture results are positive for infection, a member of the study team will call the patient to arrange for treatment.</description>
