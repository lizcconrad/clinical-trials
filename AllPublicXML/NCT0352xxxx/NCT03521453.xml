  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pre-anesthesia visit for scheduled surgery is mandatory by law in France. During this visit,
      patients should be informed of the different available technics of anesthesia (i.e. general
      or loco-regional) and of their own risks .

      Nowadays, many informations are given through written paper and leaflets, just before the
      consultation. In addition, patients need usually to wait for the doctor. This time may be
      used to give information, and new information's support, such as videos, may be used.

      The aim of this study is to evaluated if a robot (PEPPER), who is able to answer to patients
      and to give informations, may increase the satisfaction of patients having a pre anesthesia
      visit for a scheduled surgery.

      Before- after observational study.

      All adult patients (ageâ‰¥18 yrs) coming for a pre-anesthesia visit will be proposed to fulfill
      a questionnaire regarding their satisfaction and the quality of information they received.

        -  in the first period, patients will receive paper informations before the anesthesia
           visit.

        -  in the second period, they will have the same paper informations but a robot PEPPER will
           also stand in the waiting room and propose to the patients to give them informations
           about anesthesia, patients journey, risks, blood transfusion etc...
