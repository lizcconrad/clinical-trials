    <textblock>
      This trial studies how well web-based mindfulness meditation works in reducing distress in
      both participants with gastrointestinal cancer that has spread to other parts of the body,
      and their caregivers. Web-based mindfulness meditation, which uses audio exercises and
      interactive webinars taught by trained meditation instructors, may help participants with GI
      cancer and their caregivers reduce distress and improve their quality of life.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the feasibility and acceptability of an 8-week web-based mindfulness
      meditation program with live webinars among patients with a metastatic gastrointestinal (GI)
      cancer receiving chemotherapy and their caregivers.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Estimate the efficacy of an 8-week web-based mindfulness meditation program with live
      webinars among patients with a metastatic GI cancer receiving chemotherapy and their
      caregivers.

      OUTLINE:

      Participants practice with web-based mindfulness meditation over 10-15 minute guided audio
      sessions for 5 days a week for 8 weeks. Participants also attend meditation webinars over 60
      minutes once a week, for 8 weeks.

      After completion of study, participants are followed up at 8 weeks.
