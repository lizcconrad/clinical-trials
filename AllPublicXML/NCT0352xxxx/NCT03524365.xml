  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Bariatric-metabolic surgery is effective in treating the cluster of conditions forming the
      metabolic syndrome, strictly associated with NAFLD and NASH. Recently, we and other authors
      have shown also in the long term (up 5 years) with randomized-controlled trials (RCTs) that
      bariatric-metabolic surgery allows remission of type 2 diabetes and obesity reduction, which
      are the two major pathogenetic factors of NASH development, with maintenance of weight loss.

      Few small and mainly retrospective studies have shown that bariatric surgery is effective in
      improving NASH histologic picture in obese subjects.

      The aim of our proposal is to conduct a 3 arm single centre, superiority, RCT comparing
      Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass (RYGB) with Sleeve Gastrectomy (SG) and with Intensive Lifestyle
      Modifications (ILM) for the treatment of Non-Alcoholic Steato-Hepatitis.

      This is a Randomized Controlled multicentre Trial involving the Catholic University
      (Professor Geltrude Mingrone as PI and Professor Marco Raffaelli as co-PI) Research question
      in PICOT format (P) - Population: Adults 25 to 65 years of age and BMI ≥ 30 and ≤40 kg/m2
      with histological diagnosis of NASH.

      (I) - Intervention: Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass or Sleeve Gastrectomy, both plus lifestyle
      counselling.

      (C) - Comparison: Intensive Lifestyle Modifications. (O) - Outcome: histological resolution
      of NASH without worsening of fibrosis at 1 year after the interventions.

      (T) - Time: One year after intervention started. 1.3.3.2 Research Goals

        -  The primary aim of our study is to assess the effects of bariatric-metabolic surgery or
           ILM on NASH at 1 year after the interventions.

        -  Secondary aims are to assess the safety of bariatric surgery and the improvement of
           liver fibrosis, CVD, insulin sensitivity, T2DM, lipoprotein profile, NASH markers and
           fecal microbiota at 1 year and the follow up of NASH markers up to 2 years, and to
           obtain a non-invasive score systems to make diagnosis of NASH.

      Research outcomes

        -  The primary outcome is the histological resolution of NASH without worsening of fibrosis
           at 1 year after the interventions.

        -  The secondary outcomes are :

             1. Adverse health events including the need for re-operation

             2. Changes in liver fibrosis

             3. Changes in glycemic control (only in diabetic patients)

             4. Changes in cardiovascular risk score

             5. Changes in insulin sensitivity and secretion

             6. Changes in food intake

             7. Changes in physical activity

             8. Changes in quality of life

             9. Changes in gut microbiota

            10. Changes in body composition: Fat-Free Mass (FFM), Fat Mass (FM). The changes in
                NASH liver markers will be investigated at 1, and 2 years follow-up.

    <intervention_name>RYGB</intervention_name>
    <description>Roux-&amp;-Y Gastric Bypass (RYGB) involves the use of a surgical stapler to create a small and vertically oriented gastric pouch with a volume of 30 ml. The upper pouch is completely divided by the gastric remnant and is anastomosed to the jejunum, 75 cm distally to the Treitz's ligament , through a narrow gastrojejunal anastomosis in a Roux-en-Y fashion. Bowel continuity is restored by an entero-entero anastomosis, between the excluded biliary limb and the alimentary limb, performed at 100 cm from the gastrojejunostomy. Lifestyle modification counselling is provided to each patient.</description>

  </intervention>
  <intervention>
    <intervention_type>Procedure</intervention_type>
    <intervention_name>SG</intervention_name>
    <description>The SG is created using a linear stapler with two sequential 4.8/60-mm green load firings for the antrum, followed by two or three sequential 3.5/60-mm blue loads for the remaining gastric corpus and fundus. The stapler is applied alongside a 48-Fr calibrating bougie. The resection line is performed avoiding the ''critical area'' by resecting the fundus 1.5 cm from the angle of His. Staple lines are buttressed with bovine pericardial strips. The resected stomach is grasped at the antral tip by a laparoscopic grasper and retrieved through one of the trocar sites. A methylene blue dye test by a nasogastric tube is routinely performed at the end of the procedure. The residual gastric remnant capacity is 60-80 ml. Drains are not routinely placed, and the nasogastric tube is removed at the end of the procedure. Upper gastrointestinal contrast (Gastrografin) study is performed on the first postoperative day. Lifestyle modification counselling is provided to each patient.</description>

    <description>Resting calorie requirements will be calculated via the Harris Benedict equation (24) and an activity factor, and subjects will be instructed not to change their activity level other than that suggested by physicians during the study. The diet will contain 1/3 kcal less than the calculated energy expenditure and 30% fat of which 10% saturated, 55% lower glycemic index carbohydrates and 15% proteins.
The participants will be encouraged to gradually increase their walking to achieve 10,000 steps per day. A moderate intensity physical activity program of 1 hour of aerobic exercise 2-3 hours per week will be recommended to all subjects. Their physical activity will be assessed by IPAQ-SF as reported below.</description>
