    <textblock>
      This pilot trial studies how well systems support mapping works in guiding self-management in
      stage I-III colorectal cancer survivors. Systems support mapping helps participants to see
      complex self-management activities on paper, which makes them more actionable. Behavioral
      interventions, such as systems support mapping, may help colorectal cancer survivors
      facilitate self-awareness, create motivation for behavior change, and guide self-management.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the feasibility of the systems support mapping (MAP) intervention in
      colorectal cancer survivors, as characterized by enrollment, intervention adherence, and
      retention rates.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate intervention acceptability as characterized by participant ratings.

      II. To describe outcome variability to inform future studies. III. To identify multi-level
      contextual factors influencing self-management (SM).

      IV. To qualitatively assess feasibility, acceptability using semi-structured interviews.

      V. To examine how study results vary by rural-urban context.

      OUTLINE:

      Participants complete MAP in-clinic over 60-90 minutes.

      After completion of study, participants are followed-up for up to 2 weeks.
