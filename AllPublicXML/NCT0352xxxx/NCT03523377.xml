      The purpose of this study is to test whether regular not eating for at least 12 hours
      (&quot;overnight fasting&quot;) can improve blood sugar and the health of the GI tract.

      There are 2 parts to this study: Part 1 will last for 1-2 weeks and will determine whether
      the patient can participate in Part 2. If they complete Part 1 they are eligible to
      participate in Part 2, they will sign a separate consent form for Part 2. Part 2 of this
      study will last 6 months.

    <description>The purpose of the intervention is to increase the nightly fasting duration to a minimum of 12 hours. Adherence to the intervention will be measured by the proportion of SMS text message-days reflecting 12 or more hours of fasting. The intervention protocol follows an approach using strategies outlined by social cognitive theory that focus on (a) goal setting and (b) building self-efficacy.</description>

    <description>Adherence to fasting will be estimated by proportion of the 49 nights (7 weeks) with ≥12 hours of fasting as per text message data from the participant. If the participant neglects to text the fasting duration, that night will be considered not adherent (a conservative adherence estimate).</description>
