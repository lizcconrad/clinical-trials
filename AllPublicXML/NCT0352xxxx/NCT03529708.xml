  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Spinal cord compression (SCC) is a devastating complication of advanced malignancy, and can
      cause significant deterioration in function and quality of life (QoL). The goal of treatment
      is to improve functional status and symptoms, but the optimal treatment regimen for these
      patients has not been thoroughly established. Many patients with SCC present with
      uncontrolled systemic disease and poor performance status, and are not eligible for standard
      surgical resection. They are generally treated with 3D conformal palliative RT (3DCRT) alone,
      however recent trials suggest that less than 70% of patients are ambulatory, that the
      re-establishment of ambulation in non-ambulatory patients is poor, and the duration of
      improvement is guarded with radiotherapy alone.

      Recently, stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) used alone or after previous radiotherapy to
      treat spinal metastasis has demonstrated superior results in pain control, tumour response
      and durability. SBRT requires time for careful planning, and many patients with neurologic
      symptoms must be treated immediately to prevent progression. Therefore the role of SBRT is
      still unclear in this patient population, although it seems to be a potential alternative to
      surgical decompression in patient not suitable for surgery. The investigators propose a
      feasibility study to investigate the potential benefits of dose escalation with a sequential
      SBRT boost to urgent 3D CRT in the setting of SCC. This regimen will allow inoperable
      patients to receive urgent 3DCRT while simultaneously creating the opportunity for superior
      outcomes with SBRT. The investigators also aim to characterize the effect on motor function
      and ambulation, pain and QoL. This study could stimulate further multi-center randomized
      trials in this area, improve motor function and patient-reported QoL, and contribute to
      improving oncology care in Canada in a meaningful way.
