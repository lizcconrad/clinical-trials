    <textblock>
      The PERFORM-TAVR trial (Protein and Exercise to Reverse Frailty in OldeR Men and women
      undergoing Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement) is a multicenter randomized clinical trial
      with a parallel-group design. The investigators will screen consecutive patients ≥70 years of
      age before TAVR and enroll those that have evidence of physical frailty defined as an SPPB
      score ≤8. The investigators will randomly allocate 220 patients to receive a multi-faceted
      intervention consisting of a home-based exercise program and a protein-rich oral nutritional
      supplement or usual lifestyle counselling. The primary endpoint is the change in SPPB score
      3-months post-procedure.

      The PERFORM-TAVR trial (Protein and Exercise to Reverse Frailty in OldeR Men and women
      undergoing Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement) is a multicenter randomized clinical trial
      with a parallel-group design. The investigators will screen consecutive patients ≥70 years of
      age before TAVR and enroll those that have evidence of physical frailty defined as an SPPB
      score ≤8. The SPPB was chosen as the main inclusion criterion and also as the primary
      endpoint based on its ease-of-use, reproducibility, responsiveness to change, and superior
      predictive value for mortality and patient-centered outcomes in the Frailty-AVR Study. The
      investigators will randomly allocate 220 patients to receive a multi-faceted intervention
      consisting of a home-based exercise program and a protein-rich oral nutritional supplement or
      usual lifestyle counselling. The multi-faceted intervention consists of two synergistic
      components performed by patients at their homes.

      The first component is a home-based supervised exercise program that combines walking and
      weight-bearing exercises to build strength and balance performed for 12 weeks after the
      patient is discharged home post-TAVR. The exercises are based on the WEBB program that was
      developed at the University of Sydney and validated to help therapists individually prescribe
      progressive exercise that is challenging but safe for older adults. Starting as soon as the
      patient returns home post-TAVR, a trained therapist (TT; physiotherapist or certified
      exercise physiologist) will visit their home for 1 hour twice weekly over a 12-week period to
      supervise and tailor the exercises according to each individual's capability and progress,
      and to reinforce the goal of moderate-intensity aerobic activity such as brisk walking at
      least 30 minutes 5 days per week. To monitor compliance, the TT will ask patients to log
      their daily exercises and wear a wrist-worn accelerometer to record daily step counts. The
      accelerometer provides motivational cues such as individualized daily step count goals and
      gentle vibrations to remind patients to mobilize when they have been sedentary for a
      prolonged period during the day.

      The second component is a protein-rich oral nutritional supplement with 20 g protein and 1.5
      g HMB per serving, delivered as a ready-to-drink beverage in 235 mL bottles, consumed twice
      daily for 4 weeks pre-TAVR and 12 weeks after the patient is discharged home post-TAVR. This
      beverage contains 350 calories, and is provided in chocolate and vanilla flavors. It will be
      consumed with breakfast (first serving of the day) and with exercise (second serving of the
      day), not before meals, so as to supplement rather than replace food intake. The HMB
      ingredient stimulates muscle protein synthesis, particularly when combined with exercise due
      to the muscle priming effect. Therefore, the TT will ask the patient to drink the beverage
      during/after the exercise session. The TT will also replenish the patient's supply of
      beverages during home-visits and perform bottle-counts to verify compliance.

      Lifestyle counselling consists of formalized usual care - instructing patients to perform
      moderate-intensity aerobic activity at least 30 minutes 5 days per week as tolerated and eat
      a balanced diet based on the 2013 AHA/ACC Guideline on Lifestyle Management. In order to
      standardize this counselling and ensure that it is safely carried out in both the control and
      intervention groups, the TT will provide and explain the &quot;Easy Tips for Heart Healthy Eating&quot;
      and &quot;Walking for a Healthy Heart&quot; brochures designed by the American Heart Association. The
      latter brochure outlines practical tips to safely begin a walking program and gradually
      increase walking time over a 12-week period to meet the goal of 150 minutes per week. The
      brochures are available in English and French. The investigators will ask control group
      patients to refrain from consuming protein supplements during the trial unless prescribed by
      their treating physician.

      The primary endpoint is physical frailty measured by the SPPB score at 3 months. Secondary
      endpoints are health-related QOL measured by the 36-Item Short Form Health Survey (SF-36),
      disability measured by the Older Americans Resources and Services ADL/IADL scale, cognitive
      function measured by the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) test, handgrip strength
      measured by a Jamar dynamometer, body composition and phase angle measured by a portable
      bioimpedance device, vital status and a composite safety endpoint of all-cause mortality,
      injurious fall, acute kidney injury, or readmission for worsening angina, heart failure, or
      arrhythmia at 3 months. Habitual physical activity will be measured using a modified version
      of the Paffenbarger scale and accelerometer step counts. Body weight will be measured using a
      scale. The primary and secondary endpoints will be re-assessed at 6 months to detect latent
      effects and sustained adherence, and vital status and questionnaires will be assessed by
      telephone at 12 months.
