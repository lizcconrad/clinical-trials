    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the safety and efficacy of Afinitor® in Chinese
      patients with renal angiomyolipoma associated with tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC). The
      study will evaluate the safety and anti-tumor activity of Afinitor® given at a dose of 10 mg
      per day.

    <description>At screening via MRI/CT up to five measurable lesions (≥1 cm in longest diameter) in each kidney will be defined as target angiomyolipoma. The volume of these lesions will be measured at each assessment during the trial. For non-target angiomyolipoma, the volume of each kidney will be measured. Increases in the volume will be evidence of worsening angiomyolipoma.
Angiomyolipoma response will be defined as: a reduction in angiomyolipoma volume of at least 50% relative to screening, no new angiomyolipoma ≥ 1.0 cm in longest diameter are identified, neither kidney increases in volume by more than 20% from nadir, the patient does not have any angiomyolipoma-related bleeding of grade ≥2</description>

    <description>At screening via MRI/CT up to five measurable lesions (≥1 cm in longest diameter) in each kidney will be defined as target angiomyolipoma. The volume of these lesions will be measured at each assessment during the trial. For non-target angiomyolipoma, the volume of each kidney will be measured. Increases in the volume will be evidence of disease progression.
Angiomyolipoma progression will be defined as one or more of the following: an increase from nadir of 25% or more in angiomyolipoma volume to a value greater than screening, the appearance of a new angiomyolipoma ≥ 1.0 cm in longest diameter, an increase from nadir of 20% or more in the volume of either kidney to a value greater than screening, angiomyolipoma-related bleeding grade ≥2</description>
