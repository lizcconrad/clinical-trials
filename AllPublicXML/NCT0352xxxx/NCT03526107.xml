    <textblock>
      Dietary intervention study in healthy young adult males to evaluate concentration of flavanol
      metabolites in plasma and urine after single acute intakes of methylxanthines.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Flavonoids, including the sub groups of Flavanols (F) are plant-derived compounds commonly
      present in the human diet. Examples of F-containing foods and beverages are apples,
      chocolate, tea, wine, berries, pomegranate and nuts. The consumption of F-containing foods
      and beverages has been associated with improvements in cardiovascular health. In this
      context, there exists a great interest in describing the absorption, metabolism and excretion
      of F in humans, as it is thought that F-derived metabolites present in circulation are the
      mediators of F-beneficial effects in humans. Recently, the investigators described a series
      of F-derived metabolites in circulation that are present after the consumption of a single
      acute intake amount of F in humans as well as F-metabolites derived from the metabolic
      activity of the gut microbiome. A key question, however, is if the metabolites the
      investigators observed after a single acute feeding are the same as those that occur in
      individuals who consume F-rich diets on a regular basis. Studies investigating the metabolism
      of numerous other xenobiotics have shown that the profile of metabolites can greatly vary
      over time, as well as with the amount of the xenobiotic ingested. In this context, the
      investigators submit it is important to assess whether or not there are food matrix-dependent
      effects on the levels and profile of F-derived metabolites in humans. The investigators
      suggest the information that will be obtained from the outlined work will be particularly
      timely given ongoing discussion concerning the possible generation of dietary recommendations
      for F-rich foods and increasing interest in the putative health effects of F intake in
      humans.
