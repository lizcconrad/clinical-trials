  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, observer-blinded Phase 2 study in healthy infants and toddlers 6-23
      months of age at the time of the first vaccine dose.

      The purpose of this study is to assess the safety and immunogenicity of the Vi-DT vaccine in
      age group 6-23months of age.

      The Vi-DT vaccine is administered at 25 µg either as a single dose, or two doses given 6
      months apart.

      This study is carried out in healthy children aged 6 to 23 months at a single site. A total
      of 285 participants are enrolled, 114, 114 and 57 participants are randomized to either the
      single dose, two-dose Vi-DT regimens or placebo/comparator group, respectively within age
      strata. Three age strata is 6 to less than 9 months, 9 to 12 months and 13 to 23 months. The
      investigators allow the 9-12 months old children to receive Measles-Mumps-Rubella (MMR)
      vaccine concomitantly with Vi-DT vaccine and descriptive analysis of immune response to MMR
      only and to MMR and Vi-DT vaccines are performed to assess the possible immunological
      interference with MMR vaccine.

    <time_frame>Solicited AE: during 7 days after each vaccination. Unsolicited AE: after the first vaccination until 4 weeks after the second vaccination. SAE will be captured after the first vaccination up to week 100 for Group A, week 96 for Group B, week 36 Group C</time_frame>
    <description>Frequency (percentage) of solicited local reactions at the injection site: Pain, tenderness, erythema/redness, swelling/induration and pruritus local
Frequency (percentage) of solicited systemic reactions: Fever, lethargy, irritability, vomiting, diarrhea, drowsiness, loss of appetite, persistent crying, rash and nasopharyngitis
Frequency (percentage) of unsolicited adverse events

    <time_frame>At week 28, 4 weeks after the second vaccination</time_frame>
    <description>Seroconversion rate of anti-Vi IgG by Geometric Mean Titers (GMT) will be measured 4 weeks after the second vaccination using an in-house ELISA assay using standardized reagents and reference serum. The level of the specific anti-Vi IgG in ELISA units for each serum sample is determined by comparison to a reference serum. The number of anti-Vi IgG positive sera will be used to calculate the seroconversion rates.</description>

  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Exploratory Endpoints</measure>
    <time_frame>At week 4, 4 week after MMR vaccination</time_frame>
    <description>Seroconversion rates of Measles, Mumps and Rubella will be determined 4 week after MMR vaccination. Serum titers will be measured by routinely used commercially available ELISA kits. Kit-specific threshold of positivity will be used to determine specific seroconversion rates.</description>
  </other_outcome>

    <measure>Exploratory Endpoints</measure>
    <time_frame>At week 28, 4 weeks after the second vaccination and at week 96 after the booster dose in selected group.</time_frame>
    <description>Serum bactericidal titers will be determined using in-house functional assay assessing the number of survived S. Typhi Ty2 strain colony on Luria-Bertani plate. Serum bactericidal titer is defined as the highest dilution of serum that gives 50% of inhibition of colony formation of S. Typhi.</description>
