  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Immunotherapy has made rapid progress in melanoma, Hodgkin's lymphoma, non-small cell lung
      cancer, and bladder cancer, etc. Preclinical data suggested that the use of anti-PD-1
      antibody in combination with CTLA-4 receptor blockers may increase antitumor activity. The
      CheckMate-012 study showed that nivolumab and ipilimumab combination therapy achieved an
      overall response rate of 43% in unselected patients with non-small cell lung cancer, compared
      with 23% in the nivolumab monotherapy group; and in the PD-L1 positive subgroup, nivolumab in
      combination with ipilimumab showed a response rate of 57%, while nivolumab alone was 28%.
      This showed that the combination therapy of nivolumab and ipilimumab can increase the
      efficacy, but the adverse events of grade 3 or above of combination therapy reach 37%. The
      toxic side effects limit the widespread use of nivolumab in combination with ipilimumab
      therapy.

      However, since the action of ipilimumab is limited to the initiation of the immune response
      (antigen presentation and immune cell activation), and its long half-time of 15.4 days,
      ipilimumab can used as an induction therapy, following by the PD1 monoclonal antibody. This
      phase I study is aimed to evaluated the safety and efficacy of CTLA-4 antibody followed by
      PD-1 antibody in patients with recurrent or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer.
