      (Sisters Health And Primary CarE Uniting and Preventing Diabetes; aka SHAPE UP) will consist
      of: 1) Neighborhood DPP Intervention: group DPP sessions and individual coaching; 2)
      Preventive Care Coordination to FQHC: referral, navigation assistance, patient activation,
      linkage to primary care (community initiated referrals) and linkage to DPP program (FQHC
      initiated referrals)

      SHAPE-UP we will use a randomized between groups wait-list design wherein the experimental
      treatment will be compared to best practices FHCN/FQHC services waitlist control (with an
      educational supplement for control). At the 24-week point, the waitlist control participants
      will be invited to receive the intervention. This combines a between groups RCT design with a
      phase change/within-group design for maximum efficiency with a limited N. Randomization will
      occur at the level of the individual participant. To sustain participant interest and to
      address obesity-related needs, control arm participants will receive Best Practices services
      including 1) Individual counseling about pre-diabetes risk at baseline; 2) mailed written
      materials at weeks 6, 12, 18; and 3) As needed additional FQHC Primary Care services (as
      mentioned, referral to the DPP obesity intervention and FHCN/FQHC primary care services will
      be bidirectional. The RE-AIM framework will guide process and impact evaluation measures of
      this intervention.
