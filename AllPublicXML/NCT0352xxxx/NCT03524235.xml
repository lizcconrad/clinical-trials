  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study seeks to examine the investigational use of the conditioning regimen
      (bendamustine, fludarabine, and retiuximab) prior to haplo peripheral blood allogeneic stem
      cell transplantation with PTCy. The study will also test the investigational use of
      CD56-enriched Donor Lymphocyte Infusion to see if this treatment is safe and whether or not
      it will help patients achieve better outcomes post-transplant, including reduced risk of
      Graft Versus Host Disease (GVHD) and preventing disease relapse.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a single center Phase I trial of a new haploidentical stem cell transplant regimen
      intended to assess safety. Two groups of patients are planned: patients with lymphoma and
      patients with multiple myeloma. Each subject will receive a haploidentical stem cell
      transplantation using peripheral blood stem cells. Bendamustine-fludarabine-rituximab-TBI
      conditioning will be used, followed by stem cell infusion, with PTCy and tacrolimus for GVHD
      prophylaxis. Patients will receive a CD56-selected DLI on day +7. Evaluations will be taken
      at baseline and at each of the study visits. Screening data will be reviewed to determine
      subject eligibility. Subjects who meet all inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion
      criteria will be entered into the study. Total duration of subject participation will be one
      year. Total duration of the study is expected to be three years.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        General Inclusion Criteria (For Treatment Groups)

          -  Patient age 18 - 75 years

          -  ECOG 0 - 2

          -  HIV-positive patients are allowed if these criteria are met:

               1. No history of opportunistic infections

               2. CD4+ cell count greater or equal to 250 cells/mm3

               3. No history of non-malignancy AIDS-defining conditions other than historical low
                  CD4+ cell counts

          -  Patient is on antiretroviral therapy with undetectable viral load. There must be
             minimal interactions of the antiviral therapy with the experimental treatment
             (antiretroviral such as ritonavir is potent CYP3A4 inhibitor and p-gp inducer may
             interact with tacrolimus resulted in increased serum concentration of tacrolimus).

          -  Patients must have a first-degree related donor or half-sibling who is at minimum HLA
             haploidentical. The donor and recipient must be identical at least one allele of each
             of the following genetic loci: HLA-A, HLA-B, HLA-Cw, HLA-DRB1, and HLA-DQB1. A minimum
             match of 5/10 is therefore required, and will be considered sufficient evidence that
             the donor and recipient share one HLA haplotype. An unrelated donor search is not
             required. (Patients with a readily-available, suitable, fully-matched sibling donor
             less than age 55 are not eligible for this trial, these patients should proceed to
             transplant using the matched related donor as standard-of-care).

        Criteria for Donor Eligibility

          -  Age greater than 12 years

          -  Donors must meet the selection criteria as defined by the Foundation for the
             Accreditation of Hematopoietic Cell Therapy (FACT)1.

          -  In the event that two or more eligible donors are identified, the following order of
             priority will be used to determine the preferred donor:

               -  Medically and psychologically fit and willing to donate

               -  For CMV seronegative recipients, a CMV seronegative donor

               -  Red blood-cell compatibility

                    -  RBC cross-match compatible

                    -  Minor ABO incompatibility

                    -  Major ABO incompatibility

          -  If more than one preferred donor is identified and there is no medical, HLA- or KIR
             ligand reason to prefer one of them, then the following guidelines are recommended:

        If the patient is male, choose a male donor:

          -  Choose the youngest preferred donor

          -  If the patient and family express a strong preference for a particular donor, use that
             one.

        Inclusion Criteria (Lymphoma)

          -  Diagnosis of resistant or relapsed CLL, Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma, Hodgkin Lymphoma, T-cell
             lymphoma, NK or NK/T Lymphoma.

          -  Meets one of the following criteria:

               -  relapsed after auto-transplant, or

               -  failed to mobilize autologous stem cells, or

               -  for whom allogeneic stem cell transplant is deemed appropriate given disease risk
                  factors that make cure with autologous transplant seem unlikely, such as history
                  of chemotherapy refractoriness, high risk disease
                  features/mutations/translocations (e.g., Double Hit / Double Expressor DLBCL),
                  short remission after prior chemotherapy, or histologic transformation (see
                  below).

          -  For Patients with Aggressive Mantle Cell and Diffuse Large B Cell Lymphoma who have
             not had a prior autologous transplant:

               -  Must have received at least 2 lines of prior therapy, and

               -  Have been exposed to anthracycline, and

               -  High and High-Intermediate aaIPI score (2 or 3 factors), and

               -  Have relapsed within one year of primary therapy

          -  For diagnosis of other aggressive lymphoma (e.g. NK/T Lymphoma, T Cell

        Lymphoma, etc.):

          -  Must have received at least 2 lines of prior therapy, and

          -  Relapsed within 12 months of most recent therapy

               -  For low-grade lymphomas / CLL:

               -  Standard risk patients (absence of del(17p), absence of del(11q), no TP53
                  mutation and absence of complex karyotype) must have progressed on BCR inhibitor,
                  or undergone histologic transformation, to be eligible.

               -  Patients with high risk disease (del(17p) or TP53 mutations and/or complex
                  phenotype) who relapse after frontline therapy, demonstrate refractory disease to
                  second line therapy (not BCR inhibitors), but show an objective response to BCR
                  inhibitors are eligible to be taken off BCR inhibitors in order to proceed to
                  alloHSCT on trial. Patients with high risk disease who relapse after frontline
                  therapy, demonstrate refractory disease to second line therapy including BCR
                  inhibitors (not BCL-2 inhibitors), but show an objective response to BCL-2
                  inhibitors (venetoclax) are eligible to be taken off BCL-2 inhibitors in order to
                  proceed to alloHSCT on trial.

               -  For aggressive lymphomas, partial or complete remission (PR or CR) is required
                  prior to alloHSCT.

               -  Regarding CD20 expression: Patients with B cell malignancies that were CD20+ at
                  any level at the time of relapse diagnosis (including partial / dim staining on
                  IHC or partial / low level expression by flow cytometry) will receive rituximab
                  as part of allogeneic transplant conditioning. Patients with primary-refractory
                  disease who were CD20+ at any level at the time of diagnosis will likewise
                  receive rituximab. Patients with histologies that were CD20- will not receive
                  rituximab (T cell lymphoma, NK/T lymphoma, etc.). Fresh tissue / repeat biopsy is
                  not required; the most recent biopsy will be reviewed to assess CD20 status.

               -  Available Diagnostic Specimen Lymphoma patients must have a diagnostic tissue
                  specimen available on which to perform ClonoSEQ to identify the rearranged
                  immunoglobulin gene for subsequent post-transplant minimal-residual-disease
                  testing.

        Inclusion Criteria (Multiple Myeloma)

        - Patient age 18 - 75 years with:

          -  Early relapse (less than 24 months) after primary therapy that included an autologous
             HSCT, or

             chromosome 8q24.1/c-MYC abnormality, or LDH &gt; ULN at diagnosis, provided patients
             respond favorably to salvage therapy before enrollment for alloHSCT on trial and
             patient is age &lt; 55, or

          -  Patients failing to mobilize peripheral blood stem cells for autologous
             transplantation, or
