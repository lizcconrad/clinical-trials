      The purpose of the study is to compare the outcome of patients who receive standard treatment
      versus those who receive preventative radiation and then standard treatment.

    <description>Patients randomized to Arm 1 will undergo appropriate therapy as determined by their oncologist. These patients will either continue their current therapy or be transitioned to a new standard of care therapy at the discretion of the treating oncologist. If randomized to Arm 1, these patients may undergo palliative RT for progressive, painful lesions (a skeletal related event) at time of symptom development (not upfront palliative RT).</description>

    <description>Patients on Arm 2 of the study will undergo selective RT to ≤ 5 high risk bone metastases defined as 1. bulkiest sites of osseous disease ≥ 2cm, 2. disease involving the hip (acetabulum, femoral head, femoral neck), shoulder (acromion, glenoid, humeral head), or sacroiliac joints 3. disease in long bones with1/3-2/3 cortical thickness (humerus, radius, ulna, clavicle, femur, tibia, fibula, metacarpus, phalanges) 4. disease in junctional spine (C7-T1, T12-L1, L5-S1) &amp;/or disease with posterior element involvement.</description>

    <description>Radiation therapy will be delivered according to department standards. For this protocol, total dose and dose fractionation may be delivered at the discretion of the treating radiation oncologist according to department standards. All techniques including conventional, 3D-CRT, or IMRT technique may be used. Image guidance at the time of treatment delivery to verify patient positioning may be chosen at the discretion of the treating radiation oncologist according to department standards.</description>

    <description>Standard of care systemic therapy, including chemotherapeutics, targeted therapies, immunomodulatory agents, and hormonal therapies will be delivered at the discretion of the treating medical oncologist. Patients may receive systemic therapy concurrently and there are no restrictions on initiation of systemic agents after radiotherapy including immunotherapy and hormonal therapy, the timing of which will be determined by a consensus between the treating medical and radiation oncologists.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Histologically confirmed solid tumor malignancy with greater than 5 sites of
             metastatic disease detected on cross-sectional imaging.

          -  Has high risk bone metastases that are asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic (not
             requiring opioids). High risks metastases are defined as: 1. bulkiest sites of osseous
             disease ≥ 2cm, 2. disease involving the hip (acetabulum, femoral head, femoral neck),
             shoulder (acromion, glenoid, humeral head), or sacroiliac joints 3. disease in long
             bones with1/3-2/3 cortical thickness (humerus, radius, ulna, clavicle, femur, tibia,
             fibula, metacarpus, phalanges) 4. disease in junctional spine (C7-T1, T12-L1, L5-S1)
             and/or disease with posterior element involvement.

          -  ECOG performance status 0 - 2.

          -  Age ≥ 18 years.

          -  Able to provide informed consent.

          -  Patients at reproductive potential must agree to practice an effective contraceptive
             method. Women of childbearing potential must not be pregnant or lactating.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Previous radiotherapy to the intended treatment site that precludes developing a
             treatment plan that respects normal tissue tolerances.

          -  Serious medical co-morbidities precluding radiotherapy.

          -  Pregnant or lactating women.

          -  Complicated bone metastases including clinical or radiological evidence of spinal cord
             compression or impending pathological fracture.

          -  Leptomeningeal disease.

          -  Malignant pleural effusion.

          -  Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) &lt;1.0 K/mcL and platelet count &lt;50 K/mcL at time of
             enrollment.

          -  Patients whose entry to the trial will cause unacceptable clinical delays in their
             planned management.
