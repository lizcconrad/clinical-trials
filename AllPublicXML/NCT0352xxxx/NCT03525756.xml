  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Colovesical fistulas are well-recognized but relatively uncommon pathology to both the
      general and colorectal surgeon. It is a complication arising from an underlying primary acute
      to chronic inflammatory process. Although colovesical fistulas are uncommon, they are
      associated with significant morbidity, affect quality of life, and may lead to death, usually
      secondary to urosepsis. Early diagnosis and management is essential.

      The purpose of the study is to determine the objective use of cystographic evaluation on
      postoperative day two to guide early Foley catheter removal post colovesical fistula
      takedown. The hypothesis is that a cystogram showing no extravasation of contrast on
      postoperative day two will predict safe removal without increased morbidity.

      This is an uncontrolled, single arm trial. Patients who meet criteria to undergo either
      minimally invasive or open colovesical fistula takedown with sigmoid colectomy, without
      evidence of the need for bladder repair will be eligible to participate. An indwelling Foley
      catheter is placed intraoperative and continued postoperative. All patients who consent to
      participate would undergo a cystogram on postoperative day two. The cystogram will be
      conducted by a radiologist and technician well-trained in the techniques and interpretation
      of the study. The colorectal surgery enhanced recovery protocol will be followed on all
      patients with the exception of the cystogram being conducted on post-op day two. If there is
      no evidence of extravasation of dye is seen on the cystogram the Foley catheter will be
      removed. Patients will be monitored closely following catheter removal to ensure
      self-diuresis.
