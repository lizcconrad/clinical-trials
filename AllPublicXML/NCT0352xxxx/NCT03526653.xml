  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Elderly in residential care spend 97% of their time sedentary. Moreover, exercise therapy
      often takes place in a poorly stimulating environment which is less motivational for the
      elderly to undertake regularly. Exercise is however necessary to preserve their physical
      capabilities and to limit their care dependence.

      The aim of this study is to investigate the most motivating and stimulating exercise modality
      for prefrail and frail elderly in nursing homes with which they can reach sufficient training
      volume.

      To study this, elderly will exercise in 3 different ways on an ergometer or motomed
      (according to their physical capabilities): 1) in an environment without other visual stimuli
      2) in front of a television with National Geographic images 3) with the interactive software
      program MemoRide with which participants can exercise in real life on a virtual manner.

      MemoRide (Activ84Health) uses Google Street View images. The starting point is a connection
      between an exercise bike and a tablet with a pedalling sensor. This way, pedal frequency is
      sent to the tablet and as a result, images continue when pedalling.

      The forth modality is the control modality, in which participants are instructed to rest
      (supine) during 30 minutes.

      Based on objective training parameters and metabolic parameters e.g. glucose, insulin,
      brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and lactate, (via a blood sample with a venous
      catheter) the training modality which offers the best training results will be studied.
      Secondly, also subject experiences (motivation and emotions) will be evaluated by using
      questionnaires and observation scales.
