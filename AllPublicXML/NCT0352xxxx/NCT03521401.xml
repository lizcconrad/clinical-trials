  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The process by which the body responds to stressors to maintain homeostasis is called
      allostasis and is dependent on the integrated function of the nervous, endocrine, and immune
      systems. ACEs adversely affect these system, cause allostatic load, and can modify
      development of allostatic systems. However, the central hypothesis is that exercise can
      reduce allostatic load by positively augmenting function of each of these three systems. No
      previous studies have examined the effects of structured exercise interventions in
      individuals with ACEs. The investigators are studying the effects of 8-weeks of structured
      resistance and aerobic exercise on biomarkers related to nervous, endocrine, immune, and
      metabolic function and several clinical outcomes in young adult women with ACEs. The specific
      aims will test several hypotheses, and are as follows: SPECIFIC AIM 1: Conduct a feasibility
      study to explore whether progressive, structured exercise can help mitigate the adverse
      physiological effects of stress and trauma early in life. SPECIFIC AIM 2: Determine whether
      progressive, structured exercise can help improve health-related quality of life, anxiety,
      and traits like hope, self-efficacy, or self-control, resilience. SPECIFIC AIM 3: Determine
      whether the type and timing of exposure to ACEs has a significant influence on the severity
      of psychopathology and long-term physiological response to ACEs.
