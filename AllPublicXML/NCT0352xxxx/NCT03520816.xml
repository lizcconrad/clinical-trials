      Background: This study planned to investigate the effect of early physiotherapy on
      biochemical parameters in major burn patients.

      Methods: Ten women (50%) and 10 men (50%) aged 21-47 years old were included in our study.
      Participants were divided into two groups: one group was the treatment group and the other
      was the control group. In the treatment group, patients were admitted to the physiotherapy
      programme from the first day they have been hospitalised, in addition to their routine
      treatment (medical, surgery, etc.), for 4 days per week. It consisted of parameters such as
      early mobilisation and ambulatory training, chest physiotherapy, and both active and passive
      normal joint movement exercises. The days of treatment were determined as Tuesday, Wednesday,
      Thursday and Friday. Patients could not be treated on a Monday because that was surgery day.
      The control group consisted of patients who could not receive physiotherapy due to various
      reasons. All patients included in the study were evaluated weekly for 6 weeks after admission
      to the hospital. Parameters such as demographic information, characteristics of burn injury,
      C-reactive protein, fibronectin, transferrin and prealbumin were evaluated.
