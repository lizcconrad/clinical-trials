    <textblock>
      This study uses to suppress the growth of tumors, extend the patient's survival time and
      improve the quality of life as much as possible. Through the treatment, the patient is given
      the chance to undergo surgical resection, thereby more effectively prolonging the OS.
      Apatinib is a small-molecule VEGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor. It mainly treats malignant
      tumors by inhibiting VEGFR and exerting anti-angiogenic effects. Preclinical studies have
      shown that its anti-tumor effect is better than that of the similar drug PTK787. Phase II
      studies of hepatocellular carcinoma have initially demonstrated the effectiveness and safety
      of apatinib in the treatment of advanced HCC. Radiotherapy of tumors and portal vein tumor
      thrombi can promote further tumor shrinkage, and at the same time, the physiological basis
      for the recanalization of the original tumor thrombus itself will result in necrosis and
      fibrosis of the tumor thrombus, completely blocking the blood supply to the tumor portal
      vein. As a result, blood supply to the other side of the portal vein increases, and
      hepatocyte regeneration in a healthy liver is promoted, so that the patient can obtain
      surgical opportunities. Based on the therapeutic potential of apatinib and radiotherapy, we
      designed a prospective exploratory clinical study of this patient with advanced liver cancer.

    <description>Apatinib, a small molecule anti-angiogenic targeted drug that has been demonstrated to be safe and effective after failure of standard chemotherapy for advanced gastric cancer, has been initially successful in phase II clinical trials for the treatment of unresectable advanced HCC patients. The efficacy of ralfiny in the treatment of Oriental population (ORIENTAL study) is better. The randomized, double-blind, multi-center phase III clinical study of apatinib second-line treatment of advanced hepatocellular carcinoma showed a good efficacy and safety. Currently, Phase III clinical studies of apatinib in HCC patients undergoing systemic chemotherapy or sorafenib treatment have progressed. Initial results also showed good efficacy and safety.</description>
