  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the safety, tolerability and antitumor activity of
      IMAB362 in Japanese subjects with locally advanced or metastatic Gastric or GEJ
      adenocarcinoma whose tumors have Claudin (CLDN) 18.2 Expression. This study will also assess
      pharmacokinetics and immunogenicity of IMAB362.

      This study consists of two parts (Part 1: Safety; and Part 2: Expansion). First, the subjects
      will be enrolled in Safety Part with IMAB362 dose-1/2 (Arm A). Then the safety and
      tolerability of Arm A will be evaluated at Tolerability Evaluation Meeting (TEM). If there
      are no safety and tolerability concerns, enrollment for the Safety Part with IMAB362 dose-3
      (Arm B) and the Expansion Part with IMAB362 dose-1/2 will be opened. For each part,
      participants who continue to derive clinical benefit and do not have intolerable toxicity
      from study treatment will be allowed to remain on treatment until treatment discontinuation
      criterion is met.
