  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this pilot project is to test the new Radialis Positron Emission Mammography
      (R-PEM) system in breast cancer patients that has a higher sensitivity with lower radiation
      doses than conventional PET/CT.

      The plan for the pilot study is to image patients who are already scheduled for diagnostic
      imaging for breast cancer after a positive core biopsy. Participants will be injected with
      5mCi of F-18 FDG and patient will wait for a couple of hours for uptake of FDG. After this
      time, the first R-PEM scan will occur. Additional optional R-PEM scans can be performed 4
      hours after injection and 7 hours after injection with reductions in radiation emission.

      Additionally, R-PEM images will be compared to standard-of-care breast MRI and digital breast
      tomosynthesis to study extension of disease and screening of contralateral breast.

    <description>The diagnostic performance of R-PEM including sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values compared to magnetic resonance imaging, digital breast tomosynthesis mammography, and digital mammography in characterization of suspicious breast abnormalities will also be evaluated in our study when those images are available through standard patient care.</description>
