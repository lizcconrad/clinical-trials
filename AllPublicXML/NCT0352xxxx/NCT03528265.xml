    <textblock>
      Towards the goal of reducing melioidosis, this study will help clinicians in Sarawak to
      diagnose and understand the causes and risk factors for melioidosis. The data will help the
      clinicians to provide faster test results and better clinical care. The investigator's
      laboratory efforts will supplement available diagnostics by adding a new, easier-to-use test
      involving lateral flow immunoassay to rapidly detect Burkholderia pseudomallei, a bacterium
      causing melioidosis. The study aims to study up to 100 patients with melioidosis-like
      symptoms who are admitted to Kapit Hospital, Sarawak, Malaysia. No participants will be
      enrolled from other sites. The study will also examine the demographic, behavioral and
      occupational risk factors associated with hospital admissions to understand any existing
      associations between these variables and melioidosis prevalence.
