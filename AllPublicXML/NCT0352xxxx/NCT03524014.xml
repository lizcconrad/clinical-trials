  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The present research aims to collect virological and clinical data on hepatitis E virus (HEV)
      infections, either in acute or chronic forms of HEV infection in North-Eastern France, with
      liver- or non liver-related symptoms, plus data on HEV circulation in the outside
      environment. The purpose of this study is to improve the diagnosis and care of HEV-infected
      patients, as well as the preventive features to take into account in order to avoid food- and
      environment-borne infections. At last, we will investigate HEV molecular characteristics,
      with the hypothesis that some advantageous HEV strains coul be more pathogenic for some
      tissues and/or organs.
