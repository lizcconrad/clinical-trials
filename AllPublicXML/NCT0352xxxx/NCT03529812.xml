  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Emory University Spiritual Health department will incorporate Cognitively-Based
      Compassion Training (CBCT) into their training curriculum beginning in Fall 2017, which
      provides the opportunity to compare students receiving the CBCT addendum with those receiving
      traditional chaplaincy training. This is a naturalistic study that examines the impact of
      incorporating CBCT into Emory's spiritual caregiver training program. The researchers will
      examine the effect of CBCT on empathic accuracy and resilience by comparing the first group
      of students who receive CBCT-informed training with chaplains who receive standard training
      in spiritual caregiving and receive CBCT later in the residency year. Comprehensive
      assessments will be conducted in order to examine whether outcomes for patients are improved
      for those receiving chaplain spiritual care augmented by CBCT compared to those receiving
      spiritual care from chaplains who receive CBCT later in their residency.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Based on a wealth of research demonstrating the associations between physical health and
      psychosocial well-being, modern health care in the United States is characterized by an
      increasingly patient-centered model of care that places a premium on the holistic treatment
      of the patient as a physical, psychosocial, and spiritual whole. Hospital chaplains play a
      vital role in delivering emotional and spiritual care to a broad range of both religious and
      non-religious patients for a wide variety of stressors, and extensive research indicates that
      spiritual consults impact patient outcomes and satisfaction. However, there is remarkably
      little research on the &quot;active ingredients&quot; of chaplaincy spiritual care, and a subsequent
      lack of standardization and best-practice guidelines informing chaplain training and chaplain
      spiritual consulting. CBCT Â® (Cognitively-Based Compassion Training) is a secularized
      compassion meditation program adapted from the Tibetan Buddhist mind training (lojong)
      tradition, and it may be an ideal addendum to both chaplain training programs and to the
      spiritual care consults provided by Emory University hospital chaplains to approximately
      100,000 patients each year. This is a pilot study to explore the feasibility and impact of
      incorporating CBCT into the educational curriculum for chaplain residents. To this end, the
      researchers will (1) examine the impact of CBCT on burnout, compassion, and empathic accuracy
      among chaplains in training, (2) explore whether the impact persists through the end of the
      resident training, (3) evaluate the timing of the training within the existing curriculum to
      maximize its impact, (4) evaluate whether CBCT-informed interventions improve patient
      outcomes, and (5) explore chaplain and patient mediators of the impact of spiritual care
      consults on patient outcomes. Data acquired in this pilot study will be used to estimate
      efficacy and to inform a randomized controlled trial.

    <intervention_model_description>This study aims to enroll 30 hospital chaplain residents, 15 will have the CBCT intervention early and the other 15 will learn about CBCT later. Additionally, 500 patients who have spiritual services provided by the chaplains participating in the study will be enrolled in order to examine patient outcomes.</intervention_model_description>
