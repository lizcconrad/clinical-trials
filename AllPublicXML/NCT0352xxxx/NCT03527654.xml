  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hispanic immigrants to the U.S. are more likely to experience negative health outcomes the
      longer they live in the U.S. For example, over time Hispanic immigrants engage in riskier
      behaviors such as substance abuse, violence, and risky sex, and experience more depressive
      symptoms. The stress associated with the acculturation process, acculturation stress, and
      resilience at the individual, family, community, and societal levels appear to play important
      roles in influencing risks. However, little is known about the causal mechanisms linking
      acculturation stress, resilience, and health outcomes among Hispanic immigrants. Further,
      little is known about what precise types of stressors (e.g., occupational stress vs.
      discrimination) and resilience factors (e.g., individual coping vs. family support) have the
      most important influence on health trajectories of Hispanic immigrants. The proposed
      longitudinal study (N = 385) will investigate the effects of acculturation stress and
      resilience on co-occurring substance abuse, intimate partner violence, HIV risk, and
      depression (i.e., syndemic conditions) and biological stress among young adult Hispanic
      immigrants in the U.S. More specifically, the proposed project aims to: 1) test theoretical
      links between the cumulative impact of acculturation stress and resilience on syndemic
      conditions and biological stress among recent young adult Hispanic immigrants over a two-year
      period, and 2) identify the specific types of acculturation stressors and resilience factors
      at the individual, family, community, and societal levels that are most important in
      predicting syndemic conditions and biological stress among this population over time. Young
      adult low-income Hispanic immigrant men and women within the first 10 years of immigration
      will be followed for two years. Biopsychosocial data will be collected from participants at
      baseline, and then 6 months (FU1), 12 months (FU2), 18 months (FU3), and 24 months later
      (FU4). Culturally specific measures of acculturation stress and resilience will be used to
      assess for individual, family, community, and societal risk and protective factors for
      syndemic conditions. Blood and urine samples will be obtained from participants to measure
      systemic inflammation (IL 6, IL8, and IL 18) and oxidative stress (F2 isoprostanes),
      previously validated biomarkers for psychological stress. Various descriptive, univariate and
      multivariate statistics, including latent growth curve modeling, will be used to address aims
      1-2. The findings from this study have the potential to identify risk and protective factors
      for the decay in heath among Hispanic immigrants. A precise and culturally informed
      understanding of these phenomena is foundational for designing interventions that can
      ultimately promote the health and wellbeing of Hispanic immigrants, the largest immigrant
      group in the U.S. This study also has the potential to lay the theoretical foundation for
      biopsychosocial health disparities research in other populations.

    <description>The AUDIT (Babor et. al., 2001) measure has 10 items that assess frequency of drinking and alcohol use disorder symptoms. The DAST (Skinner, 1982) measure, has 10 items that measure drug abuse symptoms. The Revised Conflict Tactics Scale (Strauss &amp; Douglas, 2004) has 24 items that assess conflict between partners and intimate partner violence. The Partner Table &amp; STI History (Gonzalez-Guarda et. al., 2011) has 25 items that assess current sexual practices and risk for sexually transmitted infections including HIV. The PHQ-9 (Kroenke et al., 2002) has 9 items that assess severity depression. The GAD-7 (Spitzer et. al., 2006) contains 7 items that assess anxiety for the individual.</description>
