    <textblock>
      A single-centre, industry sponsored, pilot study to assess the feasibility of Single Exposure
      Dual Energy Subtraction with a Multi-Energy digital radiography detector as an imaging
      platform for lung lesion detection.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A feasibility study is proposed to investigate the imaging characteristics captured by a
      Single Exposure Dual-Energy Subtraction digital radiography with KA Imaging's Multi-energy
      detector.

      The acquisition of Dual-Energy Subtraction radiography will consist of using the Multi-Energy
      detector integrated into the X-ray system in Grand River Hospital. Patient will receive a
      Multi-Energy Chest radiography exam on the same day as their routine chest CT exam. Each
      Multi-Energy radiography exam will consist of one Chest PA image. Duration of each procedure
      is 60 minutes. The Multi-Energy Detector will generate a General Radiography Image and
      Dual-Energy Subtracted Images.

      Visualization of lung lesions by Multi-Energy detector will be compared to corresponding CT
      exam and general radiography results. Imaging data will be evaluated qualitatively by
      radiologists on data collection form to describe the findings on the images. Further
      comparison between general radiography, Dual-Energy Subtraction radiography and CT will be
      analyzed to determine the differences of imaging characteristics such as description of image
      quality and visibility of relevant anatomical structures and anomalies.

    <description>A Multi-energy digital flat panel detector for Single Exposure Dual-Energy Subtraction radiography is developed to capture x-ray images with improved tissue differentiation. Tissue-selective images can be produced at various tissue levels such as bone and soft tissue to visualize obscured anomalies that are not apparent to General Radiography.</description>
