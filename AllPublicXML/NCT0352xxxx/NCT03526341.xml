      A post-market clinical follow-up study for ReliaTack™ articulating reloadable fixation device
      with deep purchase tacks
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A retrospective, multi-center, chart review of medical records on the use of the device for
      two (2) surgical procedure indications:

        1. inguinal/femoral hernia

        2. ventral hernia

      A minimum of 4 sites in the United States will perform chart review and enter 116 study
      records in the database for data collection. The 116 subject records will be comprised of 76
      for the inguinal/femoral indication, and 40 for the ventral indication.
