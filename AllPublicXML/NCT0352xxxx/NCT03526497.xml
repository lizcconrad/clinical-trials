      In patients admitted to a coronary care unit, what is the correlation coefficient and limits
      of agreement for paired measurements of peripheral venous pressure and central venous
      pressure at multiple time points during the patient's hospitalization?

    <textblock>
      The treatment of numerous cardiac conditions requires assessment of intravascular volume
      status, using central venous pressure (CVP) as the gold standard. Measurement of CVP requires
      placement of an invasive venous catheter, with insertion of a venous catheter into a central
      vein to obtain CVP. Catheter placement is invasive, costly and not without complications.
      Ideally, there would exist a peripheral surrogate for CVP that would be 1) minimally invasive
      to obtain, 2) low cost and 3) strongly correlate with CVP over a wide range of physiological
      conditions.

      The peripheral venous system is in continuity with the central venous system and, as such,
      would be expected to have a pressure that correlates with central venous pressure. Numerous
      previous studies suggest a correlation between peripheral venous pressure (PVP) and central
      venous pressure. Prior studies have demonstrated a reasonable correlation between CVP and PVP
      in patient populations including decompensated heart failure, cardiac and non-cardiac
      surgery(1), liver transplant donors(2) and recipients(3), neurosurgical(4) and pediatric
      patients.(5) In an earlier study published by the authors of this paper, the mean difference
      between PVP and CVP in patients with acute heart failure syndromes was 0.4 mmHg with a
      correlation coefficient of 0.947. One limitation of the earlier study was that it established
      this correlation at only one point in time. In the study presented here, PVP and CVP will be
      obtained and correlation will be assessed across multiple time points during a given
      patient's hospitalization.

      This is a prospective, single center cohort study to investigate the correlation between
      peripheral venous pressure and central venous pressure.

        All patients with pulmonary artery catheters and peripheral IVs admitted to the Coronary
        Care Units at the Cleveland Clinic, meeting the inclusion criteria, will be considered for
        enrollment.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  We plan to enroll patients who meet the following criteria: Patients admitted to an
             intensive care unit for invasive hemodynamic monitoring. All eligible patients will be
             those who have already undergone pulmonary artery catheterization via the internal
             jugular or subclavian veins and upper extremity peripheral IV placement per routine
             standard of care prior to enrollment.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients will be excluded from this study for the following reasons: age less than 18
             years of age, inability to obtain consent, femoral pulmonary artery catheter, or if
             their attending physician refuses to allow enrollment.
