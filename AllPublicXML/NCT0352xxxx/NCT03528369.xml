  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multi-center, randomized, double-blind clinical trial to examine the comparative
      effects on OAKP of CGS-200-1 (1% Capsaicin content) (N=40), CGS-200-5 (5% Capsaicin content)
      (N=40), and CGS-200 Vehicle (no Capsaicin) (N=40) in subjects with OA of the knees according
      to the 1986 American College of Rheumatology (ACR) criteria. Assigned doses will be applied
      at the clinic for 60 minutes on each of four consecutive days.

      Subjects will be randomized to one of the three Arms in this study: CGS-200-1 or CGS-200-5 or
      CGS-200 Vehicle (CGS-200-0). All subjects will receive 4 consecutive days of treatment and
      will then be followed up until the Day 94 visit.

      Even though both knee(s) will receive application of study test materials, with regard to
      reduction in WOMAC pain and VAS pain score associated with study treatments, only one knee
      will be indicated as the &quot;Study Knee&quot;. This will be the knee with the highest WOMAC pain
      score at screening. If both knees have equal WOMAC pain scores at baseline, then the right
      knee will be considered the &quot;Study Knee&quot; with regard to WOMAC pain and VAS pain score
      reduction.

      Data will be collected from Day 1 through Day 5 and then again on Days 19, 35, 64 and 94 for
      efficacy, tolerability, and safety measures. The Investigators, all site staff and Clinical
      Research Organization (CRO) personnel (except the Medical Monitor providing safety oversight)
      directly involved in the study will remain blinded to the treatment assignment throughout the
      trial.
