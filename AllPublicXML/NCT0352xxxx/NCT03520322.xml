  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the efficacy of a mastoid treatment device in
      patients with active Ménière's disease that is not controlled by traditional medical
      management
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a single center, randomized, placebo-controlled trial of mastoid oscillation for
      treatment of Ménière's disease. Eligible subjects will be randomized using a 1:1 allocation
      to either mastoid oscillation or placebo (oscillator device that provides the same sound but
      no vibration of the mastoid) received for 30 minutes at four weekly study visits, with
      efficacy determination via change in frequency and severity of Ménière's symptoms following
      the final study visit.

    <description>The oscillator will be placed over the mastoid of their involved ear and secured via an elastic/Velcro headband. The subject is positioned so as to place the endolymphatic duct into a gravitationally dependent orientation (the subject lying on their contralateral side with the face slightly tilted towards the floor). The device is turned on and operated for 30 minutes.</description>
