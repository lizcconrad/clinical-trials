  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Alexithymia is often found in patients suffering from anorexia nervosa or from bulimia.
      Art-therapy is widely used in this indication without there is a study in the literature
      assessing it. ALEXART is an observational prospective multicenter cohort, assessing the
      effect at 3 months of art therapy on alexithymia, in patients presenting anorexia nervosa or
      bulimia.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Alexithymia, defined by difficulties to identify and describe feelings as well as a poverty
      of imaginary life, is found in patients with anorexia nervosa (AN) or bulimia (BN) in
      numerous studies. Some publications show that it is a factor of resistance in several forms
      of psychotherapies and of poor prognosis for these patients who already present a high rate
      of chronification and mortality because of the complications of the undernutrition and the
      suicide risk. Art therapy is very wide-spread in the care of AN and of BN, but little
      studied. About alexithymia, if there is no psychotherapy having made the proof of its
      efficiency currently, some studies suggest the interest of art-therapy on alexithymic
      features, but none, to our knowledge, estimated the effect.

      The investigator suggest to describe the evolution at 3 months of art therapy on alexithymia,
      using the Toronto Alexithymia Scale in 20 items (TAS-20), in patients with AN or BN. The
      investigators shall also describe the evolution at 1 month with the TAS-20 as well as the
      relationship between variations of alexithymia and BMI in patients presenting AN at 3 months.
      The investigators will also evaluate the effect of depression and anxiety at 3 months of art
      therapy on alexithymia.The investigators shall realize an observational prospective
      multicenter cohort study design. Each patient will receive standard care: multidisciplinary
      and corresponding to the HAS recommendations and semimonthly or weeklies sessions of art
      therapy, using all types of art. Thus, each patient will be her own control before art
      therapy.

    <description>Alexithymia rate using de Toronto Alexithymia Scale (TSA) in 20 items at 3 months. TAS-20 is a self-questionnaire of 20 items rated from 1 (complete disagreement) to 5 (full agreement) evaluating three central dimensions of alexithymia: the difficulty of identifying Difficulties Identifying Feelings (DIF), Difficulties Describing Feelings (DDF), and Externally Oriented, Concrete Thinking (EOT).</description>

    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>Body Mass Index (BMI) evolution for anorexic patient at 3 months The lower the Body Mass Index (BMI), the more alexithymia is important. The weight is collected weekly (twice a week at the CHU) the same day in a standardized way: in the presence of a nurse, in the morning on an empty stomach, after going to the bathroom, underwear, and using the same scale . The size is measured in similar conditions with the same meter at the entrance. The BMI is calculated by performing the operation weight divided by height squared and is expressed in kg / m2.</description>

    <measure>Effect of depression on alexithymia using the Beck Depression Inventory-II</measure>
    <time_frame>3 month</time_frame>
    <description>Effect of depression on alexithymia at 3 month, using the Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II) The revised version of the BDI or BDI-II, is a 21-item Likert scale-type self-questionnaire assessing depressive symptoms. These different items are rated from &quot;rarely&quot; (0) to often (3). The total score can be used to rate the severity of depression: 0 to 13 (minimum); 14 to 19 (light); 20 to 28 (moderate); &gt; 28 (severe [78]). Note that there is no validated threshold in adults to define a depressive episode characterized.
It has a very good level of internal consistency and reproducibility: the Cronbach Alpha coefficient is high from 0.83 to 0.96 according to the studies in a review of the 2013 literature, this is also the case in French</description>

    <measure>Effect of anxiety on alexithymia using the State Trait Anxiety Inventory-YA</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>Effect of anxiety on alexithymia at 3 month, using the State Trait Anxiety Inventory-YA (STAI-YA) The STAI is a Likert type self-questionnaire assessing anxiety that includes two scales: the STAI forms Y-A for &quot;anxiety-state&quot; (AE) and the YB form for &quot;anxiety-trait&quot; (AT) . Each scale is composed of 20 propositions: the scale E (State) relative to what the subject feels on the moment and the scale T (Line) relating to what the subject generally feels [81].
Each item has a score ranging from 1 to 4 (4 being the highest degree of anxiety). We thus obtain the score AE which is the sum of the 20 questions of the page relative to the state and which varies from 20 to 80 as well as the score AT is the sum of the 20 questions of the page &quot;Trait&quot; which also varies from 20 to 80. We will therefore find a very high score (&gt; to 65), high (from 56 to 65), average (from 46 to 55), low (from 36 to 45) or very low (â‰¤35).</description>

    <description>The main objective is to describe the evolution at 3 months on the alexithymic dimension in the course of a treatment in art therapy, in patients with anorexia nervosa or bulimia.
Art therapy is a generic term grouping different artistic disciplines adapted and used for therapeutic purposes. It is through commitment to creative work that the therapeutic work of elaboration and reflection takes place in contrast to verbal psychotherapies and mediated psychotherapies that use speech as the main therapeutic tool. All forms of practice referring to categories of art can be used: painting, music, modeling, dance, theater and writing</description>
