  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Intravenous opioids are the mainstay of acute, severe pain treatment in U.S. EDs.
      Acetaminophen, given orally, has also been used for treatment of mild to moderate pain. The
      more potent intravenous (IV) form of acetaminophen has been widely used in Europe for more
      than 20 years as post-surgical analgesia and received full FDA approval in the USA in 2010.
      As part of a continuing set of studies whose goal is to optimize treatment of pain among
      elderly ED patients, we will conduct a randomized study in which we compare efficacy and
      safety of IV acetaminophen to IV hydromorphone.
