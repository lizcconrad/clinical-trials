      The purpose of this study is to investigate the immunogenicity and safety of the concomitant
      administration of TDV (subcutaneous [SC] injection) and of hepatitis A virus (HAV) vaccine
      (intramuscular [IM] injection) in healthy participants aged 18 to 60 years living in
      country(ies) non-endemic for both dengue and hepatitis.

      The vaccine tested in this study is TDV. TDV co-administered with HAV vaccine will be tested
      to assess immunogenicity and safety in healthy participants in non-endemic area(s) for dengue
      and HAV.

      The study will enroll approximately 900 patients. Participants will be randomly assigned to
      one of the three groups—which will remain undisclosed to the observer. Participants will be
      randomized in 1:1:1 ratio to receive:

        -  Group 1: HAV vaccine (IM) and placebo (SC), co-administered at Day 1 (Month 0 [M0]);
           placebo (SC) administered at Day 90 (Month 3 [M3])

        -  Group 2: TDV (SC) and placebo (IM), co-administered at Day 1 (Month 0 [M0]); TDV (SC)
           administered at Day 90(Month 3 [M3])

        -  Group 3: TDV (SC) and HAV vaccine (IM), co-administered at Day 1 (Month 0 [M0]); TDV
           (SC) administered at Day 90 (Month 3 [M3])

      This multi-center trial will be conducted in United Kingdom. The overall time to participate
      in this study is 270 days. Participants will have multiple visits to the clinic with a
      6-months follow up after the last study administration, including a final visit at Day 270.
