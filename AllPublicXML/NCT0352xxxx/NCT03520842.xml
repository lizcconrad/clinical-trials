  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well regorafenib works together with methotrexate in treating
      participants with metastatic non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer with tumors that harbor
      a KRAS mutation. Regorafenib is a targeted therapy that works on different cancer pathways to
      stop the growth of tumor cells and stop them from spreading. Methotrexate may stop the growth
      of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Giving regorafenib and
      methotrexate together may work in treating participants with KRAS mutated non-small cell lung
      cancer.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the progression free survival (PFS) of the combination of regorafenib and
      methotrexate for metastatic KRAS mutated non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients who have
      received at least 1 prior systemic therapy.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the objective response rate (ORR) of the combination of regorafenib and
      methotrexate for metastatic KRAS mutated NSCLC patients who have received at least 1 prior
      systemic therapy.

      II. To determine the disease control rate (DCR) at 8 weeks of the combination of regorafenib
      and methotrexate for metastatic KRAS mutated NSCLC patients who have received at least 1
      prior systemic therapy.

      III. To determine the safety of the combination of regorafenib and methotrexate in metastatic
      KRAS mutated NSCLC patients who have received at least 1 prior systemic therapy, assessed as
      the number of subjects that experience a treatment-emergent adverse event.

      IV. To determine the safety of the combination of regorafenib and methotrexate in metastatic
      KRAS-mutated NSCLC patients who have received at least 1 prior systemic therapy, assessed as
      the number (percent) of participants experiencing any dose-limiting toxicity (DLT).

      V. To determine the pharmacokinetic parameters of methotrexate when combined with regorafenib
      (i.e., trough and maximum serum concentration [Cmax]).

      OUTLINE:

      Participants receive regorafenib orally (PO) once daily (QD) and methotrexate PO twice weekly
      with 2-3 days apart on a 3 week on / 1 week off schedule. Courses repeat every 28 days in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, participants will come in for an end of study treatment
      visit.

Overall Response (OR) = CR + PR
Progressive disease (PD) = 20% increase in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions, and/or the appearance of one or more new lesion(s)
Stable disease (SD) = Small changes that do not meet any of the above criteria</description>
