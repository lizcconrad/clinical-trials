  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the factors affecting the occurrence of adverse drug
      reactions (glucose and lipid metabolism abnormality, changes in liver function index and
      sleeping tendency) and clinical effects in schizophrenia patients with clozapine treatment
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      1. The baseline tests (sleeping tendency assessment, clinical symptom and cognitive
           assessments, clinical laboratory tests, genotyping, exploratory biomarker tests, etc.)
           are conducted to the schizophrenia patients before initiation of the clozapine dosing.

        2. On day 15 and 57, the changes from baseline clinical symptom and cognitive function are
           assessed after clozapine treatment. Also, the occurrence of adverse drug reactions are
           evaluated. In addition, blood sample collections are performed for the assessment of
           clozapine and its metabolite levels.

    <description>Epworth sleepiness scale (ESS).
ESS is comprised of eight questions, each asking about the subject's likelihood of dozing off or falling asleep in a particular situation that is commonly met in daily life.
Each ESS item score measures a particular &quot;situational sleep propensity&quot;, and respondents use a four-point scale from 0 (no chance of dozing/falling asleep) to 3 (high chance of dozing/falling asleep) for each of the eight questions.
The sum of eight item scores (the total ESS score) measures the subject's average sleep propensity across those different situations in daily life. A total ESS score of 16-24 points indicates severe excessive daytime sleepiness.</description>

    <description>Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS).
BPRS is a 24-item scale that measures psychiatric symptoms such as depression, anxiety, hallucinations and unusual behaviour.
Each symptom is rated on a scale from 1(not present) to 7(extremely severe).
The sum of all 24 items is then calculated to a maximum score of 168. The higher the score, the more psychiatrically impaired the patient is.</description>
