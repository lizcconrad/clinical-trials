  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary hypothesis of the study is that listening to music will reduce anxiety in female
      cancer patients during the first radiotherapy treatment session.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Receiving radiotherapy induces anxiety in at least 1/3 of patients who did not have a
      previously existing anxiety condition1. Female gender is a positive predictive factor for
      psychosocial decline during radiotherapy. One-fourth of patients disrupt their planned
      radiotherapy treatment course due to anxiety. Music therapy has demonstrated effectiveness in
      reducing anxiety when implemented in other medical settings including mechanical ventilation,
      burn debridement and venipuncture in pediatric patients. There have been some trials which
      have found a reduction in anxiety when pre-recorded music along with other relaxation
      techniques have been implemented during radiotherapy. This trial seeks to investigate the
      benefit of pre-recorded music alone in reducing anxiety experienced during the first
      radiotherapy treatment session in female cancer patients.

    <gender_description>Multiple studies document a higher rate of psychological distress in female cancer patients.The study is limited to females to decrease confounding prognostic factors related to anxiety during cancer therapy. By restricting enrollment to women in this study, is to gain proof of concept that the intervention is effective and can be determined with a smaller sample size.</gender_description>
