      This is a Phase 1 platform protocol designed to evaluate various targeted agents for the
      treatment of relapsed/refractory aggressive Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL).

      Each study arm will be conducted in a predefined disease subset. All study arms are open
      label and allocation to each study arm will not be randomized. As this master platform
      protocol has multiple study arms, subjects can be screened for several study arms at once.
      Likewise, a subject who ends participation in one study arm may be rescreened for
      participation in another (separate) study arm. The primary objective of the study is to
      evaluate the safety of targeted agents for the treatment of relapsed/refractory aggressive
      Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma (NHL).

      This protocol has a modular design, with the potential for future treatment arms to be added
      via protocol amendment.
