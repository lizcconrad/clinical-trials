  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Researchers believe that clinical care can be improved by engaging patients and families
      directly in planning the care process. Engagement efforts have included asking
      patients/families to provide information about whether they are getting better. But what does
      &quot;getting better&quot; mean? The merits of surveys, questionnaires, or rating scales have been
      widely discussed. Should they be disorder-specific or global? What should the investigators
      do if patients have difficulty reading or understanding these instruments? Investigators in
      the United Kingdom have proposed a simple solution: ask the patients and families what their
      primary goal treatment goal is and track progress together on that goal (Goal-Based Outcomes
      or GBO). Although there has been some work to suggest that this is helpful, it has never been
      tested in a controlled way. This study will do a special type of randomized controlled trial
      to test whether GBO improves clinical care in child and youth mental health. Although the
      study will use this in child and youth mental health care, if it is successful, it can be
      tested and applied in any care setting with any type of medical problem. This could change
      practice at the Children's Hospital of Eastern Ontario (CHEO) and throughout Canada.

    <description>Up to three goals can be tracked during treatment, although patients often decide to just focus on one. Progress on the goal is then quantitatively rated by the patient, with the provider, at every appointment. Adjustments in the care are then made in an iterative process to ensure that the goal will be met.</description>
