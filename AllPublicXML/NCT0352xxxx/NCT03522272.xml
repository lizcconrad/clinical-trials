      Objectives: The objective of this study was to assess prospectively the effectiveness of
      ultrasonic denture hygiene interventions in improving denture cleanliness among
      community-dwelling elders. Methods: A randomized clinical trial was conducted among
      community-dwelling elders, in which a total of 66 subjects who received upper metal framework
      removable partial dentures in the past five years were recruited randomly from a computerized
      database. They were randomly allocated into three denture hygiene intervention groups: group
      1 (mechanical cleaning with a toothbrush and ultrasonic cleaning with cetylpyridinium
      chloride mouthrinse), group 2 (mechanical cleaning with a toothbrush and ultrasonic cleaning
      with distilled water) and control (mechanical cleaning with a toothbrush only). Denture
      cleanliness was assessed at baseline and one month review using: i) Denture Cleanliness Index
      (DCI) scores; ii) plaque coverage percentage; and (iii) microbiological tests. Results: There
      were significantly greater reductions in mean DCI scores and mean percentage of plaque
      coverage area in group 1 and group 2 compared to the control group for both CoCr and acrylic
      fitting surfaces (p&lt;0.001). Group 1 had significant reductions in the viable counts of
      bacteria (CoCr and acrylic) and yeast (CoCr only) (p&lt;0.05), while only significant reductions
      in bacterial viable counts (CoCr and acrylic) (p&lt;0.05) were documented in Group 2. No
      significant differences were detected between groups 1 and 2 with regards to all clinical and
      microbiological outcomes. When comparing these parameters for CoCr and acrylic surfaces, no
      significant differences were observed following the intervention period. Conclusions: The
      ultrasonic cleaner was significantly more effective than the control in the reduction of
      biofilm coverage on metal framework removable partial dentures during the one month
      intervention period. The adjunctive use of cetylpyridinium chloride with ultrasonic cleaning
      did not yield improved outcomes compared to water.
