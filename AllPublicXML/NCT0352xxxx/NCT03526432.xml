  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single arm, Phase II study using the combination of atezolizumab and bevicacizumab
      in women with advanced, recurrent or persistent endometrial cancer. Safety and futility of
      this drug combination will be assessed to see what effect this treatment has on this patient
      population.

    <textblock>
      This phase 2 study using atezolizumab and bevacizumab aims to study the objective tumor
      response in women with recurrent endometrial cancer. Drugs will be administered via IV every
      21 days until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or loss of clinical benefit as
      determined by investigator. Subjects will receive routine cancer care as well as tests and
      procedures required for the purposes of this study. It is expected this combination will be
      produce an anti-cancer effect with manageable toxicities in this patient population.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Histologic or cytologic diagnosis of endometrial carcinoma (including endometrioid,
             serous, mixed adenocarcinoma, clear-cell carcinoma, or carcinosarcoma).

             relapsed or is refractory to curative therapy or established treatments.

          -  At least 1 prior platinum-based chemotherapeutic regimen, but not more than 2 prior
             chemotherapeutic regimens, for management of endometrial carcinoma.

          -  Measurable disease by RECIST 1.1, defined as at least 1 lesion that can be accurately
             measured in at least 1 dimension (longest diameter to be recorded).

          -  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 to 2

             administered more than 4 weeks earlier

          -  Treatment with systemic immunostimulatory agents (including, but not limited to,
             interferon [IFN]-alpha or interleukin [IL]-2) within 6 weeks or five half-lives of the
             drug (whichever is shorter) prior to cycle 1, day 1

          -  History of severe allergic, anaphylactic, or other hypersensitivity reactions to
             chimeric or humanized antibodies or fusion proteins, compounds similar to bevacizumab
             or atezolizumuab, or Chinese hamster ovary products.

          -  Major surgical procedure within 28 days prior to cycle 1, day 1 or anticipation of
             need for a major surgical procedure during the course of the study

          -  History of abdominal/pelvic fistula, gastrointestinal perforation and/or
