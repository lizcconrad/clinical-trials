  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Type 1 diabetes usually appears brutally in children or young adults. While many factors of
      poor glycemic balance have been identified in the literature (age, socio-cultural and
      socio-economic level, family structure, adherence etc.), it turns out that hypoglycemia is
      the most common acute complications. It would be an important physiological and psychological
      barrier for the patient and his parents to manage this diabetes, the latter seeking to keep
      the blood glucose levels above the objectives in order to avoid the occurrence of a
      hypoglycemia, especially nocturnal.

      If there is a questionnaire currently validated as a tool to measure the fear of hypoglycemia
      (HFS, Hypoglycemia Fear Survey is available in three versions: L'HFS-Child (HFS-C) for
      children over 6 years old, HFS-Parents of Young children ( HFS-PYC) for parents of young
      children (under 8 years of age) and HFS-Parents (HFS-P)) for parents of children over 8 years
      of age, on the other hand, there are no French and no French studies have evaluated the
      prevalence and impact of the fear of hypoglycemia in French patients with type 1 diabetes.

      It is therefore essential to use a reliable and valid tool to identify patients affected by
      the fear of hypoglycemia, which can be an obstacle to improve glycemic control and to an
      optimum quality of life. Having a tool in French and validated on the scientific level would
      allow to propose adapted therapeutic treatments (psychological follow-up, individual or
      collective sessions of therapeutic education, material assistance (sensor of blood glucose,
      pump with insulin stop...) In order to both improve metabolic balance while increasing the
      quality of life of patients by lowering secondary anxiety to hypoglycemia
