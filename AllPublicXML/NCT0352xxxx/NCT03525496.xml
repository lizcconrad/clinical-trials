  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Iodinated contrast agents (ICA) are widely used in medical imaging. They provide however a
      risk of immediate hypersensitivity reactions (IHS). The risk of anaphylactic shock is
      estimated at 1/100 000 injections. Nevertheless, for safety reasons and to limit undesirable
      effects, the reintroduction tests are not conducted along similar lines to throughout scan or
      arteriography. Moreover, reintroduction protocols are actually not standardized, in terms of
      injected volume and doses progression. It should be evaluated the relevance of the
      reintroduction tests with injection of a low volume and ensure the absence of reaction during
      the ICA injections Under real conditions.

      The investigators are assuming that the realization of a provocation test by intravenous
      reintroduction with a reduced dose of ICA improves the predictive value of IHS in comparison
      with only cutaneous tests.

      The main objective of this study will be to estimate the negative predictive value of the
      combination of cutaneous tests and provocation test by intravenous reintroduction in the IHS
      to iodinated contrast agents.
