  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research is to study a smoking cessation program for adult smokers in
      Northeast Ohio. The study will also look at how different people respond to the program.

      The study includes completing surveys and receiving text messages to help participants become
      tobacco free.

      OBJECTIVES Specific Aim 1: Translate a culturally specific video-based tobacco use
      intervention into a scalable mobile health (mhealth) format.

      Specific Aim 2: Conduct a pilot study of the video-text intervention.

      Study Design:

      2-arm semi-pragmatic randomized design among current tobacco users

      Cuyahoga Metropolitan Housing Authority residents will be randomly assigned to receive (1)
      the newly translated Path2Quit or (2) SmokeFreeText (NCI's publicly available, standard text
      messaging program) combined with brief behavioral counseling session plus 2 weeks of nicotine
      replacement therapy (NRT). Primary outcomes will include intervention evaluations (content
      and format), acceptability, coping strategies, engagement, and NRT adherence. Secondary
      variables will include 24-hour quit attempts and biochemically verified tobacco use
      abstinence at the 1-month follow-up. Exploratory mediational analyses will examine the roles
      of urban hassles, acculturation, neighborhood environment, ethnic discrimination, and
      psychological distress in intervention effects.

    <intervention_name>SmokeFreeText</intervention_name>
    <description>SmokefreeTXT is a 6-8 week fully automated text-based cessation intervention. The program is free to U.S. subscribers who have a mobile phone, and is available on smokefree.gov or by texting &quot;QUIT&quot; to short code 47848. Participants are encouraged to set a quit date within the next 14 days, followed by count-down messages leading to the quit date. Starting on the quit date, participants receive 6 weeks of intervention text messages, and assessment questions (mood, cravings, smoking status). The message library contains 166 messages and 41 behavior change techniques,40 which are delivered at the greatest frequency during the first 2 weeks and taper over time. When in need of assistance, participants can text one of 3 keywords (MOOD, CRAVE, or SLIP) to receive a relevant message from the system. Participants can opt-out by texting STOP at any time. With informed consent, we will be able to access the SmokefreeTXT data for these participants.</description>

    <intervention_name>Path2Quit</intervention_name>
    <description>Path2Quit will deliver 20-60 second video clips by multimedia messaging service. The message library will include 75-170 messages. Written text messages will be limited to brief phrases to indicate the topic of the video. Messages will be pushed to participants in the morning, in the afternoon, and 2 hours before the reported usual bedtime. The cultural adaptations will be infused throughout the video segments. Topics include deep structure: race and smoking in general, African American smoking statistics; norms for smoking; concerns about nicotine replacement/medication; family/collectivism; unique stressors; racism/discrimination, depression; co-morbid addiction; neighborhood/environmental influences; menthol cigarettes; race-specific weight issues and concerns; and working as a community against the tobacco industry.</description>
