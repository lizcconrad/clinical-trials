  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well intensity-modulated radiotherapy and nivolumab work
      together in treating participants with head and neck squamous cell cancer that has come back.
      Intensity-modulation radiation therapy uses varying intensities of radiation beams to kill
      cancer cells and shrink tumors, thereby reducing the damage to nearby healthy tissue.
      Monoclonal antibodies, such as nivolumab, may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to
      grow and spread. Giving intensity-modulated radiation therapy and nivolumab may work better
      at treating head and neck squamous cell cancer.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. To assess the 1-year progression-free survival (PFS) for patients with recurrent or second
      primary head and neck squamous cancer treated with intensity-modulated radiation therapy
      (IMRT) re-irradiation with concurrent and adjuvant nivolumab.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Evaluate the 1-year (yr) overall survival (OS) of patients treated with re-irradiation and
      nivolumab.

      II. Evaluate patient quality of life (QOL).

      III. Evaluate patterns of failure including local, regional and distant failure rates at 1
      yr.

      IV. Identify and estimate the incidence rate of acute and late toxicities associated with
      combined re-irradiation and concurrent and adjuvant nivolumab.

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. To identify potential biomarkers related to clinical benefit to concurrent and adjuvant
      nivolumab and re-irradiation in patients with recurrent or second primary (RSP) head and neck
      squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC).

      OUTLINE:

      Participants receive nivolumab intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on weeks -2, 0, 2, 4, and 6
      and undergo IMRT once daily beginning on week 0 for up to 6-6.5 weeks. Beginning week 10,
      participants receive nivolumab IV over 30 minutes every 4 weeks for up to 10 courses in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, participants are followed up for 2 years from the
      beginning of radiation therapy.
