  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hydrosalpinx (HX) has a detrimental effect on the rates of implantation, pregnancy, live
      delivery, and early pregnancy loss during in vitro fertilization (IVF). The effectiveness of
      radiological tubal blockage has not been compared with the standard treatment of laparoscopic
      salpingectomy in randomized trials. The investigators aim in this randomized trial to compare
      the live birth rate of radiological tubal blockage versus laparoscopic salpingectomy in
      infertility women with HX prior to frozen-thawed embryo transfer (FET). Eligible women will
      be recruited and randomized into one of the following two groups: (1) the radiological tubal
      blockage group and (2) the laparoscopic salpingectomy group. The primary outcome is the live
      birth rate.

    <description>In radiological tubal blockage group, under the fluoroscopy of X-ray, after confirming HX by HSG, selective catheterization will be done for the affected tube and micro spring coils will be put in to the interstitial tube and isthmus through micro catheter. The micro spring coil will be placed into the proximal end of the Fallopian tube (unilateral or bilateral depending on whether one or two HX were present) through micro catheter under the fluoroscopy of X-ray. Then HSG will be carried out to check the position of the micro spring coil and confirm complete blockage. Four weeks after the radiological procedure, a HSG will be performed to recheck the position of the micro spring coil and complete blockage of the tubes. FET is proceeded in the next menstrual cycle after HSG examination.</description>

    <description>In the laparoscopic salpingectomy group, after confirming HX, a unilateral or bilateral salpingectomy will be performed in a standard manner, depending on whether unilateral or bilateral HX are present. In women with extensive pelvic adhesions during laparoscopy, proximal tubal ligation will be performed as an alternative procedure to salpingectomy. FET is proceeded in the next menstrual cycle after the laparoscopic operation.</description>
