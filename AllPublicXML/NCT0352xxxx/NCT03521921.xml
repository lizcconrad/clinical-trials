  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The current state of the art management of severe mitral regurgitation is surgical mitral
      valve repair, either with open chest surgery or mini-thoracotomy. However, standard surgical
      approaches requiring cardiopulmonary bypass are suitable for patients with low or moderate
      surgical risk, thus many patients are denied surgery because of unfavorable risk-benefit
      balance. The EuroHeart Surveyconducted by the ESC showed that one half of patients with
      severe mitral regurgitation were denied surgical treatment because they were felt to be at
      too high risk for surgery by the referring physician. Such patients are usually elderly and
      have co-morbidities. Thus, there is a need for novel devices enabling interventional
      cardiologists and cardiothoracic surgeons to perform mitral repair in a minimally-invasive
      fashion and possibly without cardiopulmonary bypass. The landmark EVEREST II trial randomized
      279 patients with grade 3/4 MR in a 2:1 fashion to MitraClip® or surgical repair/replacement
      showing a lower major adverse event rate at 30-days in the MitraClip® group (15.0% vs. 48%;
      superiority p&lt;0.001), mainly driven by the need for blood transfusion with surgery, and the
      primary efficacy endpoint of freedom from the combined outcome of death, new surgery for
      mitral valve dysfunction or the occurrence of &gt;2+ MR was achieved in 55% vs. 73%
      (non-inferiority p=0.007). However, this study has included a highly selected patient cohort
      in which patients with significant surgical risk have been excluded. More recently,
      Multinational (ACCESS-EU, EVEREST-High Risk) and national registries (TRAMI, SWISS) have
      shown safety and efficacy in the real world experience. Patients currently treated are high
      risk, elderly, with comorbidities and mainly affected by FMR. There is need for an Italian
      registry, since Italy has produced the second largest volume of transcathetermitral
      procedures in the world after Germany. The present registry is designed to collect real world
      clinical data on early and long-term outcomes following percutaneous mitral regurgitation
      therapy in consecutive patients undergoing transcatheter procedures in Hospitals linked to
      the GISE database.

      The main objective is to achieve demographic and outcome data and identify predictors of
      clinical success, according to real-world Italian data. In addition the registry is designed
      to obtain health economic data to support reimbursement strategies in Italy. The study is
      focusing on MITRACLIP therapy since this is the leading method for treatment currently in
      Italy.

      All consecutive patients undergone/ undergoing a transcatheter mitral valve repair, with
      Mitraclip device, will be enrolled to reach a number of about 1100 patients in about 22
      hospitals. Data analysis will be conducted at the end of follow-up period of the last
      enrolled patient. . Additional data analysis will be done according to specific topics,
      approved by the scientific board of GISE and or on Ethic Committees requests. The population
      of the study is patients undergoing/undergone a transcatheter mitral valve repair procedure
      in hospitals linked to the GISE network. More specifically Patients from the investigators'
      general Mitraclip treatment patient population will be eligible to be enrolled in this
      Registry. Patients should meet all the inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria.
      Retrospective enrolments are allowed if available data are in line with the Study
      requirements and the patients can give their consent to be enrolled in the study informed
      consent process.

      Follow-up visit will be performed at 30 days, 1 year and up to 5 years after the procedure.
