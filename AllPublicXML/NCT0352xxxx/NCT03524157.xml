      ophthalmic solution PRO-087 versus Xyel Ofteno® and Systane Ultra®, on the ocular surface of
      ophthalmological and clinically healthy subjects.

      Objective: To evaluate the safety and tolerability of the preservative-free formulation

      the quantitative variables. The qualitative variables will be presented in frequencies and
      percentages. The statistical analysis will be carried out through the Kruskal-Wallis test for
      quantitative variables. The difference between the qualitative variables will be analyzed by
      means of chi square (Chi2). An alpha ≤ 0.05 will be considered significant.

    <masking>Triple (Participant, Investigator, Outcomes Assessor)</masking>
    <masking_description>Blinding It will consist in the elimination of the primary label (commercial) in the case of Xyel Ofteno® and Systane Ultra® and the placement of a label identical to the other interventions. Because the bottle in which Systane Ultra® is packaged differs in the color and shape of the lid used by Xyel Ofteno® and PRO-087, a masking will be carried out on the primary packaging which will be identical for the three interventions.The allocation sequence will be generated by personnel assigned. The research center will receive a set of envelopes which will contain the intervention number individually. The envelopes will be identical on the outside. Each of these envelopes will be shown to the participants for their election by the principal investigator or by a designated member of their team.
The blinding will correspond to the research subject and the principal investigator. In addition, the statistical analysis will be carried out in a blinded manner for the all analysis.</masking_description>
