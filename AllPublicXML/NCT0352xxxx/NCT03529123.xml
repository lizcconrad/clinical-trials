      Primary Objective:

      To demonstrate the superiority of the insulin glargine/lixisenatide fixed ratio combination
      (FRC) to insulin glargine by demonstrating change in glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c).

      Secondary Objectives:

        -  To assess the effects of the FRC in comparison with insulin glargine on:

        -  Percentage of patients reaching HbA1c targets (&lt;7% );

        -  Glycemic control in relation to a meal as evaluated by 2-hour Post-prandial Plasma
           Glucose; (PPG);

        -  Body weight

        -  Fasting Plasma Glucose (FPG);

        -  Percentage of patients reaching HbA1c targets of &lt;7% with no body weight gain and no
           hypoglycemia (as defined in the evaluation criteria);

        -  7-point Self-Monitoring Plasma Glucose (SMPG) profile;

        -  Insulin glargine dose.

        -  To assess the safety and tolerability in each treatment group.

          -  Age should be ≥ 18 years of age to &lt; 65 years;

          -  Glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) at screening visit ≥ 7.5% or ≤ 10%;

          -  Patients who have been treated with a basal insulin for at least 6 months before the
             screening visit, and who have been on a stable basal insulin regimen (ie, type of
             insulin and time/frequency of the injection), for at least 3 months before the
             screening visit. The stable total daily dose should be within the range of 15-40 U,
             both inclusive, on the day of screening, but individual fluctuations of ± 20% within 2
             months prior to screening are acceptable.

        Exclusion criteria:

          -  Use of oral or injectable glucose-lowering agents other than those stated in the
             inclusion criteria in the 3 months before screening.

          -  Previous use of insulin regimen other than basal insulin eg, prandial or pre-mixed
             insulin (Note: Short term treatment due to intercurrent illness including gestational
             diabetes is allowed at the discretion of the investigator).

          -  For patients taking metformin, any contraindication to metformin use, according to
             local labeling.

          -  For patient not treated with metformin at screening: severe renal function impairment

          -  Personal or immediate family history of medullary thyroid cancer (MTC) or genetic
             condition that predisposes to MTC (eg, multiple endocrine neoplasia syndromes).

          -  Clinically relevant history of gastrointestinal disease associated with prolonged
             nausea and vomiting, including (but not limited to): gastroparesis, unstable (ie,
             worsening) or not controlled (ie, prolonged nausea and vomiting) gastroesophageal
             reflux disease requiring medical treatment, within 6 months prior to the time of
             screening visit; or history of surgery affecting gastric emptying.

          -  History of pancreatitis (unless pancreatitis was related to gallstones and
             cholecystectomy has been performed), pancreatitis during previous treatment with
             incretin therapies, chronic pancreatitis, pancreatectomy.

          -  Average insulin glargine daily dose &lt;20 U or &gt;50 U calculated for the last 3 days
             before Visit 6.
