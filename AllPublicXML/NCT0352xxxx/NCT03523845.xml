    <textblock>
      A case-control study was performed was performed following the STROBE statement from 1996 to
      2016 including patients who were diagnosed with early apical peri-implantitis. Data were
      collected at the time of implant placement, and once the patients developed signs and
      symptoms consistent with early apical peri-implantitis, to determine the frequency and
      etiology of this pathology.

      A case-control study was performed following the STROBE statement (17) at the Oral Surgery
      Department, Faculty of Medicine and Dentistry (University of Valencia, Spain) from 1996 to
      2016, in which patients with early peri-implantitis diagnosed were included (Figure 1). All
      patients were informed about the study design and procedures. Prior to participating, they
      were requested to sign an informed consent document. The study design was approved by the
      Ethical Committee of the University of Valencia (H1478255958653).

      Two groups were established: Test group (patients diagnosed with early apical
      peri-implantitis diagnosed) and Control group (patients whose implants had not developed any
      inflammatory/infectious process and were osseointegrated).

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  The following inclusion criteria were applied: patients ≥18 years old and controlled
             medical conditions who received treatment with implants. Additionally, for the test
             group, inclusion criteria were: symptoms and signs suggesting early apical
             peri-implantitis after implant placement; absence of implant mobility; dull percussion
             of nonsurmerged implants; presence or absence of radiolucency apically.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  for the both groups: implants placed with guided bone regeneration or inadequate
             follow-up for failing to maintenance visits.
