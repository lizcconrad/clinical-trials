  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Atrial Fibrillation(AF) is one of the most common abnormal heart rhythms and approximately 3%
      of the general population have AF. The prevalence increases with age of the population and is
      increased in people with diabetes, hypertension and those who are overweight. AF is a major
      risk factor for stroke; people with AF are five times more likely to suffer an ischaemic
      stroke; however this can be reduced significantly with appropriate interventions which
      depends on detection of the abnormal rhythm. Although the National Institute of Health and
      Care Excellence (NICE) currently recommends screening patients with symptoms of AF, including
      syncope, heart palpitations, and chest discomfort, as well as patients who have suffered a
      stroke or heart attack, many patients remain symptomless and are not managed for their
      increased stroke risk. Guidelines for AF screening include manual palpation of a peripheral
      pulse, followed up by an ECG for patients who have an irregular pulse. Although almost all
      patients with AF have an irregular pulse, only about 12 in 100 patients with an irregular
      pulse have AF. Use of an improved screening tool for AF could both cut down the number of
      people undergoing unnecessary ECGs, and also lead the way for a wider screening programme for
      AF. The aim of this study is to investigate the sensitivity and specificity of a new ECG like
      device for the detection of AF, the Plessey imPulse. Participants referred or admitted to
      secondary care with stroke symptoms and other indicators of increased prevalence of AF will
      be recruited. Participants will undergo three methods of AF screening, a peripheral pulse, a
      lead-one like ECG using the imPulse device, and the gold-standard for AF detection, a 12-lead
      ECG. By comparing to the ECG results specificity and sensitivity will be established for both
      methods in this population.

    <description>The primary aim of this study is to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of the Plessey imPulse lead-I ECG like device for detecting AF.
Objectives:
Assess sensitivity
Assess specificity
Assess positive predictive value
Assess negative predictive value In addition to providing estimates of diagnostic performance of the impulse device, the results of this study are intended to inform the trajectory to undertake a follow up study to confirm diagnostic performance in primary care practice setting and its acceptability and clinical utility.</description>

        Patients referred to secondary care to investigate stroke symptoms at the Stroke Clinic
        will be the primary target for recruitment. However, to enrich the sample with more
        confirmed AF patients, admitted secondary care patients will also be recruited. Once the
        sensitivity and specificity has been established in this AF enriched cohort a larger study
        (in the primary care setting) is planned.
