  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, multicenter, dose-escalation phase I study to assess the safety,
      tolerability and preliminary efficacy of KN046 in participants with all advanced solid tumors
      who are not able to have current standard anti-tumor therapies. The purpose of this study is
      to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) or a biological effective dose (BED), to
      characterise the safety, pharmacokinetics (PK), immunogenicity, pharmacodynamics (PD) and
      anti-tumor activity of KN046 as a single agent in adult participants with advanced solid
      tumors
