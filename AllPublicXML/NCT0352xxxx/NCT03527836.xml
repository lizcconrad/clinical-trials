  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The doses of local anesthetics can be decreased with the use of ultrasound guidance. In case
      of using mixture solutions the benefits and drawbacks are controversial. The plasma
      concentrations were not studied up to this time in this kind of settings, so investigators
      believe that this is the first work that shows how lidocaine change the plasma concentration
      of bupivacaine after axillary approach to brachial plexus employed with different dilute and
      mixed solutions for upper limb surgery in trauma patients.

      Total of 30 American Society of Anesthesiologist (ASA) I-III adult patients scheduled to
      elective or emergency trauma surgery of hand and forearm under ultrasound-guided (UG)
      brachial plexus block (BPB) are planned to be assigned into this randomized-prospective
      observational study after approval by the University Research Ethics Board, Pécs University
      Medical School, Hungary. All of the patients will receive detailed information about the
      planned BPB techniques and surgeries, then written informed consents will be obtained.

      Study participants are planned to be assigned randomly by the research coordinator into 3
      groups (Lidocaine, Bupivacaine and mixture solution) according to the concentration of
      lidocaine and bupivacaine in the mixture solution.

      Standardized UG Axillary-supraclavicular (AX-SC) approach to the BP is planned to be
      performed under sterile conditions by the same anesthesiologist. The standardized dose is 0.4
      ml/kg with the targeted maximized the single-shot volume of 30 ml.

      Blood samples will be taken at 0-time point (straight after the administration of BP
      injection) and 30, 60, 240 and 480 minutes after. Plasma concentrations are determined, the
      results are collected and analyzed.

      Under standard monitorization, vital parameters, data are collected on the onset time and
      duration of actions of local anesthetics (LAs).
