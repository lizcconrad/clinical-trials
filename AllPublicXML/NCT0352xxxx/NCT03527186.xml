    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, one sequence study to evaluate the steady-state comparative
      bioavailability of 100 mg Risperidone ISM® injectable every 4 weeks compared to once daily 4
      mg oral risperidone in subjects with schizophrenia stabilized on oral risperidone treatment.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, 1-sequence study in subjects who are on stable oral risperidone
      treatment. The study consists of a screening visit, 1 treatment period with inpatient and
      outpatient visits, and a follow-up visit.

      Subjects who are on existing oral risperidone treatment (4 mg) will continue the oral regimen
      for 1 week to achieve steady-state concentrations of risperidone. Following the oral
      risperidone treatment, a single intramuscular (IM) dose of 100 mg risperidone ISM® will be
      administered deeply into the gluteal muscle. A total of 4 IM doses will be given that will be
      separated by 4 weeks.

      Safety assessments and pharmacokinetic (PK) sampling will be performed on each dosing day and
      each outpatient visit. A final follow-up visit will take place to assess each subject for
      safety and to obtain PK samples.

      Approximately 58 subjects will be enrolled, with the intent to complete 41 subjects.
      Fifty-eight subjects were estimated for enrollment based on 41 completers assuming an
      approximate drop-out rate of 30%.

      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the steady-state comparative
      bioavailability of 100 mg risperidone ISM® injectable every 4 weeks compared to once daily 4
      mg oral risperidone in subjects with schizophrenia stabilized on oral risperidone treatment.

      The secondary objective of this study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of 100 mg
      risperidone ISM® injectable every 4 weeks compared to once daily 4 mg oral risperidone in
      subjects with schizophrenia stabilized on oral risperidone treatment.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Subjects will be considered eligible to participate in this study if each one of the
        following inclusion criteria is satisfied at screening (or at baseline when specified):

          1. Male or female aged ≥18 and &lt;65 years with a body mass index (BMI) of ≥17 kg/m2 but
             ≤35 kg/m2

          2. Current diagnosis of schizophrenia, according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual
             of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5) criteria

          3. Outpatient; not hospitalized for worsening of schizophrenia within the last 3 months
             (hospitalization for social management within this time period is acceptable)

          4. Medically stable over the last month and psychiatrically stable without significant
             symptom exacerbation over the last 3 months based on the investigator's judgement

          5. On oral risperidone 4 mg daily as maintenance therapy for at least the last 4 weeks
             prior to screening and on 4 mg oral risperidone once daily (QD) for at least one week
             prior baseline (Day1, Visit 2)

          6. Agrees to taper off all prohibited medications prior to baseline

          7. On a stable dosage of all permitted medications (with the exception of medication to
             be used on an as-needed basis) for at least 2 weeks prior to the baseline visit and
             for the duration of the study

          8. Clinical Global Impression - Severity (CGI-S) score of ≤4 (moderately ill)

          9. A female subject of childbearing potential who is sexually active and using a
             medically accepted contraceptive method. Acceptable methods include condoms (male or
             female) with or without spermicidal agent, diaphragm or cervical cap with spermicide,
             medically prescribed intrauterine device, and hormonal contraceptives. A female
             subject of childbearing potential who is not currently sexually active must agree that
             should she be so while participating in the trial, she will use a medically accepted
             method of contraception for the remainder of the study and for 1 month afterward.
             Female patients who have had a hysterectomy, bilateral tubal ligation, or bilateral
             salpingooophorectomy are considered surgically sterile and are thus are exempt from
             the requirement to use contraception. Female patients who are postmenopausal are
             considered not of childbearing potential and thus exempt from the contraception
             requirement; for the purpose of this study, postmenopausal is defined as the permanent
             cessation of menstruation for at least 12 months prior to screening in women ≥ 45
             years of age.

         10. Female subjects must have a negative pregnancy test at screening (serum test) and
             baseline (urine test)

         11. Psychotherapy should not be started or changed during a patient's participation in the
             study. It is acceptable for a patient already receiving psychotherapy to participate
             in the study

         12. Able to speak, read, and understand sufficiently to allow completion of all study
             assessments

         13. Must provide written informed consent prior to the initiation of any protocol-specific
             procedures

        Subjects will not be considered eligible to participate in this study if any one of the
        following exclusion criteria is satisfied at screening (or at baseline when specified):

          1. Presence of an uncontrolled, unstable, clinically significant medical condition (eg,
             renal, endocrine, hepatic, respiratory, cardiovascular, hematologic, immunologic or
             cerebrovascular disease, or malignancy) that in the opinion of the investigator could
             have interfered with the interpretation of safety and PK evaluations

          2. Presence of a clinically significant vital sign or physical examination finding that
             in the opinion of the investigator could potentially interfere with the ability to
             evaluate safety and tolerability of the trial medication or could impair the subject's
             ability to complete the trial

          3. Presence of a clinically significant abnormality on blood or urine safety tests, which
             do not improve on retesting. In particular, laboratory and/or clinical evidence of
             clinically significant hepatic conditions, such as:

               -  alanine aminotransferase (ALT) or aspartate aminotransferase (AST) &gt; 3 × upper
                  limit of normal (ULN) and total bilirubin &gt; 2 × ULN; or

               -  ALT or AST &gt; 3 × ULN with the appearance of jaundice, worsening of fatigue,

             Individuals who have positive results for alcohol, cannabis, or other psychotropic
             substances but are not dependent on or abusing these substances may be included at the
