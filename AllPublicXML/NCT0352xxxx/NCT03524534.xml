  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a pragmatic randomized clinical trial to determine the effectiveness of two
      strategies of early follow-up in adults after hospitalization for heart failure: telephone
      follow-up with a heart failure care manager vs. in-person clinic visit with their primary
      care provider. The primary outcomes during 30-day follow-up will include readmission for
      heart failure, death and readmission for any cause. The study team will randomly assign 2400
      patients during a 15-month period in a 1-to-1 ratio to either an initial structured telephone
      call with a heart failure care manager or an in-person primary care clinic visit within 7
      days of discharge. A secondary goal is to increase the rate of any follow-up within 7 days of
      discharge to greater than 90 percent among all eligible patients.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Heart failure (HF) affects &gt;5 million adults nationally and is the leading cause of
      hospitalization among Medicare beneficiaries. Reducing hospitalization for heart failure (HF)
      and subsequent readmissions shortly after discharge is a nationally recognized health care
      delivery system priority. More than 20% of Medicare patients hospitalized for HF are
      readmitted within 30 days and this rate has not been declining over the past decade despite
      increasing attention to this problem. The data that will be collected could allow the study
      team to tailor the post-discharge follow-up program to patient characteristics to further
      improve the effectiveness of the interventions.
