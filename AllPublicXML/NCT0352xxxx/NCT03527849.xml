    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to see if stress reduction can lead to less pain due to knee
      osteoarthritis. To do this the investigators will compare two types of stress reduction
      modalities, Mindfulness-Based Stressed Reduction (MBSR) and a Health Enhancement Program
      (HEP). Both include stress reduction techniques, but MBSR has a mindfulness component that
      includes meditation. MBSR will be provided either in-person or online and HEP will be
      in-person. The assignment to the stress reduction program will be determined by the Principal
      Investigator. In order to assess for stress reduction and pain reduction the investigators
      will use validated measuring tools before, during, and after the course instructions.

    <textblock>
      The current study is aiming to compare two stress reduction programs in order to see if
      stress reduction may lead to less pain due to knee osteoarthritis (OA). There are two stress
      reduction programs being compared, Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) and a Health
      Enhancement Program (HEP). MBSR is a secular program that trains mindfulness meditation for
      stress reduction and to increase emotional regulation skills. It is defined as &quot;paying
      attention in a particular way, on purpose, in the present moment, and non-judgmentally.&quot;
      Mindfulness refers to a set of meditation practices that develop a wide array of cognitive
      skills which include: attention regulation, response inhibition, and emotion regulation. HEP
      is an educational course intended to teach participants about their disease, factors
      influencing disease progression, nutrition, physical activity including walking and
      stretching, and functional movement. Key difference between these two is MBSR includes the
      mindfulness component, and MBSR will be taught either in-person or online. HEP will only
      consist of an in-person course.

      The online MBSR course will be offered through:
      http://www.breathworks-mindfulness.org.uk/mindfulness-for-health. The investigators propose
      to use an active control training, the Health Enhancement Program (HEP), an intervention
      designed to isolate mindfulness as a testable active ingredient.

      The duration of an individual subject's participation in the study will be at least 10 weeks
      starting from the screening visit all the way to the follow-up visit.

      The in-person MBSR course consists of 8 weekly classes plus one all-day class between Weeks 6
      and 7, and is sequential. Depending on when a participant is consented, they may have to wait
      until a new 8-week course is available in order to begin. The HEP course also consists of 8
      weekly classes and will start when a group of 7-10 participants have been assigned to the HEP
      intervention. The online MBSR course is designed to last 8 weeks and can be started at any
      time.

      Since initiation of the in-person MBSR or HEP courses will depend upon when subjects are
      enrolled, it is not possible to provide the maximum length of time for a subject's
      participation. However long the subject's participation, they are only expected to complete 2
      in-clinic visits and 8 weeks of class (plus 1 all-day class for MBSR).

      Weekly classes are 2.5 hours with the one-day retreat lasting from 10am to 5pm on a weekend
      day. The online MBSR course is roughly 20 minutes per day for 6-7 days of the week for 8
      weeks.

      HEP and MBSR are structurally equivalent, both using a group format that meets once a week
      for 2.5 hours for 8 weeks, plus home participation, but the in-person MBSR includes an &quot;all
      day&quot; component after week 6. The content of the HEP intervention meets the following
      criteria: (1) class activities match MBSR activities as closely as possible, (2) activities
      represent valid, active, therapeutic ingredients in their own right, and (3) these
      ingredients do not include mindfulness.

      All participants will be assigned into one of the three courses by the Principal
      Investigator. Prior to the initial class of the participants' respective course, blood and
      saliva samples will be collected, within two weeks of the final class participants will
      return to collect the second set of blood and saliva samples. These collections prior and
      after treatment will be at the clinic, visits to the clinic may last from 1 to 2 hours.

    <masking_description>The study will be structured as a parallel-group controlled trial. The Principal Investigator will assign participants into the three groups. This will allow for equalization of distribution of participants across the three groups. It will not be possible to blind the participants to which arm of the trial they are participating in, as the content or lack thereof of their activities will be obvious to them. For results analysis, collaborators at the UCD West Coast Metabolomics Center will be blinded to the treatment of the respective samples, thus eliminating potential bias during analysis.</masking_description>

It is answered using a 1-5 scale (1=never or very rarely true, 2=rarely true, 3=sometimes true, 4=often true, 5=very often or always true). Answered prior to receiving treatment, half-way through treatment completion, and post-treatment.</description>

    <description>A self-reported questionnaire used to quantify an individual's pain experience through a series of questions asking about the individual's feelings and thoughts about when they are in pain.
Answered in a scale of 0-4 (0=not at all, 1=to a slight degree, 2=to a moderate degree, 3=to a great degree, 4=all the time). Answered prior to receiving treatment, half-way through treatment completion, and post-treatment.</description>

    <measure>Change in Salivary and Plasma Cortisol Levels</measure>
    <time_frame>At First Clinical Visit (Baseline Week 1) and at Second Clinical Visit (Post-Treatment Week 10)</time_frame>
    <description>Cortisol is a hormone the human body releases in times of stress. Because the investigators are aiming to reduce stress the investigative team will be collecting blood (4mL RED-top Vacutainer tube) and 3 mL of saliva prior to beginning treatment (respective stress reduction course) and after the course is completed to assess if there were changes in cortisol levels. Cortisol can be measured both in saliva and in the blood, the investigators' aim is to also compare the values between saliva and blood cortisol levels.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Cytokine and Oxylipin Plasma Levels</measure>
    <time_frame>At First Clinical Visit (Baseline Week 1) and at Second Clinical Visit (Post-Treatment Week 10)</time_frame>
    <description>Oxylipin inflammation markers will be measured from plasma processed from collected blood at the first and second clinical visits. There are usually 84 markers and are positively detected and quantified even in healthy individuals using 150uL of plasma. The investigative team expects there to be higher concentrations of these markers in elderly subjects with OA pain, furthermore, the investigators expect differences in concentrations of these markers for the different treatments. Cytokines are markers secreted by cells that help direct cell function during an immune response. The investigators will collect blood and process serum for analysis to measure and track changes in cytokine levels responsible for inflammation. The blood will be collected at the first clinical visit and the second clinical visit.</description>
