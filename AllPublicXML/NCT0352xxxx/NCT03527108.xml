      Cohort A in this study will enroll Immuno-oncology (IO) naïve patients who have progressed on
      previous chemotherapy or targeted therapies. The subjects will be randomized 2:1(combination:
      nivolumab monotherapy), with primary endpoint of 6-months PFS.

      Cohort B will enroll patients with prior IO therapy (alone or in combination with
      chemotherapy or in combination with other IO agents), into a non-randomized combination
      trial, with primary endpoint of disease control rate.

             treating physician. A washout period of at least 2 weeks is required prior to starting
             on this trial.

          4. Patients with molecular targets (EGFR, ALK, ROS1) who have progressed on targeted
             agents and are not eligible for other treatments or trials specific for this

             days) of oral anticoagulant or low molecular weight heparin (LMWH). If receiving
             warfarin, the patient must have an INR ≤3.0. For heparin and LMWH there should be no
             active bleeding (that is, no bleeding within 14 days prior to first dose of protocol

             effective method of contraception - Contraception, for the course of the study through
             150 days after the last dose of study medication.

         14. Male patients who have women of child bearing potential (WOCBP) partners must agree to
             use effective method of contraception - Contraception, for the course of the study
             through 210 days after the last dose of study medication.
