      Cohort A in this study will enroll Immuno-oncology (IO) na√Øve patients who have progressed on
      previous chemotherapy or targeted therapies. The subjects will be randomized 2:1(combination:
      nivolumab monotherapy), with primary endpoint of 6-months PFS.

      Cohort B will enroll patients with prior IO therapy (alone or in combination with
      chemotherapy or in combination with other IO agents), into a non-randomized combination
      trial, with primary endpoint of disease control rate.

             treating physician. A washout period of at least 2 weeks is required prior to starting
             on this trial.

          4. Patients with molecular targets (EGFR, ALK, ROS1) who have progressed on targeted
