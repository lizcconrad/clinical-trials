    <textblock>
      This study is being done to test whether receiving a dose of radiation that is higher than
      the standard dose, in combination with chemotherapy, improves the chance of becoming a
      candidate for surgery and improves the chance of extending the patient's life.

          -  Locally advanced, unresectable pancreatic cancer defined on post-induction
             chemotherapy CT as having tumor involvement of &gt;180° (&gt; 50%) of the circumference of

                  patients with creatinine levels above institutional normal

          -  Any systemic therapy associated toxicity should be Grade 1 or less

          -  Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document.

          -  Patients who have had prior abdominal radiotherapy.

          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active
