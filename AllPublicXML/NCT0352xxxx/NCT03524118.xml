  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and
      incidence of anti-drug antibodies (ADAs) of single ascending doses of MK-1654 in healthy
      pre-term (born at 29 to 35 weeks gestational age) and full-term (born at &gt;35 weeks
      gestational age) infants. Key safety and tolerability variables will be reviewed after each
      panel prior to administering the next-highest dose.
