  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is to evaluate 24-week efficacy and 52 week immunogenicity of subcutaneous Eporon
      versus Epoetin Alfa (Eprex) in the treatment of anemia associated with chronic renal failure
      in pre-dialysis patients. A total of 214 patients will be enrolled in Turkey.

    <description>The primary endpoint is the mean absolute change in Hb levels between the screening/baseline period (Week -2 to Day 1 of Week 1) and the evaluation period (Week 21 to Week 24).
Hb level at screening/baseline period is defined as the mean of the Hb measurements at screening and on Day 1 of Week 1 (prior to dosing). Hb level at evaluation period is defined as the mean of the Hb measurements at Week 21, 22, 23, and 24 (in detail, Day 1 of Week 21, Day 1 of Week 22, Day 1 of Week 23, and Day 1 of Week 24).</description>

Maintenance Phase (Week 5 to Week 24) The dose will be adjusted to maintain Hb levels between 10 and 12 g/dL.
&lt;Part 2 Treatment Period&gt; : Week 25 to Week 52 The dose of Erythropoietin Alpha will be adjusted to maintain hemoglobin levels between 10 and 12 g/dL as subcutaneous administration in accordance with the given dosing algorithm.
