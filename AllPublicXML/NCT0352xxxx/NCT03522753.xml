  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to determine if staples or sutures are better for the closure of
      uncomplicated foot and ankle surgeries. Currently, most surgeons base their choice for
      closure on previous teaching from a mentor during fellowship or personal experience. There is
      no standard of care for closure material on hand surgeries to date. This study will
      prospectively randomize patients to have either staple or suture wound closure if they have a
      short incision. In surgeries with longer incisions (i.e. 5+ cm), or multiple incisions on
      similar sites (i.e. bilateral operations, multiple toes), patients will have half sutures and
      half staple closure. The three primary measured outcomes will be: pain upon suture/staple
      removal, time to place and remove sutures vs. staples, and scar formation.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The material used for closure of surgical incision is often considered &quot;dealer's choice&quot; and
      usually is chosen from one (or a combination) of the following techniques: subcutaneous
      absorbable sutures, interrupted simple/mattress dermal sutures, or dermal staples. Factors
      that are typically taken into consideration include anatomic location, amount of tension
      involved in closure, shape of the incision and integrity of the skin involved in the closure,
      need for cosmesis, and surgeon comfort/past experience with different closure techniques.

      Previous randomized controlled trials, as well as meta-analyses, have analyzed sutures versus
      staples in orthopaedic surgeries, but often exclude foot and ankle surgeries as incisions are
      typically small and require more delicate closures. In RCTs involving other areas of the
      body, staples have been found to result in less wound infection and less time to
      insert/remove compared to sutures. They were also comparable to sutures in cosmetic result
      and patient satisfaction. These results are not known for surgeries of the foot and ankle.

      Both sutures and staples are routinely used during a typical foot and ankle surgery, without
      significant risk of wound dehiscence or complications.

    <masking_description>The resident/fellow performing closure will know what has been done for their patient, but blinded to other participants. Splints or other dressings will cover the closure. Patients will be physically &quot;blinded&quot; (i.e. eye cover) during the removal procedure. Patients and observers will assess scar appearance. &quot;Observers&quot; are the blinded surgeon or other blinded medical personnel (nurse, research assistant, CRNP, or resident/fellow who was not involved).</masking_description>

    <description>Modified Patient and Observer Scar Assessment Scale (POSAS) Questionnaire. This questionnaire rates scar formation using two total scores, each between 6-60 points (lower score is better), one completed by the patient (patient scale) and one by an observer (observer scale). The total score for each scale is the sum of 6 equally weighted questionnaire items (each scoring 1-10 points; lower score is better). In addition, both patient and observer give overall opinion of scarring, on a 1-10 scale; lower score is better. Overall opinions reported separately from total scores.</description>

    <description>Some patients will receive both nylon sutures and metal skin staples for superficial closure. If multiple incisions are involved, each incision will count as 1 in the alternation method (i.e. toe 1 will be all sutures, then toe 2 will be all staples). For long incisions, closure will alternate between nylon sutures and metal skin staples on the part of the incision which is closer (more proximal) or farther away (more distal) from the rest of the body.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Over 18 years of age

          -  Scheduled to undergo any elective foot or ankle procedures with one of our included
             surgeons investigators during the approved protocol period.

          -  Patients with comorbidities such as rheumatoid arthritis, diabetes, and other systemic
             diseases will still be included so long as they are not considered uncontrolled or
             immunocompromised.

          -  In patients with rheumatoid arthritis, the usual protocol for discontinuing
             disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) prior to surgery will be continued as
             done per each surgeon's protocol.

          -  Patients undergoing urgent surgery (e.g. within a few days of the inciting event, such
             as a traumatic fracture) will be considered for the study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients under 18 years old

          -  Patients who are not competent to give consent for themselves, or to read and answer
             questions about their scar formation (proxies will not be allowed);

          -  Any surgery that requires a non-linear surgical incision;

          -  Previous surgery(ies) on the same area;

          -  Known history of keloid/abnormal scar formation;

          -  Patients with uncontrolled diabetes (as documented by ICD-9 codes 250.x2 or 250.x3);

          -  Patients who are immunocompromised (i.e. HIV/AIDS+ patients, patients who have had a
             previous organ transplantation, patients who have been diagnosed with an
             immunodeficiency syndrome- congenital or acquired, as a result of immunomodulatory
             medication secondary to autoimmune disease, or undergoing current chemotherapy for
             cancer).

          -  Patients undergoing emergent surgery will not be considered for the study.

          -  Patients who have had a previous allergic or adverse reaction to any of the
             suture/staple materials we plan to use will not be included.

          -  If the closure requires multiple layers of sutures (i.e. subcutaneous layers, deep
             dermal layers) in addition to the usual closing staples/sutures which are through the
             skin, the patient will be excluded from the study
