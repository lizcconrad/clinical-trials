  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to explore if, for locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer
      patients whose tumors have high levels of PD-L1 (a marker associated with benefits from
      immunotherapy), a combination of immunotherapy and a personalized 4-week radiotherapy course
      could be more effective than standard treatment, which is a combination of chemotherapy and
      radiotherapy.

      This is a Phase II trial evaluating the efficacy and safety of sequential pembrolizumab (200
      mg every three weeks) and accelerated, dose-painted radiotherapy for patients with locally
      advanced NSCLC with PD-L1 expression ≥ 50%. Patients with PD-L1 expression &lt; 50% will also be
      enrolled and treated with standard concurrent chemoradiotherapy to serve as a non-randomized
      comparison group.

    <description>Patients whose tumors are found to have low (&lt; 50%) PD-L1 expression will automatically be placed in the ChemoRT group. These patients will receive radiotherapy over a course of four to seven weeks. During radiotherapy, patients will also receive two standard chemotherapy agents (carboplatin and paclitaxel) once each week. Following completion of chemotherapy and radiotherapy, patients may receive additional treatments with chemotherapy or immunotherapy as part of routine care. These treatments are optional and are not required by this clinical trial.</description>

          6. Active malignancy other than lung cancer that requires active treatment other than
             hormonal therapy or is deemed by the treating physicians to be likely to affect the
             subject's survival duration.

          7. A history of (non-infectious) pneumonitis that required steroids or current
             pneumonitis.

         10. Has a history or current evidence of any condition, therapy, or laboratory abnormality
             that might confound the results of the study, interfere with the subject's
             participation for

             the full duration of the study, or is not in the best interest of the subject to
             participate, in the opinion of the treating investigator.

         12. Pregnancy, assessed in WOCBP (defined in Appendix) with urine pregnancy test within 72
             hours prior to study treatment allocation. If urine pregnancy test is positive or
             cannot be confirmed as negative, a serum pregnancy test is required. If more than 72
             hours elapse between screening pregnancy test and the first dose of study treatment,
             another pregnancy test (urine or serum) must be performed and must be negative.

               1. Has severe hypersensitivity (≥Grade 3) to pembrolizumab and/or any of its
                  excipients.

               2. Active autoimmune disease other than vitiligo, thyroid disorders, Sjogren's
                  disease, and well-controlled rheumatoid arthritis not requiring disease-modifying
                  therapy.

               3. Has received a live vaccine within 30 days prior to the first dose of study drug.
                  Examples of live vaccines include, but are not limited to, the following:
                  measles, mumps, rubella, varicella/zoster (chicken pox), yellow fever, rabies,
                  Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG), and typhoid vaccine. Seasonal influenza vaccines
                  for injection are generally killed virus vaccines and are allowed; however,
                  intranasal influenza vaccines (e.g., FluMist®) are live attenuated vaccines and
                  are not allowed.

               4. Has a diagnosis of immunodeficiency or is receiving chronic systemic steroid
                  therapy (in dosing exceeding 10 mg daily of prednisone equivalent) or any other
                  form of immunosuppressive therapy within 7 days prior to the first dose of study
                  drug.
