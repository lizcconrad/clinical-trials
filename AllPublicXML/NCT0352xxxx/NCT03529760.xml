      Children with clinically diagnosed leukemia may experience occult HBV infection after
      chemotherapy immunosuppressive therapy, which may affect the normal course of leukemia
      treatment. However, this is not caused by clinically relevant diagnosis and treatment
      measures but exists in vivo.

    <textblock>
      The clinical diagnosis of children with leukemia may be due to the influence of leukemia
      disease on the immune cells of the children and the damage to the immune system due to
      immunosuppressive therapy in children. Therefore, the risk of contracting hepatitis B virus
      is relatively high, and some children are In the treatment of immunosuppressive chemotherapy
      (later), the reactivation of occult HBV infection has an impact on the normal course of
      leukemia treatment. However, this is not a clinically relevant diagnosis and treatment
      measure. It is necessary to avoid unnecessary conflicts between clinical doctors and patients
      as much as possible.
