  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate uptake of intravenously administered
      99mTc-tilmanocept using single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT/CT) scanning in
      individuals with HIV and individuals without HIV.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      People living with HIV (PLWH) have an increased risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) compared
      to individuals without HIV. Increased systemic immune activation and arterial inflammation
      are thought to contribute to this increased risk by affecting the highly inflammatory process
      of atherosclerotic plaque formation and progression. This study will evaluate whether
      intravenous administration of a macrophage-specific imaging agent, 99mTc-tilmanocept,
      followed by SPECT/CT scanning can permit quantification of aortic 99mTc-tilmanocept uptake,
      reflective of aortic macrophage-specific inflammation among participants with HIV. We will
      also compare aortic 99mTc-tilmanocept uptake in participants with HIV to participants without
      HIV. Immunology parameters such as markers of immune activation and traditional CVD
      parameters will be assessed in relation to imaging assessments.
