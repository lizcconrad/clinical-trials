  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Balloon kyphoplasty is a well-established treatment option to achieve pain relief and to
      correct kyphotic deformity caused by osteoporotic vertebral compression fracture. However, it
      has been demonstrated that reduction is partly lost as balloon is deflated in the vertebral
      body. An intravertebral expander was developed for better reduction and maintenance of
      vertebral body height while cement is injected. This study evaluates the efficacy of
      kyphoplasty with a new intravertebral expander with regard to correction of kyphosis angel
      and to restoration of vertebral body height.

        Patients with new osteoporotic vertebral body fractures who were eligible for kyphoplasty
        and were treated with kyphoplasty, were observed prospectively 12 months after the surgery.
        In the follow-up period the clinical and radiological data were collected
