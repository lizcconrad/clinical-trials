      Subtle speech disorganization could be predictive of a transition to schizophrenia of
      ultra-high-risk patients. The aim of our longitudinal multicenter cohort study is to identify
      specific linguistic markers of the psychotic transition to validate a french predictive model
      of this transition using computerized speech analysis techniques

      Different scales allow identification of patients at ultra-high-risk to develop psychosis.
      The current challenge is to identify a predictive marker of transition to schizophrenia.
      Language disorders, which reflect psyche, could be one of these markers. Computerized speech
      analysis techniques such as Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA) have already proven their
      reliability in schizophrenia. These techniques reveal subtle speech disorganization that
      would be predictive of a clinical transition of ultra-high-risk psychotic patients. A
      combination of semantic and syntactic analysis could accurately predict the psychotic
      transition. The aim of our longitudinal multicenter cohort study is to validate this
      predicitve model in french language as well as identifying specific linguistic markers of the
      psychotic transition.

      The initial report including the CAARMS is completed with an audio recording from the initial
      medical interview. The recording will be transcribed and analyzed by computer following the
      method of lemmatization and vectorial analysis (LSA). An analysis of the grammatical function
      (number of words, rate of the various grammatical functions) will also be performed. This
      first analysis will emerge linguistic markers correlated to transition to psychosis that we
      will use to construct a predictive model for transition to schizophrenia.
