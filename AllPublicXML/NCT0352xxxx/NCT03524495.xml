  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will primarily investigate the impacts of a one-time unconditional cash transfer
      on the well-being of recently homeless individuals.

      Secondary research questions will examine the impact of personal coaching for cash recipients
      and the impact of a workshop and coaching intervention for non-cash recipients.

      The goal of this project is to examine the effect of a direct cash transfer intervention
      involving recently homeless people in Metro Vancouver. In partnership with the New Leaf
      Project, the investigators will distribute a one-time unconditional cash grant of $7,500 to
      50 participants. An additional seventy five participants will serve as a control group and
      will not receive the cash transfer. Some participants will receive supplementary
      affirmational workshops and/or professional coaching. Participants will be followed up one
      month after baseline and then again every three months for 12 months to evaluate the effect
      of the cash transfer, workshop, and coaching interventions. Over the course of the study, the
      investigators will assess participants' cognitive functioning, subjective well-being, and
      self-efficacy.

    <intervention_model_description>We will use a 4 (condition) x 6 (time) mixed factorial design.
The between-subject factor (condition) will have 4 levels:
Group #1 - $7,500 + workshop &amp; coaching
Group #2 - $7,500 + workshop (no coaching)
Group #3 - no cash + workshop &amp; coaching
Group #4 - no cash + no workshop/coaching
The within-subjects factor (time) will have 6 levels:
Baseline
1-Month follow up
3-Month follow up
6-Month follow up
9-Month follow up
12-Month follow up
Random assignment will occur at the shelter level, such that each participating shelter will be randomly assigned to one of the four study conditions. Thus, all participants recruited from a given shelter will be in the same condition.</intervention_model_description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Satisfaction with Life</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to 1-month</time_frame>
    <description>Satisfaction with Life will be measured using the 5-item Satisfaction with Life Scale. Items will be rated on a Likert scale from 1 (Strongly disagree) to 7 (Strongly agree). The items will be averaged to form a composite score. Multiple imputation will be used to account for missing data. Higher scores indicate a better outcome.
This measure will be assessed at each time point during the study, but confirmatory analyses will only be conducted from Baseline to 1-month. Analyses conducted at other time points will be considered exploratory.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Positive Affect</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to 1-month</time_frame>
    <description>Positive affect will be measured using the 6 positive emotions from the 12-item Schedule of Positive and Negative Experience Scale. Items will be rated on a Likert scale from 1 (Very rarely or never) to 5 (Very often or always). The items will be averaged to form a composite score. Multiple imputation will be used to account for missing data. Higher scores indicate a better outcome.
This measure will be assessed at each time point during the study, but confirmatory analyses will only be conducted from Baseline to 1-month. Analyses conducted at other time points will be considered exploratory.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Negative Affect</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to 1-month</time_frame>
    <description>Negative affect will be measured using the 6 negative emotions from the 12-item Schedule of Positive and Negative Experience Scale. Items will be rated on a Likert scale from 1 (Very rarely or never) to 5 (Very often or always). The items will be averaged to form a composite score. Multiple imputation will be used to account for missing data. Lower scores indicate a better outcome.
This measure will be assessed at each time point during the study, but confirmatory analyses will only be conducted from Baseline to 1-month. Analyses conducted at other time points will be considered exploratory.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Subjective Well-being</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to 1-month</time_frame>
    <description>A composite score will be computed by first standardizing scores of satisfaction with life, positive affect, and negative affect (reverse-coded), and then averaging these three standardized scores for each participant. Higher scores indicate a better outcome.
This measure will be assessed at each time point during the study, but confirmatory analyses will only be conducted from Baseline to 1-month. Analyses conducted at other time points will be considered exploratory.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Fluid Intelligence</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to 1-month</time_frame>
    <description>Fluid intelligence will be measured using 10 Raven's Standard Progressive Matrices. The accuracy (the number of items answered correctly divided by the total number of items) is the primary measurement. Items that are skipped or declined will be treated as incorrect answers. Higher scores indicate a better outcome.
This measure will be assessed at each time point during the study, but confirmatory analyses will only be conducted from Baseline to 1-month. Analyses conducted at other time points will be considered exploratory.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Executive Function (accuracy)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to 1-month</time_frame>
    <description>Executive function will be measured using 12 trials of a visual Stroop task. Participants will be asked to click a button on the same side of the screen when image A appears, but the opposite side of the screen when image B appears. There are 6 congruent trials and 6 incongruent trials. Trials will be presented in random order.
Executive function will be assessed in two ways. The first measure is accuracy (the number of items answered correctly divided by the total number of items). Higher scores indicate a better outcome.
This measure will be assessed at each time point during the study, but confirmatory analyses will only be conducted from Baseline to 1-month. Analyses conducted at other time points will be considered exploratory.</description>

    <measure>Executive Function (efficiency)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to 1-month</time_frame>
    <description>Executive function will be measured using 12 trials of a visual Stroop task. Participants will be asked to click a button on the same side of the screen when image A appears, but the opposite side of the screen when image B appears. There are 6 congruent trials and 6 incongruent trials. Trials will be presented in random order.
Executive function will be assessed in two ways. The second measure is an efficiency score (the accuracy divided by the mean reaction time (RT) of correct trials). We will remove the participant if their mean RT is 3 standard deviations away from the mean RT of the sample at that time point. Higher scores indicate a better outcome.
This measure will be assessed at each time point during the study, but confirmatory analyses will only be conducted from Baseline to 1-month. Analyses conducted at other time points will be considered exploratory.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Self-efficacy</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to 1-month</time_frame>
    <description>Self-efficacy will be measured using the 10-item General Self-Efficacy Scale. Items will be rated on a Likert scale from 1 (Not at all true) to 4 (Exactly true). The items will be averaged to form a composite score. Multiple imputation will be used to account for missing data. Higher scores indicate a better outcome.
This measure will be assessed at each time point during the study, but confirmatory analyses will only be conducted from Baseline to 1-month. Analyses conducted at other time points will be considered exploratory.</description>
