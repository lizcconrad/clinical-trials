  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will investigate implementation of a process to enhance Clinical Practice
      Guideline (CPG) adherence to limit unwarranted variability in initial treatment decisions
      with high potential for providing more effective and efficient physical therapy management
      for patients with neck and low back pain.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Effective implementation of CPGs to augment initial clinical decision making during physical
      therapy management of patients with spine related musculoskeletal pain will have several
      important goals: 1) improve patient pain and disability outcomes, 2) limit over utilization
      of physical therapy services, and 3) increase adherence to limit unwarranted variation in
      clinical practice. This proposed pilot study proposal will test if a multifaceted
      intervention strategy for implementation of neck and low back CPG meets these goals and
      provide necessary data for larger system wide implementation efforts.

      Specific Aim 1: Determine if physical therapy clinics that receive neck and low back pain
      (LBP) clinical practice guideline (CPG) training are associated with improved patient
      outcomes compared to those that have not received training. Neck and LBP specific disability
      and pain intensity will be assessed at intake, on a weekly basis and at discharge (Specific
      Aim 1a). Secondary patient outcomes will consist of patient satisfaction scores (Specific Aim
      1b). Statistical analyses will evaluate for temporal effects of training considering the
      stepped wedge study design.

      Specific Aim 2: Determine if multifaceted interventions for CPG implementation positively
      impacts physical therapist beliefs, attitudes, knowledge and behaviors over time. CPG
      adherence (by clinicians) will be indirectly assessed using quantitative and qualitative
      methods consisting of: 1) clinician checklists, 2) clinician questionnaires, 3) quality
      indicators, and 4) total proportion outcome measure assessments (Specific Aim 2).

    <description>The Oswestry Disability Index (ODI), which has 10 items that assesses how low back pain affects common daily activities. The ODI has a range of 0% &quot;no disability due to low back pain&quot; to 100% &quot;completely disabled due to low back pain&quot;, with higher scores indicating higher disability from low back pain.</description>

    <description>Numeric Pain Rating Scale (NPRS) Pain intensity will be rated using a NPRS, ranging from &quot;0&quot; (no pain) to &quot;10&quot; (worst pain imaginable). Patients will be asked to rate their current pain intensity, as well as their best and worst level of pain intensity over the past 24 hours. These 3 pain ratings will averaged and used as the NPRS variable in this study.</description>

    <description>Cross-sectional stepped wedge design with 16 physical therapy clinics (including approximately 40 physical therapists) being allocated to one of 4 sequences that differ in CPG implementation time (each sequence consisting of 4 clinics). This proposed study will be conducted over 68 weeks, with the initial 12 weeks serving as a baseline washout phase (before any clinic has received training), then 4 clinics crossing over from standard care (control) to CPG and decision support tool implementation (intervention) approximately every 8 weeks until week 44 when all 4 sequences (16 clinics) have completed training.</description>
