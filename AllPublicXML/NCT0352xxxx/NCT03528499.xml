  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Interventions focused on the scapula have been frequently used to treat shoulder pain.
      However, most studies do not assess the contribution of scapular movement alteration for the
      symptoms.

      Objectives: To compare the effects of two interventions for shoulder pain: Scapular Movement
      Training and General Exercises.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a double-blinded randomized controlled trial. Sixty-four subjects with shoulder pain,
      scapular dyskinesis, and positive scapular assistance test will be randomized in two groups:
      1) Scapular Movement Training, and 2) General Exercises. The Scapular Movement Training Group
      will receive the orientation about proper scapular position and movement, and will be trained
      to modify the scapular movement pattern. The General Exercises Group will perform
      scapulothoracic stretching and strengthening exercises.

      Both groups will be treated twice a week for eight weeks. The following outcomes will be
      collected at baseline and follow-up: scapular kinematics, electromyographic muscle activity
      of the upper, middle and lower trapezius, and serratus anterior, as well as pain intensity,
      function, and fear avoidance beliefs. Also, pain intensity, function, and fear-avoidance
      beliefs will be assessed at the fourth week of follow-up after the end of treatment's period.

    <description>The Fear-Avoidance Beliefs Questionnaire (FABQ) contains 2 scales: FABQ work scale (with range from 0 to 42) and FABQ physical activity scale (with range from 0 to 24). Higher scores indicate higher levels of fear-avoidance beliefs.</description>
