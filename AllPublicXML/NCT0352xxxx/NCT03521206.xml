  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Advance care planning (ACP) is a process that supports adults at any age or stage of health
      in understanding and sharing their personal values, life goals, and preferences regarding
      future (medical) care. ACP is of particular relevance for frail older adults, particularly in
      the nursing home setting where an important proportion of older people die. However, the
      actual implementation of ACP in nursing home practice seems to be a challenge in many
      countries worldwide, and people often do not get the opportunity to discuss their preferences
      in advance. This study evaluates the effectiveness of a theory-based advance care planning
      training programme (ACP+ programme) for nursing homes in Flanders, Belgium, using a cluster
      randomised controlled trial (cRCT) design. The ACP+ programme aims to integrate ACP in
      routine nursing home care by training the nursing home staff and management. Residents and
      their family will receive in-depth information on ACP and participate in one or several ACP
      conversations, if they wish so.

      Who can participate? Nursing homes that conform to the eligibility criteria: at least 100
      beds, situated in Flanders and did not participate in a similar research or implementation
      project over the last 4 years.

      What does the study involve? The researchers will perform a cluster randomized controlled
      trial (cRCT) to evaluate the effects of an ACP training programme in nursing homes in
      Flanders (Belgium), accompanied by a process evaluation. Fourteen nursing homes will be
      randomized to either the intervention group, which will receive the intervention (ACP+
      programme), or the control group, in which no additional training regarding ACP (other than
      that which is part of routine practice) will be provided. The nursing homes in the control
      group will receive a short training on ACP, as well as all training materials used in the
      intervention after the last follow-up measurements.

      At month 0 the researchers will perform a baseline measurement in the intervention and
      control groups using structured questionnaires to be filled in by all care staff in the
      nursing home. At the end of month 8, the same questionnaires will be administered again in
      all nursing homes (follow-up). The process evaluation will employ structured diaries for ACP
      trainers, attendance lists for training sessions, audiotaping of a sample of ACP
      conversations and individual and group interviews with staff and management of the
      intervention homes.

      Hypotheses The primary hypothesis is that the introduction of the ACP+ programme in nursing
      homes will improve the knowledge and attitudes of nursing home care staff regarding advance
      care planning.

      Study hypothesis The primary study hypothesis is that the introduction of the ACP+ programme
      in nursing homes will improve the knowledge and attitudes of nursing home care staff
      regarding advance care planning (ACP).

      Ethics approval The study was approved by the Ethics committee of University Hospital
      Brussels (Vrije University Brussels, 22/02/2018, ref: 18-003 - B.U.N. 143201834759)

      Study design A cluster randomized controlled trial using baseline and follow-up measurement
      of relevant outcome variables and process evaluation. The trial will be implemented in a
      sample of 14 nursing homes (see eligibility criteria below) randomised to either intervention
      or control group.

      Trial duration The duration of the entire trial, from the moment the first nursing home is
      recruited until the end of follow up will be 10 months.

      At month 0, immediately after randomization, the baseline assessment is completed in both
      intervention and control homes. Staff did not know the outcome of the randomisation when
      filling in the baseline measures (with the exception of the nursing home director).

      At month 1, the ACP+ programme will start in nursing homes in the intervention group. This
      programme consists of two parts, each lasting 4-months (see intervention below for more
      details), taking up a total of 8 months.

      At the end of month 8, follow-up measures will be collected in both groups. The process
      evaluation will run through the intervention period, starting at month 1 and will be
      completed at month 9.

      Randomisation Paired randomization of nursing homes to the control and intervention groups is
      performed by an independent and blinded statistician. Criterion is facility status (public
      vs. private without profit objective vs. private with profit objective).

      Sample size calculation Given an expected effect size of d=0.50, the analysis will have power
      of 80% to detect a difference between intervention and control group on the primary outcome
      (knowledge of and attitudes of care staff regarding ACP) at follow-up compared to baseline,
      with a two-sided significance level Î±=0.05.

      Assuming an intra cluster correlation coefficient (ICC) of 0.036, there is a need to involve
      at least 35 staff members per cluster (i.e. nursing home). Since the average number of
      nursing staff is 5 FTE (including 1 FTE head nurse) and 5 FTE care assistants per 30 beds and
      the included nursing homes are all required to have over 100 beds, it is expected to have at
      least 35 care staff members per cluster (nursing home). Due to an estimated 10% of staff
      turn-over, the assumption is made that 30 care staff members per cluster will fill out the
      questionnaire at both time points (baseline and follow-up). In order to achieve the necessary
      statistical power, there is a need to involve a minimum of 142 nursing home care staff per
      study arm. To reach this number, and considering effects of potential attrition of facilities
      the researchers will include 14 nursing homes randomized to intervention or control group.

      Intervention The ACP+ programme is offered in addition to any standard education or
      continuous training that staff receive in each of the participating nursing homes randomised
      to the intervention group. Throughout the ACP+ programme, a professional trainer is made
      available by the research team to train the nursing home staff and to guide implementation of
      the programme. The ACP+ programme aims to improve or establish advance care planning (ACP) in
      the day-to-day routine of staff working in nursing homes. At the core of the intervention is
      the nomination of several representatives for ACP (named ACP reference persons) in each
      facility who are trained by a specialised ACP trainer made available through the study.
      During the study period, the specialised trainer will provide training and support to all
      staff in the nursing homes and specifically support the ACP reference persons in developing
      their knowledge and skills regarding ACP, implementing the ACP+ programme and training other
      nursing home staff.

      The intervention consists of two parts. The first part focuses on buy-in from management and
      development of facility-level ACP policy and training staff. A central element is the
      training of 'ACP reference persons' (who are nurses of the facilities, 3-4 per facility), who
      will themselves train the other staff in ACP, with the support of the external trainer
      (train-the-trainer approach). The second part focuses on nursing home staff conducting ACP
      conversations with residents and family. In addition, the trained staff will be offered more
      in-depth training sessions (so called 'comeback-seminar' to evaluate the progress they have
      made so far, and 'specialisation sessions' on handling ACP with residents living with
      dementia and professional communication) to extend their knowledge and skills, as well as
      one-on-one coaching.

      The intervention implementation period has a total duration of 8 months and is divided into:

        -  a four-month preparation and training phase. During this phase the ACP reference persons
           will attend a &quot;two-day training&quot; given by the ACP trainers. Other staff will receive
           training by the reference persons on conducting ACP conversation or recognizing triggers
           for an ACP conversation in nursing home residents.

        -  A four-month follow-up phase in which ACP conversations are held with residents.
           Additional training sessions will be organized to give more in-depth knowledge to the
           ACP reference persons.

      The staff of nursing homes in the control group will receive no additional training next to
      any standard education or continuous training. After the intervention and follow-up measures
      are finished, all nursing homes in the control group will be offered a shortened version of
      the ACP+ training programme as well as all ACP+ training materials.

      Statistical analysis The researchers will conduct regression analyses to test study
      hypotheses using intention-to-treat (ITT) and per protocol approaches. Multi-level mixed
      model regression analyses will be used to analyze outcomes, controlling for baseline values
      and clustering of data within the nursing homes. Within the multi-level mixed model analyses,
      outcomes will be analyzed with nursing homes as random factor, and group, time point, and
      their interaction as fixed factors. Differences in mean change between the intervention group
      and the control group (group by time interaction) will be calculated. The effect sizes
      (Cohen's d) using the baseline-adjusted mean differences and the variance between nursing
      home staff and between nursing homes will be estimated to assess effect sizes for the
      different outcome measures.
