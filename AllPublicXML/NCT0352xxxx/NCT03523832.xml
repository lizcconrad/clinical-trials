  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Acute Pain is the most common early complication after total knee arthroplasty that caused
      delayed mobilization, demands of morphine, and higher operative cost. There were many
      researches that had been done in analgesia method to find the most effective analgesia,
      lowest side effect, and easy to apply. Preemptive analgesia of combined celecoxib and
      pregabalin were reported to give a promising outcome.

      In a randomized, double blind controlled clinical trial, 30 subjects underwent surgery for
      total knee arthroplasty using 15-20mg bupivacaine 5% epidural anesthesia. All subjects were
      divided into three groups. First group was given celecoxib 400mg and pregabaline 150mg 1 hour
      before operation, second group was given celecoxib 200mg and pregabaline 75mg twice daily
      started from 3 days before operation, and the last group was given placebo. The outcome was
      measured with VAS, knee ROM, and post-operative mobilization
