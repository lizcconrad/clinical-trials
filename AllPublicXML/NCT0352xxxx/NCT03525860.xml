    <textblock>
      A feasibility study on the provision of acupuncture treatment in the hospital to 20 patients
      who have undergone open heart surgery procedures. The acupuncture treatments may begin as
      early as postoperative Day 2.

      Primary Aim • Evaluate the feasibility of providing acupuncture in the hospital setting for
      20 patients undergoing open heart surgery and subsequently develop arrhythmias.

      Secondary Aims

      • Evaluate the short-term effect of acupuncture including the effects on patient's
      arrhythmias, stress, anxiety, and pain measured by Electrocardiogram monitoring and
      Electrocardiography, VAS scores, and WIWI questionnaire for the patient.

    <description>The subject is placed in the selected position (lying down or sitting), based on their comfort level. The areas to be needled are prepped with an alcohol swab. Mandatory standards and safety guidelines for acupuncture will be followed.
The acupuncture treatment protocol will be based on Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) theory. The TCM treatment strategy is designed to Benefit the Heart, Tonify Heart Qi and Blood, Calm and Sedate Cardiac Excitability and Regulate the Qi. Current literature supports the use of selected acupuncture points as possibly beneficial in regulating the autonomic nervous system, modulating Heart Rate Variability (HRV), relieving chest pain, and reducing arrhythmias.
11 sterile, single use, disposable needles will be placed one by one until all needles are in place.
Needles remain in place for additional 20 minutes or so as the patient remains in the selected position</description>
