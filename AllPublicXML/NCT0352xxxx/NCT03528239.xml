      After Middle Eastern crisis, millions people were forced to migrate to European countries and
      especially neighboring countries. In Turkey, cities which are closed to east of border, face
      to cope more refugees' health care than those of other cities. The incidence of admission of
      hospital outpatient clinics and emergency department by refugee patients is not known clearly
      in our city, Nevsehir. In this study, we wanted to investigate use of health care among these
      patients in Nevsehir in Turkey.

        Refugee patients are registered in the hospital system in a different way than that of
        others. We will use these datas as recorded refugees. And also, we will use the number of
        other visits to calculate the incidence of visits of refugees.
