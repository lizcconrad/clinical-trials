      This is an open, multicenter, randomized phase III trial. This clinical study compares the
      efficacy and safety of SHR3680 with bicalutamide in the patients with hormone sensitive
      prostate cancer. Approximately 572 patients who meet the entry criteria will be randomly
      assigned in a 1:1 ratio to SHR3680 or bicalutamide treatment. Primary endpoints of the study
      are radiological progress-free survival (rPFS) and overall survival (OS).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subject has received any prior radiation therapy or surgery for prostate cancer,

             (enzalutamide, ARN-509, ODM-201), abiraterone, ketoconazole for prostate cancer, or
             other agents that will inhibit the production of androgens;

             following drugs in the past 4 weeks prior to day 1: 5-alpha reductase inhibitors,
