    <textblock>
      This is a phase 2, open-label, randomized study to compare the safety and efficacy of
      combination therapy with ALT-803 and pembrolizumab (experimental arm) versus pembrolizumab
      alone (control arm), as first-line treatment for subjects with metastatic NSCLC in which
      pembrolizumab is indicated for first-line treatment.
