    <textblock>
      Pulmonary rehabilitation program with aerobic and strengthening for 3 months will be applied
      to the candidates for lung transplantation. The program will be designed to be 2 days
      supervised weekly and 3 day home program. Cognitive functions and exercise capacities of the
      patients before and after the program will be evaluated.

    <textblock>
      The fact that cognition is not always included in the assessment routine makes it difficult
      to clarify which patient group or severity of illness is more affected by this issue. The
      effect of exercise on cognitive functions is a remarkable issue in recent years. It can also
      be predicted that cognitive function may be effective on program adaptation in patients who
      are given home program without supervision. The aim of the investigator's study was to
      investigate the effect of pulmonary rehabilitation on cognitive status in candidate lung
      transplant recipients.

      Lung transplantation candidates who refered from Lung Transplantation surgery team will
      receive the Pulmonary Rehabilitation program for 3-months (2 days at hospital, 3 days at
      home). Exercise program includes aerobic (walking band, bicycle, arm ergometer) and
      strengthening (with free weights) components. Patient will evaluate at the beginning and end
      of the program. Demographic information, diagnosis distributions, educational status of
      patients will be recorded. Exercise capacities are determined by 6 min walk test. The medical
      research concil dyspnea scale is used in determining the dispense levels. Montreal Cognitive
      Function Assessment (MOCA) is used to determine cognitive functions. Cognitive functions and
      exercise capacities of the patients before and after the program will be evaluated.

    <description>The Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA; Nasreddine et al., 2005) takes approximately 10 minutes to administer and was designed to detect mild cognitive impairment.Thirty items assessing multiple cognitive domains are contained in the MoCA: short-term memory (5 points); visuospatial abilities via clock drawing (3 points), and a cube copy task (1 point); executive functioning via an adaptation of Trail Making Test Part B (1 point), phonemic fluency (1 point), and verbal abstraction (2 points); attention, concentration, and working memory via target detection (1 point), serial subtraction (3 points), digits forward (1 point), and digits backward (1 point); language via confrontation naming with low-familiarity animals (3 points), and repetition of complex sentences (2 points); and orientation to time and place (6 points) (Nasreddine et al., 2005). The MoCA is scored by obtaining an item total and the authors recommend a clinical cutoff score of 26.</description>

    <description>Aerobic training:The aerobic exercise program consists of treadmill walking, cycle ergometer and arm ergometer training. Group exercises were performed in sets of 15 minutes each with three exercise modalities.
Strength training:It is recommended that resistance targets are set at loads equivalent to 20 to 40% of a 1-repetition maximum (1RM) maneuver and performed between 8 to 12 repetitions for 1 to 2 sets per session.
Home exercise programme:The program included breathing exercises (local expansion exercises, diaphragmatic breathing and pursed lip breathing), free walking, upper and lower extremity strengthening exercises with Thera-Band.</description>
