  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      the polycystic ovarian syndrome is associated with an ovulation and infertility. recently the
      laparoscopic ovarian drilling has been used as surgical treatment for ovulation in women with
      polycystic ovarian syndrome, although its mechanism and outcomes are still unclear. this
      study is undertaken to evaluate the in vitro fertilisation outcomes in clomiphene-resistant
      women with PCOS who were treated with LOD.
