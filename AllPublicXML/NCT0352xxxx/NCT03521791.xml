      Title of the study Efficacy and safety of PRO-155 (Zebesten ofteno®) on inflammation of the
      conjunctival surface in subjects with grade I-III pterygium vs placebo.

      Hypothesis H0. The Zebesten® ophthalmic solution (bromfenac 0.09%) is less effective and safe
      than placebo in reducing conjunctival hyperemia in subjects with grade I-III pterygium.

      H1 The Zebesten® ophthalmic solution (bromfenac 0.09%) is more effective and safe than
      placebo in reducing conjunctival hyperemia in subjects with grade I-III pterygium.

      Objective

      To evaluate the efficacy and safety of PRO-155 (bromfenac 009%) ophthalmic solution in the
      treatment of conjunctival hyperemia and ocular surface inflammation in a clinical model of
      pterygium grade I to III.

      the previous segment. Exploration of the posterior segment. Lacrimal rupture time. Corneal

      PHARMACOLOGICAL INTERVENTION

      The pharmacological intervention will consist of the instillation of the ophthalmological
      solution in the conjunctival cul-de-sac, during the waking period, to any of the following
      study groups:

        -  Group 1:

             -  Sodium hyaluronate 0.4% [Lagricel ofteno®] 1 drop 3 times a day in the period of
                vigil in the conjunctival sac fund (the following application scheme is suggested:
                start: 7:00 ± 1 hours, continuation: 15:00 ± 1 hour and term: at 19:00 ± 1 hours)
                for 20 days

             -  Pro-155 1 drop 2 times a day in the period of vigil in the conjunctival cul-de-sac
                (the following application scheme is recommended: start: 7:15 ± 1 hours and term:
                at 19:15 ± 1 hours) during 20 days

        -  Group 2:

             -  Sodium hyaluronate 0.4% [Lagricel ofteno®] 1 drop 3 times a day in the period of
                vigil in the conjunctival sac fund (the following application scheme is suggested:
                start: 7:00 ± 1 hours, continuation: 15:00 ± 1 hour and term: at 19:00 ± 1 hours)
                for 20 days

             -  Placebo 1 drop 2 times a day in the period of vigil in the conjunctival cul-de-sac
                (the following application scheme is recommended: start: 7:15 ± 1 hours and term:

    <primary_purpose>Treatment</primary_purpose>
    <masking>Triple (Participant, Investigator, Outcomes Assessor)</masking>
    <masking_description>The double-blind study is a procedure in which the subject and the principal investigator do not know which of the intervention groups was assigned to the subject of the study. To achieve the blinding of the drug, both the investigational drug and the placebo, will be packed in the same bottle, containing the same legends on the label. The blinding codes are protected by a person outside the study designated by the sponsor. The codes are also available in the research center (fully sealed), so that they can be consulted by the Investigator in the event that the subject presents a serious adverse event, prior authorization of the study sponsor, as well as strict continuous blindness during the analysis of data.</masking_description>
