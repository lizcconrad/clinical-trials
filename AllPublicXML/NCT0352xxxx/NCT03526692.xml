  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a non-pharmacological study evaluating the effects of SMR/delta ratio and beta1/theta
      ratio neurofeedback trainings on cognitive performance and electrical brain activity in
      elderly with mild cognitive impairment.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Older adults with Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) are at high risk to progress to Alzheimer's
      disease (AD). Slowing down effect of dementia by enhancing brain plasticity represents one of
      the most prominent challenges. Neurofeedback is one of the promising techniques that showed
      therapeutic efficacy and cognitive improvement in attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder,
      epilepsy, stroke. We aim to study the effects of two neurofeedback training protocols,
      SMR/delta ratio and beta1/theta ratio, on cognitive performances in older adults with Mild
      Cognitive Impairment and to assess whether MCI patients change in brain electrical activity
      in a resting state after training.

    <description>Three interventions will be administered:
An electroencephalography recording (EEG) for 30 minutes.We will use an electrocap of 19 scalp locations according to the International 10-20 EEG placement system.
The second intervention is the neuropsychological assessments and questionnaires. They will be done in one session for approximately 2 hours.
The third intervention is the neurofeedback training sensorimotor/delta ratio that will be recorded at channel Cz according to the International 10-20 system.</description>

    <description>Neurofeedback experiment will consist of 30 sessions of neurofeedback training, twice or three times a week during maximum 4 months. The two experimental groups will undergo questionnaires, EEG recording and neuropsychological assessments in three-time points, pre-training (T0), post-training (T1) and 3 months follow-up (T2). Electroencephalography will be recorded by a technician in EEGFor each participant, EEG power spectrum will be calculated in pre (T0) and post neurofeedback training/psycho-pedagogical care at T2 and T3.</description>
