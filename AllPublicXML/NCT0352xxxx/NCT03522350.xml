  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to compare the current EmbryoScope Time-Lapse System being used
      in IVF which has become standard of care to the new model EmbryoScope to demonstrate that the
      EmbryoScope+ is as safe and reliable as the EmbryoScope.

      This is a randomized, controlled, single-center study in otherwise healthy infertile female
      subjects undergoing in vitro fertilization (IVF). The subjects recruited for this study will
      be among those patients who have been diagnosed with infertility and are planning to undergo
      IVF at the center where this study is being performed. The subjects will have undergone the
      usual informed consent procedure at the center.

      Subjects will undergo ovarian stimulation, oocyte retrieval, IVF, and Intra Cytoplasmic Sperm
      Injection (ICSI) procedure following the center's usual procedures. At the time of retrieval,
      participant's oocytes will be randomly assigned to both groups for comparison: Standard
      EmbryoScope Time-Lapse system versus EmbryoScope+. The best quality embryos are selected for
      embryo transfer and the pregnancy outcome is evaluated.

      &quot;Best grade&quot; embryos will be transferred regardless of EmbryoScope use. The standard
      EmbryoScope as well as the EmbryoScope+ monitor system as assigned during the randomization
      process will be used to observe the embryo development and document timing of embryo
      cleavages and morphology dynamics. Subjects will not be provided with the time- lapse images.

      Endpoints will be Day 3 and Day 5/6 embryo development, implantation and pregnancy rate. The
      study is approximately 2 months, the estimated time it takes a physician to perform one
      IVF-ART treatment cycle. If embryos are frozen, the patient may be in the study until the
      time they choose to thaw the embryos or up to 1 year if they become pregnant.
