  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The VFB Ecosystem capitalizes on digital technologies' ability to connect parents and
      children, allowing parents to actively support their child's physical activity, even when
      parents cannot be present. The VFB is a kiosk-based system that houses a virtual dog
      programmed to allow children to set self-determined physical activity goals. The children
      wear Fitbits while performing physical activity. Using the unique data embedded in the
      Fitbit, the kiosk is able to detect each individual child and automatically connect him or
      her to a unique, personalized virtual dog. Physical activity data is transmitted
      automatically from the Fitbit to the kiosk when the child approaches, and the virtual dog
      provides accurate evaluations of whether the child met the self-determined physical activity
      goal, offering words of encouragement and physical activity support. The virtual pet
      functions as a personalized fitness buddy to encourage children to set and meet physical
      activity goals, promote physical activity self-efficacy, and foster mutually supportive
      relationships among children, parents, and the virtual pet. This will be particularly helpful
      for children who receive insufficient amounts of social support in their current environment.

      Concurrently, the kiosk sends a text message to parents on the child's physical activity
      progress. Parents are then able to send words of encouragement and communicate with their
      children via the kiosk, using the text messaging feature of their mobile phones. Thus, even
      when the parent is not with the child, the virtual pet is designed to serve as a coordinating
      focus for facilitating parent-child communication. Parents will also receive text messages
      from the kiosk with a security code to access a website that provides detailed records of the
      child's physical activity over time.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Childhood obesity poses a critical public health concern and chronically remains as one of
      the strongest predictors of obesity as an adult. Scientific evidence has demonstrated that
      daily physical activity (PA) is imperative in preventing the onset of obesity. The outpour of
      academic and professional interest has increased the public awareness of the risks related to
      obesity (e.g., type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, cancers) as well as the importance
      of PA. However, studies show that the rising prevalence of childhood obesity has not faltered
      since 1999. Many existing PA interventions show short-term impact, but have failed to
      demonstrate longer-term efficacy in sustaining the changes in PA over timeâ€”a gap this project
      aims to address.

      One important, yet commonly overlooked, limitation of existing PA interventions is the
      negative impact of extrinsic rewards, such as points, grades, and badges, which are often
      used in health promotion interventions to incentivize children for engaging with the program.
      Children become motivated to excel in obtaining the extrinsic rewards rather than learning
      the intrinsic benefits of the intervention. Consequently, these types of interventions have
      limited effects that may disappear altogether when they stop receiving extrinsic rewards.
      Another critical limitation of existing PA interventions related to the use of extrinsic
      rewards is that the focus on &quot;beating the system&quot; by obtaining extrinsic rewards
      decontextualizes the intervention from the child's everyday life. This is an isolating
      experience for the child, taking him or her away from existing social support (e.g., parents)
      and left to his or her devices to engage in PA, based solely on the motivation from extrinsic
      rewards.

      Guided by the frameworks of social ecological theory and self-determination theory, we
      propose a paradigm-shifting intervention through an engaging, game-like platform that
      incorporates intrinsic reward systems by harnessing the power of technology to connect people
      and devices to promote PA in children. The Virtual Fitness Buddy (VFB) Ecosystem was designed
      to encourage children to embrace PA as a lifestyle change that can be sustained over time
      rather than a means to gain points. The Ecosystem meets this goal by leveraging one of the
      most influential existing social relationships in children's lives, the parent-child
      relationship. Using consumer-grade technological devices, such as mobile phones, the
      Ecosystem allows parents to stay involved in the intervention and support their children's PA
      efforts even when they cannot be with their children. In addition, a virtual pet, designed to
      mimic human-pet relationships in the physical world, will guide children to set and meet PA
      goals and offer tailored support.

      Using technology to amplify the power of existing social relationships, children will learn
      to embrace PA as a lifestyle change while supported by their parents and the virtual pet
      within the Ecosystem. Because the intervention is embedded in the context of children's
      everyday lives, our preliminary findings demonstrated the potential of the Ecosystem to
      elicit high levels of engagement and excitement from both children and parents over a 3-day
      intervention period. The next critical question is whether the Ecosystem can maintain
      children and parents' engagement over longer periods of time, yielding sustainable changes in
      health behavior and lifestyle choices that were initiated by the Ecosystem.

      In collaboration with YMCA, 720 children and 720 parents in 24 afterschool programs will be
      randomly assigned to treatment and control groups in a cluster-randomized controlled trial.
      Afterschool programs in the treatment group will receive the Ecosystem intervention for
      3-months; afterschool programs in the control group will not experience the Ecosystem (but
      will receive the standard of care). All children will complete baseline assessments, a
      3-month posttest, and a 6-month and 12-month follow up. Parents and children will provide
      self-report data on their perceived social support, motivation, and PA self-efficacy. PA will
      be assessed with activity monitors, which children will wear throughout the project.

      Our specific aims are:

      Aim 1. Test the hypothesis that at the 3-month, 6 month, and 12-month assessments, children
      assigned to the Ecosystem will evince higher levels of moderate-to-vigorous intensity PA than
      children in the control group.

      Auxiliary Aim 1. For the treatment group only, test the engagement of parents and children
      over the 3-month intervention through tracking the usage frequency and duration of their
      interactions through the Ecosystem.

      Aim 2. Test the parent and child mechanisms of change. Specifically, we hypothesize that
      children and parents in the treatment group will report higher levels of motivation, PA
      self-efficacy, and perceived social support at the 3-month, 6 month, and 12-month follow up
      compared to control children. Moderators of change, such as the child's age and gender will
      also be analyzed.

      The Virtual Fitness Buddy Ecosystem represents a new generation of technology-mediated health
      interventions for children, which integrates fun and engaging technology into existing social
      systems, to promote sustainable lifestyle changes through the intrinsic reward of social
      support. Because the Ecosystem is a cost- and labor-effective solution that integrates
      consumer-grade technology with low barriers for continued use, it has the potential for rapid
      diffusion and widespread public health impact.

    <intervention_model_description>The efficacy of the VFB Ecosystem will be tested using a cluster randomized trial with repeated measures at baseline, posttest (immediately after 3-month intervention), mid-term follow up (6 months post intervention), and a long-term follow up (12 months post intervention). A 3-month intervention period was selected to observe variance in engagement over the course of an academic semester in the afterschool programs. A cluster randomized design is indicated when outcomes are tracked at a group level (afterschool programs) instead of at the individual level (children) and is the preferred method to reduce the impact of dependency in the data. From a pool of 24 demographically matched afterschool programs, we will randomly assign pairs to either receive the Ecosystem or physical activity as usual. Outcomes will be modeled and expressed as changes occurring at the afterschool program level--the unit of randomization.</intervention_model_description>

    <ipd_description>The overriding aim of this project is to help tackle the childhood obesity epidemic, which of national importance. As such, all of the investigators are committed to ensuring widespread dissemination of our findings and to making the technologies developed freely available to other researchers. This will include publishing not just our evaluation results through appropriate scholarly journals and presentations at national meetings, but also our experiences and lessons learned during the design and development process. For example, our design documents will evolve on password-protected website that, upon completion of the project, will be made public (with teacher names removed) with contact details for the investigators included, and will be detailed in publications and presentations.</ipd_description>
