  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The process of developing Gamma Knife radiosurgery treatment plans is today very dependent on
      the level of human expertise resulting in a great heterogeneity of the intrinsic qualities of
      the treatment planning and the quality of care delivered in radiosurgery.

      The existing reverse planning systems, although they have progressed considerably in recent
      years, produce results that are still lower than those achieved by an expert.

      Conventionally, an experienced dosimetric planner will act mainly on the coordinates of the
      position of the isocenters, on the size of the collimators, sector by sector, and on the
      irradiation time of each isocenters. In theory, the combination of these variables provides
      access to billions of combinatorics whose diversity far exceeds the computational
      capabilities of the human mind. The dosimetric planner therefore uses a very small part of
      the spectrum of possible patterns by always reproducing a limited number of empirical
      solutions.

      The company Intuitive Therapeutics has developed a new mathematical algorithm which can
      automatically test in a very short time all the combinatorial possibilities and converge very
      quickly to the solution that best meets the clinical, anatomical and dosimetric objectives
      defined by the neurosurgeon. The quick processing of the system also allows the operator to
      modify the constraints to refine the proposed result in real time.

      The demonstration of the reality of the performances of this algorithm would give the ability
      to even inexperienced users to develop high performance planning for the benefit of the
      patient in terms of optimizing the efficacy / toxicity ratio of the radiosurgery treatment
      results

      The primary objective is to evaluate comparatively the quality of the schedules produced by
      the algorithm developed by the company Innovative Therapeutics to those produced by an expert
      who carried out more than 15000 dosimetric plannings and radiosurgical interventions.

      The main criterion of comparison is the Paddick index.

      The secondary criteria for comparison are:

        -  Compliance index

        -  selectivity index

        -  Gradient index

        -  Maximum, minimum, average dose at risk structures

        -  Dose distribution in the target volume

        -  Treatment time (at equal source activity)

        -  Time of realization of the planning

      It was chosen to treat patients with vestibular Schwannoma OR multiple brain metastases (&gt; 5)
      treated in single session by Gamma Knife OR para-optic meningioma in hypo-fractionated
      treatment on Gamma Knife with restraint mask with inclusion of visual paths in the target
      volume planning.

      The aim of the study is to show at least the non-inferiority of this new method compared to
      the expert user based on the Paddick Index. This index has continuous values between 0 and 1,
      0 being the worst case and 1 being the ideal solution. In order to define the sample size
      needed for each pathology, a pilot phase is required. This phase can be performed
      retrospectively using treatments already defined by the expert user. This pilot phase will
      allow us to identify the difference that can be expected between the index values and the
      variability of this difference. Based on these values we will be able to determine the size
      of the sample allowing us to statistically test the non-inferiority, or even the superiority
      of this new device. The number of cases to be included during the pilot phase should be at
      least ten cases and a maximum of thirty cases. The choice of the number of cases to be
      integrated during this pilot phase will depend on the homogeneity of the differences obtained
      on the first cases. These values will allow us to calculate the size of the samples necessary
      for the study of non-inferiority as well as for the study of superiority. Depending on the
      calculated sizes samples we will make a choice to ensure that this study takes place in the
      expected duration.
