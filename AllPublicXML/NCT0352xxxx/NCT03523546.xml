  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Oncology Episode Payment Model (EPM) is a payment model designed to test the effects of
      better care coordination on health outcomes and costs of care for Hawaii Medical Services
      Association (HMSA) members with cancer who receive chemotherapy.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The EPM is designed to improve community health, to improve care coordination, quality, and
      appropriateness of care, to improve patient experience, and to implement a value-based
      incentive structure that appropriately rewards oncologists for cost-savings and sustained of
      improved quality of care.
