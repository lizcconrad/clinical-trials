      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect of pulse widths &lt;500 µS and &gt;1000 µS on
      clinical outcomes during a temporary SCS trial.

      The proposed study is a prospective, single-center, two arm, randomized, crossover design to
      be conducted at The Ohio Pain Clinic. The study will enroll up to 15 subjects in order to
      include up to 10 subjects in the study. Subjects selected to participate in the trial have
      back and/or leg pain, have been evaluated as a candidate for SCS and have agreed to undergo a
      temporary SCS trial using the Algostim system with percutaneous leads. Each subject will be
      followed during the trial period of approximately 7 days.

      The study will end when the last subject has completed the trial period. exited. The expected
      enrollment period for this study is approximately three months. After exit from the clinical
      study, subjects will continue to be followed by their physician per usual care. All device
      and procedure-related AEs will be collected and reported per the study protocol.

    <measure>Reduction in targeted pain compared to baseline</measure>

    <description>percent reduction in targeted pain compared to baseline using the numeric rating scale. The pain scale we used is the NRS numerical rating scale 0-10 where 10 is the most symptomatic and 0 is no symptoms. We also used a pain relief scale (similar to a brief pain inventory). NRS numeric rating scale and a percentage pain relief scale that you see in our patient report forms. The scale assess pain relief using a percent relief rating in 10% increments, where a higher number represents greater pain relief than a lower number for the pain scale. For the NRS the scale is 0-10 where 10 is severe pain. A higher number is considered better for pain relief scale the Lower number is better for the NRS pain scale</description>
