  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Multiple myeloma (MM) is an incurable malignancy and accounts for 1 percentage of all cancers
      and for 10% of all hematologic malignancies. Subjects with relapsed/refractory multiple
      myeloma (RRMM) will be included in this study, to evaluate the efficacy and safety of
      GSK2857916 monotherapy. Subjects will be treated with GSK2857916 monotherapy until disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity and will be followed for Progression Free Survival (PFS)
      and Overall survival (OS). The subjects will be randomized to receive either frozen
      GSK2857916 at the dose of 2.5 milligram per kilogram (mg/kg) or 3.4 mg/kg Intravenous (IV).
      There will be an independent cohort of subjects who will receive a lyophilized configuration
      of GSK2857916. Approximately 155 subjects will be enrolled in the study of which 130 subjects
      will be enrolled to receive frozen GSK2857916 and 25 subjects will be enrolled in the
      independent lyophilized drug product cohort. The subjects who discontinued from the study
      other than Progressive disease (PD), disease evaluation will continue to be performed at
      3-week intervals until confirmed PD, death, start of a new anticancer treatment, withdrawal
      of consent, or end of the study whichever occurs first.

             to the first dose of study drug.

          -  Symptomatic amyloidosis, active 'polyneuropathy, organomegaly, endocrinopathy, myeloma
             protein, and skin changes' (POEMS) syndrome, active plasma cell leukemia at the time
             of screening.

          -  Prior allogeneic stem cell transplant.

          -  Current corneal epithelial disease except mild punctate keratopathy.

          -  Use of an investigational drug within 14 days or five half-lives, whichever is
             shorter, preceding the first dose of study drug. Prior treatment with a monoclonal
             antibody within 30 days of receiving the first dose of study drugs. Prior BCMA
             targeted therapy.

          -  Evidence of active mucosal or internal bleeding.

          -  Any major surgery within the last four weeks.

          -  Presence of active renal condition (infection, requirement for dialysis or any other
             condition that could affect subject's safety). Subjects with isolated proteinuria
             resulting from MM are eligible.

          -  Any serious and/or unstable pre-existing medical, psychiatric disorder or other
             conditions (including lab abnormalities) that could interfere with participant's

          -  Current unstable liver or biliary disease per investigator assessment defined by the
             presence of ascites, encephalopathy, coagulopathy, hypoalbuminemia, esophageal or
             gastric varices, persistent jaundice, or cirrhosis. Stable chronic liver disease
             (including Gilbert's syndrome or asymptomatic gallstones) or hepatobiliary involvement
             of malignancy is acceptable if subject otherwise meets entry criteria.

          -  Malignancies other than disease under study are excluded, except for any other
             malignancy from which the subject has been disease-free for more than 2 years and, in
             the opinion of the principal investigators and GSK Medical Monitor, will not affect
             the evaluation of the effects of this clinical trial treatment on the currently
             targeted malignancy (MM).

          -  Evidence of cardiovascular risk including any of the following: Corrected QT interval
             Fridericia (QTcF) interval &gt;=470 milliseconds (msecs); Evidence of current clinically
             significant uncontrolled arrhythmias, including clinically significant ECG
             abnormalities such as 2nd degree (Type II) or 3rd degree atrioventricular (AV) block;
             History of myocardial infarction, acute coronary syndromes (including unstable
             angina), coronary angioplasty, or stenting or bypass grafting within six months of
             Screening; Class III or IV heart failure as defined by the New York Heart Association
             functional classification system (NYHA); Uncontrolled hypertension.

          -  Known immediate or delayed hypersensitivity reaction or idiosyncrasy to drugs
             chemically related to GSK2857916, or any of the components of the study treatment.

          -  Pregnant or lactating female.

          -  Active infection requiring antibiotic, antiviral, or antifungal treatment.

          -  Known Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) infection.

          -  Presence of hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), or hepatitis B core antibody (HBcAb
             at screening or within 3 months prior to first dose of study treatment.

          -  Positive hepatitis C antibody test result or positive hepatitis C Ribonucleic acid
             (RNA) test result at screening or within 3 months prior to first dose of study
             treatment. Subjects with positive Hepatitis C antibody due to prior resolved disease
             can be enrolled, only if a confirmatory negative Hepatitis C RNA test is obtained.
