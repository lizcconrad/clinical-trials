  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There are fewer than 30 paediatric intensive care units (PICUs) in the United Kingdom (UK).
      This means that a critically ill child taken to their nearest hospital will need to be
      transferred to a PICU. Such transports are usually done by PICU retrieval teams (PICRTs),
      mobile teams who take specialist expertise to the child and safely transport them to a PICU.

      There are national variations in how PICRTs are organised and deliver clinical care. There
      has been little research into these differences and how they might influence outcomes and
      experiences for sick children and families. The investigators do not know if national
      variation in how PICRT services are organised and delivered matters, or whether current
      standards help achieve the best outcomes for patients. This clinical study aims to understand
      how existing differences in access to paediatric intensive care and care provided by PICRTs
      affect clinical outcomes and experiences for transported critically ill children and
      families. The investigators will analyse routine national audit data to examine various
      aspects such as how long it takes a PICRT to reach the patient, how long it takes the child
      to reach the PICU, the seniority of clinicians performing the transport, medical procedures
      performed by the PICRT and any critical incidents during transport, and investigate whether
      any of these factors influence how likely a child is to survive. The investigators will also
      collect and analyse information about the experiences of sick children by interviewing the
      families involved, and staff experiences of PICU retrieval by interviewing clinicians.
      Alongside this work, the investigators will look at the costs of different ways of delivering
      PICRT services for sick children, and use mathematical techniques to study if and how
      alternate models of service delivery can improve clinical outcomes in a cost effective
      manner. The research team in this trial includes PICU and transport clinicians, parents,
      academic experts and an National Health Service (NHS) commissioner.

      Independent committees consisting of clinicians and parents will be formed to oversee the
      study. The work from this study will directly inform the development of evidence-based
      national standards for PICU transport and help improve the patient experience for critically
      ill children and their families.
