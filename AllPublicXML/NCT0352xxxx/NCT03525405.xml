        herbal products, and non-prescription drugs (except as authorized by the Investigator and
        Medical Monitor) for 14 days prior to clinical research unit (CRU) admission through
        follow-up call.

        8. Subject has not consumed and agrees to abstain from taking any prescription drugs
        (except as authorized by the Investigator and Medical Monitor) during the 14 days prior to
        CRU admission through follow-up call.

        orange-containing products within the 3 days prior to CRU admission and agrees not to
        consume Seville oranges, grapefruit and grapefruit juice through clinic discharge.

        11. Subject has not used tobacco- and nicotine-containing products within 2 months prior to
        the CRU admission and agrees to abstain from using tobacco- and nicotine-containing
        products through clinic discharge.

        12. Subject agrees to abstain from consuming caffeine- or xanthine-containing products from
        3 days prior to CRU admission through clinic discharge.

             evidence of such abuse in the opinion of the Investigator.

          2. Subject has positive findings on urine drug screen (including cotinine).

          3. Subject is positive for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis B and/or

          8. Subject has donated plasma within 7 days of drug administration.

          9. Subject has donated 1 or more pints of blood (or equivalent blood loss) within 30 days

         12. Subject has any condition possibly affecting drug absorption (e.g., gastrectomy,
             cholecystectomy, or other gastrointestinal tract surgery, except appendectomy).

         13. Subject has participated in an investigational drug study within 30 days or 5
             half-lives (whichever is longer) of exposure to another investigational medication
             prior to CRU admission.

         14. Subject is an employee of the Investigator or study center, with direct involvement in
             the proposed study or other studies under the direction of that Investigator or study
