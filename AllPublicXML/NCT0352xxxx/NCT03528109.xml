  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There is strong evidence that cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) with exposure is the
      preferred treatment for youth with anxiety disorders, but outpatient services that provide
      this type of treatment are limited. Even for those who do have access to anxiety-specific
      treatment, a traditional outpatient model of treatment delivery may not be suitable. Among
      the numerous logistical barriers to treatment access and response is the inability to
      generalize treatment tools to settings outside of the office. Patient-centered (home-based)
      treatment models that target symptoms in the context in which they occur could be more
      effective, efficient, and accessible for families. The present study aims to compare the
      efficacy, efficiency, and feasibility of patient centered, home-based CBT with a traditional
      office-based model of care. The question proposed, including proposed outcomes, have been
      generated and developed by a group of hospital, payer, patient and family stakeholders who
      will also contribute to the iterative process of protocol revision. The investigators
      anticipate 333 anxious youth to be randomized to receive outpatient treatment using
      home-based services or treatment as usual using a traditional outpatient model. Results of
      this study are expected to provide evidence for the efficacy and efficiency of
      patient-centered treatment, as well as increase treatment access and family engagement in the
      treatment process.

    <textblock>
      Anxiety disorders are a significant public health problem that cause suffering for youth and
      their families, derail normal childhood development, and when left untreated persist into
      adulthood with high societal costs. Cognitive Behavioral Treatment (CBT) including exposure
      therapy is the treatment of choice, yet multiple barriers limit access to care. Even for
      families with access to care, traditional provider-centered (office based) treatment presents
      challenges and can limit effectiveness for many youth and families. Home- and Community-based
      exposure therapy is efficacious for patients who previously did not improve with
      provider-centered services, and input from family stakeholders suggests that treatment in
      these settings is an optimal match for their needs. Patient-centered models involving home
      visits and provider teams have consistently demonstrated increased treatment accessibility
      and engagement. However, there has been no comprehensive comparison of exposure delivered by
      patient-centered teams using home visits versus by provider-centered office visits alone for
      childhood anxiety. The absence of comparative effectiveness research (CER) data impedes
      targeted use of patient centered versus traditional outpatient treatment and would better
      allocate limited resources, provide the best quality care, and help patients and families
      make educated decisions about their treatment choices. The overall goal of this proposal is
      to compare two models of service delivery, patient-centered delivery (utilizing novel
      deployment of personnel) vs. traditional provider-centered delivery, of CBT in youth ages
      5-18 receiving exposure therapy for anxiety. A total of 333 children will be treated, with
      189 children randomly assigned to each of the treatment conditions. A trained independent
      evaluator (IE) blind to condition will measure patient and family treatment engagement,
      anxiety symptoms/severity, and functional impairment at baseline, during active treatment at
      weeks 6, 12, 18, and 24, and 3- and 6-month follow-up after acute treatment. The primary aims
      are to compare the relative effectiveness of patient-centered vs. provider-centered treatment
      for: 1) improving family treatment engagement/satisfaction, 2) reducing anxiety symptoms, and
      3) reducing associated disability (quality of life and functional impairment). Secondary
      outcomes are to understand moderators of treatment response including: severity of illness,
      caregiver burden/family accommodation, and barriers to treatment access and to explore group
      differences in time course of response, durability of treatment gains, provider
      volume/capacity and efficiency in patient centered versus provider centered treatment.

    <description>The CY-BOCS is a measure of obsessive compulsive symptoms and severity. The Obsession Rating Scale measures 5 domains of obsessional severity on a scale from 0 (no impairment) to 4 (extreme impairment.) The Compulsion Rating Scale measures 5 domains of compulsion severity on a scale from 0 (no impairment) to 5 (extreme impairment.) The total range of OCD severity is reported on a scale from 0-40, with a higher score indicating greater severity.</description>
