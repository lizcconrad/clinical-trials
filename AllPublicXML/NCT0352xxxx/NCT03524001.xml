      RATIONALE:

      Cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) is known to improve cardiac performance and to reduce
      morbidity and mortality in reduced-ejection fraction heart failure (HFrEF) despite optimal
      medical therapy (OMT). Several studies have shown that patients with with left bundle branch
      block (LBBB) respond favourably to CRT, whereas there is less certainty about non-LBBB
      morphology.

      Specifically, whether patients with right bundle branch block (RBBB) and HFrEF benefit from
      CRT is unclear. Some studies suggest lack of favourable outcomes. It follows from this that
      VVI implantable defibrillator are implanted in most RBBB patients.On the other hand right
      ventricular bifocal stimulation could be useful as an alternative approach in patient with
      RBBB. It consists of two endocardial leads implanted in right ventricle. The first lead is
      implanted in His bundle area, and the second lead is in the right ventricle apex. In this way
      bifocal pacing could decrease the inter- and intraventricular delays, thus improving left
      ventricular hemodynamics. However no specifically randomized studies are designed to date.

      PURPOSE:

      To demonstrate the superiority of right ventricular bifocal stimulation over placebo (VVI
      implantable defibrillator) in RBBB and HFrEF despite OMT.

      DESIGN Multicenter prospective randomized, double blind cross-over study. MASKING
      Investigator responsible for device programming is masked from having knowledge about
      clinical, functional, and echocardiographic data. On the other hand echocardiographist is
      masked from having knowledge about stimulation mode. Patients are masked from having
      knowledge about their clinical, functional, and device data.

      POPULATION At least fifty patients would be enrolled. The enrollment period should be one
      year. Study overall duration should be two years.

      ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA RBBB and HFrEF (left ventricular ejection fraction ≤35%) in sinus
      rhythm, in NYHA class II-III or ambulatory IV despite OMT.

      EXCLUSION CRITERIA

      -Refusal or withdrawal of informed consent.Renal failure (glomerular filtration rate ≤ 60
      ml/min).Life expectancy &lt; 12 months.Active neoplasm.Permanent atrial fibrillation.40 days
      following acute coronary syndrome.Atrio-ventricular block (from second degree AV
      block).Valvular heart disease with surgery indications.

      PROTOCOL Each patient undergoes baseline assessment. Pharmacological therapy,
      hospitalization,NYHA functional class, QRS complex informations, type of heart disease and
      comorbidities are collected. Quality of life (QOL) is defined by Minnesota Living with Heart
      Failure questionnaire. Functional capacity is assessed by 6MWT (optionally by cardiopulmonary
      exercise test). Trans-thoracic echocardiogram is performed, analyzing: left-ventricle
      diameters and volumes, left-ventricle ejection fraction (LVEF), left atrial diameter and
      area, TAPSE,valvulopathy,systolic pulmonary artery pressure. All patients undergo bifocal
      right ventricular resynchronization therapy: right atrial lead is implanted, whereas the
      first ventricular lead is placed in His bundle area, and the second ventricular lead in the
      right ventricle apex. Then the leads are connected to the respective channels of a CRT-D
      generator.After the implant, all devices are programmed in VVI mode. After the first 40±10
      days (first f-up) patients are 1:1 randomized to VVI mode 40 beats/minute (placebo arm) or
      bifocal DDD-mode 60 beats/minute (with VV delay 0 msec and optimal AV delay). After six
      months (second f-up) a clinical and instrumental assessment equal to baseline is performed,
      as well as devices electrical parameters control. Then arms cross-over is performed (from
      VVI-mode to bifocal DDD-mode and vice versa). At 12 months (end of follow-up) an evaluation
      equal to that performed at 6 months is assessed. Echocardiographic data are unravelled to the
      investigator responsible for device programming. In this way the stimulation mode able to
      determine the best clinical improved (VVI or bifocal DDD mode) is programmed and the study
      closes.

      PRIMARY ENDPOINT The main assumption is that bifocal stimulation can increase of at least 20%
      the distance walked during 6MWT in respect of baseline and VVI-mode.The primary endpoint is
      the distance walked (expressed by meters) during 6MWT, as assessed at baseline, 6-months
      follow-up and 12 months follow up. Specifically changes in 6MWT observed during bifocal
      DDD-mode compared to baseline and to VVI mode would be significative if there is an increase
      of at least 20%.

      SECONDARY ENDPOINT

      Secondary endpoint is bifocal stimulation therapy response, defined by at least one of the
      following criteria, evaluated at baseline, 6-months follow-up and 12 months-follow-up in
      comparison to baseline and VVI mode:

      NYHA functional class improvement; changes in 6MWT, defined by an increase in distance walked
      major or equal to 30%; LVEF improvement major or equal to 25%;Left ventricular telesystolic
      volume reduction major or equal to 15%

    <description>Secondary endpoint is bifocal stimulation therapy clinical response defined by New York Heart Association functional class scale, that is a method defining functional status of patients with heart failure. It has four categories (scale range: class 1-2-3-4) based on how much patients are limited during physical activity. Class 1 is the better outcome:no limitation of physical activity and ordinary physical activity does not cause fatigue, palpitation, dyspnea. Class 2: slight limitation of physical activity,comfortable at rest;ordinary physical activity results in fatigue, palpitation, dyspnea. Class 3:marked limitation of physical activity;comfortable at rest;less than ordinary activity causes fatigue, palpitation, or dyspnea. Class 4 is the worst outcome:unable to carry on any physical activity without discomfort; HF symptoms at rest and physical activity increases discomfort.</description>
