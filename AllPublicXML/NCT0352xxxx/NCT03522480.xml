    <textblock>
      The Effectiveness of the Jamboxx Respiratory Therapy Device in Treatment of Patients with
      Decreased Respiratory Function is a proposal for investigation of the application of gaming
      to improving respiratory health. The Jamboxx device combines gaming with traditional
      incentive spirometry to provide users with a fun experience to keep them engaged in their
      respiratory therapy routine. The device allows users to play a series of mini-games that walk
      them through their routines. The Jamboxx also records airflow and lung parameters with an
      external mouthpiece attachment to provide users with real time feedback, and helps to assess
      increases or decreases in relative lung function over time. The Jamboxx has the potential to
      significantly impact the field of respiratory therapy by being one of the first gaming
      devices for patient therapy, and the first respiratory therapy gaming device that is
      accessible to users with limited mobility. Jamboxx provides a fun and engaging, low cost
      alternative to the traditional therapy techniques used and aims to improve patient
      compliance.

      This study addresses the ongoing challenge of clearing the burden of bronchial secretions
      resulting from cystic fibrosis. These patients are dependent upon mechanical devices to help
      clear secretions. A device autonomous means for clearing secretions is well defined in the
      literature (autogenic drainage) but is difficult to learn. This study proposes to teach
      cystic fibrosis patients to master autogenic drainage, and seeks to determine at what age it
      can be taught. As it would be expected that gaming could easily teach adults this procedure,
      the study will include children for whom learning autogenic drainage based upon
      conceptualization would be expected to be very difficult.

      Testing Plan: Children will be randomized into one of two groups via a random number
      generation software program

      Group A (education &amp; gaming): Children will participate in 1 initial training session at
      Albany Med where they will be taught by a respiratory therapist (RT) to use autogenic
      drainage: a series of controlled breathing exercises that mobilizes mucous without inducing
      wheezing in patients with reactive airways. Patients will be sent home and prescribed to
      practice the autogenic draining technique 15 minutes three times per week. At week 8 +/- 1
      week patients will return for study visits and will be tested by a software program designed
      to evaluate their ability to perform autogenic drainage sequence (percent accuracy). This
      will be done through a software program installed on the device that uses a series of
      calibration breaths to fit a curve that models the individual patient's idealized autogenic
      drainage sequence, then maps their actual performance to this curve and calculates a percent
      accuracy. At the 8 week visit, the Jamboxx gaming device will be introduced through a
      training session with a RT, which will contain a game to guide them through the proper
      sequence of breathing for the autogenic draining technique. Patients will be sent home with a
      Jamboxx device and requested to do 15 minutes of autogenic drainage training three times a
      week. Patients will return for a research visits at week 16 and again will be tested via
      software program for ability to perform the autogenic drainage technique.

      Group B (gaming only): Children will participate in an initial training session at Albany Med
      where they will be taught by a RT to use Jamboxx respiratory thearpy device to guide them
      through autogenic drainage: a series of controlled breathing exercises that mobilizes mucous
      without inducing wheezing in patients with reactive airways. Patients will be sent home and
      prescribed to use the Jamboxx respiratory therapy device 15 minutes three times per week. At
      week 8 and week 16 +/- 1 week patients will return for study visits and will be tested by a
      software program designed to evaluate their ability to perform autogenic drainage sequence
      (percent accuracy). This will be done through a software program installed on the device that
      uses a series of calibration breaths to fit a curve that models the individual patient's
      idealized autogenic drainage sequence, then maps their actual performance to this curve and
      calculates a percent accuracy.

      This protocol does not replace prescribed chest physiotherapy. There is no alteration of the
      standard of care beyond 15 minutes of autogenic drainage three times per week. Demographic
      data (age, gender, ethnicity) will be collected. Medical records will be evaluated for
      relevant health history, medication use, and hospitalizations including dates.

Beginning in week 8, they will be taught to use autogenic draining technique guided by a videogame through the Jamboxx respiratory therapy device and will be advised to perform the technique regularly using the game for guidance through week 16 Participants in group B will be taught to perform the autogenic draining technique using the Jamboxx respiratory therapy guided by a videogame in week 0, and will be instructed to perform the technique regularly for the next 16 weeks using the game for guidance</intervention_model_description>
