      The purpose of this study is to explore the clinical efficacy between robotic and
      laparoscopic total gastrectomy in patients with clinical Stage I gastric cancer

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Robotic surgery has been developed with the aim of improving surgical quality and overcoming
      the limitations of conventional laparoscopy in the performance of complex mini-invasive
      procedures. The study is designed to explore the clinical outcomes of the robotic assisted
      total gastrectomy by comparing short- and long-term outcomes including financial cost of
      robotic and laparoscopic assisted total gastrectomy in the treatment of clinical Stage I
      gastric adenocarcinoma （cStage IA（T1N0M0）or cStage IB（T1N1M0，T2N0M0））.
