  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research study is designed to investigate the use of a simple cognitive task (a memory
      cue and 10 minute time gap, followed by playing the computer game &quot;Tetris&quot;) for decreasing
      the number of intrusive memories of trauma among young refugees and asylum seekers. The
      design is a single case experimental AB design with or without optional replication (ABAB).
      Participants will aim to complete a no-intervention phase ('A': baseline phase) of one week
      followed by a one-week intervention phase ('B'), including a one-session intervention with a
      researcher comprising the simple cognitive task, followed by instructions to continue to use
      the technique self-guided in the subsequent week. Follow ups are conducted after each week to
      monitor the occurrence of intrusive memories of trauma in a pen-and-paper diary. It is
      predicted that participants will report fewer intrusive memories during the intervention
      phase than during the preceding baseline phase.

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Feasibility and acceptability ratings for using a smartphone game-play intervention</measure>
    <time_frame>Intervention week 1</time_frame>
    <description>Feasibility and Acceptability of the intervention was assessed with 10 self-rated items, e.g. &quot;Would you recommend playing Tetris to a friend?&quot;. Scores could range from 0 - 10 with higher scores indicating greater acceptability/feasibility. Two items had open-ended follow-up questions: &quot;How did you feel about playing Tetris after you had an intrusive memory?&quot; and &quot;Why&quot;? or &quot;How much would you prefer an intervention that is delivered by a computer/smartphone compared to seeing a doctor/psychologist in person?&quot; and &quot;Why&quot;?</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Self-guided intervention adherence - usage of the gameplay intervention in daily life</measure>
    <time_frame>Intervention week 1</time_frame>
    <description>Usage of the gameplay intervention was assessed with 4 self-rated items: 1. Did you play Tetris in the last week since the last meeting? (Yes/No). 2. If yes, how many days did you play Tetris in the last week since we first practiced the game together? 3. How long did you spend playing Tetris at a time? (&lt;10 min - &gt;30 min), 4. How often did you manage to play Tetris after you experienced an intrusive memory? (11-point scale; 0 = not at all; 10 = every time).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Impact of intrusive memories on concentration, control, sleep and stress</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline week 1 and Intervention week 1</time_frame>
    <description>7 self-rated items were used to assess the impact of intrusive memories on concentration, control, sleep and stress: 2 items assessed experienced concentration difficulties due to intrusive memories and in general (11-point scale; high scores indicating more concentration difficulties); 1 item assessed for how long intrusive memories disrupted concentration (&lt;1 min - &gt;60 min), 1 item assessed feeling of control over intrusive memories (11-point scale, 0 = no control; 10 = in full control); 2 items assessed sleep disturbances due to intrusive memories (11-point scale; higher scores indicating more sleep disturbance); and 1 item assessed to what degree intrusive memories affected stress levels (11-point scale, 0 = not at all; 10 = affected very much). Two open-ended questions were included: &quot;How do intrusive memories interfere with your concentration?&quot; and &quot;How do intrusive memories interfere with your ability to settle in to this country and learn new skills, such as a new language?&quot;</description>
