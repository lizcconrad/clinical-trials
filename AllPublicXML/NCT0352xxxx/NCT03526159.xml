  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Herlitz junctional epidermolysis bullosa (H-JEB), an incurable, fatal, inherited skin
      disease, is caused by loss-of-function mutations in the LAMA3, LAMB3 or LAMC2 genes,
      resulting in loss of laminin 332 and poor epidermal-dermal adherence. Eighty percent of H-JEB
      patients have LAMB3 mutations and about 95% of these are nonsense mutations. The
      investigators recently demonstrated that gentamicin readily induced nonsense mutation
      readthrough and produced full-length laminin beta3 in several nonsense mutations tested.
      Importantly, the gentamicin-induced laminin beta3 restored laminin 332 assembly, secretion,
      and deposition into the dermal-epidermal junction (DEJ). Newly induced laminin 332 reversed
      abnormal H-JEB cellular phenotypes. Herein, the investigators propose the first clinical
      trial of gentamicin (by topical and intravenous administration) in JEB patients with nonsense
      mutations. The milestones will include restored laminin 332 and hemidesmosomes at the DEJ,
      improved wound closure, and the absence of significant gentamicin side effects.

      Three subjects (adults and children of any age) will receive topical gentamicin to be applied
      to select skin sites.

      Three subjects (adults and children of any age) will receive intravenous (IV) gentamicin
      infusions.

      Patients will be assessed for Primary and Secondary endpoints during follow up visits.

    <measure>Increased laminin beta 3 / laminin 332 expression as assessed by immunofluorescence.</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>New or increased staining of the target protein, laminin 332, in sections of skin biopsies obtained during follow-up visits in comparison with baseline biopsies. Five micron cryosections will be probed with three different antibodies against laminin 332. Patient samples along with normal control samples will be compared. Mean fluorescence intensity will be calculated for each sample and antibody using ImageJ software. Percent expression relative to normal human skin (set to 100%) will be calculated for each patient sample. Any statistically significant increase in (p value &lt; 0.05) over baseline will be considered improvement.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Incidence of Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>The total number of adverse events and serious adverse events will be recorded and enumerated for each study participant. Gentamicin in high doses is associated with ototoxicity and nephrotoxicity. Audiometry and creatinine clearance tests will be performed throughout the study to monitor for the emergence of any treatment-related adverse events. In addition, as this treatment may result in the production of a protein that is hasn't been present in the patient's system, commercial ELISA tests will be performed on serum samples to test for the emergence of circulating anti-laminin 332 antibodies. Adverse events include a decline of &gt;15 dB on pure tone audiometry at 2 consecutive frequencies, creatinine clearance &lt;60ml/min, presence of antibodies to laminin 332, and for IV gentamicin recipients, serum gentamicin peak levels above 40 ug/ml and trough levels above 2 ug/ml.</description>

    <measure>Generation of new hemidesmosomes as assessed by electron microscopy.</measure>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Improved wound closure.</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>Participants in the Topical arm will treat and monitor specific test sites, along with untreated control sites, selected during their baseline visits. Photographs will be used to assess the size of open erosions. Wound areas (treated and untreated) (cm2) will be measured using computer-assisted planimetry of digital photographs taken throughout the study.</description>

    <measure>Reduction in blistering</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>Participants in the Topical arm will treat and monitor specific test sites, along with untreated control sites, selected during their baseline visits. Photographs and patient diaries will be used to assess the number of blisters that appear at the test sites as well as whether the wound had closed during treatment.</description>

    <description>Gentamicin (formulated as gentamicin sulfate) is a well-known, well-characterized antibiotic that has been used for four decades as a treatment against gram negative bacteria. It, like other aminoglycoside antibiotics, has the well documented added potential to facilitate readthrough of premature termination codons in eukaryotic cells and organisms.</description>
