    <textblock>
      The purposes of this study are to compare the effects of core stabilization exercises on pain
      intensity, functional disability and lumbar stability between using and not using the Swiss
      ball in patients with non-specific chronic low back pain.

      For Patient Registries:

      The participant was screened for inclusion criteria and was asked to sign the informed
      consent prior to participate. A randomized control trial was performed with participants
      randomly divided into one of the two treatment groups: core stabilization exercise with ball
      and core stabilization exercise without ball by using sealed envelopes.
