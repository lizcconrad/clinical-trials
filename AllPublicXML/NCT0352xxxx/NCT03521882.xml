  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Stroke is caused by sudden changes in blood flow in the brain. This can be fatal or can
      result in permanent disability. A fast diagnosis is essential to initiate effective
      interventions and optimize benefits to patients. There are other diseases that can look like
      a stroke and these are called &quot;stroke mimics&quot;. The quicker that stroke mimics can be ruled
      out the faster a stroke can be diagnosed and treatment can be given. We may be able to use
      chemicals in the blood to rapidly confirm that a person has had a stroke. One such chemical
      is called eotaxin. Eotaxin has been found to be changed in sufferers of a stroke but not in
      those with stroke mimics. However, more research is needed to confirm the usefulness of
      eotaxin. This feasibility study aims to provide the foundations to allow a large scale trial
      of this test. The study aims to recruit participants that have had a stroke or a stroke mimic
      from the Acute Stroke Unit and Stroke clinic at the Royal Devon and Exeter Hospital. Up to 6
      blood samples will be taken from each participant at different times over one week. Eotaxin
      will be measured in these samples and in participant's leftover samples taken for clinical
      care. This is needed because we know that the amount of eotaxin changes in the blood after a
      stroke but we do not know how quickly this change happens and for how long the change occurs.
      The study will also allow us to understand how many participants will be needed for a large
      scale trial and the challenges we may face in recruiting participants.
