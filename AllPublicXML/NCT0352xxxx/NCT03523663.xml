  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to create a formal, quantitative methodology to determine what is
      the most beneficial dose of Central Nervous System (CNS) stimulant (Ritalin, methylphenidate)
      to improve cognitive and behavioral function of children diagnosed with Attention Deficit
      Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) individually. If successful, it will change the way in which
      the dose of CNS stimulant for treating ADHD is determined for children in need of therapeutic
      intervention. The project will be focused on developing the necessary methodology to analyze
      the children's data with the drift-decision model (DDM), and to develop the required
      technology, i.e., a computer game with which to measure cognitive/behavioral function and its
      validation with eye-tracking measurements.
