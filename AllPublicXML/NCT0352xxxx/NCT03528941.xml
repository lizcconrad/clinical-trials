    <textblock>
      This observational retrospective study will enroll at least 158 patients affected by Chronic
      Lymphoid Leukemia (CLL) with previous HBV exposure (HBsAg negative, anti-HBc positive with or
      without anti-HBs) treated, with Ibrutinib single agent according to the IWCLL criteria 2008.
      Patients will be divided into two cohorts, one encompassing patients who received lamivudine
      and the second one including patients who received no prophylaxis. Each patient will be
      observed for one year from the first administration of Ibrutinib.
