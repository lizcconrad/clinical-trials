  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Rapid metabolic improvements seen with sleeve gastrectomy are likely a result of changes in
      gastric origin. The gastric mucosa is an endocrine organ that regulates satiation pathways
      and is a complex regulator of food intake as well as lipid and glucose metabolism. This study
      aims to assess the efficacy and safety of endoscopic selective gastric mucosal devitalization
      (GMD) for the management of obesity and its related comorbidities.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Endoscopic approaches to obesity may help fulfill the unmet need of over half the US adult
      population that would benefit from therapy for obesity but are not receiving it. Endoscopic
      approaches to obesity have the potential to be more efficacious than antiobesity medications
      and have a lower risk-cost profile compared with bariatric surgery.

      Endoscopic approaches to obesity need to be increasingly modeled on the proposed mechanisms
      contributing to the benefits of bariatric surgery.

      The investigators seek to decipher if the gastric mucosa is an independent regulator of food
      intake, body weight, lipid and glucose metabolism and serum gut hormones. The investigators
      also wish to ascertain if selective devitalization of the gastric mucosa, without alteration
      in gastric volume, will improve obesity related comorbidities.

      This study will be divided into 3 phases. The purpose of completing the 3 phases is to
      develop a minimally invasive weight loss technique that is effective, safe and ready for more
      rigorous assessment via a future randomized control trial.

      Objectives:

      Overall:

      To assess the efficacy and safety of gastric mucosal devitalization for the management of
      obesity and its related comorbidities

      Phase 1:

      On an ex vivo specimen, identify the optimal color of the tissue indicating that the gastric
      mucosa has been sufficiently treated such that selective mucosal devitalization has occurred.

    <description>Patients will be enrolled into the study after being scheduled to undergo vertical sleeve gastrectomy as part of routine clinical care at Johns Hopkins Bayview. The cost of the surgery will be covered by the patient's insurance and there will no extra procedural element that would add time to surgery.
The intervention will occur on the excised specimen ex vivo (outside the body) and will involve devitalization of the gastric mucosa using Argon Plasma Coagulation.</description>

    <description>During routine laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy surgery, once the greater curvature of the stomach is excised as per normal surgical technique, the investigators will take the specimen out and perform an ablation ex-vivo, with the intention of performing selective mucosal devitalization. This specimen will then be transported to pathology lab for analysis.</description>
