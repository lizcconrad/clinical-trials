  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background: Depression is prevalent and can have devastating effects on the life of
      adolescents. Computerized intervention programs for depression have shown positive results.
      There is less evidence in prevention and early treatment for depression in Latin American
      adolescents.

      Purpose: The purpose of this study is to determine whether a stepped internet-based program
      is effective to prevent and early intervene depression in adolescents attending 9th to 11th
      grade in eight schools in Santiago, Chile.

      Study design: A two-arm cluster-randomized clinical trial will be carried out with
      approximately 600 adolescents.

    <description>The intervention consists of an Internet-based program. The program will last 3 months, with subsequent monthly reinforcement sessions for other 3 months.
The program is stepped, so that the more depressive symptomatology the more intensive program and consists of more components.
The students will interact with the program via a monitoring and feedback e-mail with 3 questions of the PHQ--9- adolescent version (1st, 2nd &amp; 9th question) that they will receive every 2 weeks and a Website that will allow them to access to psycho-educational videos and information. There will also in the Website sections that will provide emergency information, the possibility of a contact via e-mail, and group chats. Adolescents with more depressive symptoms or suicidal risk will be invited to participate in an online counselling appointment or a face to face assessment with a mental health professional of the program.</description>
