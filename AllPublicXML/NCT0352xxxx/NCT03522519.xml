  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Poststroke recovery mainly takes place within the first weeks to months and about 95% of the
      patients reach their maximum recovery 3 months after stroke onset. Poststroke rehabilitation
      is initiated as early as possible and aims to reduce functional consequences of stroke,
      allowing patients to integrate into the community. However, up to 75% of the patients remain
      disabled in the long term. Strikingly, about 20 to 30% of the patients show functional
      decline (i.e., learned-nonuse) in the long term - most often after having finished their
      intensive rehabilitation period - and even stroke survivors who have little or no residual
      disability are less physically active when compared to their age-matched peers.

      Poststroke outcomes can be well predicted early after stroke. However, the deficits early
      after stroke and the outcomes are measured by standardized clinical tests performed in the
      laboratory. The drawback of these tests is that they provide information about the best
      possible abilities of the patients, as they are encouraged by therapists in testing
      situations. This so called &quot;capacity&quot; does not necessarily reflect what patients do in daily
      life situations (i.e., &quot;performance&quot; or &quot;real world use&quot;).

      With the growing interest in the patients' performance, various assessments that objectively
      measure activities in daily life situations have been developed in the last few years. These
      devices capture movement in daily life situations in a sensitive and objective way. An
      additional benefit is that they are less hampered by floor or ceiling effects when compared
      to clinical laboratory measurements (i.e., clinimetrics). Nevertheless, outcome of real world
      performance is hardly ever used in clinical trials aiming to determine the effectiveness of
      stroke rehabilitation interventions. Actually, until today, the natural course of performance
      remains largely unknown, as are predictors for this course. It is also unknown to which
      extend patients' subjective reporting of performance matches objectively measured
      performance. Finally, although it is believed that there is a threshold for, for example,
      real life use of the paretic arm and further improvement, there is no evidence as to what
      this threshold is in terms of clinical laboratory measurements.

      The present prospective longitudinal cohort study fills in the gap regarding knowledge about
      the profile and predictability of two performance outcomes during the first year poststroke:
      engagement in physical activities and the use of the paretic upper limb. In addition, it will
      provide insight in how physical activity engagement and upper limb use measured by daily life
      assessments relate to standard clinical laboratory assessments. This knowledge is a
      prerequisite for the identification of patients' phenotypes and a first essential step
      towards the development of tailored (i.e., precision medicine), innovative rehabilitation
      interventions which enhance performance in terms of physical activities or upper limb use in
      daily life. The ultimate goal is to reduce poststroke disability and associated costs.

      RE-USE is a prospective longitudinal observational cohort study of 120 first-ever stroke
      patients, who will be assessed 3, 10, 28, 90 and 365 days after stroke onset, as well as at
      discharge of the rehabilitation center.
