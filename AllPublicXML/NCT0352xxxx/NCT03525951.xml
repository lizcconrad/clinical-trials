  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Early language intervention is critical to improving the academic, social, vocational, and
      health outcomes of at-risk children under five. This at-risk group includes approximately 1.7
      million children with primary developmental language disorder (DLD), 350,000 children with
      autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and millions in adverse early environments (e.g., 5 million
      children living in poverty; Child Trends, 2017; NCCP, 2017; Norbury &amp; Sonuga-Barke, 2017).
      One cost-effective option for addressing this public health issue is caregiver-implemented
      intervention. Caregiver-training programs have proliferated, but have shown vast individual
      differences in outcomes and limited scalability. This project will address this problem by
      examining caregiver and child-level factors that influence the quality of early
      caregiver-child language interaction and early language intervention outcomes. We hypothesize
      that caregiver language abilities and behavioral awareness are associated with interaction
      quality and intervention outcomes.

    <measure>Caregiver Language Stimulation Strategies</measure>
    <time_frame>Within one study session</time_frame>
    <description>We will code the structured interaction task for parents' use of language stimulation strategies. This primary outcome will be a composite score of these language stimulation strategies (e.g., models, expansions, constructive directives, and scaffolds). This composite will be measured at baseline and after parent training during the structured interaction task, so the same amount of time will be given to each participant to interact. This is a continuous outcome variable, with values greater than or equal to zero. Higher values are generally representative of higher-quality language interactions.</description>

    <description>Caregiver-child dyads will complete a structured interaction task, which will be recorded. Next, the research assistant will conduct the caregiver training in the form of feedback about their communicative interactions with their child including things that are going well and things to try for next time. This feedback will be related to things like modeling, responsivity, providing appropriate support, and expanding on what the child is producing. The caregiver will then interact with the child again as described in the observational interaction procedure.</description>
