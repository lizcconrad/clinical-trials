    <textblock>
      The study evaluate safety and effectiveness of chlorambucil and obinutuzumab in routine
      clinical practice in patients with chronic lymphatic leukemia and with certain comorbidities
      (any cardiac pathology, diabetes mellitus (DM), kidney pathology or cytopenia), whom
      obinutuzumab &amp; chlorambucil have been applied according to indications before enrollment in
      the study.

      MRD (Minimal residual disease) evaluation was chosen as a primary measure outcome as it is
      considered as prognostic marker for long-term progression freee survival (PFS) and as a
      potential therapeutic goal in chronic lymphocytic leukemia/ CLL .

      Minimal residual disease (MRD-negative) is assessed in the clinic by 8-color flow cytometry
      giving the sensitivity level of MRD detection 10-5; MRD is measured in real clinical practice
      at this clinical center according to National recommendations in diagnostics and treatment of
      lymphoproliferative disorders.

      To achieve study objectives medical patients' charts will be analyzed retrospectively. In the
      frame of this program 104 patients' charts treated in defined clinical site, are planned to
      be analyzed. This number of patients corresponds to the patient flow with this pathology at a
      defined clinical site for 1 years.

      Data collection is considered to be retrospective as data will be transferred to e-CRF from
      patient medical charts. During this study no further specific extra procedures for data
      gathering is expected.

      But since patients included in the study will be at the center of ongoing therapy, the study
      was called a prospective.
