  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A phenome-wide association study (PheWAS) identified an association between a variant in the
      human gene for the N2A subunit of the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor, GRIN2A, and
      Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE). A single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in this gene
      encodes for increased NMDA receptor activity. Based on the potential function of the
      associated SNP and published literature, alterations in SNP function signaling may underlie a
      cluster of symptoms. The objective of this study is to evaluate the safety, tolerability and
      efficacy of memantine, an NMDA receptor antagonist, in a precise patient subset with SLE.
      Participants will complete a full 14-week clinical trial, receiving either memantine or a
      placebo. Participants' blood will be drawn to test for various antibodies as well as organ
      function. Patients' urine will also be collected to assess organ function and pregnancy for
      females at a number of specific time points. The overall goal is to develop a safe and
      inexpensive therapeutic approach to reduce debilitating cognitive symptoms in a precisely
      selected SLE sub-population.

    <measure>Change in the Repeatable Battery for Assessment of Neuropsychological Status (RBANS) Total Index Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Visit 1) to Endpoint (Visit 4) - 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>RBANS is a widely used psychiatric tool that objectively measures cognitive impairment. It is comprised of 12 subtests and takes approximately 30 minutes. For scoring, the RBANS index scores are converted to classifications including Very Superior (130 and above), Superior (120-129), High Average (110-119), Average (90-109), Low Average (80-89), Borderline (70-79), and Extremely Low (69 and below). A score of Extremely Low equates to severe cognitive impairment.</description>

    <measure>Incidence of Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Visit 1) to Endpoint (Visit 4) - 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>We will determine the safety of memantine as measured by treatment-emergent adverse events.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Polysymptomatic Distress Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Visit 1) to Endpoint (Visit 4) - 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Polysymptomatic Distress (PSD) scale measures the effect of PSD over a range of pain-related clinical symptoms. The scale was derived from variables used in the 2010 American College of Rheumatology fibromyalgia criteria, modified for use in clinical research, and broadened to be applicable for patients not meeting fibromyalgia diagnostic criteria. The PSD score is calculated by summing two components, the Widespread Pain Index (WPI) and Symptom Severity Scale (SSS). The WPI is a count of painful nonarticular body regions, and the SSS is a symptom severity measure that includes fatigue, sleep, and cognitive problems.</description>

    <measure>Beck Depression Inventory</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Visit 1) to Endpoint (Visit 4) - 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) is a 21-item, self-report inventory that measures depression symptoms and attitudes. It takes approximately 10 minutes to complete and requires a fifth to sixth grade reading level to adequately comprehend the questions.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Visit 1) to Endpoint (Visit 4) - 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) is a self-assessment scale and was developed to detect states of depression, anxiety, and emotional distress among patients who were being treated for a variety of clinical problems. The scale has a total of 14 items, with responses being scored on a scale of 0-3 (3 indicates higher symptom frequencies). Scores for each subscale (anxiety and depression) range from 0 to 21, categorized as follows: normal 0-7, mild 8-10, moderate 11-14, and severe 15-21.</description>

    <measure>Systemic Lupus Erythematosus Disease Activity Index (SLEDAI)-2K</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Visit 1) to Endpoint (Visit 4) - 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>SLEDAI-2K is an updated version of the SLEDAI which was originally developed in 1985 as a clinical index to assess lupus disease activity in the preceding 10 days. It is a cumulative and weighted index of 24 different clinical and laboratory variables/disease descriptors, comprising 9 organ systems. The Investigator will assess disease descriptors on the SLEDAI-2K collection sheet (e.g., arthritis, myositis, alopecia, rash, mucosal ulcers, etc.).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Patient Global Impression of Change</measure>
    <time_frame>Endpoint (Visit 4)</time_frame>
    <description>Participants will answer the standard question, &quot;Considering all the ways your health affects you, how are you doing since the beginning of your treatment?&quot; Answers include very much worse, much worse, worse, unchanged, improved, much improved, and very much improved.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>RBANS Subscales</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Visit 1) to Endpoint (Visit 4) - 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Our primary outcome is the RBANS Total Index Score, which is the sum of several subscales/tests. For a secondary outcome, we will look at each subscale/test individually to see if there is a trend for any one test in particular. The subscales are all scored the same (40 - 160) and include immediate memory, delayed memory, visuospatial/constructional, language, and attention.</description>
