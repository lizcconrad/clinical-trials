  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the effect of TAK-925 after a single intravenous
      dose (compared to placebo) on promoting wakefulness as measured by sleep latency on the
      maintenance of wakefulness (MWT) in sleep-deprived healthy participants.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The drug being tested in this study is called TAK-925. This study will assess the safety,
      tolerability, PK and PD of TAK-925 and will assess the effects of TAK-925 in sleep-deprived
      healthy adult participants.

      The study will enroll approximately 20 participants. Participants will be randomly assigned
      (by chance, like flipping a coin) to one of the 4 treatment sequences—which will remain
      undisclosed to the participant and study doctor during the study (unless there is an urgent
      medical need):

        -  TAK-925 Low Dose + Placebo + TAK-925 High Dose + Modafinil

        -  TAK-925 High Dose + TAK-925 Low Dose + Modafinil + Placebo

        -  Modafinil+ TAK-925 High Dose + Placebo + TAK-925 Low Dose

        -  Placebo + Modafinil + TAK-925 Low Dose + TAK-925 High Dose

      TAK-925 will be administered as an intravenous infusion based on the availability of safety,
      tolerability and PK data from health Japanese participants in ongoing study TAK-925-1001.

      This single center trial will be conducted in the United States. The overall time to
      participate in this study is approximately 10 weeks. Participants will make a final visit 7
      days after receiving their last dose of drug for a follow-up assessment.

    <measure>Latency in MWT</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1</time_frame>
    <description>The MWT is a validated objective measure that evaluates a person's ability to remain awake under soporific conditions for a defined period of time. This tendency to fall asleep is measured via electroencephalography-derived sleep latency. Sleep onset is defined as the first epoch of greater than 15 seconds of cumulative sleep in a 30-second epoch. Trials are ended after 40 minutes if no sleep occurs, or after unequivocal sleep, defined as 3 consecutive epochs of stage 1 sleep, or 1 epoch of any other stage of sleep. If no sleep has been observed according to these rules, then the latency is defined as 40 minutes.</description>

    <description>The KSS scale measures the subjective level of sleepiness at a particular time during the day. On this scale participants indicate which level best reflects the psycho-physical state experienced in the last 10 minutes. The KSS is a 9-item Likert-type rating scale for assessing subjective sleepiness, where 1=very alert, 3=alert, 5=neither alert nor sleepy, 7=sleepy (but not fighting sleep), 9=very sleepy (fighting sleep). Lower score indicates better results.</description>

          3. Has excessive sleepiness defined by a self-reported Epworth Sleepiness Scale score at
             screening greater than 10; irregular work hours; or routine night-shift work within 1
             month before randomization.

          4. Currently experiencing or having a history of any known/suspected sleep disorder, any
             disorder associated with excessive daytime somnolence (EDS), or any diagnosis
             interfering with assessment of sleepiness.

          5. Abnormal findings on the initial polysomnography (PSG) conducted on Day -1 (check-in),
             as specified in the study manual.

          6. Traveled across 2 or more time zones 2 weeks or less before screening.

          7. Caffeine consumption of more than 400 milligram per day (mg/day) for 2 weeks before
