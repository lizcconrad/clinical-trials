  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Recent drug improvement (e.g. abiraterone or enzalutamide) for castration resistant prostate
      cancer (CRPC) patients has improved survival. As treatment strategies improve and patients
      live longer, patients must cope with their treatment-induced adverse effects. Improving
      levels of physical activity (PA) and less amounts of sitting time (e.g. sedentary behavior,
      SB) could have a positive impact on patient's health, non-cancer mortality, and quality of
      life and potentially improve survival.

      The role of PA has not yet been examined in CRPC patients, which is a clear unmet need. No
      specific PA guidelines exist for CRPC patients, but specific guidelines are warranted because
      of advanced disease stage, reduced performance score and comorbidity. It is to be expected
      that the PA level of CRPC patients is lower compared to non-CRPC patients receiving androgen
      deprivation therapy (ADT).

      This study aims to determine the optimal starting physical therapy prescription in CRPC
      patients receiving second line hormone treatment.

      CRPC patients receiving second-line hormone treatment at Ghent University Hospital are
      invited to participate in this phase I 3+3 dose escalation design (escalation to next
      exercise dose per 3 study patients). The prescription start dose is 15min. aerobic training
      (50-80% maximum heart rate (HRmax). warm-up and cooling-down and 65-80%HRmax. core), 1 set
      with 8-10 reps. resistance training (50-60% one repetition maximum (1RM), 8 exercises) and 1
      set (30s.) with 2 reps. flexibility training (5 exercises). Factors determining compliance
      for the dose are tolerance and safety. Tolerance for the exercise prescription will be
      assessed with the Borg scale of perceived exertion after every exercise. Compliant for
      tolerance is a score ≤16. Safety will be assessed by the visual analogue scale (VAS)
      (assessed by the patient) for pain and the CTCAE criteria (assessed by a trained health care
      provider) for bone pain after every exercise. Compliant for safety is ≤3 VAS for
      exercise-induced pain and &lt;grade 2 according to the CTCAE criteria.
