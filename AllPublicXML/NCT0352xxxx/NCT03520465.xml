  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Randomized prospective experimental study, in which the effect of a prophylactic mesh is
      assessed in the eventration rate diagnosed by CT at one year after surgery in patients with
      CRC who underwent elective intervention for supra-infraumbilical midline laparotomy,
      considering as treatment the supra-aponeurotic mesh positioning (experimental group), and
      comparing it to the standard closing with a continuous suture using slow absorption
      monofilament.

      Randomized prospective experimental study, in which we evaluate patients with CRC who
      underwent elective intervention for supra-infraumbilical midline laparotomy in order to:

      Main objective:

      - To assess the effect of the prophylactic mesh in the eventration rate diagnosed by CT at
      one year after surgery in patients with CRC who underwent elective intervention for
      supra-infraumbilical midline laparotomy.

      Secondary objectives:

        -  To compare the appearance of complications in the control group and in the experimental
           group.

        -  Compare costs derived from short and long-term mesh placement in both groups.

      We consider as treatment the supra-aponeurotic mesh positioning (experimental group), and
      compare it to the standard closing with slow absorption monofilament.

    <description>Patients with laparotomy closure by conventional approach of aponeurosis (continuous suture with monofilament of slow absorption), and posterior placement of supraaponeurotic mesh of polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) medium / low density and wide pore. The mesh has a longitudinal measurement that exceeds about 3 cm the upper and lower ends of the wound and width should not be less than 10 cm, therefore the mesh selected is DynaMesh®-CICAT longitudinal measure 10x35 cm.
The mesh is fixed to the aponeurosis with a crown of loose stitches and points to the midline. A prolene 2/0 non-reabsorbable monofilament suture of cylindrical needle is used.
A 10 Fr suction drainage is placed in the supraaponeurotic plane, with an exit to the exterior beyond the edges of the prosthesis. Drainage will be preserved for a minimum of 48 hours after surgery, and will be withdrawn when a debit of less than 50 ml is presented in 24 h.</description>
