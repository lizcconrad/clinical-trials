  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase 2 study of the drug denosumab for the management bone metastases from
      urothelial cancer.

      The purpose of this study is to find out how effective denosumab is in the management of bone
      metastases from urothelial cancer. This will be done by comparing denosumab with standard
      treatment, compared to placebo and standard treatment.

      Denosumab is a monoclonal antibody that binds to a protein called Receptor Activator of
      Nuclear Factor ÎºB (RANK). RANK works by telling certain cells called osteoclasts to break
      down bone tissue. The binding of denosumab to RANK stops it from telling osteoclasts to break
      down bone tissue which may help with symptoms related bone metastases from urothelial cancer.

      This is a multicenter, randomized, double blind, Phase II study. Participants eligible for
      this study have metastatic urothelial cancer and bone metastases and are planned to receive
      4-6 cycles of a standard of care platinum-doublet regimen. In a double blind manner, 50
      participants will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive denosumab 120 mg or matching
      placebo subcutaneously every 4 weeks with their first dose coinciding with the first cycle of
      chemotherapy. Patients will continue on denosumab/placebo even after all planned chemotherapy
      cycles have been delivered and until the end of the study at 18 months after the last dose of
      chemotherapy. Patients with symptomatic progression in the bone may be unblinded and crossed
      over to denosumab (if on placebo). All participants will be provided with 1000 mg of calcium
      and 400 IU of vitamin D to be taken daily. Participants who discontinue the investigational
      product early will be followed for disease status and survival.
