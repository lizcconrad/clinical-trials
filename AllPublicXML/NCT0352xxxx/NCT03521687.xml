      This is a single-center, open-label clinical study to study the efficacy of apremilast in the
      treatment of mild to moderate central centrifugal cicatricial alopecia. The investigators
      hypothesize that the anti-inflammatory properties of apremilast may play a role in the
      decreasing scalp inflammation in patients with CCCA and may prevent further hair loss and
      potentially induce hair regrowth in patients with mild to moderate disease.

      Central centrifugal cicatricial alopecia (CCCA) is a type of scarring alopecia commonly seen
      in women of African American descent. The etiology is not completely understood, but CCCA
      likely results from a combination of hair-grooming practices, a pro-inflammatory state within
      the hair follicles, and genetic factors. The management of CCCA remains a challenge as there
      are no published treatment guidelines. Current therapies aim to decrease inflammation in
      order to prevent further hair loss.

      Apremilast, an oral phosphodiesterase-4 inhibitor, has been shown to be effective in the
      treatment of moderate to severe plaque psoriasis and psoriatic arthropathy. In vitro studies
      have demonstrated anti-inflammatory properties via inhibition of inflammatory mediators.
      Therefore, apremilast offers a possible therapeutic option for CCCA. This will be a
      single-center, open-label clinical study to determine the efficacy of apremilast in the
      treatment of mild to moderate central centrifugal cicatricial alopecia.

    <measure>Change in Physician Global Assessment of Improvement (PGA-I)</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 0 and Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>Change in PGA-I at Week 24 compared to Baseline. Trained study personnel will take standardized photographs of the scalp. These photographs will be provided to a panel of three dermatologists with expertise in CCCA, each of whom will review the photographs at these time points. Investigators will assess the improvement in hair loss severity using PGA-I. PGA-I will range from -3 (significant worsening) to 3 (significant improvement).</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in CCCA Investigator Global Severity Score (IGSS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 0 and Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>Change in IGSS at Week 24 compared to Baseline. Treatment response will be considered no change or improvement in IGSS. CCCA Investigator Global Severity Score (IGSS) assess subjects on a scale of 0 (no hair loss) to 6 (severe CCCA, e.g. &gt;75% involvement of vertex).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Central Hair Loss Grade (CHLG)</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 0 and week 24</time_frame>
    <description>Change in CHLG at Week 24 compared to Baseline. Degree of severity of hair loss is graded on a 6-point visual scale (pattern 0: no hair loss, pattern 1-2: mild hair loss, pattern 3-5: more severe hair loss).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in subject visual analog scale (VAS) of hair loss severity</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 0, Week 12 and Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>Change in VAS at Week 12 and 24 compared to Baseline. The VAS is a numerical scale used to assess patients' perception of hair loss severity. The evaluation is a 10cm long line on which the subjects indicate the severity of their condition from &quot;0&quot; (complete loss of hair in affected area - ie no visible hairs on central scalp) to &quot;10&quot; (full growth/regrowth in affected areaâ€”ie no visible hair loss on central scalp).</description>

    <measure>Subject Global Assessment of Improvement</measure>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in subject rating of symptom severity questionnaire (NRS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 0, Week 12 and Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>Change in NRS at Week 12 and Week 24 as compared to Baseline. Subjects will complete a symptom severity questionnaire consisting of 3 numeric rating scales (NRS) measuring severity of pruritus, burning, and pain. The NRS will range from 0 (no symptoms) to 10 (severe symptoms). Patients indicate the intensity of each symptom (pruritus, burning, or pain) by choosing a number from 0 to 10 that corresponds to the severity of that symptom.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from baseline in Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) total score</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 0 and Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>Change in DLQI total score at Week 24 as compared to Baseline. DLQi is a 10-item questionnaire, each question is scored from 0 to 3, giving a possible score range from 0 (meaning no impact of skin disease on quality of life) to 30 (meaning maximum impact on quality of life).</description>

             within the last 3 years.

          -  Pregnant or breast feeding.

          -  Subjects not willing to implement the following suggested hair care practices and/or

             7 days with a conditioning shampoo; Condition hair every 7 days with a deep or
             reconstructive conditioner; Towel-dry hair before exposing it to a dryer to minimize

             thermal injury to scalp during hair styling process; Chemical relaxer treatments can
             be used as long as there is no associated scalp injury (i.e. tingling, burning, pain);
             Maintain the same hair style throughout the study i.e. weave or braids present at
             baseline must be maintained through the end of the study; weaves or braids may be
             redone during the study if needed, but should resemble the subject's hair style at
             baseline, if possible.

          -  Use of any investigational drug within 4 weeks prior to randomization, or 5
             pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamics half-lives, if known (whichever is longer).
