  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Syncope, a frequent reason for emergency room visits and hospitalization, is a symptom of
      three major etiological entities: cardiac causes, vaso-reflex causes and orthostatic
      hypotension. The etiological diagnosis is often uncertain and the prognostic assessment
      orients the outcome of the patient. The vast majority of syncope management costs are related
      to hospitalizations. Hospitalization in the immediate aftermath of emergency care is
      justified by a short-term prognosis. The current relevance of hospitalizations and the
      prognostic assessment of syncope is questioned.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The improvement of cardiac troponin assay techniques has increased its sensitivity to detect
      myocardial ischemic conditions, even at the expense of a loss of specificity. Myocardial
      infarction type 2 is due to an imbalance between needs and oxygen supply to cardiomyocytes at
      the time of an increase of the first and / or a decrease of the second and is favored by an
      underlying cardiovascular field fragile. Syncope, because of the low flow that they imply,
      can be the cause of a type II myocardial infarction on fragile cardiovascular ground.

      The study is prospectively conducted in all patients admitted for syncope to assess the
      actual diagnostic performance of hypersensitive troponin in the syncope risk stratification.
      The primary benefit is to identify patients at risk of serious cardiac events in the short
      term. The secondary benefits expected from the study are a decrease in unjustified
      hospitalizations of patients admitted to the emergency for syncope and thus a decrease in the
      cost of care.

      The validation of the indication of the troponin assay in the stratification of the risk
      after a syncope passes by its prospective evaluation in a prognostic study.

    <description>Telephone follow-up at one month, 3 months and 6 months by a clinical research technician. Collection of serious adverse events, reports of hospitalization.
The hypersensitive troponin assay will be recently proposed in a short-term risk stratification score after syncope (30 days), the canadian syncope risk score. If hypersensitive troponin benefits from interesting performances it needs to be evaluated prospectively, as measured only in 47.9% of syncope in this study. Hypersensitive troponin could be a prognostic marker of early serious adverse cardiovascular events in syncope.</description>

        Knowing that the number of malaise admitted per year to emergencies is 3972 (2016 data),
        and 20% are syncope (about 800 syncope per year), recruitment can be done in 12 months.

        248 patients admitted for syncope.
