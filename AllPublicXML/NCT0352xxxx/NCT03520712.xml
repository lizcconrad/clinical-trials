             evidenced by medical history, at the time of signing the informed consent.

             total antibody ELISA

          3. Treated/exposed to FVIII concentrates or cryoprecipitate for a minimum of 150 exposure
             days (EDs)

          4. Subject must have been on prophylactic FVIII replacement therapy for at least 12
             months prior to study entry.

          5. Willing and able to provide written, signed informed consent after the nature of the
             study has been explained and prior to any study-related procedures.

          6. No history of FVIII inhibitor, and results from a Bethesda assay with Nijmegen
             modification of less than 0.6 Bethesda Units (BU) on 2 consecutive occasions (the most
             recent one of which should be tested at the central laboratory) at least one week
             apart within the past 12 months

          7. HIV positive patients may be enrolled, only if the patient has a CD4 count &gt; 200/mm³
             and an undetectable viral load.

          8. Sexually active participants must agree to use an acceptable method of double barrier
             contraception for at least 6 months post-infusion, which may include hormonal
             contraception for a female partner. After 6 months, subjects may stop contraception
             use only if they have had 3 consecutive semen samples with no detectable viral vector
             DNA.

          9. Willing to abstain from consumption of alcohol for at least the first 26 weeks
             following valoctocogene roxaparvovec infusion.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Any evidence of active infection or any immunosuppressive disorder, except for HIV
             infection as described in the inclusion criterion above.

          2. Significant liver dysfunction with any of the following abnormal laboratory results:

               -  ALT (alanine transaminase) or AST &gt;2X ULN

               -  Alkaline phosphatase &gt;2X ULN or

               -  INR (international normalized ratio) ≥ 1.4

             Subjects whose liver laboratory assessments fall outside of these ranges may undergo
             repeat testing and, if eligibility criteria are met on retest, may be enrolled after
             confirmation by the Medical Monitor. In addition, subjects with abnormal laboratory
             results related to confirmed benign liver conditions (eg, Gilbert's syndrome) are
             considered eligible for the study notwithstanding their abnormal laboratory results
             and may be enrolled after discussion with the Medical Monitor.

          3. Prior liver biopsy showing significant fibrosis of 3 or 4 as rated on a scale of 0-4
             on the BattsLudwig (Batts 1995) or METAVIR (Bedossa 1996) scoring systems, or an
             equivalent grade of fibrosis if an alternative scale is used

             therapy

         10. Active malignancy, except non-melanoma skin cancer

         11. History of hepatic malignancy

         12. History of arterial or venous thromboembolic events (eg, deep vein thrombosis,
             nonhemorrhagic stroke, pulmonary embolism, myocardial infarction, arterial embolus),
             with the exception of catheter-associated thrombosis for which anti-thrombotic
             treatment is not currently ongoing.

             patient from fully complying with the requirements of the study (including possible
             corticosteroid treatment outlined in the protocol) and/or would impact or interfere
             with evaluation and interpretation of subject safety or efficacy result.

         17. Prior treatment with any vector or gene transfer agent

         18. Major surgery planned in the 26-week period following the infusion with valoctocogene
             roxaparvovec

         19. Use of systemic immunosuppressive agents, not including corticosteroids, or live
             vaccines within 30 days before the valoctocogene roxaparvovec infusion

         20. Concurrent enrollment in another clinical study, unless it is an observational
             (noninterventional) clinical study that does not interfere with the requirements of
             the current protocol or have the potential to impact the evaluation of safety and
             efficacy of valoctocogene roxaparvovec and with prior consultation with the Medical
             Monitor

         21. Known allergy or hypersensitivity to investigational product formulation

         22. Unwilling to receive blood or blood products for treatment of an adverse event and/or
             a bleed
