    <textblock>
      The Habitual Diet and Avocado Trial will evaluate the effects of providing one avocado per
      day for recommended consumption over a 6 month period in a cohort of approximately 1000
      free-living participants with increased waist circumference in comparison with a control
      group that will maintain their habitual diets. Participants will be recruited and screened at
      4 clinics in 4 locations: Pennsylvania State University; Loma Linda University; UCLA, and
      Tufts University (250 per site).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Preliminary evidence suggests that consumption of avocados can modulate body weight, food
      intake and markers of metabolic syndrome and may reduce visceral adiposity. Visceral adipose
      tissue is positively correlated with risk of cardiometabolic syndrome that predisposes to
      cardiovascular disease and diabetes. The Habitual Diet and Avocado Trial (HAT) aims to
      investigate an impactful outcome (visceral fat reduction) in a relevant population (Americans
      with an increased weight circumference) with a reasonable lifestyle modification (consumption
      of 1 avocado per day). HAT will evaluate the effect of providing one avocado per day for
      consumption over a 6 month period on established health parameters, including visceral
      adiposity, hepatic lipid content, markers of metabolic syndrome and high sensitivity
      C-reactive protein (hsCRP) when compared to a habitual diet. Blood specimens will be drawn
      and analyzed for fasting total cholesterol, triglyceride, HDL-C, glucose, insulin, hsCRP and
      RBC fatty acid profiles. Two non-contrast MRIs will be performed (at screening to assess
      eligibility and final participant visit 8 for randomized participants) to assess the volume
      of visceral adipose tissue and hepatic fat fraction. Four 24-hour dietary recalls will be
      conducted for study participants to capture dietary intake data. Questionnaires include the
      following: health and demographic including eating habits and physical activity; diet, food
      and avocado satisfaction (intervention group only); quality of life; and quality of sleep.

    <intervention_model_description>This clinical trial aims to assess the effect of providing one avocado per day on established parameters of health in comparison with a control group maintaining their habitual diets. Participants are pre-screened over the telephone initially to assess eligibility and likelihood of compliance. For those that remain eligible, additional screening is conducted at a study visit. Participants' eligibility is confirmed by the data entry system on the trial website when the Inclusion/Exclusion form is complete and entered. Randomization is performed automatically by the data entry system using a block design and stratified by site. Participants are randomly assigned to one of two equally sized groups. Neither participants nor staff will be blinded to intervention assignment. Both groups are instructed to continue to follow their habitual diet but the intervention group will receive one avocado per day. Participants are followed for outcomes for a six-month period.</intervention_model_description>

    <description>All participants will complete the RAND (research and development) 36-Item Health Survey to assess 8 health concepts: physical functioning, bodily pain, role limitations due to personal or emotional problems, emotional well-being, social functioning, energy/fatigue and general health perceptions.All items are scored so that a high score defines more favorable health state. Each item is scored on a 0 to 100 range so that the lowest and highest possible scores are 0 and 100. Items in the same scale are averaged together to create 8 scale scores. Items that are left blank are not taken into account when calculating scale scores.</description>

    <description>The 20-item Short Form Health Survey (SF-20) was designed to reduce respondent burden while achieving minimum standards of precision for purposes of group comparisons involving multiple health dimensions. It includes 7 items to assess physical functioning, 2 items on role functioning, 1 social functioning survey item, 5 items to assess mental health, 4 items on current health perceptions and 1 item on pain.

    <description>Four 24-hour dietary recalls will be conducted for each study participant during the course of the study. The goal for the 3 intra-study recalls is to capture intake data for 2 weekdays and 1 weekend day for each participant. The recalls are collected and analyzed using Nutrition Data System for Research (NDSR) software Vs 2017. The Loma Linda University site and Tufts University will be responsible for collecting 50% each of the 24 hour recalls across all study sites. They will follow a standardized manual of procedures for dietary data collection and dietary data management. Outcome data from NDSR will include daily estimated energy and nutrient intake, as well as food, food group and dietary supplement data.</description>
