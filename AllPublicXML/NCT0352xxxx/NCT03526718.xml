  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Despite decades of a solid leprosy control program, including active case finding and
      follow-up on therapeutic outcome, the Comoros islands of Anjouan and Moheli continue to be
      hyperendemic for leprosy, with leprosy case notifications far exceeding those for
      tuberculosis, while the third island, Grande Comore, presents few cases. The high proportion
      (31% in 2015) of disease in children indicates that recent transmission is a major driver of
      the persistent endemicity, and that present control measures are not sufficient. The low
      proportion (2.6% average in last 10 years) of grade II disabilities in newly diagnosed cases
      indicates that case detection is early.

      The main objective of the present proposal is to identify which persons would most benefit
      from prophylactic treatment. The secondary objective is to unravel human, bacterial and
      environmental risk factors for transmission of and progression to leprosy disease, with the
      ultimate goal to reduce the leprosy incidence.. The program has remaining expertise to
      re-establish laboratory confirmation of leprosy patients, allowing to optimize and validate
      molecular genotyping techniques to complement conventional epidemiological investigations in
      a 3-year prospective cohort of leprosy patients and their close contacts, aiming to identify
      transmission links. A third objective is to document diagnostic delays in more detail

      As the leprosy control programme has initiated a pilot study on rifampicin prophylaxis in
      four villages on Anjouan in 2015, a prospective cohort study will permit measuring the
      leprosy incidence in close contacts as well as those in neighboring houses, who did or did
      not receive rifampicin prophylaxis.

      The expected outcome of this project will be to identify risk factors for leprosy
      transmission. Specifically, we expect to identify those contacts at highest risk of
      developing leprosy disease, who would most benefit from rifampicin prophylaxis or other
      preventive measures.

    <description>Incidence rate ratios among the contacts by proximity to the index patients will be calculated. Classification of contacts in proximity groups is a dynamic process. Persons belonging to the same household, surrounding households, entire village, or entire island may shift to closer proximity groups when leprosy patients are diagnosed in their environment. Since date of diagnosis, and any recent migration, will be recorded for each patient, we will be able to reallocate contacts to other circles and attribute to each contact a period of exposure within each circle.</description>

    <description>Transmission links will be defined as identical genotypes based on their &quot;variable number of tandem repeat(VNTR)&quot;- profile. The definition of clustering will be based on comparison of the copy number of the VNTRs using two different stringencies: either considering those that presented identical copy number for all 17 alleles, or considering those that had identical copy number excluding the most variable loci.</description>

        The Comoros islands, located between Madagascar and Mozambique, continue to be hyperendemic
        for leprosy. Periodic active case finding across the entire island of Anjouan is in place,
        resulting in early case detection, and every patient identified is being treated with
        highly effective multi drug therapy. Nevertheless, the high proportion of leprosy in
        children (31% were &lt;15y old in 2015) in combination with a low relapse rate (&lt;2%) indicate
        transmission continues unabated. The majority of the patients in Anjouan are
        paucibacillary.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  in the prospective cohort study: All newly diagnosed leprosy patients (any age) on the
             island of Anjouan who provide written informed consent.

          -  In the in-depth interviews: Patients who are part of a cluster and provide written
             informed consent. Additional written informed consent will be asked for questions in
             which the identity of other member(s) of a cluster needs to be revealed.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  in the prospective cohort study: None.

          -  In the in-depth interviews: Patients belonging to clusters not extending beyond the
             same first or second circle
