  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A multiple-ascending-dose (MAD), randomized, placebo-controlled, blinded trial to evaluate
      the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of Elafin in healthy adult
      subjects. The purpose of this study is to assess Elafin that is being developed for treatment
      of PAH. Elafin inhibits elastase, an enzyme that is increased in pulmonary hypertension and
      is a major factor in the development of PAH. Elafin will be administered subcutaneously daily
      for 7 days in normal healthy subjects followed over a 28 day time period.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There will be a total of up to 30 subjects randomly assigned to 5 groups with 6 subjects in
      each group. One subject in each group will be assigned to placebo drug and 5 subjects to
      active drug. Subjects in each group will receive a single daily dose of Elafin/Placebo for
      total of 7 days. There will be ascending doses across groups. Groups receiving a higher dose
      will only do so after the previous group has completed dosing (i.e., 7 days). Each subject
      will be followed over a 28 day time period.

      An interim trial analysis will occur after completion of the 2nd cohort in order for the
      research team to review PK and safety data to determine modification (if needed) of dosing
      strategy for groups 3-5. The study is also designed to absorb a de-escalation strategy. If
      the protocol requires a lowering of dose from the initial dosing, a new group will be
      assigned a low-dose subcutaneous Elafin regimen.

      The study will conclude at any dose that produces clinically significant adverse effects and
      identified as Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD).
