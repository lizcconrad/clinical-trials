    <textblock>
      The aim of the present research is to test the effect of helping people to reward themselves
      when they have successfully lost weight and the impact this will have on subsequent weight.
      Each participant will be randomly allocated to one of four conditions. The trial requires 200
      participants to perform a fully powered statistical analysis. The four conditions are: (1) a
      control condition, (2) intervention 1 (form a single self-incentivising implementation
      intention from a drop-down menu), (3) intervention 2 (form multiple self-incentivising
      implementation intentions from a drop-down menu), or (4) intervention 3 (asked to form a
      single self-incentivising implementation intention of their own devising). The main outcome
      measure will be BMI, which will be self-reported.

    <description>Single self-incentivising implementation intention
After completing a questionnaire, participants will be asked to form a self-incentivising implementation intention:
Research shows that rewarding yourself for success can help you to lose weight, but that people often forget to reward themselves. We want you to plan to reward yourself if you achieve your personal weight-loss goal, at the end of 4 weeks. To help you do this, we would like you to complete the following sentence by telling us how you will reward yourself.
Please complete the following sentence with a reward of your own choosing.
If I lose at least ___lbs/kg by the end of 4 weeks, then I will reward myself by…
