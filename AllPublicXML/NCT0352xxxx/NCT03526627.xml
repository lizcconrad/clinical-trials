    <time_frame>3 months for each interval and 4 times on each patient (total 9 months on this study)</time_frame>
    <description>we use a modified questionnaire &quot;assessment the medical needs and preference on terminal patients and their families (Tang, et al., 2004) by literature review and named &quot;The prognosis and message status on patients with advanced Heart failure. the questionnaire include 3 parts: medical preference in their advanced status, communication between physician and patients and physician and their families ( the definition of families in this study is the major medical decision for the patients), and the knowledge of disease prognosis. The questionnaire include 17 items with continue and category variables. Before study we use expert validity from 5 experts who works in group at least 10 years. Each items is scored on a five-point Likert scale range from 0(not at all) to 4 (very appropriate to this study). The overall score was calculated as the average of all items and finally we got 3.67-points.</description>
