  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      One in five women will undergo prolapse surgery in their lifetime, and there is a strong
      correlation between prolapse and urinary incontinence. Pelvic floor surgeons aspire to
      improve relevant quality of life outcomes for women with pelvic floor disorders while
      minimizing complications and unnecessary procedures. There has been an experience of
      disappointment and frustration when a patient returns following POP repair with new symptoms
      of SUI that she ranks as a greater disruption to her quality of life than her original
      vaginal bulge. While retropubic (RP) slings are considered to be the &quot;gold-standard&quot; referent
      for other slings with long-term outcomes data, they are associated with the highest risks of
      intra- and post-operative complications including bladder injury, bleeding, and
      post-operative voiding dysfunction. Single-incision slings (SIS) are the latest iteration in
      sling development that build upon the benefits of slings but avoid passage through the
      muscles of the inner thigh. The hypothesis for this study is that single-incision slings
      (Altis ™) are non-inferior to Retropubic mid-urethral slings when placed at the time of
      native tissue vaginal repair.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Pelvic floor surgeons aspire to improve relevant quality of life outcomes for women with
      pelvic floor disorders while minimizing complications and unnecessary procedures. Efficacy
      and risk always compete for equilibrium. Level I evidence has demonstrated a positive
      efficacy benefit of a concomitant synthetic mid-urethral sling in women with, and without,
      pre-operative symptoms of SUI who are undergoing POP repair. Concomitant sling placement has
      been shown to reduce the risk of de novo or persistent SUI from 50% to 23%. The combination
      of surgical treatment of POP and SUI at the same time, however, increases the risk of
      incomplete bladder emptying. While retropubic (RP) slings are considered to be the
      &quot;gold-standard&quot; referent for other slings with long-term outcomes data, they are associated
      with the highest risks of intra- and post-operative complications including bladder injury,
      bleeding, and post-operative voiding dysfunction. Single-incision slings (SIS) are the latest
      iteration in sling development that build upon the benefits of slings but avoid passage
      through the muscles of the inner thigh. As the combination of POP and sling surgery increases
      the risk of voiding dysfunction, and rates of incomplete bladder emptying appear
      significantly lower for SIS than RP slings, the study team hypothesizes that the use of the
      Altis ™ SIS will be non-inferior to RP slings in efficacy and superior in irritative voiding
      symptoms/voiding dysfunction at one year after combined surgery.

    <description>A 1.5 cm incision will be made at the mid-urethra through a separate vaginal incision with lateral dissection with Metzembaum scissors. After placement of both trocars, cystoscopy with a 70-degree scope will be performed to assess for bladder and urethral injury. Surgeons will set the tension of the tension-free vaginal tape (TVT) slings so that a spacer can be placed between the sling and the urethra. Sling tensioning will be performed after anterior and apical prolapse is corrected.</description>

    <description>The sling is introduced through a single anterior vaginal incision of 1.5 cm at the mid-urethra. The sling/needle assembly is advanced behind the ischiopubic rami in a transobturator trajectory toward the obturator space bilaterally.The needle is then removed by simply sliding the fixating tip back out. The other side is then completed in an identical fashion. After the fixation of the two anchors at the 2 and 10 o'clock positions, the patient's bladder is filled with 250 mL of NaCl. Afterward, an intraoperative crede maneuver is performed and the tension adjustment suture is pulled, when necessary, to achieve the desired continence. The mesh will lie in direct apposition to the urethra. The adjustment thread is then cut short and the vaginal incision is closed with an absorbable suture.</description>
