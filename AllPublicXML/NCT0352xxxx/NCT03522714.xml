  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective is to compare the efficacy of the FIS on closure rate to the AFB after
      2 weeks of operative debridement and closure.

      Secondary Objectives:

        1. Compare the complication rate in each treatment group during the acute postoperative
           period (2 weeks).

        2. Comparisons of the inflammatory and bacterial microbiomes of pressure ulcers following
           surgical therapy.

        3. Comparisons of baseline patient characteristics and their relationship to both early and
           late pressure ulcer recurrence, and complication rates.

        4. Assessment of outcomes and complications associated with flap technique and surgeon
           guided descriptions of the operative closure.

        5. Compare the absolute costs associated with the FIS System against AFB system.

        6. Compare the acceptance of each system by subjects and nursing staff, including the
           parameter of patient comfort at 7 and 14 days postoperative.

        7. Assessing the incidence of complications and additional treatments needed following the
           two week study period.
