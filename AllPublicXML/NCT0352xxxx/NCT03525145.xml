  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Platelet function testing has been considered for DAPT strategy adjustments to reduce the
      patient's risk of ischemia and bleeding. Although several previous RCT studies did not find
      any benefit in the detection of platelet functionï¼Œ the previous studies were mostly low-risk
      populations, and the P2Y12 receptor antagonists were simply clopidogrel, and the detection
      methods were relatively simple. Therefore, the need for platelet monitoring in high-risk ACS
      patients receiving new potent P2Y12 inhibitor ticagrelor, as well as the diagnostic threshold
      for different platelet function assays needs further study. In addition, due to the
      differences on the response to anti-platelet drugs between the East and the West, it is not
      appropriate to simply refer to the conclusion of the other party. However, as of now, there
      is no large sample randomized controlled study systematically focused on the applicability
      and status of platelet function tests in East Asian populations, especially Chinese
      populations.
