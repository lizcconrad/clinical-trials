        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Medical Conditions

               1. Pregnant or nursing women

               2. Central nervous system metastases, unless stable for at least 4 weeks and no
                  longer requiring steroid therapy.

               3. Patients with an autoimmune disease or with a condition requiring systemic
                  treatment with either corticosteroids (&gt; 10 mg daily prednisone equivalent) or
                  other immunosuppressive medications may be permitted to enroll only after
                  discussion with the study P.I.

               4. Participants with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) or acquired immunodeficiency
                  syndrome (AIDS)

               5. Viral hepatitis

             i. Participants with active hepatitis B (positive hepatitis B surface antigen [HBsAg]
             or hepatitis C virus (HCV) (positive HCV RNA) are excluded ii. Patients with past
             Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection or resolved HBV infection (defined as the presence
             of hepatitis B core antibody [HBcAb] and the absence of HBsAg) are not ineligible, but
             HBV DNA quantification must be performed and results discussed with the P.I.

             iii. HBV carriers or those participants requiring antiviral therapy are not eligible
             to participate.

             iv. Patients positive for HCV antibody are eligible only if polymerase chain reaction
             (PCR) is negative for HCV RNA after discussion with the study P.I.

             f. Participants with a prior malignancy active within the previous 2 years may be
             permitted to enroll only after discussion with the study P.I. Examples might include
             locally curable cancers that have been apparently cured, such as squamous cell skin
             cancer, superficial bladder cancer, or carcinoma in situ of the prostate, cervix, or
             breast.

             g. Organ transplant recipients with a functioning allograft will be excluded from this
             study.

             experienced a toxicity to immunotherapy that, in the opinion of the investigator,
             would make it unsafe to restart therapy. Examples may include a Grade 3 or greater
             immune mediated adverse event that was considered related to previous immunotherapy
             and required immunosuppressive therapy, or an immune mediated adverse event that was
             considered related to previous immunotherapy and is still &gt; grade 1 despite
             administration of immunosuppressive therapy. Exceptions may include Grade 3
             ophthalmologic immune-mediated events that improved to Grade 1 within 2 weeks after
             topical therapy only, or Grade 3 endocrine immune-mediated events that did not result
             in symptoms lasting &gt;6 weeks and are not requiring &gt;7.5mg prednisone or equivalent per
             day.

          2. Allergies and Adverse Drug Reaction

               1. History of severe allergy or hypersensitivity to study drug components.

               2. Patients with a history of a severe toxicity to an immune checkpoint blocking
                  drug may be permitted to enroll only after discussion with the study P.I.

          3. Other Exclusion Criteria

               1. Prisoners or participants who are incarcerated may be permitted to enroll only
                  after discussion with the study P.I.

               2. Participants who are detained for treatment of either a psychiatric or physical
                  (e.g., infectious disease) illness.
