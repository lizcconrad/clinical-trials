  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study investigates the effects of a new infant formula on growth, safety, and tolerance
      in healthy term Chinese infants.

      Screening starts after the informed consent is obtained. Infants who are less than or equal
      to 28 days of age and meeting all eligibility criteria will be enrolled into the study. The
      total duration of the study is around 12 months which includes 8 study visits.

      Infants, whose mother has the intention to fully breastfeed her infant at least until 17
      weeks of age will be enrolled into the breastfeeding reference group. Infants, whose mother
      has the intention to fully formula feed her infant as of 28 days of age at the latest, will
      be randomized to receive either the investigational product or control product until infants
      reach the age of 17 weeks. After the age of 17 weeks, infants can switch to any feeding and
      continue be followed up until 12 months of age.

      Safety, growth and tolerance parameters will be followed and collected throughout the study.
