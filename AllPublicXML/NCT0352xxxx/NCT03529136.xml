  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Decompensated liver cirrhosis is one of the life-threatening complication of chronic liver
      disease. Liver transplantation currently is the only effective method that can improve the
      survival of these patients. However, the severe shortage of donor livers, high cost, and
      potential serious complications have restricted the availability of liver
      transplantation.Umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells (UC-MSC) has been generally shown to be
      safe and effective for liver diseases in some pre-clinical and clinical studies. This study
      aim to evaluate the safety and efficiency of human umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cell
      transfusion in patients with decompensated liver cirrhosis, and explore the best protocol of
      MSC transfusion.

      This study is a multicenter non randomized control study. Patients with decompensated liver
      cirrhosis are going to be assigned to receive standard medical care plus UC-MSC treatment
      with two different protocol (group 1 and group 2) or standard medical care (control). Four
      times of MSC infusion (1.5x10E6 cells/kg body weight) via peripheral vein will be given to
      the group 1（once every 4 days), and two times of MSC infusion once every 7 days to the group
      2. The primary outcome is survival rates in one year. Secondary outcomes are liver function,
      liver ascites and MELD score.

    <description>Human umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells have driven from Wharton's jelly and cultured with serum-free medium in Shandong Cell and tissue bank. All of the cells in this study within three passages. Before transfusion, the mesenchymal stem cells were subjected to quality control. The UC-MSC were stained with anti-CD90-FITC, Anti-CD44-FITC, Anti-CD34-FITC and anti-45-FITC.</description>
