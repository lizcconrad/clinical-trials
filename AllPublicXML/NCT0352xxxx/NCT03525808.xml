      This study is a prospective, single arm, multi-center trial. Treatment of up to 40 patients
      will take place at up to 6 clinical centers. Patients who meet all eligibility criteria will
      receive the AXIOS stent for up to 60 days stent indwell and 6 months follow-up after stent
      removal.
