      This study is designed to assess the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of LMSCs as an
      adjunct therapy to the standard stage II (BDCPA) surgical intervention for HLHS, which is
      typically performed at 4 - 6 months after birth. LMSCs will be delivered via intramyocardial
      injections.

      A total of 30 patients will be enrolled in 2 stages with 3 Cohorts.

      In the first stage, 10 consecutive HLHS patients will be enrolled and treated with LMSCs
      (Cohort A). The first 3 patients will be treated no less than 5 days apart, and will be
      evaluated for any treatment-emergent adverse events (TE-AEs) (e.g., induced myocardial
      infarction or perforation). These patients will undergo full evaluation for 5 days to
      demonstrate safety prior to proceeding with the remainder of the cohort. After 6 months
      post-treatment of the last patient of Cohort A, a formal safety review will be conducted
      prior to proceeding to the next phase.

      The second stage is double-blinded, in which 20 HLHS patients will be randomized to either
      receive treatment with LMSCs (Cohort B, 10 patients), or will receive no cells and no
      injection (Cohort C, 10 patients).

    <description>10 consecutive HLHS patients will be enrolled and treated with Longeveron Mesenchymal Stem Cells (LMSCs). A single administration of LMSCs will be performed via intramyocardial injections during the Stage II (BDCPA) surgery. Dosing is based on body weight. Each LMSC-treated patient will be given 2.5 x 105 LMSCs per kg of body weight. The entire dose of the cells will be roughly 600 microliters.</description>
