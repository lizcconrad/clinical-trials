  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There is still great divergence in the aspects related to caries lesions around restorations.
      The methods and the systems used for the detection of secondary caries lesions have presented
      low validity. Also, the consequent treatment decisions of this kind of lesions have presented
      a lot of variation. However, the correct diagnosis of secondary caries may guarantee greater
      longevity to the restorative treatment, as well as oral health to the patients, reducing the
      cost and clinical time of the dentists. Therefore, the investigators aimed to perform this
      study to evaluate and compare two visual criteria for the evaluation of restorations in
      primary teeth in medium and long term outcomes for the patients, through a randomized
      clinical study. These criteria are the system proposed by the World Dental Federation (FDI)
      and the International Caries Classification and Management System - ICCMS.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Among the available diagnosis criteria to detect caries lesions around restorations, there
      are the World Dental Federation (FDI) criteria and the International Caries Classification
      and Management System - ICCMS. However, few studies have evaluated the accuracy of both
      methods. The impact of the use of these methods in the treatment decisions regarding the
      restorations was also not evaluated. In relation to the detection of caries lesions around
      restorations in primary teeth, no randomized clinical study was performed, so the aim of this
      study is to establish the best diagnosis and treatment decision to caries around restorations
      in children. For this, three different studies will be carried out according the following
      specific aims: (1) to evaluate the accuracy of the FDI criteria and the system proposed by
      the ICCMS for the evaluation of caries lesions around restorations in primary teeth through a
      cross-sectional study design; (2) to evaluate the impact and cost of using these two criteria
      in treatment decisions related to the evaluation of restorations in primary teeth through a
      cross-sectional study design; (3) to evaluate the influence of the use of these two criteria
      for the evaluation of restorations in primary teeth in medium and long term outcomes for the
      patients, through a randomized clinical trial. To reach these objectives 626 restorations
      will be evaluated in children from 3 to 10 years who have looked for dental treatment in our
      dental school. They will be randomly allocated in two groups according to the diagnostic
      strategy used for caries detection around restorations: diagnosis and treatment decision
      based on the criteria of the International Dental Federation (FDI) (control group) or
      diagnosis and treatment decision based on the CARS detection criteria and treatment decision
      proposed by the ICCMS (experimental group). The consequent treatment decision of the
      restorations will be divided into no restorative intervention; repair or replacement of the
      restorations. Children will be treated by dentists, blinded to the criteria used to reach the
      treatment decision and then, will be monitored for two years. Reassessments will be performed
      by a blind examiner in relation to the child's allocation group, and the occurrence of
      outcomes will be assessed according to predefined criteria described for evaluation of
      restorations performed in the context of atraumatic restorative treatment. The primary
      outcome will be the need for restorative intervention during the follow-up of the
      restorations evaluated by the different criteria. This outcome is composed of several
      components. The reference standard will be the presence of caries lesion adjacent to the
      restoration after removal of the restoration, and their occurrence will be compared among the
      methods by survival analysis.

    <description>The primary outcome of this study is the necessity of operatory intervention during the follow-up of the restorations evaluated by the different criteria. This outcome is composed of several componentes and it will be assessed by the Roeleveld et al. criteria: the necessity to repair the restoration (scores 11, 12, 13 and 30); the presence of secondary caries lesion with dentin exposure (scores 20 and 21); the restored teeth that presents symptoms of pulp inflammation or episode of pain and need extraction (score 40). Each one of these events will be separately analyzed as a secondary outcome. Following on the Roeleveld et al. criteria, it will be considered &quot;success&quot; only the restorations that receive the scores 00 and 10. The scores 11 to 40 will be considered &quot;failure&quot;. The scores 50, 60, 70 and 90 will not be assessed in the analysis of the success of the restoration.</description>

    <description>The necessity to repair the evaluated restorations during the follow-up examinations will be assessed by the Roeleveld et al. criteria (scores 11, 12, 13 and 30). The criteria of the respective scores are described below:
Score 11 - Restoration present, defect at the margin and/or wear of the surface; &gt; 0.5 mm in depth, repair needed. Score 12 - Restoration present; underfilled &gt; 0.5 mm, no gap, repair needed. Score 13 - Restoration overfilled &gt; 0.5 mm, repair needed. Score 30 - Restoration not present, bulk fracture, loose, (partly) lost; repair needed (if still possible without exposing the pulp).</description>

    <time_frame>24 months</time_frame>
    <description>Caries lesion with dentin exposure around evaluated restorations detected in the follow-up examinations will be assessed by the Roeleveld et al. criteria (scores 20 and 21). The criteria of the respective scores are described below:
Score 20 - Secondary caries, discoloration in depth, surface hard and intact, caries within dentin; repair needed. Score 21 - Secondary caries. Surface defect, caries within dentin; repair needed.</description>

    <description>The restored teeth that presents symptoms of pulp inflammation or episode of pain during the follow-up examinations and need to be extracted will be assessed by the Roeleveld et al. criteria (score 40). The criteria of the respective score is described below:
Score 40 - Inflammation of the pulp (restoration still in situ, not categorized in the former categories); fistula or severe pain complaints; extraction needed.</description>

  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Impact of Oral Health on quality of life</measure>
    <time_frame>24 months</time_frame>
    <description>Impact of Oral Health on quality of life of the children participants in the study will be assessed through the questionnaire &quot;Early Childhood Oral Health Impact Scale&quot; (ECOHIS). The questionnaire is answered by the parents and contains 13 questions, divided into two sections: a child impact section with 4 domains (child symptoms, function, psychological, and self-image/social interaction domains) and a family impact section with 2 domains (parental distress and family function). Respondents answer the questions using a rating scale from 0 to 5, and total scores can range from 0 to 52. Score r corresponds to the &quot;don't know&quot; answer. Higher ECOHIS scores are indicative of greater negative impacts of oral health problems on quality of life. The questionnaire will be applied at the baseline and after 24 months of follow-up, preferentially to the same parent who responded the first questionnaire.</description>
