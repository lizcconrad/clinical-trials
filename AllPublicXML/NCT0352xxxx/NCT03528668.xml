  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the acceptability, use, and general effect that exposure to virtual
      reality has on hospitalized patients reporting at least one discomfort including recent or
      current moderate-severe pain.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with moderate-severe pain will be approached with approval of nursing staff and
      front line nurse manager who determine their appropriateness for a trial of virtual reality
      (VR) exposure for up to 30 minutes. The trial and use of VR will be explained after meeting
      the inclusion criteria and they will be asked about their level of interest in trying the VR
      headset. If interested, the subject will indicate their verbal consent to proceed with the VR
      trial. They will be asked about any baseline discomforts of pain, anxiety/stress or other
      discomfort; which will be rated on a 0-10 numeric (visual analog) scale. A baseline heart
      rate will be recorded in beats per minute. The headset will be applied and adjusted for
      comfort, then the app will be started along with a timer to track the duration of their use
      up to a maximum of 30 minutes. When the Headset is removed, the duration of use will be
      noted. The change in post-exposure heart rate (in beats per minute) and discomforts of pain,
      anxiety/stress or other discomforts (subtracting baseline from 5 minute post-exposure data)
      will be recorded. Subjects will be asked about the ease of use, whether or not they would use
      VR again, and for any other comments they would like to express. The headset will be
      disinfected between patient use.

        Inpatients on adult general care medical/surgical units, regardless of genders will be
        identified via an existing pain assessment dashboard that allows the investigator to
        identify patients with 3 or episodes of moderate-severe pain in the prior 24-hour period.
        The investigator will scan the report for potential subjects in accordance with
        participating units, inclusion and exclusion criteria. The front-line nurse manager and
        registered Nurse caring for to patient will be contacted for appropriateness to consider
        including and the timing when the patient can be approached without interrupting planned
        tests, treatments or workflow.
