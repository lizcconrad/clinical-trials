      Title of the study:

      Phase I clinical trial, to evaluate the safety and tolerability of the ophthalmic gel PRO-167
      versus Corneregel®, on the ocular surface of ophthalmological and clinically healthy
      subjects.

      Methodology:

      Phase I clinical trial, controlled, of parallel groups, double blind, randomized,
      exploratory.

      Goals:

      To evaluate the safety and tolerability of the ophthalmic gel PRO-167 manufactured by
      Laboratorios Sophia S.A. of C.V. on the ocular surface of clinically healthy subjects.

      Hypothesis:

      Ophthalmic gel PRO-167 has a safety and tolerability profile similar to that of its
      comparator in healthy subjects.

      percentages. The statistical analysis will be carried out through the Mann-Whitney U test for
      quantitative variables. The difference between the qualitative variables will be analyzed by
      means of square chi (Chi2). An alpha ≤ 0.05 will be considered significant.

           bottom of the right eye sac.

        -  Route of administration: ophthalmic.

      Reference product, dose and route of administration, lot:

      Secondary security variables:

        -  Epithelial defects in cornea and conjunctiva.

        -  Presence of adverse events.

    <masking_description>The blinding will correspond to the research subject and the principal investigator. In addition, the statistical analysis will be carried out in a blinded manner for the partial and final analysis.
The masking will be done using boxes in the primary packaging identical in the two groups. Blinding for the research subject and the researcher will be done by replacing the commercial labels in the case of the comparator in the bottles and the use of identical labels that contain the allocation number.
Blinding may be opened in the following cases:
Presence of a serious adverse event.
Safety alarm due to the use of the drugs under study.
In case the sponsor determines it for any reason of security or other reason that considers pertinent.</masking_description>
