  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study designed as a randomized controlled split-mouth trial will be conducted at the
      Dental Clinic of the University of Valencia. The aim will be to assess differences in
      clinical, radiological and microbiological outcomes between implants with 2 different
      connections: internal hexagon and conical connection. Following the premises, to minimize the
      bias related to prosthetic phase and maximize the effect of connections on MBL changes, a
      1abutment-1time protocol will be used.

      The study hypothesis is that there will be no statistically significant differences between
      both implant connections.

    <description>Small flaps will be elevated to reduce any kind of injury on the periosteum and maintain the blood supply during the healing period.
Patients will receive 2 implants. One implant (assigned randomly) will have internal hexagon connection.
The Internal Hex (IH) implant has a 2.5mm internal hexagon and a 90° cone. The platform diameter is Ø3.5mm.</description>

    <description>All patients will receive an implant with internal hexagon connection. All implants will be10 mm in length and 3.75 mm in diameter. Implants will be inserted slightly subcrestal. Bone levels will be measured using a calibrated probe.
Torque insertion will be assed using W&amp;H machine Once inserted, implants will be connected to smart pegs to test primary stability.
A periapical x-ray will be done after the operation. Thereafter, a specific coping for digital impression will be connected to the implant and a digital impression will be taken. Aim of this procedure will be to produce a screw retained definitive zirconia prosthesis to be adapted at the time of second surgery</description>
