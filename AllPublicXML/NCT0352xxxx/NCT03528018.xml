  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Rehabilitation options for stroke survivors who present severe hemiparesis in chronic stages
      are limited and may end in compensation techniques that involve the use of the less affected
      arm to achieve some degree of functional independence. Transcranial direct current
      stimulation (tDCS) is a non-invasive technique that has been used after stroke to promote
      excitability of the surviving neural architecture in order to support functional recovery.
      Interestingly, cortical excitability has been reported to increase when tDCS is combined with
      virtual reality. This synergetic effect could explain the promising results achieved by
      preliminary experimental interventions that combined both approaches on upper limb
      rehabilitation after stroke. The objective of this study is to explore the use of these
      interventions in subjects with severe hemiparesis and to determine its efficacy in comparison
      to conventional physical therapy

    <description>The REACt system is a virtual reality-based paradigm for upper limb rehabilitation that allows for interaction of individuals with restricted movements from active responses triggered when they attempt to perform a movement. The experimental system also provides multisensory stimulation in the visual, auditory, and tactile channels, and transcranial direct current stimulation coherent to the observed movements</description>

    <description>Physical therapy included passive and active mobilization of the paretic upper limb. Passive range of motion exercises were provided in those segments where no active movement was detected to meticulously reproduce a range of articular movements and muscle and soft tissue elongation. In case of residual active movement capability, participants were encouraged to perform the movements with the assistance of the therapists</description>
