  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis are types of chronic intestinal disorder called
      inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) that can affect the small and large bowel causing symptoms
      of abdominal pain, diarrhea, blood in the stool, and weight loss. Irritable bowel syndrome
      (IBS) is a milder form of IBD, with symptoms of abdominal pain, bloating, diarrhea or
      constipation, and blood in the stool. It is not known what causes diseases such as IBD and
      IBS. This study will look at the events in the gut that leads to leaky gut and inflammation
      in patients with IBD and IBS. The study will also see if medications such as rifaximin and
      mesalamine may reduce the amount of leaky gut.

    <description>1) Patients scheduled for endoscopy (EGD or colonoscopy) for IBD will be consented to allow physicians who are performing endoscopies to take additional biopsies and blood samples for &quot;research purposes&quot;.</description>

        The subject population includes patients with known Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis and
        indeterminant colitis. Patients will be recruited after they check in to the endoscopy
        unit, and before their endoscopic procedure, prior to any pre-procedure sedation
        medications having been given. All participants are undergoing endoscopy with biopsy for
        surveillance, screening, , diagnosis , or assessment of treatment. If no biopsy specimens
        are taken from subjects for diagnosis, no biopsy samples are taken for research purposes.
        The subject enrollment goal is 60 separate subjects with Crohn's disease, ulcerative
        colitis and indeterminant colitis or Irritable bowel syndrome. The subjects' participation
        will be limited to in the endoscopy suite.
