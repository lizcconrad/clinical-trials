  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to learn about how breast milk from mothers with
      insulin-resistance may be different. Investigators are specifically studying insulin
      concentrations in breast milk. Investigators are also studying how insulin in breast milk
      might affect a baby's intestines and pancreas.

        The inclusion criteria were selected to include only healthy infants of uncomplicated
        pregnancy (with the exception of gestational diabetes) and normal birth weight. The
        criteria for insulin resistance were strategically defined to capture the insulin-resistant
        population which represents a large proportion of the population that are at risk for
        diabetes but have not yet developed the disease. Insulin therapy is an exclusion criteria
        because it passes through the breast milk and we are unable to distinguish endogenous
        maternal insulin from exogenous therapeutic insulin in breast milk samples. These criteria
        will minimize the risks and increase the safety of subjects.
