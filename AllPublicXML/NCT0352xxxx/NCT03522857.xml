  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic pain affects from one third to one half of the population in the UK (Fayaz et al,
      2016). The cost and burden of chronic pain is significant to health services worldwide. The
      affects of chronic pain are widespread upon the lives of those affected. Health professionals
      need to be better equipped than at present to manage pain and current chronic pain management
      knowledge in healthcare is poor. Briggs et al 2011 described the hours of pain education
      delivered at undergraduate level as 'woefully inadequate'. The International Association for
      Study of Pain (IASP) defined curricula for pain education at undergraduate level 6 years ago
      but current levels of knowledge at undergraduate health professional level are not widely
      known. This study aims to establish this at the outset of a pre-registration health
      professional courses and at the end of these courses.

      This study aims to identify the baseline knowledge and attitudes of pre-registration
      healthcare students in Universities throughout UK and Ireland toward chronic pain management.
      The disciplines targeted are nursing, midwifery, physiotherapy, occupational therapy,
      diagnostic radiography and paramedics.

      It is a cross sectional study that compares attitudes and knowledge of first year and final
      year pre-registration healthcare students in the UK and Ireland. These parameters are
      measured using the HC-PAIRS measure and Revised Neurophysiology Questionnaire respectively.
      In addition anonymous data is collected pertaining to participant characteristics which are
      institute of study, age, gender, level and discipline of study to enable a comparison between
      these parameters.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Chronic pain is characterised by a protective mechanism of the neuro-immune-endocrine systems
      potentially exacerbated by loading exposures, conditioning, psychological, socio-economic,
      lifestyle, comorbid mental health and non-modifiables such as genetics, (O'Sullivan et al
      2016). Pain education can be a useful basis for helping patients to manage their symptoms and
      return to good daily function. However a biomedical approach to chronic pain persists in
      medical communities, whilst persistent pain populations increase and incidences of opioid
      addiction are growing secondary to poor pain management. Biomedical models of pain are likely
      to induce fear avoidant behaviour and exacerbate chronicity (Wertli et al 2014). In order to
      change the prevailing biomedical approach to chronic pain the International Association for
      the Study of Pain (IASP) have provided detailed pain curricula content for different medical
      and allied health professional courses. Briggs et al (2015) found that out of 15
      'representative European countries' less than a handful of universities from 3 countries had
      implemented distinctly identifiable pain education teaching. However they may be other forms
      of pain education that are taking place in pre-registration healthcare professional
      education. This study aims to establish the levels of chronic pain management knowledge and
      attitudes prevail in the UK and Ireland amongst pre-registration healthcare professionals.

    <measure>Revised Neurophysiology Quiz</measure>
    <time_frame>1 day</time_frame>
    <description>12 point pain knowledge quiz devised originally by Moseley 2003 to assess knowledge of biological mechanisms of pain. Revised and reduced in 2013 by Catley et al. The lowest score is 0 and the highest would be 12 on a scale of 0-12. There are no subscales.</description>

    <measure>Health care providers Pain and Impairment Relationship Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>1 day</time_frame>
    <description>A 13 question, 7 point Likert scale and a validated questionnaire to assess health care providers' attitudes and beliefs about the relationship between pain and impairment. The scale ranges in outcome from 0-90, higher scores representing a stronger belief in the relationship between chronic pain and disability (a 'worse outcome') and lower scores representing a reduced belief on this relationship thus a 'better outcome'. There are no subscales.</description>
