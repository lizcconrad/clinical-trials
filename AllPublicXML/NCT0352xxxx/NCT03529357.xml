      This cohort study investigates how implementation of Biological Age technology in worksite
      health promotion, affects health behavior in the general Danish working population.

      This cohort study is designed on the basis of Body Age tests, executed by a private Danish
      health care company in the period from 2010 to 2013.

      The dataset comprises pre- and post Body Age tests from &gt;4000 individuals. They used a
      standardised protocol and educated staff ( physiotherapists or with a degree in sports
      science) to carry out the tests. Body Age tests apply biometrics, fitness level and health
      status data of the employee. The test results are characterized by a Body Age score, which
      defines the employee's biological age (in years).

      This design categorises as a register study why The Danish National Committee is not applied
      for.

        The volunteers are employees in either private or governmental companies. A total of 18
        different companies are included in this study, primarily related to banking, pension and
        pharmaceutical work areas. The Body Age test is voluntary and part of the companies health
