    <description>The study sites will pilot the Team Birth Project designed to improve team communication (between providers, as well as providers and patients). The project includes three key implementation steps that involve: preparing local sites for the implementation of the project; training and coaching on the use of the tools; and sustainment through peer coaching and data feedback. A mixed methods approach will be used to assess acceptability and feasibility, including: (1) clinician surveys and interviews, (2) implementation team focus groups, and (3) patient surveys.</description>
