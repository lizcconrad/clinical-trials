  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a first-in-human, open-label, multicenter, Phase 1-2 study to assess the
      safety, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and preliminary clinical activity of ASTX029
      administered orally to subjects with advanced solid malignancies who are not candidates for
      approved or available therapies.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      ASTX029 is a synthetic small molecule inhibitor of extracellular signal-regulated kinases
      (ERKs) 1/2. ASTX029 has not been previously evaluated in human subjects. The Phase 1 portion
      of this study will assess safety and determine the maximum tolerated dose, the recommended
      Phase 2 dose (RP2D), and the recommended dosing regimen of ASTX029 administered orally. The
      Phase 2 portion will assess preliminary clinical activity in tumors characterized by gene
      aberrations in the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signal pathway that may confer
      sensitivity to ASTX029.

             retinopathy (CSR) including:

               1. Presence of predisposing factors to RVO or CSR (eg, uncontrolled glaucoma or
                  ocular hypertension, uncontrolled diabetes mellitus) or

               2. Visible retinal pathology as assessed by ophthalmic examination at screening that
