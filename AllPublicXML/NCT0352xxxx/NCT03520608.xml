      Painful Diabetic peripheral Neuropathy Study of Chinese OutPatiEnt (PDN-SCOPE): a

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Painful diabetic peripheral neuropathy (PDN) presents a serious health problem in China.
      SCOPE is a cross-sectional, multi-centers registry study with a target sample size of 1500
      patients who are experiencing PDN. The patients are treated following guideline and local
      practice. Real-world data including demographics, medical histories, VAS, PHQ, GAD -7 and
      therapies are collected. The primary objective is to analyze the clinical characteristics of
      PDN. The secondary objectives include anxiety depression distribution and current treatment
      status.The SCOPE study will help to find actual clinical manifestation and treatment and
      improve the overall treatment outcome of Chinese patients with PDN.
