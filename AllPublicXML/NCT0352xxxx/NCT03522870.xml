    <textblock>
      This trial is a randomized, multi-center, parallel group, efficacy and safety study with a
      28-weeks follow- up. The study aims to: 1)compare the effects of novel flash glucose
      monitoring system (FGMS) and conventional Self Measurement of Blood Glucose (SMBG); and 2)
      optimize integrated management for glycaemic control in adult patients with type 1 diabetes
      who are sub-optimally controlled.

      144 Subjects with Type 1 diabetes who meet criteria will be enrolled at up to seven clinical
      research sites in China. Subjects will be randomized to either flash glucose monitoring
      system(Freestyle Libre®;Abbott Diabetes Care,Witney, Oxon,UK) or conventional Self
      Measurement of Blood Glucose (Bayer®)alone at least three times per day. Primary outcome
      variable is the difference in HbA1c which will be analyzed in a central laboratory between
      baseline and the 28weeks follow-up. Secondary outcome variables such as time-in-range,
      frequency and duration of and hyperglycemic episodes etc. will be assessed at baseline
      (Week-2 to 0), Week 12-14 and Week 26-28 via wear professional continuous glucose system
      (Ipro2®; Medtronic). At the same time, demographic factors, clinical data, patient reported
      outcome (PROs) will be collected. Assessment of Adverse Events will occur via self-reporting
      at each visit and/or phone call. All patients will receive same ordinary diabetes education.
