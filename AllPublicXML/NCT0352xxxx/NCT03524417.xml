    <textblock>
      No study was conducted to evaluate the rabies neutralizing antibody titers after RIG
      injection on day 7. The only study that has supported the delay of RIG administration was
      done in 1996 by our institute, of which RIG was given on day 5 with the original Thai Red
      Cross intradermal regimen (2-2-2-0-1-1).

  <detailed_description>

      Rabies immunoglobulin (RIG) should be administered as soon as possible after the initiation
      of post-exposure prophylaxis. RIG should not be given after day 7 following the first rabies
      vaccine dose, because circulating neutralizing antibody will have begun to appear.
      Nevertheless, no study was conducted to evaluate the rabies neutralizing antibody titers
      after RIG injection on day 7.

      The only study that has supported the delay of RIG administration was done in 1996 by our
      institute, of which RIG was given on day 5 with the original Thai Red Cross intradermal
      regimen (2-2-2-0-1-1). The ongoing study would prove the validity of the recommendation and
      eliminate the controversies in clinical practice.

    <description>The patients with WHO category III rabies exposure, who have received first dose of rabies vaccination a week before and have not received rabies immunoglobulin were enrolled. Blood for Rabies neutralizing antibody titers (RNab) would be examined on day 0. On the same day, Equine rabies immunoglobulin (ERIG) at the dosage of 40 IU/kg would be injected into and around the wound as much as possible and the rest would be injected intramuscularly at the site distance from rabies vaccine. Then blood for RNab would be serially examined on day 7, 14, 90, 365.</description>
