  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators have previously observed a reduced level of platelet aggregation 2 hours
      after healthy male individuals were asked to drink extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) that
      provided a higher level of one specific phenolic known as oleocanthal. This study will help
      the investigators further determine the effects of oleocanthal-rich EVOO intake on platelet
      function at 2, 4 and 6 hours after intake with food compared to platelet function in the
      morning after an overnight fast.

      Fifty adult male volunteers will be asked to participate in one of two study trials that will
      be randomized double-blind controlled crossover trials with 2 study visits. The participants
      will arrive to the facility after an overnight fast, and will be asked to consume their
      assigned EVOO either without (trial 1) or with (trial 2) a standardized low-phenolic food
      (such as rice, pasta or mashed potatoes) with 40 mL of one of 2 EVOOs that are matched for
      their total phenolic content, but with one oil containing oleocanthal, and one with very low
      levels of oleocanthal. At zero, two, 4 and 6 hours after EVOO intake a blood sample will be
      collected for the assessment of collagen- ADP-, and AA-induced platelet aggregation, as well
      as an untargeted metabolomics profile.

      As an assessment of phenotypic stability, a subset of individuals (n=5 per trial) that have
      exhibit either low or high platelet responses, will be asked to repeat the above study.
