  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to test the effects of a digital meditation intervention in a sample
      UCSF employees who report mild to moderate stress. We will randomize UCSF employees to either
      8-weeks of a digital meditation intervention (using the commercially available application
      Headspace) or a waitlist control condition.

      The aim of this study is to test the effects of a digital meditation intervention in a sample
      UCSF employees who report moderate to high stress. We will randomize UCSF employees to either
      8-weeks of a digital meditation intervention (using the commercially available application
      Headspace) or a waitlist control condition.

      Participants assigned to the intervention group will be asked to download and use the
      Headspace mobile application for at least 10 minutes per day for 8 weeks. All study
      participants will be asked to fill out short (no longer than 25 minutes) questionnaires at
      baseline, week 4, week 8 (post intervention), and a 4-month follow up period. Among
      participants who are randomized to the digital meditation intervention, they will also take
      part in a 1-year follow up. All activities will take place online (via computer or
      smartphone).

      Prior to randomization, participants will go through an eligibility screening and complete
      the baseline questionnaire battery. The entirety of the study is digital and there are no
      in-person assessments. Adherence will be tracked remotely. The goal is to recruit as many as
      2000 participants (1000 per condition).

    <measure>Change in job strain, as determined by Siegrist Job Strain Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to post-intervention, an anticipated average of 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The job strain measure is a comprised of two sub scales, effort (5 items) and reward (11 items), each ranging from 1 to 4. The job strain score is calculated as the ratio of demand to reward, with a higher ratio reflecting more job strain.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in job overcommitment, as as determined by Siegrist Job Strain Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to post-intervention, an anticipated average of 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The job overcommitment subscale of the Siegrist Job Strain Scale is comprised of 4 items providing a total score range from 4 to16. A higher total score reflects more job overcommitment.</description>

    <measure>Change in burnout, as determined by the Bergen Burnout Inventory</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to post-intervention, an anticipated average of 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Bergen Burnout Inventory is comprised of 9 items, ranging from 1 to 6. The total score range is from 9 to 54 with a higher score reflecting higher burnout.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in subjective mindfulness, as determined by total score on Mindful Attention Awareness Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to post-intervention, an anticipated average of 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Mindful Attention Awareness Scale is a 15-item measure with each item ranging from a score of 1 to 6. To score the scale, we compute the average score across items, with a higher score reflecting higher levels of mindfulness.</description>

    <measure>Change in work engagement, as determined by the Utrecht Work Engagement Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to post-intervention, an anticipated average of 8 weeks</time_frame>
