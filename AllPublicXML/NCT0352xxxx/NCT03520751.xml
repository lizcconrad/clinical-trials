      This clinical trial is an open-label, one-time injection ascending dose study in which
      scAAV1.tMCK.NTF3 will be administered by intramuscular injections into muscles in both legs
      in CMT1A subjects with PMP22 gene duplication. Cohort 1 will include three subjects ages 18
      to 35 years receiving (2.0 X 1012 vg/kg), and Cohort 2 will include six subjects ages 15 to
      35 years old receiving (6.0 X 1012 vg/kg).

      This clinical trial is an open-label, one-time injection ascending dose study in which
      scAAV1.tMCK.NTF3 will be administered by intramuscular injections into medial and lateral
      heads of gastrocnemius and tibialis anterior muscles in both legs in CMT1A subjects with
      PMP22 gene duplication. Nine CMT1A patients, 15 to 35 years of age will be enrolled into one
      of two cohorts in this trial. The first cohort will consist of subjects that are 18 to 35
      years of age. The first three adult subjects will be enrolled at a low-minimally effective
      dose (2.0 X 1012 vg/kg) distributed bilaterally between both limbs in Cohort 1. An additional
      six subjects, ages 15 to 35, will be enrolled with a 3-fold dose escalation (6.0 X 1012
      vg/kg) in Cohort 2. Post-gene transfer monitoring will include follow up visits on days 7,
      14, 30, 60, 90, 120, and months 6, 9, 12, 15, 18 and 24 following gene transfer. Safety is
      the primary endpoint for this clinical gene transfer trial. Stopping criteria are based on
      development of unacceptable toxicity defined as the occurrence of any one Grade III or
      higher, unanticipated, treatment-related toxicity. The secondary endpoint is efficacy defined
      as halting of the decline in abilities measured by the CMT Pediatric Scale (CMTPedS) at 2
      years post gene transfer. The CMTPedS is an 11-item scale comprised of the Functional
      Dexterity Test, Nine-Hole Peg Test (9HPT), hand grip, foot plantarflexion, and foot
      dorsiflexion strength using handheld myometry, pinprick and vibration sensation, the
      Bruininks Oseretsky Test- Balance assessment, gait assessment, long jump, and six-minute walk
      test (6MWT). Exploratory outcome measures will include 100 meter timed test (100M), peroneal
      and ulnar CMAP amplitude and sensory and motor conduction velocities, a revised sensory
      testing to increase sensitivity for pinprick, touch-test and vibration assessments, visual
      analogue scales for pain and fatigue, Short Form Health Survey (SF-36) as Quality of Life
      measure, and circulating NT-3 levels.

    <description>CMT Pediatric Scale. Efficacy will be defined as the ability to halt the decline in functional and sensory abilities as measured by the CMTPedS at 2 years post gene transfer. This 11 item scale, developed by the Inherited Neuropathies Consortium, underwent validation testing in patients aged 3-20 years with CMT and generates a linear score of disability.</description>

    <description>The visual analog scale (VAS) of pain intensity consists of a line, most often 100 mm long, with 2 descriptors representing extremes of pain intensity (e.g., no pain and extreme pain) at each end. Patients rate their pain intensity by making a mark somewhere on the line that represents their pain intensity and the VAS is scored by measuring the distance from the &quot;no pain&quot; end of the line.</description>
