  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Endothelial dysfunction and vasoreactivity disorders are early subclinical complications of
      type 1 diabetes (T1D). In a preventive setting, in T1D patients still free of complications,
      the research of non-pharmacological interventions to improve endothelial function appears
      fundamental.

      In this randomized controlled trial, the effects of exercise training on endothelial function
      will be evaluated in T1D adults. Secondary objectives are to evaluate the exercise training
      effects on the micro and macrovascular function and exercise-induced tissue vasoreactivity
      and their possible neurometabolic consequences.

      An improvement in vascular function, particularly endothelium-dependent, as well as in
      neurometabolic profile, through this non-pharmacological strategy is expected
