    <textblock>
      This trial studies histamine and bone pain association in participants with breast cancer
      that has spread to the bone. Studying histamine levels in samples of blood from participants
      with breast cancer in the laboratory may help doctors learn more about reducing cancer bone
      pain and preventing further bone metastasis.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To correlate levels of histamine in plasma with pain scores in patients with bone
      metastases from breast cancer that have or have not been treated with palliative
      radiotherapy.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To perform exploratory studies with additional markers not mentioned, including calcitonin
      gene-related peptide (CGRP), stem cell factor (SCF), angiotensin II (Ang II) substance P,
      angiotensin 1-7 (Ang1-7), may be performed at the investigator's discretion.

      II. To perform next generation ribonucleic acid (RNA) sequences using the whole blood to
      determine whether histamine system is involved in the development of cancer-induced bone pain
      (CIBP).

      III. To assess the impact of pain response after radiotherapy on bone structural properties
      such as bone mineral density and cortical thickness, and patient quality of life, physical
      and psychological function.

      OUTLINE:

      Participants undergo collection of blood samples for histamine level analysis via
      enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA).

      After completion of study, participants are followed up at 1, 3, and 6 months.

    <description>To correlate levels of histamine in plasma with pain scores (3 groups) in patients with bone metastases from breast cancer that have or have not been treated with palliative radiotherapy, analysis of variance (ANOVA) will be used. The histamine levels will be transformed to satisfy the conditional normality assumption if needed. Linear regression models will be used to relate histamine levels (outcome variable) with the pain groups (covariate of interest).</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline up to 1 month</time_frame>
    <description>Will compare the 1-month differences of the outcome variables between pain group 2 and pain group 3 using the 2-sample t-test. If possible, the mixed effects model will be used to take into account the repeated measures. The thickness of the cortical bone within the irradiated volume will be measured.</description>

    <measure>Change in patient quality of life</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline up to 1 month</time_frame>
    <description>The change in patient quality of life will be assessed by the visual analogue scale (VAS) pain scale. The total score range is 0-10 with higher scores denoting worse outcomes.</description>

    <measure>Change in physical and psychological function</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline up to 1 month</time_frame>
    <description>To be measured using the EORTC QLQ-BM22 quality of life questionnaire. It's divided into two categories, giving a single value: symptoms and functions. A high score indicates a high level of symptoms and a high level of functioning. The score range is 22-88.</description>
