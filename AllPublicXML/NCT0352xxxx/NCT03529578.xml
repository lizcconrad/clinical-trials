        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Index ulcer characteristics:

               1. Index ulcer area after debridement is ≥ 2 cm² and ≤ 25 cm² at the randomization
                  visit

               2. Ulcer must be Stage II or III as determined by the National Pressure Ulcer
                  Advisory Panel (NPUAP) pressure ulcer staging system

          2. Subject criteria must include:

               1. Age 18 or older

               2. The subject or their legally authorized representative provides consent and is
                  willing and able to participate in all procedures and follow-up evaluations
                  necessary to complete the study

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Index ulcer characteristics that will make subject ineligible for enrollment:

               1. Stage I or IV ulcers as determined by NPUAP pressure ulcer staging system

               2. Signs and symptoms of local infection

               3. Previous surgical procedure performed at site

               4. Known or suspected local skin malignancy at index ulcer site

               5. Prior radiation therapy treatment at the index ulcer site

          2. Subject criteria that will make subject ineligible for enrollment:

               1. Presence of other diseases which, in the Opinion of the Investigator, may result
                  in allograft failure or has experienced graft failure in the past (examples
                  include: immune system disorders including Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE),
                  Fibromyalgia, Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS) or HIV)

               2. Currently taking medications which in the opinion of the investigator may affect
                  graft incorporation

               3. Allergy or known sensitivity to Aminoglycosides such as gentamicin sulfate and/or
                  streptomycin sulfate

               4. Any condition(s) that in the opinion of the investigator may seriously
                  compromises the subject's ability to participate in this study. Examples include:
                  known history of poor adherence with medical treatment, current drug or alcohol
                  abuse or a medical/psychiatric condition

               5. Pregnancy at enrollment or within last 6 months, women who are breastfeeding, or
                  women of childbearing potential who are planning to become pregnant during the
                  time of the study OR are unwilling/unable to use acceptable methods of
                  contraception (birth control pills, barriers, or abstinence)

               6. Subjects currently enrolled in this study (i.e. concurrent enrollment in the
                  study is prohibited)

               7. Subject has used any investigational drug(s) or therapeutic device(s) within 30
                  days preceding screening.

               8. Any pathology that would limit the blood supply and compromise healing

               9. Subject is a prisoner
