    <textblock>
      Diabetic retinopathy(DR) is one of the most common and serious microvascular complications of
      diabetes,which is the primary cause of vision loss of diabetic patients. The risk of
      blindness is 25 times that of healthy people.Fundus fluorescein angiography (FFA) is the gold
      standard for diagnosing the stage of diabetic retinopathy.However,FFA is an invasive
      examination which requires the patient to be in good physical condition and is not suitable
      for large-scale screening.Therefore, it is important to build up an evaluation system for
      early diagnosis of DR,which is more convenient, safer, and non-invasive.Firstly, this study
      will retrospectively analyze the FFA images of DR to find the earliest and most frequently
      occurring fundus quadrant.Secondly,based on the retrospective analysis results, a prospective
      comparative study will be conducted,which combines the fundus photography with optical
      coherence tomography angiography(angio-OCT) and physical indicators to find out whether it
      has consistency, sensitivity and specificity with FFA in diagnosing the stage of DR in order
      to build up a more effective,safer and faster evaluation system and clinical application for
      DR.

    <description>The study is to find the earliest and most frequently occurring fundus quadrant of diabetic retinopathy.Based on the the retrospective analysis results, a prospective comparative study will be conducted to build up a evaluation system and clinical application for diabetic retinopathy.We divided the FFA images into nine quadrants: posterior pole, superior, superior nasal, nasal, inferior nasal, inferior, inferior temporal, temporal, and superior temporal. The qualitative analysis of diabetic retinopathy in each quadrant was performed. The earliest and most common fundus quadrant of diabetic retinopathy was then assessed using a rank sum test, t-test, and analysis of variance.</description>
