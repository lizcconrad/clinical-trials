  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators aim is to establish a Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA) National Platform to
      improve UK standards of care, manage national and International clinical trials and
      facilitate translational research for this common neuromuscular disease.

      To achieve this purpose investigators will start to systematically collect longitudinal
      validated outcome measures for SMA children followed at GOSH, the largest cohort followed in
      UK, and pilot and update novel outcome measures. This will be done ensuring that data
      collected are not only clinically meaningful but also robust for subsequent use in clinical
      trials.

      In collaboration with the MRC Neuromuscular Centre in London and Newcastle, investigators
      will link the existing registries and the longitudinal data collection of outcome measures
      and develop a hub and bespoke platform model linking the other paediatric UK centres involved
      in the clinical management of SMA patients. This UK SMA Platform (SMA REACH UK) will be a
      unique infrastructure containing the largest comprehensive longitudinal series of SMA patient
      data in the UK; the data collected will be agreed between the relevant other UK centres
      stakeholders and will take into consideration other international initiatives with historical
      success in SMA treatment and research.

      Ongoing analysis including modern psychometric techniques will ensure that the functional
      data collected in the UK SMA population meets the high statistical standards required for the
      data to inform natural history studies and be usable as an outcome measure for clinical
      trials.

      An innovative genetic therapy preclinical project taking advantage of our expertise in
      antisense oligonucleotide compounds will also be pursued on a parallel research project.
