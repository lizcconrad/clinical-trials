  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase III, open label, randomized controlled multi-center global study designed to
      evaluate the safety and efficacy of single agent nazartinib (EGF816) compared with
      investigator's choice (erlotinib or gefitinib) in patients with locally advanced or
      metastatic NSCLC who are treatment na√Øve and whose tumors harbor EGFR activating mutations
      (L858R or ex19del).
