  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main purpose of the research study is to estimate the prevalence of tobacco product use
      and describe the tobacco use patterns in adults in Italy.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the survey is to describe the current and past patterns of use of tobacco products
      in the general adult population of Italy and in adult IQOS users registered in the IQOS user
      database of Philip Morris Italia S.r.l. (Italy IQOS User Database), and explore their
      association with key independent variables. More specifically, the objectives are:

        1. Estimate the prevalence of current tobacco use status in the study population.

        2. Describe the past tobacco use status (cigarette, IQOS and other innovative products,
           including e-cigarettes) in the study population (i.e. never-use, initiation, product use
           transition, cessation, re-initiation, and relapse).

        3. Explore the association between self-reported health status and use of tobacco products
           in the study population.

        4. Explore the association between patterns of use (including misuse) with motivation to
           use, perceived quality attributes of IQOS (e.g. risk and self-reported changes since
           switching to the product, in a number of relevant domains where IQOS may have potential
           benefits), and consumer's satisfaction in the population of IQOS users in Italy
           registered in the Italy IQOS User Database.
