  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Context: Women with gestational diabetes have excessive fetus growth weeks earlier than the
      screening period recommended currently, suggesting that earlier screening and intervention
      may improve pregnancy outcomes and the health of the offspring.

      Objective: To determine if early screening and intervention could alter pregnancy outcomes,
      the incidence of maternal diabetes after delivery, and growth and development of the
      offspring, compared to the standard group.

      Design, Setting, Participants: We will conduct an open-label randomized controlled trial in
      2068 pregnant women, who deliver a singleton and who have not been diagnosed with overt
      diabetes mellitus at National Taiwan University Hospital from 2018 to 2020.

      Interventions: Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is diagnosed by a 75g 2-hour OGTT at 18-22
      weeks of GA for the early-screening group and at 24-28 weeks for the standard-screening
      group. The diagnostic cutoffs are according to the IADPSG criteria. GDM is diagnosed if one
      of the plasma glucose levels at fasting, 1-hour, and 2-hour during OGTT is above 92 mg/dL,
      180 mg/dL, or 153 mg/dL respectively. Subjects who are diagnosed with GDM receive lifestyle
      intervention and self-monitoring of blood glucose. Pharmacological therapies are given when
      the target of glycemic control is not achieved within 4-6 weeks.

      Main Outcome Measure: The primary outcome is a composite measure of pregnancy outcomes,
      including primary CS, birth weight &gt;90th percentile, neonatal hypoglycemia, cord serum
      C-peptide &gt;90th percentile, pregnancy-induced hypertension, preeclampsia and birth trauma.
      The primary outcome is measured within the entire period of perinatal and neonatal
      intensive-care units (NICU) stay for infants and the entire period of gestation for pregnant
      women after randomization.

      Conclusion: This study will test our hypothesis that early screening and intervention of GDM
      improves pregnancy outcomes as compared to standard practice.

    <description>The early screening group will be screened by a 75g 2-hour oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) at 18-20 weeks of gestational age (GA). Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is diagnosed according to the IADPSG criteria. Subjects diagnosed with GDM will receive nutrition counseling, and lifestyle intervention. Pharmacologic therapies exclusively with human insulin or insulin analogues will be given when the target of glycemic control is not achieved within 4 weeks. The process of screening and intervention in the early screening group is all the same with that in the standard screening group. The only difference between two groups is the time of screening and intervention (18-20 weeks vs. 24-28 weeks of GA).</description>
