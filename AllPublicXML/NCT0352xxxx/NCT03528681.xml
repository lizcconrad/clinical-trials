  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To evaluate the efficacy of two different doses (5 and 10 g) of ZS orally administered once
      daily (qd) vs placebo in maintaining normokalemia in initially hyperkalemic patients having
      achieved normokalemia following two days of initial ZS therapy (10g TID).

      This study will be conducted in approximately 45 centers in China and India. Before patients
      are randomized to the double-blind phase, they will receive open-label ZS for 48 hours during
      the initial phase. It is expected that approximately 555 patients will need to be enrolled,
      to have approximately 337 patients entered into the 48-hour open-label initial phase
      resulting in 320 patients being randomized in the 28-day treatment study phase. Enrolment
      will be stopped when 320 patients have been initiated with the 28-day randomized treatment
      study phase.
