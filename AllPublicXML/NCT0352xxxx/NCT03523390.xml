             that are not part of standard patient management

          -  Histologically or cytologically proven locally advanced unresectable or metastatic
             solid tumors, for which no standard therapy exists or standard therapy has failed

             unstained tumor slides suitable for biomarker detection

          -  Other protocol defined inclusion criteria could apply

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Prior therapy with any antibody/drug targeting T-cell coregulatory proteins (immune
             checkpoints) such as programmed death 1 (PD-1), PD-L1, cytotoxic T-lymphocyte
             antigen-4 (CTLA-4), 4-1BB, Lymphocyte-activation gene 3 (LAG-3), T-cell immunoglobulin

          -  Persisting toxicity related to prior therapy (Grade greater than equals to [&gt;=] 2
             National Cancer Institute- Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events [NCI-CTCAE]
             v4.03, except Grade less than [&lt;] 3 neuropathy and alopecia of any grade)

          -  Concurrent anticancer treatment (for example, cytoreductive therapy, radiotherapy
             [with the exception of limited palliative bone-directed radiotherapy], immune therapy,
             or cytokine therapy except for erthyropoietin).

          -  Concurrent immunosuppressive agents (except for corticosteroids at physiologic
             replacement dose, equivalent to less than equals to [&lt;=] 10 milligram [mg] prednisone
             daily)

          -  Severe hypersensitivity reactions to monoclonal antibodies (Grade &gt;= 3 NCI-CTCAE
             v4.03)

          -  Active brain metastases (except those treated locally, and have not been progressing
             for at least 2 weeks after the completion of therapy, with no steroid maintenance
             therapy required, and no ongoing neurological symptoms related to brain localization
             of the disease)

          -  Any history of anaphylaxis, or uncontrolled asthma (that is, 3 or more features of
             partially controlled asthma)
