  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      n this study, approximately 30 patients with relapsed or refractory non-Hodgkin's lymphoma
      (NHL) were recruited for a single reinfusion of IM19-CD28 and IM19-41BB CAR-T cells. Assess
      the safety, tolerability of treatment, and initially observe the efficacy.

      1. Dose-escalation:Patients entered the IM19-41BB or IM19-CD28 group and performed dose
           escalation studies in three dose groups.

        2. According to the results of the previous dose escalation study, select one dose to
           continue the enrollment of 6 patients for extended studies.
