      A prospective, single arm, multicenter, Phase II-Trial to assess safety and efficacy of
      preoperative Radiation therapy before radical CystEctomy combined with ImmunoTherapy in
      locally advanced urothelial carcinoma of the bladder
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with locally advanced bladder cancer have a poor prognosis despite radical surgical
      therapy. The addition of perioperative combination chemotherapy did not add significant
      benefit to surgery alone. There is data indicating a synergistic effect of radiation and
      immunotherapy. Therefore, combined application of radiotherapy with Nivolumab before radical
      cystectomy might lead to improved cure rates and local control in this poor prognosis group
      with locally advanced bladder cancer. The aim of this phase-II study is to assess feasibility
      and safety of immunotherapy combined with neoadjuvant radiation before radical cystectomy.

          -  Female subjects who are pregnant, breast-feeding or male/female patients of
