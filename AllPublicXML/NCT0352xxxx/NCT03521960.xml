  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a pilot study to collect preliminary data to support a grant application. The goal of
      the study is to evaluate whether the Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved and
      generically-available medication buspirone reduces symptoms of opioid withdrawal among
      patients undergoing a clinically-indicated and supervised taper from their opioid pain
      medications. This is premised on strong preclinical scientific support but has not yet be
      well-examined in humans.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Buspirone (Buspar) has shown initial efficacy in reducing symptoms of opioid withdrawal in
      animal studies and in human patients undergoing a methadone taper. Buspirone may have
      pharmacologic activity in specific neurotransmitter systems that preclinical evidence
      suggests may be implicated in the manifestation of opioid withdrawal symptoms. Administration
      of buspirone during an opioid taper may improve outcomes relative to placebo. The goal of
      this study is to collect preliminary feasibility and efficacy data from a sample of patients
      undergoing clinically-indicated opioid tapering. Participant enrollment will occur at the
      beginning of their residential stay on the Pain Treatment Unit at Johns Hopkins Hospital.
      Participants will be randomly assigned to receive buspirone (15 milligrams, three times
      daily, for daily dose of 45 milligrams) or placebo. Daily assessments for withdrawal and
      requests for additional symptomatic medications will be evaluated as evidence of initial
      efficacy. Feasibility measures include willingness to participate and study retention.
