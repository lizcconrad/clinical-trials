      The study is a multi-center, randomized, open, and parallel study. Approximately 958 subjects
      will be enrolled in 16 sites. The random number table will be adopted to conduct cluster
      randomization per township hospital/community health service center. Patients will be
      randomized 1:1 to receive blood pressure management in Internet medical model or Conventional
      medical model. After follow-ups of 3 months and 6 months, the blood pressure in each group
      will be observed and compared.

       14. Subjects who are unable to conduct blood pressure self-test;

       15. The subject has any other known condition at screening that would compromise subject
           safety, might affect life expectancy, or making it difficult to successfully manage and
           follow the subject according to the protocol.

    <description>Subjects in the Internet group should upload blood pressure monitoring data at least once per day. It is highly recommended to upload two pressure monitoring results to capture more blood pressure information. The warning value of blood pressure set in the cloud database is systolic blood pressure ≥ 180mmHg or ≤ 100mmHg and diastolic blood pressure ≥ 110mmHg or ≤ 60mmHg. After enrollment, subjects and physicians communicate via telephone or Internet every two weeks until blood pressure is well controlled judged by physician. Then the frequency of communication will be changed to once a month. Once there are lacks of blood pressure data in 3 days of each week, or. blood pressure values of the subject exceed the warning value in 2 days of consecutive 3 days, the physician will take the initiative to contact the patient for disease inquiry.</description>
