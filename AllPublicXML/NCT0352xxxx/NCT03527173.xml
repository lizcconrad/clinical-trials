  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy, safety and immunogenicity of the
      GSK3536852A vaccine, which was designed to protect against shigellosis caused by Shigella
      sonnei (S. sonnei) and is using the new Generalized Modules for Membrane Antigens (GMMA)
      platform technology developed by GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) Vaccines Institute for Global Health
      (GVGH).

      The study vaccine could be the stepping stone for the development of a multivalent broadly
      protective Shigella vaccine for vaccination of impoverished communities where shigellosis is
      endemic. However, a standalone monovalent vaccine against S. sonnei could be used to protect
      travelers against diarrheal shigellosis, as the vast majority of travelers' shigellosis is
      caused by S. sonnei, and even to protect infants in endemic regions where shigellosis is
      primarily caused by S. sonnei.

      The GSK3536852A vaccine has been tested in two Phase I dose escalation studies in Europe to
      assess its safety and immunogenicity via three routes of administration: intramuscular (IM),
      intranasal (IN) and intradermal (ID). The results from the first study (dose escalation with
      IM vaccination) have shown that the vaccine has an acceptable safety profile and is
      well-tolerated up to a dose of 100 micrograms (µg). The results from the second study (dose
      escalation with ID, IN and IM vaccination) showed that GSK3536852A vaccine is well-tolerated
      also when administered by the ID and IN routes of vaccination. However, immunogenicity data
      have shown that GSK3536852A vaccine administered by the ID and IN routes is not as
      immunogenic as GSK3536852A vaccine administered by the IM route. Therefore, it has been
      decided to proceed with the clinical development program of this vaccine only using the IM
      vaccination route. In terms of dosage, the regimen tested in Phase I studies (three doses
      given one month apart) did not show any significant benefit from the third dose in terms of
      immunogenicity, therefore a two dose schedule was selected for next studies.

      A Phase IIa study, conducted in endemic regions of Africa (i.e., Kenya), has just been
      completed and confirmed the acceptable safety profile and immunogenicity of GSK3536852A
      vaccine.

      Performing this vaccine-human challenge study may give the opportunity to establish evidence
      of clinical protection induced by the candidate S. sonnei vaccine (GSK3536852A vaccine) at an
      early development stage.

    <measure>Number of subjects presenting shigellosis</measure>
    <time_frame>Starting with the challenge visit (Day 57) and lasting up to the end of the inpatient stay, in all subjects (Day 64)</time_frame>
    <description>Anti-shigellosis vaccine efficacy (VE) is evaluated by the rate of shigellosis, fulfilling the protocol primary case definition: moderate or severe diarrhea, or fever higher than or equal to (≥) 38 degrees Celsius (°C). Moderate diarrhea consists of 4 to 5 loose or watery (Grade 3 to 5) stools or 400 to 800 grams of Grade 3 to 5 stools within 24 hours, while severe diarrhea includes 6 or more loose or watery (Grade 3 to 5) stools or &gt; 800 grams of Grades 3 to 5 stools within 24 hours or required medical intervention. Grade 3 = viscous opaque liquid or semi-liquid which assumes the shape of the bowl; Grade 4 = watery opaque liquid; Grade 5 = clear watery or mucoid liquid.</description>

    <time_frame>During the 7-day follow-up period (i.e., on the day of vaccination and 6 subsequent days) after each vaccine dose</time_frame>
    <description>Solicited local AEs include: pain, erythema and induration, at injection site. Any = occurrence of local adverse event regardless of intensity grade.</description>

    <time_frame>During the 28-day follow-up period (i.e., on the day of vaccination and 27 subsequent days)</time_frame>
    <description>An unsolicited AE covers any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical investigation subject temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product and reported in addition to those solicited during the clinical study and any solicited symptom with onset outside the specified period of follow-up for solicited symptoms. Any is defined as the occurrence of any unsolicited adverse event regardless of intensity grade or relation to vaccination.</description>

    <measure>Number of subjects reporting the occurrence of serious adverse events (SAEs) and related SAEs</measure>
    <time_frame>From Day 1 to study end, at Day 57 + 6 Months</time_frame>
    <description>Serious adverse events (SAEs) include any untoward medical occurrences that result in death, are life-threatening, require hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization or result in disability/incapacity. Related SAEs = SAEs assessed by the investigator as related to the vaccination.</description>

    <time_frame>At 28 days after first (Day 29) and 28 days after second (Day 57) vaccination</time_frame>
    <description>Seroresponse is aimed to define a significant increase in anti S. sonnei LPS IgG concentration in post-vaccination samples and relies on the definition already used in a previous phase II study in Kenyan population. For the purpose of this study seroresponse is defined as:
If the baseline value is greater than (&gt;) 50 EU/mL then an increase of at least 50% in the post-vaccination sample as compared to baseline.
If the baseline value is less or equal to (≤) 50 EU/mL then an increase of at least 25 EU/mL in the post-vaccination sample as compared to baseline.</description>
