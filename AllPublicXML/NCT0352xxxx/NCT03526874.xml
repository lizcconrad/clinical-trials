  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Migraine affects 10-28% of children and adolescents and yet 20-30% of patients are
      ineffectively treated with current oral and nasal options. Peripheral nerve blocks (PNBs),
      injections of local anesthetics over branches of the occipital and/or trigeminal nerves, have
      been associated with possible benefit for pediatric headaches in case series, and may be
      useful for both acute and preventive treatment of migraine for children who fail less
      invasive treatments. In fact, 80% of pediatric headache specialists reported using peripheral
      nerve blocks and carry low risk of serious side effects; however, peripheral nerve blocks
      have never been tested, formally, in a randomized pediatric trial.

      By applying a novel design that utilizes lidocaine cream as a run-in step, investigators
      intend to test the efficacy of the most commonly used peripheral nerve block, the greater
      occipital nerve (GON) block, as an acute treatment for pediatric migraine and determine
      whether lidocaine cream leads to successful blinding of the injection.

      The GON block is expected to prove effective in decreasing the pain of migraine, with
      lidocaine being superior to saline and lidocaine cream maintaining blinding.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There are two substantial hurdles that must be overcome in designing a trial to test the
      efficacy of PNBs: high placebo response rate and possible unblinding. In order to test the
      efficacy of this commonly used treatment for children and adolescents with difficult-to-treat
      headache, we need utilize a trial design which will address the high placebo response rate
      and the potential lack of blinding.

      About 58 children, recruited over a 3.5 year period at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia,
      will take part in this study. Participation will last about one month and involve one
      in-person study visit, and then completion of headache-related surveys, at home, for 28 days.
      Lidocaine cream lead-in will be used open-label for all subjects followed by double-blind
      randomized injections of active treatment (lidocaine) versus comparator (saline) in subjects
      who continue to have significant headache.

      To accomplish our secondary objectives, we will examine how expectation is affected by
      perceived treatment, and how expectations, measured in patients, parents, and providers,
      influence outcomes in pediatric and adolescent acute migraine.

    <measure>Mean Change in Pain Intensity Scores</measure>
    <time_frame>Pre-injection and 30 minutes Post-injection</time_frame>
    <description>By subtracting the 30 minutes post-injection score from the pre-injection score, measured on a Visual Analog Scale (VAS), the mean change, in the lidocaine versus saline groups, will be used as the primary outcome measure. A mean change of 2-points has been shown to be clinically relevant.</description>

    <measure>Change from Baseline Disability</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Day 7</time_frame>
    <description>The PROMIS Pain Interference (Short Form) as well as the PedMIDAS will assess changes in functional disability due to headache. The PROMIS Pain Interference (Short Form) measures the self-reported consequences of pain on relevant aspects of the subject's life over the past seven days. A pain item pool was developed to yield scores on a T-score scale with a mean of 50 and standard deviation of 10. The PedMIDAS is a validated 6-question scale that captures headache-related disability—across multiple domains of functioning including school, home, social, and recreational—for pediatric and adolescent aged patients over 3 months. The instrument measures the number of days in which subjects missed activities due to headache or migraine. The measure yields a total score by summing items. Total scores correspond to one of four disability grades: 0 - 10 = little to no disability; 11-30 = mild disability; 31-50 = moderate disability; and &gt; 50 = severe disability.</description>
