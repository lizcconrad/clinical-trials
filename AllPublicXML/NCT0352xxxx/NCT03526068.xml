  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The threat of MRSA and multi-drug resistant pathogens have been growing in recent years. A
      new means of countering the infectious threat is required and one such modality is the use of
      UV light for disinfection. The aim of the study is to proof the efficacy of the 222nm UV
      light in disinfection on patients with sacral sores. This is a first in human
      proof-of-concept study

    <textblock>
      Recent outbreaks of Ebola and MERS, and in the trend of growing threat of MRSA and multi-drug
      resistant pathogens, it is clear that a new means of countering the infectious threat is
      needed - even the US, EU, and Korean hospitals with the latest facilities has failed to stop
      the spread of these pathogens inside their wards.

      This novel &quot;Harmless UV Light,&quot; operating within the &quot;Safe Zone Wave Length,&quot; will be a
      disruptive technology to counter the growing threats of infectious diseases, such as
      multi-drug-resistant bacteria and also viruses such as Ebola, MERS and new type Influenza. It
      will be a disruptive device in that it aims to be applied to fast, effective and labor-free
      disinfection of living environments, such as hospital wards, airports, and other public
      spaces to stop the spread of pathogens. This research is the first human clinical trial using
      this device that will spearhead the development of this technology, providing the key
      starting clinical data which would be the lead to development for a wider range of
      indications and markets. Successful proof of concept will lead to the next stage
      collaboration of larger scale clinical trials, and trials targeting wider range of
      indications and markets, at NUHS.

    <description>SafeZoneUVC® uses a Krypton Chloride (Kr-Cl) excimer lamp as its light source. The Kr-Cl excimer lamp emits UVC light having a main wavelength of 222 nm when the Kr-Cl exciplex is deactivated to non-excited state molecule in the lamp. This 222 nm UVC light can inactivate bacteria, while the Kr-Cl excimer lamp also emits UVC light having a wavelength of 230 nm or more. SafeZoneUVC® effectively eliminates UVC light with a wavelength of 230 nm or more by incorporating an appropriate optical filter inside the unit and also utilizing an opaque guide to ensure that light is not dispersed beyond the target area.</description>
