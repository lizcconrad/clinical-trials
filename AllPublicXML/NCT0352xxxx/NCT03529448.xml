  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Glioblastoma is the primary brain tumour with the worst prognosis: median survival is only 12
      months despite the use of the most advanced treatments. In the past 10 years, survival in the
      treatment of this disease has not advanced significantly, with the postoperative standard
      being the administration of chemoradiotherapy with temozolomide, followed by 6 cycles of
      sequential chemotherapy with temozolomide.

      Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and cannabidiol (CBD) have shown a clear synergistic antitumour
      effect with temozolomide and radiotherapy in preclinical glioma models. THC and CBD have a
      wide variety of biological effects by binding with and activating the type 1 and type 2
      cannabinoid receptors (CB1 expressed in certain neuronal areas of the brain and CB2 expressed
      in the immune system and in glial cells). The activation of these receptors initiates a
      signalling pathway, called the endoplasmic reticulum stress response, which generates tumour
      cell autophagy by activating TRB3.

      Given these data, the Spanish Group for Neuro-oncology (GEINO) proposes developing a phase
      Ib, open-label, multicenter, intrapatient dose-escalation clinical trial to assess the safety
      profile of the THC+CBD combination at a 1:1 ratio, adding temozolomide and radiotherapy in
      patients with newly-diagnosed glioblastoma.

      The number of patients to be recruited is 30 over 6 months at 8 sites specialising in
      neuro-oncology.

    <description>During Phase Ib, Four to seven weeks after surgical diagnosis, concurrent with radiotherapy (STUPP)
+ temozolomide (75mg/m2/day for 42 days) +TN-TC11G will be evaluated. During radiation therapy, temozolomide and TN-TC11G will be administered. This last, as the dose that have been selected previously, based on dose-titration period. Patient specific dose will remain until progresion of disease, unacceptable toxicity, non-compliance, consent withdrawal up to 2 years.</description>

          -  Patients must have recovered from previous surgeries (time between surgery and
             inclusion in the study: 6 weeks).

          -  Karnofsky Index ≥60%.

          -  Creatinine clearance &gt;60 ml/min/1.73 m2.

          -  The study treatment's effects on the development of the human foetus are not known.
             For this reason, women of childbearing age and men must agree to use a suitable birth
             control method (hormonal, barrier, abstinence or surgical sterilisation) before
             inclusion in the study, for the duration of the study and for at least 3 months after
             completing the trial treatment. The definition of an effective method of birth control
             is based on the judgement of the principal investigator or their designee. If a woman
             is pregnant or there is suspicion that she might be pregnant while participating in
             the study, she must inform the trial doctor immediately. All women of childbearing age
             should have a negative pregnancy test (serum/urine) in the 2 weeks prior to the
             beginning of treatment.

        Exclusion Criteria:

             medication in the form of oral tablets or solution.

          -  Presence of any psychiatric or cognitive impairment that limits understanding or the
             signing of the informed consent and/or compromises compliance with the requirements of
             this protocol.

          -  Significant or uncontrolled cardiovascular disease, including: 1. Myocardial
             infarction in the previous 12 months. 2. Uncontrolled angina in the previous 6 months.
             3. Congestive heart failure in the previous 6 months. 4. Diagnosed or suspected
             congenital long QT syndrome. 5. History of ventricular arrhythmias of any clinically
             significant type (such as ventricular tachycardia, ventricular fibrillation or
             torsades de pointes). 6. QTc prolongation on an electrocardiogram prior to entry (&gt;470
             ms). 7. History of second- or third-degree heart block (these patients may be eligible

          -  Any patient with a history of significant cardiovascular disease, even if it is
             currently controlled, or who presents signs or symptoms that suggest impaired left
             ventricular function according to the investigator should have an assessment of left
             ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) by ECCO or MUGA. If the LVEF in these
             circumstances is below the site's lower limit of normality or less than 50%, the
             patient will not be eligible.

          -  History of any cancer, except in the following circumstances: Patients with a history
             of other malignancies are eligible if they have been disease-free for at least the
             last 3 years and if, in the investigator's opinion, there is a low risk of disease
             recurrence. People with the following cancers are eligible, even if they have been
             diagnosed and treated in the past 3 years: cervical carcinoma in situ and basal cell
             carcinoma.

        Patients will not be eligible if there is evidence of another cancer that required therapy
        other than surgery in the past 3 years.
