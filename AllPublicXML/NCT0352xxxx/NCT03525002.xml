  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Obesity is a widespread disease with increasing prevalence and associated with serious
      secondary complications. So far, the origin of the disease, regardless of an existing
      positive energy balance, is not fully understood. In addition to environmental factors, the
      genetic background plays an important role in the pathogenesis of obesity. Of common genetic
      polymorphisms, variants in the fat mass and obesity associated gene (FTO) locus have the
      highest effect size on body weight. Animal and first clinical studies indicate that FTO
      variants interact with dopamine signaling in the brain, thus influencing the risk of
      overweight. In fact, preliminary results indicate that enhancing dopamine signaling with the
      dopamine agonist bromocriptine, depending on the FTO genotype, either induces weight loss or
      has a neutral effect on body weight.

      The planned clinical trial serves to develop a genotype-specific and thus individualized
      therapy approach for obesity. The influence of dopamine agonist therapy on weight loss as a
      function of the FTO (rs8050136) genotype is to be tested.

      Here, the greatest weight loss is expected to occur in subjects carrying the homozygous
      risk-allele (AA).

      So far, there are only a few established conservative therapy forms of obesity, so that
      bariatric interventions with an increasing rate are necessary to achieve weight loss and thus
      a reduction in overall morbidity and mortality. Among the approved drug therapies for
      obesity, bromocriptine is commonly used. In addition, some interventions require injections.
      An early, conservative individualized, genotype-specific treatment with little side-effects
      would enable simple treatment of obesity.

      Study design: 150 obese (BMI &gt; 30) subjects (50 / study center) will be enrolled in the
      study. The subjects will be stratified according to their FTO genotype (rs8050136). Subjects
      will be randomized into placebo or bromocriptine treatment group. Treatment will last for 18
      weeks and a follow-up will be performed 30 weeks after baseline.
