  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pregnancy is associated with increased requirements for iron and increased blood volume of up
      to 40%. Because expansion in plasma volume is higher than the increase in the mass of red
      blood cells, there is a fall in hemoglobin concentration, which leads to physiological
      anemia, characterized with lower hemoglobin (Hb), hematocrit and red blood cells, but without
      changes in mean corpuscular volume (MCV). Anemia in pregnancy is defined with Hb values under
      110 g/L in the first trimester and under 105 g/L in the second and third trimester.

      Iron deficiency is thought to be the most common nutrient deficiency among pregnant women.
      Consequences of anemia include delayed fetal growth, premature delivery, intrauterine fetal
      death, postpartum depression and delayed psychomotor development of a child. It is known that
      in women that are not anemic daily iron supplementation of 27 mg/day is sufficient, which can
      be obtained from adequate nutrition or body supplies. Iron supplementation is pregnancy has
      been recommended by the WHO (World Health Organisation) since 1959, and this recommendation
      was confirmed by numerous professional associations. However, in women with anemia, or women
      subjected to particular dietary regimens with diminished quantity of iron, including
      vegetarian or vegan diet, required supplementation dosage is higher, and estimated in the
      literature to be 120 mg/day.

      The aim of this study was to analyze whether adding vitamin B12 (5 µg /100 days), along with
      folic acid and iron as supplement in pregnant women who are not anemic and who need only iron
      supplementation, will result in improvements of hematological and biochemical markers.
