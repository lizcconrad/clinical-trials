    <textblock>
      Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a complex disorder with clinical manifestations ranging from
      mild dysfunction to complete anuric kidney failure. Its leads to sudden and rapid decline in
      renal excretory function within hours to days,accompanied by accumulation of nitrogenous
      waste products such creatinine,urea and other clinically un measured products

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Acute kidney injury (AKI) is an under-recognized morbidity of neonates; the incidence remains
      unclear due to the absence of a unified definition of AKI in this population and because
      previous studies have varied greatly in screening for AKI with serum creatinine and urine
      output assessments. Premature infants may be born with less than half of the nephrons
      compared with term neonates, predisposing them to chronic kidney disease (CKD) early on in
      life and as they age. AKI can also lead to CKD, and premature infants with AKI may be at very
      high risk for long-term kidney problems. AKI in neonates is often multifactorial and may
      result from prenatal, perinatal, or postnatal insults as well as any combination thereof.
