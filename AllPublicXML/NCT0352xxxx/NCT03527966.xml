      This study is aimed at comparing the overall efficacy (clinical and radiographic) of Vivigen,
      a novel cellular allograft product, and rhBMP-2 when utilized in lumbar fusion procedures.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare the overall efficacy (clinical outcome and
      radiographic fusion) of Vivigen (cellular allograft product) and rhBMP-2 in patients who
      undergo a single level lumbar instrumented fusion. Specifically, when compared to their
      control group counterparts treated to rhBMP-2, we hypothesize that the intervention group
      administered Vivigen would, following surgery, experience:

        1. Comparable mean postoperative leg/back pain score, where the pain scores are obtained
           using the numeric rating scale of 0-no pain, to 10-worst pain possible

        2. Comparable inpatient length of stay (LOS)

        3. Comparable postoperative Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) score (0-no disability, to
           100-maximum disability possible), two weeks, 6 weeks, 3 months, 6 months, and 1 year
           postoperatively

        4. Comparable fusion rates, evaluated via CT scan I year postoperatively

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Age 18 or older;

          2. Diagnosed with lumbar degenerative/isthmic spondylolisthesis, degenerative disc
             disease with axial low back pain and neurologic symptoms, failed conservative
             treatment and eligible for a single level lumbar instrumented fusion;

          3. Willing to provide informed consent, participate in study, and comply with study
             protocol.

        Exclusion Criteria:
