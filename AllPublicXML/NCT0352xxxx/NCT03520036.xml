    <textblock>
      This is a Phase II, randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled study to assess the
      efficacy, tolerability, and safety of MT-7117 in subjects with EPP. The study consists of a 2
      week screening period, a 16 week double-blind treatment period, and a 6 week follow-up period
      at Week 22. The total participation period is approximately 24 weeks.
