  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is being done because new treatment for patients with metastatic or locally
      advanced cancers expressing Neurotensin receptor 1 (NTSR1) is being studied. This study will
      be the first administration of a radioactive drug called 177Lu-3BP-227 to patients under
      controlled conditions of a clinical study. The purpose of this study is to evaluate how safe
      this investigational drug is as well to verify how well it is tolerated by patients after
      several intravenous administrations. In addition, we will evaluate the effect of the study
      drug on tumoral lesions and how it distributes throughout the body and at which rate it is
      removed from the body. Since 177Lu-3BP-227 is a radio-labelled drug, it will also be measured
      how the emitted radiation is distributed throughout the body (dosimetry).

      The study consists of a phase I with a dose escalation part (and potential expansion cohorts)
      and a phase II either in selected or over multiple indications in a basket approach. For the
      dose escalation part, it is anticipated that approximately 30 subjects will be included, in
      up to six escalation steps. In case of the implementation of phase I expansion cohorts, up to
      45 additional subjects will be enrolled. For the phase II, approximately 125 subjects (55
      Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma and 70 Colorectal cancer subjects) are planned to be
      enrolled for Basket trial or Optimal Simon's Two Stage design. If additional cohorts of
      subjects with Gastric cancer (GC) or Squamous-cell carcinoma of head and neck (SCCHN) in the
      phase II are to be studied, approximately 100 additional subjects will be enrolled.
