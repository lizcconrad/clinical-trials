      The study is a randomized, double-blind, controlled randomized, double-blind, controlled
      clinical trial clinical trial. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the immunogenicity
      and safety of Sabin Inactivated Poliovirus Vaccine (Vero cell) manufactured by Sinovac
      Vaccine Technology Co., Ltd in 2-month-old infants. The control vaccine is a commercialized
      Inactivated Poliovirus Vaccine manufactured by Sanofi Pasteur company. 1200 healthy infants
      between 60-90 days will be randomly assigned into experimental group or control group in the
      ratio 1:1.
