  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The rate of postpartum hemorrhage (PPH) has risen dramatically in the developed world, along
      with a rise in blood transfusion rates. The rate of cesarean delivery has increased
      dramatically in the past decade and is well over 30% in the United States. With an increase
      in primary and repeat cesarean delivery, comes the added risk of abnormal placentation, which
      can contribute to maternal and fetal morbidity and mortality via placenta accreta, increta,
      and percreta. The incidence of accreta has increased 10-fold over the past 50 years, becoming
      the most common reason for cesarean hysterectomy in highly industrialized countries. These
      conditions have tremendous impact on maternal outcomes.

      Although whole blood (WB) contains all of the individual blood components, there are concerns
      for the use of WB due to the potential limitations such as the hemostatic efficacy of
      platelet after cold storage, the risk of hemolytic transfusion reaction following the
      transfusion of un-cross matched WB and the logistical issues in providing WB. Traditional
      obstetric transfusion protocols involve blood component therapy. Whole blood contains all
      components and could be more efficient for massive transfusion in obstetric hemorrhage.
      Trauma resuscitation protocols mimic whole blood in the 1:1:1 transfusion protocols of packed
      red blood cells to plasma to platelet ratio. It is difficult to compare trauma resuscitation
      to obstetric hemorrhage, but both can involve significant resuscitation and serious sequelae
      from unnecessary transfusion.

      The use of WB instead of component therapy may reduce the multiple organ dysfunction rates
      due to the rapid resolution of shock and coagulopathy. Additionally, the number of donor
      exposure is important factor for the transfusion-related allergic reactions including severe
      systemic reactions such as anaphylaxis. Use of WB may decrease number of donor exposure. The
      secondary aim is to compare the incidence of 3 common adverse outcomes associated with the
      transfusion of blood products in subjects who receive whole blood versus component therapy.

      We hypothesize that the patients receiving WB will have fewer incidences of a) acute renal
      failure, b) acute heart failure and c) transfusion-related lung disease compared to those
      receiving component therapy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Rates of obstetric blood product transfusion have increased by 33% since 2001, with the
      majority of this phenomenon associated with hemorrhage. While transfusion in obstetrics
      represents a very small proportion of overall blood use, it is a limited, costly resource,
      and not without risk. The current trend is to reduce unnecessary transfusion and utilize
      goal-directed therapy.

      Unfortunately, obstetric transfusions tend to be urgent, unpredictable, and occur in
      otherwise healthy women. The maternal population has changed dramatically with older
      first-time mothers, women with multiple repeat cesarean deliveries, and the presence of
      significant co-morbidity. Clinical practice may also have changed in slightly less
      restrictive criteria for transfusion practices all resulting in higher transfusion rates in
      the obstetric population.

      Identified risk factors that predispose a woman to obstetric hemorrhage include abnormal
      placentation in the form of placenta previa or a low-lying placenta, placenta
      accrete/percreta/increta, hematocrit level of less than 30 in conjunction with other risk
      factors, platelet (PLT) count of less than 100 X 109/L, active bleeding on admission, and
      known coagulopathy. Other risk factors during and after labor include prolonged second stage
      of labor, prolonged oxytocin use, active bleeding, chorioamnionitis, magnesium sulfate use,
      use of vacuum or forceps-assisted delivery, cesarean delivery, and retained placenta.

      The presence and easy access to component therapy can pose a problem at smaller institutions.
      Many smaller hospitals for example, may thaw plasma only on receipt of an order to transfuse
      the plasma, which can cause a significant delay. Similarly, many community hospitals may not
      routinely stock platelets. While these smaller facilities are crucial to taking care of
      routine patients, the more severe hemorrhaging patient could potentially benefit from whole
      blood.

      Our aim in this study is to compare overall transfusion rates in subjects who receive whole
      blood to those who receive component therapy to see if there is any benefit to whole blood
      transfusion.
