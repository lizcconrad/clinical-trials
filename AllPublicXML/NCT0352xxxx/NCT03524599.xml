  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A quasi-experimental study will compare primary health care-based prevention and management
      of alcohol use disorder, operationalized by heavy drinking, in three intervention cities from
      Colombia, Mexico and Peru with three comparator cities from the same countries. In the
      implementation cities, primary health care units (PHCUs) will receive training embedded
      within ongoing supportive municipal action over an 18-month implementation period. In the
      comparator cities, practice as usual will continue at both municipal and PHCU levels. The
      primary outcome will be the proportion of consulting adult patients intervened with (screened
      and advice given to screen positives).
