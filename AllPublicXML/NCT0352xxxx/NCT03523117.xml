  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to demonstrate the efficacy and safety of intravenous
      ferric carboxymaltose (FCM), compared to oral iron, in pediatric participants who have iron
      deficiency anemia.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase III, multicenter, randomized, active-controlled study that compares the
      efficacy and safety of FCM to oral iron in pediatric participants with IDA and a documented
      history of an inadequate response to oral iron therapy at least 8 weeks (56 days) prior to
      randomization.

      Participants who satisfy the inclusion requirements and no exclusion criteria will be
      eligible to participate in this study and enter into a screening phase to confirm
      eligibility. Randomization will occur via the Interactive Response Technology (IRT) system in
      a 1:1 ratio to either Group A, participants receiving FCM, or Group B, participants receiving
      oral iron (oral solution drops, elixir or oral tablets). Randomization will be stratified by
      baseline Hgb (&lt;10, ≥10 g/dL) and age (1 to &lt;12 years and ≥12 to 17 years).

      The oral ferrous sulfate formulation received will be based on the participant's age, such
      that infants and children (1 to &lt;4 years of age) will receive ferrous sulfate drops, children
      (≥4 to &lt;12 years of age) will receive ferrous sulfate elixir, and adolescents (≥12 to 17
      years of age) will receive ferrous sulfate tablets. Participants who experience adverse
      clinical symptoms due to the oral iron during the treatment phase may have a weight-based
      dose of ferrous sulfate reduced from 6 mg/kg to 3 mg/kg. If the participant is receiving
      tablets, the dose will be reduced from one tablet taken twice daily to one tablet per day.

      Once randomized, all participants will return for efficacy and safety evaluations, including
      adverse events and laboratory assessments, on Days 7, 14, 28, and 35. Additional
      pharmacokinetic sampling and analyses will be performed for participants receiving FCM on
      Days 0 and 7.

Infants and children (ages 1 to &lt;4 years) will receive oral ferrous sulfate drops, while children (ages ≥4 to &lt;12 years) will receive oral ferrous sulfate elixir.
