      Background:

      Chronic hepatitis C infects the liver. It may scar the liver. This is called cirrhosis and
      may lead to liver cancer or death. Current chronic hepatitis C treatments cure most people.
      But some keep getting complications even after it is cured. Researchers want to study why.

      Objective:

      To study the course and complications of liver disease after cure of hepatitis C infection.

      Eligibility:

      Adults 18 years and older infected with chronic hepatitis C virus who were never treated or
      were treated and not cured and those who were cured

      Design:

      Participants will be screened with:

      Blood and urine tests

      Questionnaires

      Liver ultrasound

      Fibroscan. A probe vibrates the liver, testing stiffness.

      In Phase 1, people with chronic hepatitis C will:

      Have a 3-day clinic stay to repeat some screening tests and have a liver biopsy. A small
      piece of liver is removed by needle passed through the skin.

      Take 1 tablet containing 2 hepatitis C drugs once a day for 12 weeks.

      Repeat some screening tests at 3 visits in those 12 weeks, then 4 visits in the next 24
      weeks.

      Phase 1 participants who test negative for hepatitis C and all other participants will enter
      Phase 2.

      Phase 2 participants will have a visit every 24 weeks for 10 years. These may include:

      Repeats of screening tests

      Scans

      Stool tests

      Chest x-ray

      Heart function test

      Endoscopy. A tube guides a camera into the upper digestive system.

      At about 5 years, participants will have another liver biopsy.

      Some participants will give separate consent for genetic testing and a special blood
      procedure.

      We intend to observe up to 350 patients with chronic HCV infection who have successfully
      eradiated HCV following therapy with direct acting antiviral agents and describe the
      clinical, virological, laboratory, histological and immunological outcomes following
      eradication of HCV. Subjects will be recruited from two sources: 1) subjects who have already
      achieved SVR with a DAA only regimen and who have undergone a liver biopsy within five years
      prior to therapy and no history of hepatic decompensation or hepatocellular carcinoma and 2)
      treatment na(SqrRoot) ve or experienced who have failed a prior treatment (including
      DAA-experienced) who are willing to undergo a pre-treatment liver biopsy. Subjects yet to
      achieve SVR with evidence of clinical cirrhosis will undergo a transjugular liver biopsy with
      measurement of portal pressures in lieu of the percutaneous liver biopsy. Subjects yet to
      achieve an SVR will receive 12 weeks of therapy with sofosbuvir/velapatasvir fixed dose
      combination. Subjects who have attained a SVR (or upon achieving an SVR) will undergo a
      thorough medical evaluation, laboratory testing, transient elastography and hepatic
      ultrasound. Thereafter, subjects will be followed prospectively every 24 weeks for liver
      decompensation (ascites, spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, hepatic encephalopathy, variceal
      hemorrhage), hepatocellular carcinoma, liver-related mortality and all-cause mortality.
      During each study visit, subjects will be questioned on the development of these adverse
      outcomes. In addition, blood will be drawn for the assessment of routine blood tests,
      quantitative viral biomarker levels, serological response markers and immune cell functional
      status. Blood, urine and stool will be collected and stored for exploratory biomarker
      development. Transient elastography will be performed annually in all subjects. For subjects
      with cirrhosis, esophagogastroduodenoscopy will be performed annually and imaging every 24
      weeks. At the end of 240 weeks, all subjects will be admitted to undergo a liver biopsy to
      assess the stage of liver fibrosis. In subjects with cirrhosis at study entry, the liver
      biopsy will be performed by the transjugular route with hepatic venous pressure measurements.
      The primary goal of the study will be to describe the natural history of viral eradication
      following treatment with direct acting antiviral agents, to identify predictors of adverse
      outcomes after sustained viral eradication and regression of fibrosis/cirrhosis.
