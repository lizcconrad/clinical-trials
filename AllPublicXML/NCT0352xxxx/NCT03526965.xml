  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Neck Pain caused by Cervical spondylosis (CS) is one of the most common health complaints.
      Despite its frequency as clinical problem worldwide, there are few evidence-based studies
      that document efficacy of therapies for neck pain. The aim of this study was to evaluate the
      effects of Yoga chikitsa (Yoga therapy) on pain and quality of life (QOL) in CS patients
      compared to usual care.
