    <textblock>
      Primary Objective:

        -  To demonstrate that sotagliflozin reduces cardiovascular (CV) mortality and morbidity
           (composite of CV death or hospitalization for heart failure [HHF]) compared to placebo
           in hemodynamically stable patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D) and heart failure (HF)
           with left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) &lt;50%, after admission for worsening heart
           failure (WHF).

        -  To demonstrate that sotagliflozin reduces cardiovascular (CV) mortality and morbidity
           (composite of CV death or hospitalization for heart failure [HHF]) compared to placebo
           in hemodynamically stable patients with T2D and HF irrespective of LVEF after admission
           for WHF.

      Secondary Objectives:

        -  To demonstrate that, when compared to placebo in the toal patient population,
           sotagliflozin reduces the total number (i.e., including recurrent events) of the
           following clinical events:

        -  Cardiovascular death, HHF or urgent HF visit.

        -  To demonstrate that, when compared to placebo, sotagliflozin reduces:

        -  The composite of positively adjudicated sustained ≥50% decrease in eGFR, chronic
           dialysis, renal transplant or positively adjudicated sustained eGFR &lt;15 mL/min/1.73 m2
           in the total patient population.

        -  Cardiovascular death in patients with LVEF &lt; 50%.

        -  Cardiovascular death in the total patient population.

        -  All-cause mortality in patients with LVEF &lt; 50%.

        -  All cause mortality in the total patient population.

        -  To demonstrate the safety and tolerability of sotagliflozin in the total population in
           this study.
