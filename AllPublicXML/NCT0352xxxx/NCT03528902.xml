    <textblock>
      The main purpose of this clinical trial is to examine the feasibility and effects of
      tamoxifen in subjects with pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH). The study will evaluate how
      well the drug is tolerated, and its impact on functional condition and selected biomarkers.
      Changes in tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion (TAPSE) and other parameters determined
      by transthoracic echocardiography will be evaluated as well as changes in additional metrics
      such as six minute walk test distance, quality of life assessments, and hormone levels.

    <textblock>
      Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is characterized by progressive loss of function by the
      pulmonary vascular bed due to a variety of factors including obliterative vascular lesions,
      vasoconstriction, and thrombotic occlusion of the pulmonary arteries. Ultimately, right-sided
      heart failure ensues with severe limitation of exercise and eventual progression to death or
      lung transplantation. While there are multiple FDA-approved therapies for PAH representing 3
      major pathways of interest, no treatments are curative, and have additional limitations
      including high expense, multiple side effects, and dosing inconveniences.

      The strongest established risk factor for the progressively fatal disease pulmonary arterial
      hypertension (PAH) is female sex (~3:1 female:male ratio). We and others have found higher
      circulating estrogen levels, and enhanced estrogen signaling, in PAH patients. Preclinical
      work by our group and others supports the concept that anti-estrogen therapy, is effective
      for both prevention and treatment in PAH. Recent and ongoing clinical studies are underway to
      assess these approaches in humans, including a recent study demonstrating the safety of
      estrogen reduction in postmenopausal women.

      Tamoxifen is the most commonly used selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM). Due to its
      extensive use in humans for over three decades, it has an excellent safety profile and its
      long-term sequelae are well characterized. Furthermore, it is a generic drug which has been
      FDA-approved for treatment and prevention of breast cancer, particularly those with estrogen
      receptor-positive neoplasms.

      To help to determine whether tamoxifen may be a safe and effective treatment for PAH in women
      and men, we will conduct a single-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase
      II study of subjects with PAH. All subjects will also be treated with background standard of
      care therapy at the discretion of their PAH care physician.

    <measure>Transthoracic echocardiogram (ECHO)-based change in the Tricuspid Annular Plane Systolic Excursion (TAPSE) measurement</measure>
    <time_frame>24 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Transthoracic echocardiograms (ECHOs) will be performed to measure the TAPSE value prior to Intervention at Week 0, as well as at the end of the study intervention (Week 24). The primary outcome measure will be the change in TAPSE, determined by echocardiogram, from Week 0 to Week 24.
About TAPSE: Tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion (TAPSE) is a parameter of global right ventricular function which describes apex-to-base shortening of the ventricle. It is obtained by transthoracic echocardiogram, which can be performed on a resting subject without sedation in the outpatient setting. TAPSE correlates closely with the right ventricular ejection fraction, and has been determined to be both highly specific and easy to measure.</description>

    <measure>Six minute walk test distance (6MWTD)</measure>
    <time_frame>24 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Change in 6MWTD from Week 0 to Week 24. The 6-minute walk test distance (6MWTD) is a widely accepted measure of exercise capacity and functional status. The 6MWTD is a clinical and research test obtained in a standardized manner according to American Thoracic Society (ATS) Guidelines.
Briefly, the 6MWT is a sub-maximal exercise test on flat ground that is used to assess aerobic capacity and endurance. The distance covered over a time of 6 minutes is used as the outcome by which to compare changes in performance capacity over time.</description>

    <ipd_description>Since the data that will be produced involves patients with a disease process that is much in need of new treatment options and the investigators agree that data sharing is essential for expedited translation of research results into patient treatment options. A detailed data sharing plan is in place and available upon request. In brief:
It is our plan to make data available at the time it is accepted for publication of the main findings from the final dataset through the use of a data enclave of our own design that would restrict our Data Analyst from sharing any information that would breach participant confidentiality. Potential researchers will contact the PI to discuss specific needs and how the data will be utilized. A formal approval process is in place to evaluate and complete such requests.</ipd_description>
