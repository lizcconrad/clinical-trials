  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Intensive care unit acquired muscle weakness (ICUAW), is a common disease which influence
      rehabilitation, extend mechanical ventilation and length of stay in intensive care unit, and
      affect quality of life at hospital discharge.

      To prevent ICUAW, different strategies of early mobilization are recommended. But all cannot
      be applied in all ICU patients. Some of them benefit from heavy therapies like circulatory
      assistance or renal replacement therapy for example, that limit mobilization.

      Cycloergometer is a tool that allows continuous passive mobilization in bedridden and even
      unconscious patients.

      Neuromuscular electrical stimulation (NMES) is an alternative that helps preserve muscle mass
      and limit muscle atrophy.

      Early bedside cycle exercise coupled with NMES is an interesting new approach where
      application of an electrical stimulation along specific motor nerves on each lower limb,
      generates muscles contractions and pedaling on cycloergometer.

      The aim of this study is to evaluate safety and feasibility of this coupled technique called
      Functional Electrical Stimulation (FES) Cycling, in ICU patients.
