  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to demonstrate superiority of the Absorb scaffold
      compared to the Sequent Please Drug Coated Balloon when treating patients with
      In-Stent-Restenosis (ISR).

    <textblock>
      Absorb ISR is randomized-controlled trial of Absorb scaffold vs. Sequent Please drug coated
      balloon in an all-comers population with in-stent-restenosis. The patients will be randomized
      in a 1:1 fashion and the investigators intend to include 150 patients.

      Repeat coronary angiography will be performed 9 months post intervention in all subjects.
      Optical coherence tomography will be performed at baseline and at 9 months in both groups.

      All patients presenting with ISR and requiring percutaneous coronary intervention will be
      eligible to be included in this study. This will include patients with stable angina and
      those presenting with acute coronary syndrome (ACS).
