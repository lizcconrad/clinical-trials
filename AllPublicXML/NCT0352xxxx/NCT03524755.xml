  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cancer cachexia is a prevalent symptom of head and neck neoplasms. The reduction in skeletal
      muscle mass is one of the main characteristics which can lead to poor physical functioning.
      The purpose of this study was to determine the feasibility of progressive resistance training
      in cachectic head and neck cancer patients during radiotherapy in a pilot randomized
      controlled design.

      Baseline data for all participants were ascertained via medical records and patient
      interview. This included demographic information, Union internationale contre le
      cancer-status (UICC-status), comorbidities and the results of blood samples. Outcomes were
      measured at admission. One study coordinator completed all assessments to enhance patient
      compliance. Body weight loss percentage was calculated via the individuals' body weight 6
      months before (in retrospect) and the current body weight. Participants completed two
      questionnaires: The Multidimensional Fatigue Inventory and the Functional Assessment of
      Anorexia/Cachexia Therapy questionnaire. Six-Minute Walk Test was applied. To document
      changes in muscle force, strength of the functional muscle group for elbow flexion in supine
      position as well as of knee extension in sitting position (in each case right and left) was
      tested via hand-held dynamometry for isometric maximal muscle strength. Bioelectrical
      impedance analysis was executed to assess the adaption in body composition.

      The exercise intervention was undertaken in the hospitals department of physical and
      rehabilitation medicine and based on standardized but individualized training protocols. It
      consisted of a warm up period for 5 minutes on a bicycle ergometer or an upper body cycle
      with individual selectable wattage. A leg press, a latissimus pull-down and a chest press
      formed the three equipment supported core exercises. All exercises were performed with 8-12
      repetitions and 3 sets.
