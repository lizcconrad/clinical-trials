    <textblock>
      The goal of the study was to ascertain the influence of dental caries and teeth position as
      well as the type and amount of the applied dental materials (DMs) on the oxidative stress
      (OS) status in gingival crevicular fluid (GCF).

    <textblock>
      Six DMs were tested by investigators, each sealed in one session: amalgam (Amg), zinc
      phosphate cement (ZnPhC), zinc polycarboxylate cement (ZnPoC), glass ionomer cement (GIC) and
      composites, Tetric EvoCeram (TEC) and Beautifil (BF).

      The study included 88 dental outpatients. Oxidative stress parameters, including
      malondialdehyde (MDA), glutathione (GSH) and total superoxide dismutase (tSOD) activity were
      measured in GCF, before (day 0) and after treatment (7th and 30th day).

      Antagonistically positioned healthy teeth were used as a control.

    <intervention_model_description>According to Black's Classification Criteria, patients were classified into four groups (K2 - K5). The number of patients within those groups were as follows: K2 (n=58), K3 (n=10), K4 (n=6) and K5 (n=14).
Six different DMs were used in this study. The type of DM to be used for each patient was determined in relation to the dental lesion degree. DM placement was performed in one session and only one type was used per patient. Accordingly, 6 groups (arms) of dental patients (Amg, ZnPhC, ZnPoC, GIC, TEC and BF) were formed.
Parameters of OS (MDA, GSH and tSOD) were measured in the GCF of the patients both before (day 0) and after treatment (on the 7th and 30th day).</intervention_model_description>
