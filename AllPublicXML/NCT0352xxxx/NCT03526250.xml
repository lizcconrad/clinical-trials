    <textblock>
      This phase II Pediatric MATCH trial studies how well palbociclib works in treating patients
      with Rb positive solid tumors, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, or histiocytic disorders with activating
      alterations (mutations) in cell cycle genes that have spread to other places in the body and
      have come back or do not respond to treatment. Palbociclib may stop the growth of cancer
      cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the objective response rate (ORR; complete response + partial response) in
      pediatric patients treated with palbociclib with advanced solid tumors (including central
      nervous system [CNS] tumors), non-Hodgkin lymphomas or histiocytic disorders that harbor
      activating genetic alterations in cell cycle genes.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To estimate the progression free survival in pediatric patients treated with palbociclib
      with advanced solid tumors (including CNS tumors), non-Hodgkin lymphomas or histiocytic
      disorders that harbor activating genetic alterations in alterations in cell cycle genes.

      II. To obtain information about the tolerability of palbociclib in children and adolescents
      with relapsed or refractory cancer.

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To explore approaches to profiling changes in tumor genomics over time through evaluation
      of circulating tumor deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA).

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive palbociclib orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-21. Courses repeat every
      28 days for up to 2 years in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.
