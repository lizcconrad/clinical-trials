    <textblock>
      Pouch ischemia plays an important role in the pathogenesis of pouchitis after IPAA surgery
      for ulcerative colitis. Obese Male patients are at high risk for pouchitis because of
      mesenteric tension. Excessive weight gain is associated with an increased risk for pouch
      failure in patients with restorative proctocolectomy. Also, patients with an 'S' pouch hardly
      ever develop chronic pouchitis, owing to the additional length of bowel loop along with
      mesentery when attached to the anal transitional zone. The treatment of chronic
      antibiotic-refractory pouchitis(CARP) is difficult.

      Hyperbaric oxygen therapy(HBOT) have been proven effecitve in the treatment of inflammatory
      bowel diseases(IBD). Meta-analysis revealed that the overall response rate was 86% (85% CD,
      88% UC), and of the endoscopic response rate to HBOT is 100%. The possible mechanism might be
      due to the prmoted wound healing by increasing oxygen delivery to hypooxic tissues and
      changes in inflammatory and immunological mediators.

      Therefore, the aim of current study is to examine the therapeutic effect of HBOT for chronic
      antibiotic-refractory pouchitis(CARP).
