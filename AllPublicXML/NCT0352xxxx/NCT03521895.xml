  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this integrated analysis is to describe the effectiveness of Eylea in an
      integrated pooled analysis using existing individual patient data of two non-interventional
      studies RAINBOW and PERSEUS.

      The primary objective of this integrated analysis is to describe the effectiveness of Eylea
      on the mean change from baseline in visual acuity (VA) at 12 months in Wet age-related
      macular degeneration (wAMD) treatment naïve patients.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        PERSEUS

          -  Patients with wet AMD treated with Eylea (in accordance with the local Summary of
             Product Characteristics, SPC)

          -  Documentation of at least one Aflibercept (Eylea) injection

          -  Assessment of at least one visual acuity measurement with available VA letter score
             for the study eye at baseline and at least one post-baseline assessment of visual
             acuity with available VA letter score for the study eye and valid for analysis, i.e.
             measured at least 5 days after an injection RAINBOW

          -  Patient with a diagnosis of wet AMD will be enrolled after the decision for treatment
             with Aflibercept (Eylea) has been made

          -  Patient who meet the local indication criteria for Eylea treatment

          -  At least one BCVA after the 1st Eylea injection

          -  BCVA at baseline

          -  Patient with no history of retinal disease

          -  Patient not previously treated with any macular laser or any anti-VEGF intravitreal
             injections for the study eye (for fellow eye allowed).

          -  For patients with both eyes treated, the eye firstly treated at initial visit will be
             considered as study eye. If both eyes are treated during initial visit, the treated
             eye with worst Best-Corrected Visual Acuity (BCVA) at M0 will be retained. If the two
             conditions are similar the study eye is the Right eye by convention

          -  Patient with 1st injection of Eylea from 01 January 2014 until 30 April 2015 will be
             enrolled Exclusion criteria PERSEUS

          -  Exclusion criteria as listed in the local SPC

          -  Scar, fibrosis, or atrophy involving the center of the fovea in the study eye

          -  All patients previously treated with any macular laser or any anti-VEGF intravitreal
             injections for the study eye will additionally be excluded for this integrated
             analysis

          -  Any concomitant therapy with another agent to treat wet AMD in the study eye RAINBOW

          -  Patient who does not meet the local indication criteria for Eylea treatment.
             Contraindications listed in the SmPCs must be taken into account

          -  Patient with another retinal disease: diabetic retinopathy, diabetic macular oedema
             (DME), myopic choroidal neovascularization, retinal vein occlusion (RVO), central
             serous chorioretinopathy (CSC), angioid streaks

          -  Patient who has previously been treated with any macular laser (laser and/or
             visudyne/PDT) or any anti-VEGF intravitreal injections for the study eye

          -  Patient taking part in an interventional study at the time of enrolment
