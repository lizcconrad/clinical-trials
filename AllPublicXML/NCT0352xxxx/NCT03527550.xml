  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed to test whether computer-based cognitive exercises are helpful for
      reducing a specific type of impulsivity. Also, the study is testing whether these are
      exercises are associated with specific changes in behavior and in the brain. Participants
      will be psychiatric patients enrolled in a partial hospitalization program. Half of these
      participants will receive usual treatment, and half will complete computer-based cognitive
      exercises in addition to usual treatment.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Impulsivity has different components. One personality trait related to impulsivity, known as
      &quot;urgency,&quot; is strongly related to many different mental health symptoms and risky behaviors.
      Urgency refers to impulsivity specifically in the context of strong emotions.

      Research shows that higher levels of urgency are related to specific deficits in cognition.
      Problems with response inhibition--the ability to cancel or withhold a planned action--are
      associated with urgency. Also, research shows that difficulties in another aspect of
      cognition--working memory--may moderate the relationship between inhibition deficits and
      urgency. One previous study found that people who practiced computerized response inhibition
      and working memory tasks for two weeks reported significant decreases in urgency.

      It is unknown if these computerized tasks would be helpful for reducing urgency in adults
      with psychiatric disorders. Furthermore, it is unknown if changes in urgency are related to
      changes in the brain mechanisms that help to support response inhibition. This study will
      collect data on brain activity while people are completing response inhibition tasks.

    <description>Cognitive Control Training involves daily practice with one of two computerized interventions. The first intervention is an adaptive Go/No-Go task to provide practice in the domain of response inhibition. Participants press a key as fast as possible in response to stimuli (letters of the alphabet), but must inhibit responses to a specific letter. The second intervention is an adaptive Paced Auditory Serial Addition Task (PASAT), designed to practice working memory. Participants are presented with single numbers presented aurally, and must add each number they hear to the previous number and click the correct sum on the screen.</description>
