  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Glioblastoma is the most frequent and aggressive primary brain tumor in adults. A team
      recently showed that baseline plasma levels of matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP2) and matrix
      metalloproteinase-9 (MMP9) were correlated to bevacizumab activity in patients with recurrent
      glioblastoma. To date, the biological rationale of this results remains unknown but MMP2
      could be involved in classical angiogenesis while MMP9 could promote vasculogenesis.

      The objectives are to correlate the plasma levels of MMP2 and MMP9 to their Ribonucleic acid
      (RNA) and protein tissue expression, activity and to patient neuro-imaging features. To
      analyze the changes of MMP2 and MMP9 plasma levels during peri-operative period and after
      radio-chemotherapy.

      Methods: Plasmatic levels of MMP2, MMP9, vascular endothelial growth factor-A (VEGFA),
      vascular endothelial growth factor-R2 (VEGFR2), stromal cell-derived factor 1 (SDF1) and
      chemokine receptor-4 (CXCR4) will be analyzed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) in
      pre-, post-operative period, before radiotherapy, before adjuvant temozolomide and at relapse
      in newly diagnosed glioblastoma. RNA expression of these factors will be analyzed by reverse
      transcription-Polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) on frozen tumor samples, whereas protein
      expression will be analyzed by ELISA and immunohistochemistry. Enzymatic activity of MMP2 and
      MMP9 will be analyzed by zymography. Tumor volume, infiltration and perfusion degrees will be
      analyzed on Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) performed before and after surgery and before
      adjuvant temozolomide. Neuro-imaging characteristics will be correlated to plasma and tissue
      expressions of these factors.

      The expected results are to better define the expression profile of MMP2, MMP9 and the change
      in their plasma level during treatment, a prerequisite for their clinical use.
