  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to measure synaptic density in the brains (including in ventral striatum [VS]
      and medial prefrontal cortex [mPFC]) of abstinent subjects with Cocaine Use Disorder (CUD) or
      Opiate Use Disorder (OUD) as compared to healthy control (HC) subjects using 11C-UCB-J PET.
      Subjects will undergo a single 11C-UCB-J (also known as 11C-APP311) PET scan.

      This would be the very first to image synaptic density in human cocaine and opiate users,
      thereby testing whether altered synaptic density in the rodent brain is recapitulated in CUD
      and OUD humans. If confirmed, the current study would provide compelling
      clinical-translational support for an important pathophysiological mechanism of addiction -
      aberrant structural synaptic plasticity. As such, the current study has considerable
      potential for advancing the neurobiological understanding of human cocaine and opiate
      addiction.
