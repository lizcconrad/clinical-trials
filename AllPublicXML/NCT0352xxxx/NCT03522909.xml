  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In January 2017 investigators started a Center for Peripartum Optimization (CPO) with the aim
      of optimizing a patient's clinical status in an outpatient setting to minimize unnecessary
      laboratory tests and studies, costly inpatient consultations, the likelihood of post-surgical
      adverse events, escalations in level of care, inpatient admissions and readmissions. This
      research project seeks to evaluate the impact of this innovative concept on patient outcomes
      during the last 12 months. Investigators will accomplish this by collecting retrospective
      data from patients' electronic medical records in the intervention group and comparing it to
      data gathered from a controlled group of patients with similar comorbidities but who were not
      evaluated at the CPO clinic.

        This will be a retrospective study design utilizing the Johns Hopkins Hospital (JHH)
        electronic medical record system (EMR) &quot;EPIC&quot;. We will be reviewing records of parturients
        seen at JHH in the Center for Peripartum Optimization (CPO) clinic between January 2017 to
        January 2018 and comparing outcome data with a matched controlled group patients not seen
        at the CPO clinic. This matched controlled parturient group will be identified utilizing
        the JHH EMR and ICD-10 comorbidity codes.

        These patients will be female of child-bearing age that fits into the inclusion criteria.
