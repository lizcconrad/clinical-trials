  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study investigates the effect of detailed, written dietary advice for improving blood
      lipids, in a primary care setting. n=222 participants will be randomized to Active
      Intervention or Control Group. After 3 weeks' intervention, participants will receive written
      feedback on the effect on their blood lipids. After 6 months, another blood sample is drawn
      and participants will receive further written feedback.

  <detailed_description>

      The Active Intervention Group will receive detailed dietary advice based on current evidence
      for food choices that improve LDL cholesterol levels. The information will contain
      motivational strategies, e.g. &quot;It's great that you want to improve your blood lipids! What
      are your three main reasons that you want to improve your blood lipids? What food choices
      suit you? How low can you go?&quot; Participants will receive a table of ten suggested healthy
      food choices and be instructed to mark for each day a certain food change has been made.

      The Control Group will receive similar advice and motivational strategies, with the one
      difference being the dietary advice, that will focus on Triglycerides instead of LDL
      cholesterol.
