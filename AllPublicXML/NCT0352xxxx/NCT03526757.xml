  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Importance: Aging is characterized by numerous molecular, physiological, functional, motor
      and psychological changes, such as loss of postural balance and reduced muscle mass/strength.
      Such modifications often lead to reduced physical-functional capacity in the elderly and
      increased risk of falls. Currently, physical exercise is widely used to improve physical
      performance and reduce, at least in part, postural instabilities and the risk of falls. In
      this context, the Pilates method may be a good strategy to improve body balance, muscle
      strength and, potentially, the perception of quality of life in this population, depending
      how the exercises are performed. This study seeks to assess whether practicing Pilates
      exercises in orthostatic position results in differential effects on walking mobility and
      postural balance in healthy elderly women when compared to the standard sequence in the
      Pilates method, which involves less time performing exercise in the orthostatic position. The
      study hypothesis is that a higher relative volume of Pilates exercises performed in the
      orthostatic position can promote greater benefits in terms of walking mobility and postural
      balance compared to the standard Pilates protocol in the elderly.

      Importance: Aging is characterized by numerous molecular, physiological, functional, motor
      and psychological changes, such as loss of postural balance and reduced muscle mass/strength.
      Such modifications often lead to reduced physical-functional capacity in the elderly and
      increased risk of falls. Currently, physical exercise is widely used to improve physical
      performance and reduce, at least in part, postural instabilities and the risk of falls. In
      this context, the Pilates method may be a good strategy to improve body balance, muscle
      strength and, potentially, the perception of quality of life in this population, depending
      how the exercises are performed.

      Objective: To evaluate whether practicing Pilates exercises in orthostatic position results
      in differential effects on walking mobility and postural balance in healthy elderly women
      when compared to the standard sequence in the Pilates method, which involves less time
      performing exercise in the orthostatic position.

      Design, Methods and Participants: Clinical, single blind controlled and randomized trial. 36
      previously sedentary elderly women will be included in the study and sign a Free and Informed
      Consent Term (TCLE). The Pilates protocols will be administered over 12 weeks on a bi-weekly
      scheme, and each session will last approximately 50 minutes. The subjects who agree to
      participate will be evaluated at baseline and immediately post-intervention.

      Intervention: Subjects will be randomized to participate in the experimental group (Pilates
      exercises with emphasis on orthostatic posture) or control group (Pilates exercises practiced
      following traditional sequence of postures).

      Main Outcomes and Measurements: The main outcome of the study will be walking mobility and
      postural balance, assessed using the Timed Up and Go test (single &quot;motor&quot; and dual task
      &quot;cognitive-motor&quot; tests), BERG Balance Scale, Functional Reach Test, and ABC Balance
      Confidence Scale).

      Expected results: The experimental group is expected to perform better in terms of walking
      mobility and body balance, since hypothetically, a higher relative volume of orthostatic
      exercises would be more adequate for training anticipatory postural adjustments when compared
      to the traditional Pilates postural sequence.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Walking mobility</measure>
    <time_frame>Post-intervention (change after 12 weeks of training)</time_frame>
    <description>Walking mobility will be assessed using the Timed Up and Go tests (single and dual task - cognitive/motor). It uses the time that a person takes to rise from a chair, walk three meters, turn around, walk back to the chair, and sit down. During the test, the person is expected to wear their regular footwear and use any mobility aids that they would normally require.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Postural balance - Functional Reach Test</measure>
    <time_frame>Post-intervention (change after 12 weeks of training)</time_frame>
    <description>Postural balance will be assessed using the Functional Reach Test. The FRT is a quick single-task dynamic test defined as the maximal distance one can reach forward beyond arm's length, while maintaining a fixed base of support in the standing position.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Postural balance - BERG Balance scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Post-intervention (change after 12 weeks of training)</time_frame>
    <description>The Berg balance scale is used to objectively determine a patient's ability (or inability) to safely balance during a series of predetermined tasks. It is a 14 item list with each item consisting of a five-point ordinal scale ranging from 0 to 4, with 0 indicating the lowest level of function and 4 the highest level of function.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Activities-specific Balance Confidence (ABC) Scale.</measure>
    <time_frame>Post-intervention (change after 12 weeks of training)</time_frame>
    <description>For each assessed activity, the subjects indicate their level of confidence in doing the activity without losing your balance or becoming unsteady from choosing one of the percentage points on the scale from 0% to 100%. If subjects do not currently do the activity in question, they should imagine how confident they would be if had to do the activity. If they normally use a walking aid to do the activity or hold onto someone, subjects should rate their confidence as if they were using these supports.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Quality of life</measure>
    <time_frame>Post-intervention (change after 12 weeks of training)</time_frame>
    <description>Quality of life will be assessed using the 36-Item Short Form Health Survey (SF-36). The SF-36 consists of eight scaled scores (vitality; physical functioning; bodily pain; general health perceptions; physical role functioning; emotional role functioning; social role functioning; and mental health.), which are the weighted sums of the questions in their section. Each scale is directly transformed into a 0-100 scale on the assumption that each question carries equal weight. The lower the score the more disability. The higher the score the less disability i.e., a score of zero is equivalent to maximum disability and a score of 100 is equivalent to no disability.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Physical Activity Levels</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Physical Activity Levels will be assessed using the International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ). The International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ) estimates the weekly energy expenditure for physical activities (PA). This instrument was validated for use with Brazilian older adults. The report of the IPAQ adapted for older adults should be delivered in minutes per week.</description>
  </other_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Cognition screening</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Cognitive decline will be screened using the Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE). The Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) or Folstein test is a 30-point questionnaire that is used extensively in clinical and research settings to measure cognitive impairment. Any score greater than or equal to 24 points (out of 30) indicates a normal cognition. Below this, scores can indicate severe (≤9 points), moderate (10-18 points) or mild (19-23 points) cognitive impairment. The raw score may also need to be corrected for educational attainment and age. That is, a maximal score of 30 points can never rule out dementia. Low to very low scores correlate closely with the presence of dementia, although other mental disorders can also lead to abnormal findings on MMSE testing.</description>
  </other_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Depression screening</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Depression will be screened using the Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS). The scale consists of 30 yes/no questions. Each question is scored as either 0 or 1 points. The following general cutoff may be used to qualify the severity: 0-9 as &quot;normal&quot;, 10-19 as &quot;mildly depressed&quot;, and 20-30 as &quot;severely depressed&quot;.</description>
