  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is to demonstrate the safety and tolerability of a single oral dose of BAY60-4552
      in a single dose escalation design. Furthermore, this study examines the changes in
      hemodynamics after application of the test substance.42 hospitalized stable patients with
      chronic heart failure will be included. Several measurements will be performed to test how
      good the drug works and wether there are any unwanted reactions to the drug (e.g. blood
      tests, ECG, heart rate, blood pressure, adverse events). After a observation period the
      patient will be discharged from the hospital.
