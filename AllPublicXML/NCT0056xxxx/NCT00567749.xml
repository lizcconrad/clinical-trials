      This study is to establish the clinical sensitivity of the Chembio Diagnostics Systems, Inc.
      Clearview COMPLETE HIV 1/2 Assay and Clearview HIV 1/2 Stat-Pak Assay (Clearview HIV tests)
      in pediatric subjects who are between 12 and 17 years of age. A minimum of ten (10) known
      HIV-positive participants will be tested.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In order to achieve the primary objective, clinical trials will be conducted to establish and
      confirm the sensitivity of the Clearview HIV 1/2 tests in the described pediatric population.
      Only HIV-1 will be included in the study.

      The Clearview HIV tests can be used as a safe and effective screening method to aid in the
      diagnosis of infection with HIV 1/2 in the pediatric population aged between 12 and 17 years.

      The secondary objectives of this study include demonstrating that:

      - The Clearview HIV tests detect HIV-1 antibodies in a variety of sample matrices: capillary
      (fingertip) whole blood, venous whole blood, plasma and serum.

        The patient population intended for this study (study participants) consists of a minimum
        of 10 individuals, known to have previously tested positive for HIV antibodies, who are
        between 12 and 17 years of age. The patients should not be on HAART, however, the sponsor
        reserves the option to include a limited number of HAART patients for investigational
        purposes. The number of HAART patients enrolled will depend on the available pediatric HIV
        positive participant pool. HAART patients will be clearly identified and will be additional
        to the enrollment needed to meet the study objectives.
