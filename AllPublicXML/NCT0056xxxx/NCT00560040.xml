      Investigations have shown increases in cardiac markers consistent with myocardial injury and
      left ventricular dysfunction in both recreational and elite athletes after endurance
      exercise. Pre-race training is an important component of endurance events, yet its effect on
      cardiovascular injury is unclear. The present study aimed to evaluate the correlation between
      myocardial injury and training level in recreational marathon runners utilizing both
      objective and subjective measures.
