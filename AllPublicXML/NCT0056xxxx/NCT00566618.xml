      The goal of this clinical research study is to find the highest tolerable dose of dasatinib
      and Zometa (zoledronic acid) that can be given in combination for the treatment of breast
      cancer that has spread to the bone. The safety and effectiveness of this combination will
      also be studied.

      The Study Drugs:

      Zoledronic acid is designed to strengthen the bone and prevent fractures or breaks in the
      bone. Dasatinib is designed to block (stop) cells responsible for the breakdown of bone.

      Study Groups:

      If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, you will be enrolled in a group
      of at least 3 participants to begin receiving zoledronic acid and dasatinib. The dose of
      dasatinib you receive will depend on when you enrolled in this study. All participants will
      receive the same amount of zoledronic acid. The first group of participants will be treated
      with the lowest dose of dasatinib given in combination with zoledronic acid.

      Once the highest tolerable dose level is found, up to 25 additional participants will be
      enrolled at that dose level. This is called the Phase II portion of the study.

      Drug Administration:

      You will receive zoledronic acid through a needle in your vein on Day 1 over 15 minutes. You
      will take dasatinib by mouth daily for 28 days. Dasatinib should be taken on an empty stomach
      or after a light meal. Every 28 days is called a study &quot;cycle.&quot;

      Study Visits for Participants in the Phase I Portion:

      On Day 1 of Cycle 1, you will have the following tests and procedures performed.

        -  You will have a physical exam, including measurement of your vital signs.

        -  You will have a performance status evaluation.

        -  Blood (about 1-2 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests.

        -  You will have an ECG.

      On Day 8 of Cycle 1, you will have the following tests and procedures performed.

        -  Blood (about 1-2 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests.

        -  You will have an ECG.

      On Day 15 of Cycle 1, you will have the following tests and procedures performed.

        -  You will have a physical exam.

        -  You will have a performance status evaluation.

        -  Blood (about 1-2 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests.

        -  You will have an ECG.

      On Day 21 of Cycle 1, you will have the following tests and procedures performed.

        -  Your vital signs will be measured.

        -  Blood (about 1-2 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests.

        -  You will have an ECG.

      On Day 1 of Cycle 2, you will have an ECG.

      On Day 1 of all other cycles, you will have the following tests and procedures performed.

        -  You will have a physical exam.

        -  You will have a performance status evaluation.

        -  Blood (about 1-2 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests.

        -  You will have MRIs, CT scans, and/or x-rays to check the status of the disease.

      On Days 1 and 28 of Cycle 1 and then every 3rd month, urine will be collected over 24 hours
      to check for markers of bone loss.

      After Cycles 3, 6, 9 and so on, you will have CT scans, MRIs, and/or x-rays to check the
      status of the disease

      At all study visits, you will be asked about any drugs you may be taking and any side effects
      you may be experiencing.

      you may be experiencing.

      Length of Study:

      You may remain on study for as long as you are benefitting. You will be taken off study if
      the disease gets worse or you experience intolerable side effects.

      End-of-Study Visit:

      Once you go off-study, you will have an end-of-study visit.

        -  Your vital signs will be measured.

        -  Blood (about 1-2 teaspoons) and urine will be collected for routine tests.

        -  You will have MRIs, CT scans, and/or x-rays to check the status of the disease.

      This is an investigational study. Zoledronic acid is FDA approved and commercially available
      for the treatment of breast cancer. Dasatinib is not FDA approved or commercially available
      for the treatment of breast cancer. It has been authorized for use in research only. Up to 28
      patients will take part in this multicenter study. Up to 12 will be enrolled at MD Anderson.

             breast.

          2. Patients must carry a diagnosis of metastatic breast cancer with predominant bone
             involvement. For the purposes of this study, predominant bone involvement will be
             defined as radiographically detected bone metastasis in the presence or absence of
             other sites of metastatic breast cancer (i.e. visceral involvement). If visceral
             involvement is present, patients must be asymptomatic and have no tumors in visceral
             organs that measure &gt;3cm in size.

          3. Patients must agree to serial urine collections for measurement of Ntx.

             study disease progression while receiving hormonal therapy will be defined as:
             Radiographic evidence of progressive disease according to RECIST criteria, Progression
             of disease by physical exam in patients with skin involvement. Continued in # 9

          9. Continuation from # 8: 25% increase in tumor marker as measured on two evaluations no
             less than 72 hours apart.

         10. Patients must have and ECOG performance status of &lt;/= 2.

             give written informed consent.

         15. Patients may have received previous radiation but must have completed radiation at
             least 2 weeks (8 weeks for radiation to the brain) prior to registration. Patients
             with irradiated tumor as the only site of evaluable disease will not be eligible for
             protocol therapy unless there is documented disease progression within the previously
             radiated site.

         16. Patients must have recovered to grade &lt;/= 1 from all acute toxicity of previous
             radiation or hormonal therapy.

         18. Patients must not receive any concurrent bisphosphonate therapy other than that
             prescribed by the study.

         19. Sexually active patients with reproductive potential must agree to use an effective
             method of birth control during the course of the study and for no less than 4 weeks
             after discontinuing study drug. Contraceptives must be used in a manner such that risk
             of failure is minimized. Oral contraceptives should be avoided in women with estrogen
             or progesterone receptor positive breast cancer.

         20. Prior to study enrollment, women of childbearing potential (WOCBP) must be advised of
             the importance of avoiding pregnancy during trial participation and the potential risk
             factors for an unintentional pregnancy. In addition, men enrolled on this study should
             understand the risks to any sexual partner of childbearing potential and should
