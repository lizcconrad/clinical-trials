      To evaluate the effects of a single sc administration of TEZAMPANEL at one of three different
      dosage levels compared to placebo, employing traditional measures of efficacy and safety in
      the treatment of a single episode of acute migraine.

      Primary:

      • Headache relief (headache response) defined as the percentage of patients in each treatment
      group who experience a decrease in pain from moderate or severe intensity pre-dose (baseline)
      to mild or no pain 2 hours after study drug administration and prior to use of rescue
      medication.

      Secondary:

        -  Percentage of patients in each treatment group who are pain-free two hours after study
           drug administration, prior to the use of any rescue medication

        -  Sustained headache response rate (percentage of patients in each treatment group with
           headache response at Hour 2 and no rescue medication or headache recurrence from 2
           through 24 hours)

        -  Sustained pain-free rate (percentage of patients in each treatment group who are pain
           free at Hour 2 with no rescue medication or headache recurrence from 2 through 48 hours)

        -  Recurrence rate (percentage of patients in each treatment group with an Hour 2 mild
           response or pain-free response who subsequently develop a headache rated as moderate to
           severe in intensity within 2 to 24 hours)

        -  Relapse rate (percentage of patients in each treatment group with an Hour 2 pain free
           response who subsequently develop a headache rated as moderate to severe in intensity
           within 2 to 48 hours

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients who meet all of the following inclusion criteria at screening should be
             considered for admission to the study:

               1. Males and females aged 18 to 65 years, inclusive.

                  a. Females of childbearing potential must not be at risk for pregnancy during the
                  study.

               2. Patients must meet IHS diagnostic criteria for migraine, with or without aura.

               3. Patients should have a history of 1 to 6 acute migraine headache attacks per
                  month and 1 migraine headache within the past 30 days.

               4. Patients should have at least a 1-year history of migraine headaches.

               5. Patients should have been ≤ 50 years of age at initial migraine onset.

               6. Patients must be able to distinguish migraine headaches as discreet headaches
                  from other headaches, such as tension-type headaches. Additionally, patients
                  should experience at least 48 hours of freedom from headaches between migraine
                  attacks.

               7. Patients must have a complete medical history (including headache history), ECG,
                  and a PE at screening including formal assessments of visual acuity (Snellen
                  chart) and visual field integrity visit.

               8. Patients who have met the DSM-IV-TR criteria for any significant psychoactive
                  substance use disorder (abuse, dependence, and/or withdrawal) within the past 90
                  days.

               9. Patients who have a clinically significant abnormal laboratory test result at
                  screening.

              10. Patients who have a clinically notable vital sign abnormality at screening.

              11. Patients will be excluded if 2 consecutive urine drug screenings are positive.
