  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study was to evaluate the safety and efficacy profile of Humira
      (adalimumab) in patients who had a sub-optimal response to prior systemic therapy. This
      open-label study was conducted in a patient population of moderate to severe chronic plaque
      psoriasis patients, which is an approved patient population for adalimumab.

    <textblock>
      This 16-week multicenter, open-label study was designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety
      of a loading dose of 80 mg adalimumab, followed by 40 mg adalimumab every other week in the
      treatment of psoriasis in patients with a sub-optimal response to etanercept, methotrexate
      (MTX), or Narrow band Ultraviolet âˆ’ B (NB-UVB).

      Approximately 150 participants were planned for 3 sub-studies: 80 participants with
      sub-optimal response to etanercept, 40 participants with sub-optimal response to MTX, and 30
      participants with sub-optimal response to NB-UVB. Actual enrollment was 82 participants with
      sub-optimal response to etanercept, 41 participants with sub-optimal response to MTX, and 29
      participants with sub-optimal response to NB-UVB.

      Screening was performed at least 96 hours and no more than 31 days before the Baseline visit
      (Week 0). A participant who was eligible for the study based on sub-optimal response to one
      treatment (MTX, NB-UVB, or etanercept) was required to discontinue that treatment within a
      specified time before first dose of adalimumab (see descriptions of sub-study groups). In
      addition, if the participant was also receiving another qualifying treatment, he/she was
      required to have discontinued the other treatment at least 30 days before the Baseline visit
      (Week 0).

      Adalimumab was administered by subcutaneous (SC) injection. At the Baseline Visit (Week 0),
      all participants received an initial dose of 80 mg adalimumab SC. Every other week
      (odd-numbered weeks) from Week 1 to Week 15, participants received 40 mg adalimumab SC.

      This was a single group assignment study, that is, all participants received the same
      treatment; however, data were summarized for 3 groups (sub-studies) that were defined by
      psoriasis treatments participants received before entering this study: methotrexate,
      etanercept, or narrow-band, ultraviolet-B.

      Efficacy was evaluated using the Physician's Global Assessment (PGA) of disease severity, and
      patient-reported outcomes: Patient's Global Assessment (PTGA) of disease severity, the
      Psoriasis-related Pruritus Assessment, the Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI), a visual
      analog scale (VAS) for plaque psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis pain, the Medical Outcomes
      Study (MOS) Sleep Scale, and the Work Productivity and Activity Impairment Questionnaire:
      Specific Health Problem (WPAI: SHP).

      Serious and nonserious adverse events were summarized by sub-study of participants
      (suboptimal response to MTX, suboptimal response to NB-UVB, and suboptimal response to
      etanercept).

    <time_frame>Week 16</time_frame>
    <description>The PGA is a 6-point scale used to measure the severity of a patient's disease. Plaque elevation, scaling, and erythema are rated from 0= clear (no plaque elevation; no scaling; erythema=hyperpigmentation, pigmented macules, diffuse faint pink or red coloration) to 5=very severe (plaque elevation=very marked; scaling=very coarse; erythema=very severe [extreme red coloration, dusky to deep red coloration]).</description>

    <time_frame>Weeks 2, 4, and 8</time_frame>
    <description>The Patient's Global Assessment of Psoriasis-Severity is a rating of how well their disease is controlled. 0=complete disease control; 1=good disease control; 2=limited disease control; 3=uncontrolled disease.</description>

Participants rate how much their skin problem affected their life in previous week. Responses are 0 (not at all) to 3=very much. DLQI=total of scores for all items; max=30; min=0.</description>

    <measure>Percent Work Time Missed Due to Psoriasis</measure>
    <time_frame>From Screening to Week 16</time_frame>
    <description>Work and activity impairment due to psoriasis were evaluated using the Work Productivity and Activity Impairment Questionnaire: Specific Health Problem (WPAI-SHP), a 6-item questionnaire that measures effect of psoriasis on number of hours worked and the number of hours missed from work. It also measures the effect on productivity and regular activities: 0=no effect on work/daily activities; 10=psoriasis prevented me from working/doing daily activities. Decreases in values on each part indicate improvement. At Screening, percent time missed in the previous week ranged from 0% to 40%.</description>

      <recruitment_details>Patients who were previously treated with etanercept, methotrexate (MTX), or narrow-band ultraviolet-B (NB-UVB) and had a sub-optimal response were recruited for participation in the study.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>Participants who were receiving more than 1 of the treatments (etanercept, MTX, NB-UVB) at the time of screening must have discontinued 1 therapy (e.g., MTX) at least 30 days before first dose of adalimumab and must have discontinued the other therapy (e.g., NB-UVB) during a specified time before first dose of adalimumab.

          <description>MTX treatment must have been administered for at least 4 consecutive months prior to Screening, with no treatment interruptions except for toxicity or intolerability. If there had been a treatment interruption due to toxicity or intolerability, the length of treatment interruption could not have exceeded 14 days.

The last dose of methotrexate must have been at least 4 days but not more than 10 days before the first dose of adalimumab.
