    <textblock>
      To evaluate changes in coagulation (blood clotting) factors and platelet function in multiple
      myeloma participants undergoing VELCADE treatment for the first time.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cardiovascular complications during the treatment of patients with multiple myeloma are not
      uncommon, (10%) and the frequency clearly increases with the use of regimens containing
      thalidomide in combination with glucocorticosteroids or chemotherapy especially adriamycin.
      Even with prophylactic anticoagulation, DVT still occurs in 10% of such patients. The use of
      full anticoagulation raises considerable concern of bleeding especially during the post
      chemotherapy thrombocytopenic period. We observed no thromboembolic episodes when Velcade was
      added to thalidomide and adriamycin containing chemotherapy.

      Therefore, we would like to investigate this protective antithrombotic effect of VELCADE in a
      malignancy associated with a hypercoagulable state in a group of 10 patients with
      Relapsed/Refractory Multiple Myeloma.

    <time_frame>60 days</time_frame>
    <description>Goal is to evaluate changes in coagulation (blood clotting) in refractory/relapsing multiple myeloma patients during VELCADE treatment.
Before and during treatment, participant will undergo routine tests/procedures following the Myeloma Institute's guidelines (physical exams, blood, urine, and bone tests, and bone marrow aspirates and biopsies) and will also receive a series of coagulation tests before treatment and after 1st and 3rd doses of each cycle.
Response measured as: complete, partial, or minimal response, no change, progressive disease, or relapse from complete response.</description>

    <description>Treatment on this study will last 2 cycles. Each cycle consists of 3 weeks, or 21 days. After you have gone off study, you will be followed every three months for approximately 2 years.
Each cycle will consist of 3 weeks (21 days) according to the schedule below.
DRUG ROUTE DOSE DAYS Velcade IV 1.3 mg/m2 1,4,8, and 11 This 21-day period will be considered one treatment cycle; Cycle 2 would commence on Day 22 (Cycle 2, Day 1). Patients may continue to receive treatment every 21 days, provided there is no evidence of disease progression or no unacceptable toxicity for a two cycles.</description>

    <description>Except for the two PCR-based genotyping assays, which will be conducted only on baseline samples, tests will be assessed at baseline, 1-3 hours after the first dose of Velcade day 1 and on day 11 of the first cycle of Velcade.
The platelet Aggregation Test will be done only if Platelet count is 100 000.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with myeloma who had relapsed after one prior treatment and who have
             demonstrated resistance to their last treatment, who are candidate to receive Velcade

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Previous history of venous thromboembolism, myocardial infarction, stroke, TIA

          -  Hypercoagulable state (deficit ATIII, Factor V Leiden, deficit protein S, deficit
             protein C, prothrombin gene mutation), antiphospholipid syndrome.

          -  Von Willebrand disease, inherited platelet abnormalities.

          -  Familiar history of hypercoagulable state.

          -  Anticoagulant therapy, aspirin, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, beta blockers,
             tricyclic antidepressant, hormone replacement therapy, BCPs, and all other agents able
             to interfere with platelet function in the previous two weeks.

          -  Non-secretory MM, unless the patient has measurable lesions on CT, MRI and/or PET.
