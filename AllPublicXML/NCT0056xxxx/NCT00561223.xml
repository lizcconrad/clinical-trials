      The investigators believe that iloprost will improve gas exchange in COPD patients with
      pulmonary hypertension.

      Pulmonary hypertension and right heart failure can complicate the management of the patient
      with advanced COPD. Attempts to treat this pulmonary hypertension with systemic vasodilators
      frequently result in a worsening of ventilation perfusion matching and an increase sense of
      dyspnea. This study will look at the effect of an FDA approved pulmonary vasodilator,
      iloprost, on gas exchange and pulmonary mechanics in patients with COPD. Ten clinically
      stable patients will be enrolled. They will report to the lab on the morning of the study and
      after an arterial line is placed, pulmonary function measurements and arterial blood gases
      will be obtained. Iloprost (2.5 mcg via nebulizer) will be administered and the effect upon
      arterial blood pressure, respiration and arterial saturation will be monitored. Pulmonary
      function tests (PFTs) and blood gases will be repeated after 30 minutes. Patients who remain
      clinically stable without evidence of a fall in arterial PO2 or systemic blood pressure would
      inhale a second dose of 2.5 mcg of iloprost. The patient will be monitored for a minimum of 2
      hours after their last dose of iloprost. Primary outcome variable will be the alveolar
      arterial O2 difference while secondary outcomes will include PAO2, venous admixture, FVC and
      FEV1, DLCO and ventilatory equivalents for O2 and CO2. All comparisons will be made using
      Student's t-test with a Bonferroni correction. The number of study patients was chosen on the
      basis of a power analysis to provide an alpha of 0.05 at a level of 0.9.

    <description>This study will examine the hypothesis that iloprost maintains and improves ventilation perfusion matching in patients with COPD as reflected by 1) a constant or reduced alveolar to arterial O2 difference as calculated from the measured arterial blood gases obtained before and after iloprost administration, 2) an improvement in the lung diffusing capacity for carbon monoxide that occurs in the absence of a change in spirometry, 3) an improvement in the ventilatory equivalent for oxygen and CO2 measured by expired gas analysis.
It is anticipated that a positive result in this pilot study would lead to a larger long-term study examining the effect of iloprost on gas exchange, exercise tolerance and quality of life in patients with COPD.</description>
