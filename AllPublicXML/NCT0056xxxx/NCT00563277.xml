  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pterygium is known to induce with-the-rule astigmatism. The corneal curvature along the long
      axis of the pterygium body is flattened. The excision of pterygium will result in steepening
      of the cornea and reduction of astigmatism. Therefore, the effect of pterygium excision on
      intraocular lens (IOL) power calculation has been examined in our previous study. The study
      confirmed that pterygium can cause alteration of IOL power.

      The determination of IOL power for cataract surgery is usually calculated from IOL formula
      called SRK II formula. IOL power = A - (2.5 x AL)-(0.9 x K). Variable A denotes the
      A-constant of the intraocular lens which is dependent on the IOL material and refractive
      index. Other variables for input include axial length (AL) and keratometry (K). A larger K
      reading will result in a lower estimated IOL power and vice versa. Previous studies have
      documented simultaneous cataract and pterygium operation resulted in reasonable visual
      outcome without adjustment of IOL power.

      With the presence of a pterygium, the cornea is flattened and lead to a reduction of K value
      and over-estimation of calculated IOL power. This randomized controlled trial is designed to
      compare the refractive outcomes of sequential and simultaneous pterygium and cataract
      operation.

      Pterygium excision should be done with various adjuvant therapies to minimize recurrence. Our
      previous studies reliably demonstrated limbal conjunctival graft and mitomycin C were
      effective methods to achieve low pterygium recurrence. We use limbal conjunctival autograft
      as the adjuvant therapy in the current study because this method is safer to be performed
      either alone or in combination with phacoemulsification. We avoid using mitomycin C as the
      adjuvant therapy in order to minimize the possibility of intraocular toxicity due to seepage.
