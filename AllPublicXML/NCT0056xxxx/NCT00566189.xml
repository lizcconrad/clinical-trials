      Bariatric surgery leads to remission of type 2 diabetes in morbid obese patients in 80%
      (Roux-en-Y gastric bypass)to 90% (biliopancreatic diversion and duodenal switch) of cases.
      The current consensus supports bariatric surgical treatment for diabetic patients with BMI as
      low as 35kg/m2 but it has questioned that lower body mass patients might benefit of the
      surgery as well.

      This study is proposed to describe the effects of Roux-en-Y gastric bypass in mild obese (BMI
      30-35) human volunteers on incretins, insulin production and sensitivity and its clinical
      (diabetic chronic complications) and metabolic impact.

      Bariatric surgery leads to remission of type 2 diabetes in morbid obese patients in 80%
      (Roux-en-Y gastric bypass)to 90% (biliopancreatic diversion and duodenal switch) of cases;
      most of the remainder achieve better glycemic control, even if they regain weight. The
      current consensus supports bariatric surgical treatment for diabetic patients with BMI as low
      as 35kg/m2 but it has questioned that lower body mass patients might benefit of the surgery
      as well.

      Actually, many clinical researchers worldwide would consider a lower limit BMI of 30kg/m2,
      i.e., any grade of obesity.

      This study is proposed to describe the effects of Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (Fobi-Capella
      technique, adapted to create a larger gastric pouch, about 80ml)in mild obese (BMI 30-35)
      human volunteers on incretins, insulin production and sensitivity and its clinical (diabetic
      chronic complications) and metabolic impact.

    <description>Under open laparotomy, a stomach section separates a 80-ml proximal gastric pouch. A jejunum section below Treitz's Angle creates an excluded gastrobiliopancreatic limb of 150cm. A Roux-in-Y retrocolic anastomosis of the alimentary limb promotes the continuity between the gastric pouch and the jejunum and a silastic ring reduces the pouch outlet.The anastomosis of the excluded limb is done 100cm below the silastic ring.</description>
