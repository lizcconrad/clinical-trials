      The purpose of this study is to determine whether the combination of naltrexone SR and
      bupropion SR is safe and effective in the treatment of obesity.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Two Phase II clinical trials demonstrated that a combination of bupropion SR and naltrexone
      is associated with greater weight loss than naltrexone alone, bupropion SR alone or placebo
      in subjects with uncomplicated obesity. The current study investigated the safety and
      efficacy of the combination of naltrexone SR and bupropion SR compared to placebo in obese
      subjects with uncomplicated obesity and in those with overweight/obesity and hypertension
      and/or dyslipidemia.

    <description>Beginning at Week 28 through Week 44, NB32-treated subjects who failed to achieve or maintain at least 5% body weight loss from baseline were re-randomized (1:1 ratio) to continue NB32 or begin treatment with a higher dose of naltrexone SR - naltrexone SR 48 mg/bupropion SR 360 mg (referred to as NB48) (daily dose of bupropion SR was 360 mg for NB32 and NB48).The analysis of NB32 vs. placebo at Week 56 was completed using a weighted analysis. This analysis was referred to as the weighted LOCF analysis.
Subjects treated with NB32 who were re-randomized to NB48 were not included. Subjects re-randomized to NB32 were double-weighted and subjects who were not re-randomized were single-weighted. Subjects in the placebo group were single-weighted. The double weighting analysis restored the influence of poor performers at Weeks 28 to 44 in the NB32 group without including any data from the higher dose group (NB48).</description>

    <description>The Food Craving Inventory is a 33-item self-report measure designed to assess specific food cravings and is organized into 4 subscales (high fats, sweets, carbohydrates/starches, and fast-food fats). A craving was defined as an intense desire to consume a particular food (or food type) that was difficult to resist over the past month. Subjects rated their frequency of cravings for each of the 33 items using a 5-point scale, where 1=never, 2=rarely, 3=sometimes, 4=often, and 5=always. The sweets subscale consisted of 8 items and the score ranges from 8 (better outcome) to 40 (worse outcome).</description>

        <description>Beginning at Week 28 through Week 44, NB32-treated subjects who failed to achieve or maintain at least 5% body weight loss from baseline were re-randomized (1:1 ratio) to continue NB32 or begin treatment with a higher dose of naltrexone SR - naltrexone SR 48 mg/bupropion SR 360 mg (referred to as NB48) (daily dose of bupropion SR was 360 mg for NB32 and NB48).The analysis of NB32 vs. placebo at Week 56 was completed using a weighted analysis. This analysis was referred to as the weighted LOCF analysis.
Subjects treated with NB32 who were re-randomized to NB48 were not included. Subjects re-randomized to NB32 were double-weighted and subjects who were not re-randomized were single-weighted. Subjects in the placebo group were single-weighted. The double weighting analysis restored the influence of poor performers at Weeks 28 to 44 in the NB32 group without including any data from the higher dose group (NB48).</description>

          <description>Beginning at Week 28 through Week 44, NB32-treated subjects who failed to achieve or maintain at least 5% body weight loss from baseline were re-randomized (1:1 ratio) to continue NB32 or begin treatment with a higher dose of naltrexone SR - naltrexone SR 48 mg/bupropion SR 360 mg (referred to as NB48) (daily dose of bupropion SR was 360 mg for NB32 and NB48).The analysis of NB32 vs. placebo at Week 56 was completed using a weighted analysis. This analysis was referred to as the weighted LOCF analysis.
Subjects treated with NB32 who were re-randomized to NB48 were not included. Subjects re-randomized to NB32 were double-weighted and subjects who were not re-randomized were single-weighted. Subjects in the placebo group were single-weighted. The double weighting analysis restored the influence of poor performers at Weeks 28 to 44 in the NB32 group without including any data from the higher dose group (NB48).</description>

        <description>The Food Craving Inventory is a 33-item self-report measure designed to assess specific food cravings and is organized into 4 subscales (high fats, sweets, carbohydrates/starches, and fast-food fats). A craving was defined as an intense desire to consume a particular food (or food type) that was difficult to resist over the past month. Subjects rated their frequency of cravings for each of the 33 items using a 5-point scale, where 1=never, 2=rarely, 3=sometimes, 4=often, and 5=always. The sweets subscale consisted of 8 items and the score ranges from 8 (better outcome) to 40 (worse outcome).</description>

      <desc>The safety analysis set includes all randomized subjects who took study drug and were assessed by investigator after their first dose, whether or not they discontinue the study. Treatment-emergent adverse events were defined as events that started or worsened in the double-blind treatment phase after the first dose and before 7 days post last dose.</desc>

Beginning at Week 28 through Week 44, NB32-treated subjects who failed to achieve or maintain at least 5% body weight loss from baseline were re-randomized (1:1 ratio) to continue NB32 or begin treatment with a higher dose of naltrexone SR - naltrexone SR 48 mg/bupropion SR 360 mg (referred to as NB48) (daily dose of bupropion SR was 360 mg for NB32 and NB48).
NB32/48 group includes all participants in the safety analysis set randomized to NB32 at baseline, regardless of re-randomization status.</description>
