  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Acute rejection is a common problem after a kidney transplant. Rejection can occur when the
      kidney recipient's immune system tries to attack (or reject) the new kidney. Rejection
      typically most often develops in the first few months after a transplant.

      This single center study will seek to determine if a new combination of anti-rejection
      medications, including the recently FDA approved drug called Belatacept, is better than the
      current standard anti-rejection drug regimen at preventing rejection. Also to be determined
      will be whether the new combination of drugs will allow participants to wean off their oral
      anti-rejection medications over time.

      This study will test the safety and effectiveness of a new investigational drug combination
      using alemtuzumab, belatacept, and sirolimus when given with or without donor bone marrow.

      This combination of medicines has not been tested before in humans. Alemtuzumab (Campath) is
      approved for use in some types of white blood cell cancers, but is considered investigational
      in transplant patients. Belatacept is now FDA approved and is being studied in transplant
      patients. Sirolimus (Rapamune) is approved for use in transplant patients, but its use with
      belatacept and alemtuzumab is investigational.

      In the initial 20 subjects enrolled in the study, half tested whether an infusion of bone
      marrow from the kidney donor would improve the effect of these drugs. This bone marrow
      infusion was also considered investigational.

      Enrollment of 20 additional subjects was begun in January, 2013. The donor bone marrow
      infusion has been eliminated. Enrollment was open to primary living and deceased donor kidney
      recipients. Enrollment is closed as of 8/12/2014.

      This study will be a single-center, open-label,proof of concept study in non-HLA-identical
      living and deceased donor renal transplants. The initial 20 subjects were randomized to
      either receive/not to receive a single donor bone marrow infusion in addition to the
      investigational combination of alemtuzumab, belatacept, and sirolimus. Since the bone marrow
      infusion has been eliminated in the second group of 20 subjects, no randomization will be
      required. All recipients in the second group of 20 subjects will receive the same
      investigational combination of alemtuzumab, belatacept, and sirolimus.

      At the time of transplant, participants will receive a 3-hour IV infusion of 30 mg. of
      alemtuzumab. Participants will receive a combination of sirolimus and belatacept for at least
      1 year. At that time, eligible participants will consent to and begin oral immunosuppressive
      withdrawal or continue therapy through study close. Sirolimus will first be weaned by halving
      the dose and/or increasing the dosing interval over at least a 2-6 month period. After
      sirolimus is discontinued, participants will remain on monthly IV belatacept monotherapy
      indefinitely.

      Follow-up will continue for at least five years. If subjects are successfully weaned from
      oral immunosuppression during their participation in this trial, no other alternative therapy
      will be warranted. Since belatacept is now FDA approved, subjects will be eligible to
      continue this therapy after their study participation has ended.
