  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This open label single blind study will determine the safety of albuterol sulfate dry powder
      in a novel inhaler by observing for the potential occurrence of reflex bronchial constriction
      after inhalation of increasing doses of the compound.

      This is a single blind (investigator unblinded), open label, single exposure, non-randomized,
      single center, outpatient, stepwise, rising dose study in male subjects with mild
      intermittent asthma to assess topical safety and tolerability of Albuterol Sulfate Acu-30™
      DPI, compared with Placebo Acu-30™ DPI. Increasing doses of each drug will be administered in
      a sequential fashion in 4 steps to 3 different subjects at each step (a total of 12 subjects)
      with mild intermittent asthma in each step.
