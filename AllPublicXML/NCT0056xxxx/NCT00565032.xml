      Women with abnormal serum thyroid antibody levels or abnormal TSH and/or T4 values are more
      likely than their normal counterparts to have higher scores on a common postpartum depression
      screening test.

      This small pilot study was an attempt to corroborate a relationship between quantified mood
      and thyroid measures, using the numerical scores obtained from a common depression screen,
      the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS), as a continuum. Mood scores were compared
      with presence of thyroid autoantibodies and plasma concentrations of free T4 and TSH.
