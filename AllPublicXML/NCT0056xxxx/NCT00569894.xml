      -  To assess the safety of FluMist vaccination Rates of medically attended events in
           FluMist recipients, including serious adverse events (SAEs), anaphylaxis , urticaria,
           asthma, wheezing, pre-specified grouped diagnoses, and rare events potentially related
           to wild-type influenza, will be compared to rates in multiple non-randomized control
           groups.

        -  To assess the safety of annual FluMist re-vaccination [Rates of MAEs in the subset of
           children who receive FluMist in â‰¥2 consecutive years will be compared to rates in
           first-time vaccinees during the same season.]

        -  To assess the safety of FluMist vaccination in children previously vaccinated with
           trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine (TIV) [Rates of MAEs in the subset of children
           who received one or more prior TIV vaccinations will be compared to rates in children
           who did not receive prior TIV.]
