  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The most direct treatment of vasomotor symptions (hot flushes) may be by means of 5-HT2A
      receptor antagonist. Mirtazapine is a potent blocker of 5-HT2A receptors and was found to be
      effective in reducing the number and intensity of hot flushes in preliminary trials. Also
      several Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors (SSRIs) and other similar compounds have been
      investigated to manage hot flushes, confirming the role of the serotonergic system. In the
      present trial, the efficacy and safety of four different doses of esmirtazapine compared to
      placebo was investigated in women with moderate to severe vasomotor symptoms associated with
      the menopause. The primary study hypothesis was that esmirtazapine would show superior
      efficacy to placebo.

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Average Daily Frequency of Vasomotor Symptoms (Frequency Score A) at Week 4</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 4</time_frame>
    <description>Participants recorded the frequency of vasomotor symptoms (hot flushes) on an electronic diary card (LogPadÂ®) on a daily basis during screening and treatment. Frequency score A was based on the number of moderate hot flushes + the number of severe hot flushes in one day. Baseline average was derived from, at most, 7 completely observed pre-treatment days. Weekly averages during treatment were calculated if at least 4 days with non-missing data were completely observed; if less than 4 days were completely observed, the averages of the previous week were carried forward (last observation carried forward, or LOCF). If the number of days observed in Week 1 were not sufficient, baseline values were carried forward.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Average Daily Frequency of Vasomotor Symptoms (Frequency Score A) at Week 12</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>Participants recorded the frequency of vasomotor symptoms (hot flushes) on a LogPad on a daily basis during screening and treatment. Frequency score A was based on the number of moderate hot flushes + the number of severe hot flushes in one day. Baseline average was derived from, at most, 7 completely observed pre-treatment days. Weekly averages during treatment were calculated if at least 4 days with non-missing data were completely observed; if less than 4 days were completely observed, the averages of the previous week were carried forward (last observation carried forward, or LOCF).

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in Average Daily Severity of Moderate/Severe Vasomotor Symptoms (Severity Score A) at Week 4</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 4</time_frame>
    <description>Participants recorded the severity of hot flushes on a LogPad on a daily basis during screening and treatment. The severity of hot flushes was defined as: mild (sensation of heat without sweating); moderate (sensation of heat with sweating, able to continue activity); and severe (sensation of heat with sweating, causing cessation of activity). Severity score A was calculated as the number of moderate hot flushes x 2 + the number of severe hot flushes x 3, divided by the total number of moderate and severe hot flushes. If no hot flushes were experienced, this was to be recorded as 'no sensation of heat'. Baseline values were based on, at most, 7 completely observed pre-treatment days. If less than 4 days were completely observed during treatment, the averages of the previous week were carried forward (last observation carried forward, or LOCF). If the number of days observed in Week 1 were not sufficient, baseline values were carried forward.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Vasomotor Symptoms Score Per Women's Health Questionnaire (WHQ) at Week 12</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>The WHQ is a 36-item, user-friendly, and rapid way of assessing nine domains of physical and emotional health for mid-aged women. Participants self-administered the WHQ questionnaire; scoring is based on a 4-point scale as follows: 'Yes definitely=1', 'Yes sometimes=2', 'No not much=3' and 'No not at all=4'. Each score is transformed to a value '1' for scores '1' and '2' and to a value '0' for scores '3' and '4'. Vasomotor symptoms encompass Items 19 and 27 of the 36 total items. The transformed sums of items 19+27 are divided by 2 to get the score; therefore, the domain ranges from 0 to 1, where lower values are better.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Average Daily Frequency of Vasomotor Symptoms (Frequency Score A) at Week 4</title>
        <description>Participants recorded the frequency of vasomotor symptoms (hot flushes) on an electronic diary card (LogPadÂ®) on a daily basis during screening and treatment. Frequency score A was based on the number of moderate hot flushes + the number of severe hot flushes in one day. Baseline average was derived from, at most, 7 completely observed pre-treatment days. Weekly averages during treatment were calculated if at least 4 days with non-missing data were completely observed; if less than 4 days were completely observed, the averages of the previous week were carried forward (last observation carried forward, or LOCF). If the number of days observed in Week 1 were not sufficient, baseline values were carried forward.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Vasomotor Symptoms Score Per Women's Health Questionnaire (WHQ) at Week 12</title>
        <description>The WHQ is a 36-item, user-friendly, and rapid way of assessing nine domains of physical and emotional health for mid-aged women. Participants self-administered the WHQ questionnaire; scoring is based on a 4-point scale as follows: âYes definitely=1â, âYes sometimes=2â, âNo not much=3â and âNo not at all=4â. Each score is transformed to a value â1â for scores â1â and â2â and to a value â0â for scores â3â and â4â. Vasomotor symptoms encompass Items 19 and 27 of the 36 total items. The transformed sums of items 19+27 are divided by 2 to get the score; therefore, the domain ranges from 0 to 1, where lower values are better.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Average Daily Frequency of Vasomotor Symptoms (Frequency Score A) at Week 12</title>
        <description>Participants recorded the frequency of vasomotor symptoms (hot flushes) on a LogPad on a daily basis during screening and treatment. Frequency score A was based on the number of moderate hot flushes + the number of severe hot flushes in one day. Baseline average was derived from, at most, 7 completely observed pre-treatment days. Weekly averages during treatment were calculated if at least 4 days with non-missing data were completely observed; if less than 4 days were completely observed, the averages of the previous week were carried forward (last observation carried forward, or LOCF). If the number of days observed in Week 1 were not sufficient, baseline values were carried forward.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Average Daily Severity of Moderate/Severe Vasomotor Symptoms (Severity Score A) at Week 4</title>
        <description>Participants recorded the severity of hot flushes on a LogPad on a daily basis during screening and treatment. The severity of hot flushes was defined as: mild (sensation of heat without sweating); moderate (sensation of heat with sweating, able to continue activity); and severe (sensation of heat with sweating, causing cessation of activity). Severity score A was calculated as the number of moderate hot flushes x 2 + the number of severe hot flushes x 3, divided by the total number of moderate and severe hot flushes. If no hot flushes were experienced, this was to be recorded as âno sensation of heatâ. Baseline values were based on, at most, 7 completely observed pre-treatment days. If less than 4 days were completely observed during treatment, the averages of the previous week were carried forward (last observation carried forward, or LOCF). If the number of days observed in Week 1 were not sufficient, baseline values were carried forward.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Average Daily Severity of Moderate/Severe Vasomotor Symptoms (Severity Score A) at Week 12</title>
        <description>Participants recorded the severity of hot flushes on a LogPad on a daily basis during screening and treatment. The severity of hot flushes was defined as: mild (sensation of heat without sweating); moderate (sensation of heat with sweating, able to continue activity); and severe (sensation of heat with sweating, causing cessation of activity). Severity score A was calculated as the number of moderate hot flushes x 2 + the number of severe hot flushes x 3, divided by the total number of moderate and severe hot flushes. If no hot flushes were experienced, this was to be recorded as âno sensation of heatâ. Baseline values were based on, at most, 7 completely observed pre-treatment days. If less than 4 days were completely observed during treatment, the averages of the previous week were carried forward (last observation carried forward, or LOCF). If the number of days observed in Week 1 were not sufficient, baseline values were carried forward.</description>
