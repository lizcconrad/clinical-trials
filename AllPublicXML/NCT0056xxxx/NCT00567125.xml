      The purpose of the study was the comparative assessment of the influence of low and standard
      pressure CO2 pneumoperitoneum on the systemic inflammatory and angiogenic responses during
      the postoperative period after laparoscopic management of cholelithiasis.

      Objective: The purpose of the study was to access the influence of low pressure CO2
      pneumoperitoneum on the inflammatory and angiogenic responses during the postoperative period
      after laparoscopy. Summary background data: Surgical procedures enhance production of pro-
      and anti-inflammatory cytokines and angiogenic factors that play a pivotal role in the
      immunological response to surgical trauma and take part in the pathogenesis of tumor growth
      and adhesions formation. Methods: Study group consisted of 40 patients, operated on due to
      cholelithiasis using standard- (n=20) and low-pressure (n=20) CO2 pneumoperitoneum. Serum
      concentration of IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, VEGF-A and endostatin were measured before the surgeries
      and thereafter at 6, 24 and 48h with commercially available ELISA assays. Results:
      Concentrations of IL-6 increased significantly after the operations in both groups. No
      differences were observed between the groups in regards to IL-6, IL-8 and IL-10 levels.
      Concentrations of VEGF-A measured at 6 and 48h were significantly lower in patients who
      underwent laparoscopies performed with low pressure pneumoperitoneum. No significant
      variations were observed in endostatin serum concentration. Concentrations of the studied
      parameters were not influenced by the duration of surgeries, age, gender, or BMI of the
      patients. Conclusions: The results obtained in our study do not show any significant
      differences between studied operative procedures with regards to systemic inflammatory
      response. Changes in the concentrations of VEGF-A and endostatin observed in the studied
      population may suggest this technique to be more favorable with regards to angiogenesis
      process intensity, along with all its consequences and implications.
