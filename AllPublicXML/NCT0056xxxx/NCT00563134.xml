  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sepsis sometimes occurs in people who have a serious infection. It is caused by toxic
      substances (toxins) from bacteria and other germs entering your bloodstream. Most people with
      sepsis will recover with routine medical care before the illness gets more serious. However,
      in some people, sepsis does become more serious. This severe sepsis can cause damage to
      internal organs (such as your heart, lungs, kidneys, and liver) and can be life threatening.
      Special natural fats, (called 'lipoproteins') in our blood are thought to help protect us
      from the toxins produced by bacteria during sepsis. Levels of these lipoproteins are often
      low in people with sepsis and this may make it more difficult to recover from the disease.
      GR270773 is a new drug that has been developed to help the lipoproteins in protecting the
      body against toxins. GR270773 is made from purified fats and oils from the soyabean and does
      not contain cholesterol. This research study will test the safety (side effects) of GR270773
      and whether or not it is effective in preventing complications in people with severe sepsis.

      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subject is 18 years of age or over.

          -  Subject has one of the following bacterial infections (as defined in Section 14.5) and
             a suspected or confirmed Gram-negative etiology:

               -  Confirmed Gram-negative bacteremia (Gram-negative pathogen must be isolated from
                  blood culture prior to study entry)

               -  Intra-abdominal infection

               -  Nosocomial pneumonia (Evidence of Gram-negative organism from histology or by
                  direct stain of a respiratory specimen required prior to study entry)

               -  Pyelonephritis

          -  Subject is receiving new parenteral antibacterial treatment for the suspected or
             confirmed Gram-negative infection believed to be responsible for this episode of
             sepsis. The subject must receive study drug within 36 hours of commencing treatment
             with this new antibacterial agent.

        Note: Changes in antibiotic coverage made to treat the infection causing the current
        episode of sepsis or needed to treat a deteriorating subject in whom previous antibiotic
        coverage was deemed inadequate will be viewed as a new antibiotic.

          -  Subject has signs of new-onset severe sepsis as evidenced by at least ONE of the
             following hypoperfusion abnormalities OR organ failures caused by the current episode
             of sepsis. Subject must receive study medication within 12 hours from onset of the
             first sepsis-related hypoperfusion abnormality or organ failure:

               -  Persistent oliguria (urine output &lt;0.5 mL/kg/hr for at least two hours after
                  adequate volume resuscitation (ie, &gt;=2 L isotonic crystalloid or appropriate
                  colloid to achieve the same effect)) Note: This criterion does not apply to
                  subjects with chronic renal insufficiency/failure.

               -  Metabolic acidosis (either a pH &lt;=7.3 or a base deficit &gt;5 mmol/L and a blood
                  lactate level &gt;2X the upper limit of normal)

               -  Respiratory failure: PaO2/FiO2 &lt;200

               -  Coagulopathy: acute sepsis-related changes in either platelet count (&lt;100,000
                  cells/mm3) or INR (&gt;1.5)

               -  Cardiovascular failure: sustained hypotension requiring vasopressor support
                  (dopamine &gt;5 µg/kg/min, epinephrine, norepinephrine, phenylephrine or vasopressin
                  at any dose if used to increase blood pressure) for &gt;1 hour in subjects in whom
                  volume resuscitation is believed to be adequate (ie, subject has received &gt;=2 L
                  isotonic crystalloid or appropriate colloid to achieve the same effect) Note:
                  Where a hypoperfusion abnormality/organ failure definition requires a condition
                  to persist for a specified period of time, the organ failure is not considered to
                  exist until the condition specified by the definition is met. The 12 hour window
                  for start of study drug begins when the criteria for the organ
                  failure/hypoperfusion are fulfilled. For organ failure/hypoperfusion abnormality
                  defined in terms of a laboratory result (ie, metabolic acidosis, respiratory
                  failure, and coagulopathy) the criteria for the organ failure/hypoperfusion are
                  considered to be fulfilled at the time the laboratory sample was drawn.
                  Otherwise, the 12 hour window begins at the time the organ failure definition
                  criteria are fulfilled (ie, persistent oliguria and cardiovascular failure).
                  Organ failures occurring subsequent to subject randomization but prior to
                  initiation of study drug infusion do not constitute a secondary endpoint. These
                  are treated as organ failures at study entry and should be documented as such in
                  the relevant CRF pages. The occurrence of a subsequent organ failure does not
                  redefine the start of the 12 hour window for start of study drug. This period is
                  defined above to begin at the onset of the first sepsis-related organ failure
                  qualifying the subject for study entry.

          -  Subject or their legally acceptable representative has provided written and dated
             informed consent to participate in the study.

          -  Subject, if female of childbearing potential or less than one year post menopausal
             (including those who are practicing birth control and those with tubal ligations), has
             a negative urine pregnancy test (measuring human chorionic gonadotropin(HCG) result
             prior to enrollment.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subject is currently participating in or has participated in an investigational drug
             or medical device trial within 30 days or five half-lives, which ever is longer, prior
             to enrollment in this study.

          -  Subject is unlikely to remain in hospital for a minimum of three days (72 hours)
             following enrollment.

          -  Subject has neutropenia (e.g., subject recently receiving cytotoxic chemotherapy with
             absolute neutrophil count &lt;500/µL or expected to decline to &lt;500/µL in the next 3
             days).

          -  Subject is known or believed to suffer from hereditary spherocytosis or S.E. Asian
             elliptocytosis.

          -  Subject has known active hemolytic disease; immune hemolytic anemias,
             hemoglobinopathies (sickle cell anemia and thalassemia major).

          -  Subject has a known bone marrow disorder of inadequate red cell production (eg,
             aplastic anemia, myelodysplasia).

          -  Subject is at increased risk of complications from GR270773-related hemolysis due to
             the inability to increase cardiac function sufficiently to meet the demands for oxygen
             delivery.

          -  Subject has a hemoglobin level at screening &lt;9.0 g/dL (5.59 mmol/L). This hemoglobin
             assessment should be based on the most recent available data in the subject's medical
             record at the time of screening and is not used in the assessment of the hemoglobin
             stopping rule described in Section 6.2.2.

          -  Subject is currently being treated with Xigris (Drotrecogin alfa (activated)) or its
             use is considered imminent (ie, a decision to treat with Xigris has been made).

          -  Subject has a history of allergic reaction to eggs (or egg products), soybeans,
             Intralipid, or any component of GR270773.

          -  Subject has been designated as 'not full support', 'do not resuscitate' (DNR), or
             other equivalent status which prohibits the use of life supporting interventions
             (e.g., mechanical ventilation, dialysis/hemofiltration, or others) thereby limiting
             the treatment options available.

        Note: Subjects with advanced directives prohibiting only chest compression (CPR) are
        eligible for the study.

          -  Subject has preexisting severe liver disease such as cirrhosis, primary biliary
             cirrhosis or known preexisting Child-Pugh class B or C liver dysfunction.

          -  Subject is moribund (a state in which death is perceived to be imminent) or has a life
             expectancy of less than 3 months due to an underlying disease.

          -  Subject is currently receiving one of the following prohibited concomitant
             medications; parenteral nutrition supplements containing lipid emulsions (eg,
             Intralipid), or systemic administration of amphotericin preparations (for example;
             amphotericin, liposomal amphotericin, or amphotericin B lipid complex).

        Note: the use of topical amphotericin and oral amphotericin products are permitted and may
        be administered concomitantly with study drug at the discretion of the investigator.

          -  Subject is pregnant (positive urine pregnancy test at baseline) or lactating.

          -  Subject has previously been enrolled in this study.
