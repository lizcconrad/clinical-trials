  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a research-based study that is looking at the biologic features of breast tissue,
      lymph node tissue, or blood in order to study breast cancer development growth, and spread.
      Through tissue and/or blood samples we hope to gain further knowledge and understanding of
      how to improve diagnosis and treatment of breast cancer by identifying the molecular markers
      that predict clinical outcome and response to therapy.

      The tissue obtained in this protocol will be used for genome-wide examination of DNA, RNA
      expression profiling, proteomic analyses, isolation and analyses of normal and cancer stem
      cells, isolation and analyses of circulating tumor cells, possible analyses of immune cells,
      and possible analyses of serum factors. The tissue may also be used to develop
      patient-specific cell culture models or mouse xenograft models of breast cancer for biologic
      study of tumor progression and metastases and for therapeutic testing. In general, the tissue
      will be used in studies that will molecularly classify tumors, identify prognostic markers,
      identify potential therapeutic markers, identify potential treatment targets, and help us
      better understand the biology and specific role played by different tumor cells in the
      metastatic process.

      The ultimate goal is to use molecular analyses to improve the diagnosis and treatment of
      breast cancer.

      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:People eligible for this study include anyone older than 18 years who is
        undergoing one of the following procedures: core needle or surgical breast biopsy,
        lumpectomy, mastectomy, axillary lymph node surgery, breast reduction surgery, or ductal
        lavage or ductoscopy. Patients who have had breast cancer in the past who are currently
        free of disease or who have a breast cancer recurrence are also eligible. All patients who
        participate must be able to understand and sign the informed consent. Although most
        patients will be female, any males undergoing the above procedures are also eligible for
        this study.

        Exclusion Criteria:Any patient who is less than 18 years old, who is unable to understand
        the informed consent, or not undergoing the above procedures will be excluded from this
        research.
