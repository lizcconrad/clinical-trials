  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) is a useful therapy when treating patients with heart
      failure. As many of these patients also have airways disease it is important to determine if
      BNP also has a positive effect on their respiratory condition. The role of BNP in airways
      disease has never been studied although there is evidence to suggest that it will have a
      positive effect.

      The current study is therefore a proof on concept study which will demonstrate whether BNP
      (nesiritide) will improve both heart failure and airflow obstruction in patient who have
      both.

      The investigators are looking to enroll 40 patients with heart failure and airways disease
      who present to hospital emergency departments. Patients who consent and meet the entry
      criteria will be randomised to receive either nesiritide or placebo in addition to standard
      therapy. They will receive a bolus of study medication followed by a 4 hour infusion. Before,
      at hourly intervals and immediately following the infusion the following data will be
      collected:

        -  dyspnoea score

        -  respiratory rate

        -  FEV1 (if able to be performed)

        -  peak respiratory flow rates (PEFR, if able to be performed)

        -  requirement for concomitant bronchodilator therapy

        -  urinary GMP At all times during the study period and at the conclusion of the study
           patients will be provided with the best available therapy for their condition at the
           physicians' discretion.
