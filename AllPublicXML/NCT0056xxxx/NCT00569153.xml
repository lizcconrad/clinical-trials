             x-ray) metastatic disease.

          -  Subject has undergone orchiectomy or is expected to continue receiving luteinizing
             hormone-releasing hormone analogue therapy, and has a testosterone level of &lt;50 ng/dL
             at screening.

          -  Subject has discontinued all antiandrogen therapy (within 30 days for flutamide and

          -  Subject has normal or, in the opinion of the investigator, clinically insignificant,
             physical examination findings, ECG and chest x-ray results.

          -  Subjects, even if surgically sterilized (ie, status postvasectomy), who: agree to
             practice effective barrier contraception during the entire study treatment period and
             for 4 months after the last dose of study drug, or agree to completely abstain from
             heterosexual intercourse.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subject has known hypersensitivity to TAK-700 or related compounds.

          -  Subject has received prior therapy with aminoglutethimide or ketoconazole within 30
             days prior to the first dose of study drug.

          -  Subject has received prior chemotherapy for prostate cancer.

          -  Subject has received any investigational compound within 30 days prior to first dose
             of study drug.

          -  Subject has received prior herbal product known to decrease prostate-specific antigen
             levels (eg, Saw Palmetto, PC-SPES) within 30 days prior to the first dose of study
             drug.

          -  Subject has received radiation therapy for prostate cancer within 30 days prior to

             prednisone, within 30 days prior to Screening. Chronic therapy is defined as the use
             of corticosteroids for more than 7 days within a 30-day period.

          -  Subject has current spinal cord compression, current bilateral hydronephrosis, or

             embolism, or symptomatic cerebrovascular events), or any other cardiac condition
             (e.g., pericardial effusion restrictive cardiomyopathy) within 12 months prior to
             first dose of study drug.
