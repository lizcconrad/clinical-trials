    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of this study is to demonstrate the efficacy of an investigational
      Vero-cell derived influenza vaccine to prevent infection in an adult population with an
      influenza virus that is antigenically similar to one of the three strains in the vaccine. All
      subjects will be randomized to receive a single 0.5 ml intramuscular injection from one of
      three lots of seasonal Vero-cell derived influenza vaccine or saline placebo. Subjects will
      be monitored for 180 days following vaccination for occurrence of adverse events. For
      determining antibody response, subjects will have one blood draw before and one blood draw 21
      days after vaccination.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        Male and female subjects who

          -  are 18 to 49 years of age, inclusive, on the day of screening

             incorporate two types of the following FDA approved birth control measures through 60
             days after the vaccination: hormonal types of birth control (such as implants, birth
             control pills, patches or other methods) or an intrauterine device, OR an additional
             barrier type of birth control measure (i.e., condoms, diaphragms, cervical caps,
             etc.).

        Exclusion Criteria:

             vaccination and study entry at a later date provided: 1.) oral temperature has
             decreased to &lt; 99.5째F (37.5째C) on rescheduled date, 2.) all other inclusion/exclusion
             criteria are met, 3.) the rescheduled date is no more than 14 days past the initial
             screening date, 4.) the study site is still enrolling subjects]

          -  have a rash or dermatologic condition or tattoos which may interfere with injection
             site reaction rating

          -  have received a blood transfusion or immunoglobulins within 90 days of study entry
