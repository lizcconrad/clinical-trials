    <textblock>
      This clinical trial tests the hypotheses that 1) body decolonization of patients with
      recurrent community-associated (CA) MRSA infections and their household members and 2)
      environmental decolonization of the patients' households will significantly reduce the
      likelihood of recurrent CA-MRSA infection.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Staphylococcus aureus is a ubiquitous pathogen, and causes infections of the skin, lung,
      bloodstream, and other body parts. Over the past decade,community-acquired methicillin
      resistant S. aureus (CA-MRSA) infections, which were previously extremely rare, are occurring
      commonly worldwide. CA-MRSA is the most common cause of skin infection in many locales in the
      U.S., including Southern California.

      CA-MRSA strains are notable for their ability to spread in closed settings and cause
      recurrent infections among healthy persons. Management of recurrent CA-MRSA infection is
      challenging and optimal prevention strategies are undefined. Many experts recommend topical
      agents that decontaminate the body and/or anterior nares. Others suggest environmental
      decontamination to help control recurrences or transmission within households. However, there
      are no data that quantify the efficacy and safety of these approaches.

      We will conduct a multi-center clinical trial to compare the efficacy and safety of body and
      environmental decolonization regimens in the prevention of CA-MRSA infection. This trial is
      being conducted at Kaiser Permanente Southern California (KPSC) sites among KPSC enrollees.

      The study population will comprise of persons suffering from recurrent CA-MRSA infection.
      Household members of this &quot;index subject&quot; will also be offered the chance to enroll in the
      study. For this clinical trial, all subjects will be randomized in a 2 x 2 design to test: 1)
      chlorhexidine body washes and nasal mupirocin ointment vs. usual care, and 2) environmental
      cleansing with ethanol spray and aggressive laundering vs. no environmental cleansing.
      Household members, should they consent, will also be enrolled into the study into the same
      treatment arm as &quot;index subjects&quot;. We will also perform selected secondary analyses,
      including studying the efficacy of the interventions at preventing infections in household
      members. Additionally, we will examine strain relatedness of colonizing and infecting CA-MRSA
      strains to better understand colonization dynamics within households.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Current residence in a KPSC-associated chronic care facility or other chronic-care
             facility (e.g., a rehabilitation facility or nursing home)

          -  Any of the following severe underlying conditions: Organ transplantation, active or
             recent malignancy, cancer, or inflammatory disorder that has required (or would have
             require treatment) in the prior 12 months, with radiation therapy, surgery,
             chemotherapy, systemic immunomodulatory therapy (e.g., tumor necrosis factor

          -  Use of the following drugs or procedures within 120 days prior to study entry: topical
             mupirocin (Bactroban or Bactroban Nasal), Chlorhexidine (e.g., Hibiclens or other
             branded or generic formulations) body washes, or environmental decontamination of the
             household with ethyl alcohol (e.g., Lysol Brand Disinfectant Spray for Kitchens or
             other branded or generic formulations), bleach or dilute bleach solutions, or similar
             regimens

          -  Current use of systemic antibiotics used specifically to treat skin or skin structure

             preparations.

          -  Known hypersensitivity among household members to the agents listed above,
             specifically mupirocin, chlorhexidine, and topical ethanol.
