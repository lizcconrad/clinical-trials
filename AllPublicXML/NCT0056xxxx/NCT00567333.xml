    <textblock>
      This study proposes to compare two innovative treatment approaches for LBP, both of which
      focus on delivering individualized care through evidence-based, clinical care pathways.

      The primary aim of the project is to determine the relative clinical efficacy of 1)
      chiropractic care and 2) multidisciplinary, integrative care in 200 patients with sub-acute
      or chronic LBP, in both the short-term (after 12 weeks) and long-term (after 52 weeks). The
      primary outcome measure in this study is patient-rated back pain.

      Chiropractic care will include therapies within the professional scope of practice.
      Integrative, multidisciplinary care will include chiropractic, massage therapy, traditional
      Chinese medicine (including acupuncture), medication, cognitive behavioral therapy, exercise,
      and patient education.

      Secondary aims are to assess between group differences in frequency of symptoms, disability,
      fear avoidance behavior, self efficacy, general health, improvement, patient satisfaction,
      work loss, medication use, lumbar dynamic motion, and torso muscle endurance. Patients' and
      providers' perceptions of treatment will be described using qualitative methods and
      cost-effectiveness and cost utility will be assessed in the short- and long-term.

      This innovative study is an exciting collaboration between an experienced and established
      team of chiropractic, conventional, and CAM professionals dedicated to advancing the care of
      pervasive and costly LBP conditions. This trial will provide new and important information
      for all health care providers and LBP patients, informing decision making and improving care
      delivery systems.
