    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the tolerability, safety and treatment response of
      flexible doses of paliperidone extended-release (ER; designed to slowly release a drug in the
      body over an extended period of time) tablets in participants with acute schizophrenia
      (psychiatric disorder with symptoms of emotional instability, detachment from reality, often
      with delusions and hallucinations, and withdrawal into the self).

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label (all people know the identity of the intervention), single-arm (getting
      one dose of medicine), multi-center (conducted in more than 1 center) study to evaluate
      tolerability, safety and efficacy of flexible daily doses of paliperidone ER in participants
      with acute schizophrenia. All participants will be given paliperidone ER once daily at a dose
      of 3, 6, 9, or 12 milligram (mg) tablets orally depending on Investigator's discretion, based
      on participant's clinical response and tolerability towards paliperidone ER. The duration of
      the core phase of the treatment will be 6 weeks and the participants who will complete this
      phase, respond well and would like to continue, will be eligible to be enrolled in an
      extension phase, which is no longer than 12 months. Efficacy will primarily be evaluated by
      treatment response evaluated through total Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS)
      score. Participants' safety will be monitored throughout the study.

    <description>Response was defined as decrease of at least 30 percent in total Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) score from Baseline to endpoint of core phase (which is, Day 42 or early discontinuation). The PANSS is a 30-item scale designed to assess various symptoms of schizophrenia including delusions, grandiosity, blunted affect, poor attention, &amp; poor impulse control. The 30 symptoms are rated on a 7-point scale that ranges from 1 (absent) to 7 (extreme psychopathology). The PANSS total score consists of sum of all 30 PANSS items &amp; ranges from 30 to 210. Higher scores indicate worsening.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Simpson Angus Extrapyramidal Symptoms Rating Scale (SAS) Score at Day 7, 14, 42 and Final Evaluation (Day 42 or Early Discontinuation)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Day 7, 14, 42 and Final Evaluation (Day 42 or early discontinuation)</time_frame>
    <description>The SAS is a 10-item scale used to measure the symptoms of parkinsonism (slow movements) or parkinsonian side-effects related to the use of antipsychotic medications. The SAS rates 10 items (including gait, arm dropping, shoulder shaking, elbow rigidity, wrist rigidity, leg pendulousness, head dropping, Glabella tap, tremor and salivation), score ranging from 0 (normal) to 4 (extreme). The SAS global score is the average score (total sum of items score divided by the number of items) and ranges between 0 and 4, where the higher score indicates more severe condition of Extrapyramidal Symptoms. Final evaluation is the last post- baseline visit with data.</description>

  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in Global Rating Sub-scale Score Based on Barnes Akathisia Rating Scale (BARS) at Day 7, 14, 42 and Final Evaluation (Day 42 or Early Discontinuation)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Day 7, 14, 42 and Final Evaluation (Day 42 or early discontinuation)</time_frame>
    <description>The BARS included an objective rating (from 0=normal to 3=constantly engaged), two subjective ratings of symptoms of akathisia, namely awareness of restlessness (ranging from 0=absence of inner restlessness to 3=awareness of intense compulsion to move) and reported distress related to restlessness (ranging from 0=no distress to 3=severe), and a global clinical rating of akathisia, ranging from 0 (absent) to 5 (severe). Global rating sub-scale score (that is, global clinical rating of akathisia) was assessed which was scored separately and is the most relevant measure of severity of akathisia. Higher scores indicates worsening akathisia. Final evaluation is the last post-baseline visit with data.</description>

        <description>The CGI-S rating scale is a 7 point global assessment that measures the clinician's impression of the severity of illness exhibited by a participant. A rating of 1 is equivalent to &quot;normal, not at all ill&quot; and a rating of 7 is equivalent to &quot;among the most extremely ill participants&quot;. Higher scores indicate worsening. Final evaluation is the last post-baseline visit with data.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Personal and Social Performance Scale (PSP) Score at Day 7, 14, 28, 42 and Final Evaluation (Day 42 or Early Discontinuation)</title>
        <description>The PSP assesses the degree of dysfunction within 4 domains of behavior: socially useful activities, personal &amp; social relationships, self-care &amp; disturbing and aggressive behavior. The score ranges from 1 to 100, divided into 10 equal intervals to rate the degree of difficulty (1, absent to 6, very severe) in each of 4 domains. Participants with a score of 71 to 100 have a mild degree of difficulty; from 31 to 70, varying degrees of disability; less than or equal to 30, functioning so poorly as to require intensive supervision. Final evaluation is the last post-baseline visit with data.</description>

        <description>The SAS is a 10-item scale used to measure the symptoms of parkinsonism (slow movements) or parkinsonian side-effects related to the use of antipsychotic medications. The SAS rates 10 items (including gait, arm dropping, shoulder shaking, elbow rigidity, wrist rigidity, leg pendulousness, head dropping, Glabella tap, tremor and salivation), score ranging from 0 (normal) to 4 (extreme). The SAS global score is the average score (total sum of items score divided by the number of items) and ranges between 0 and 4, where the higher score indicates more severe condition of Extrapyramidal Symptoms. Final evaluation is the last post- baseline visit with data.</description>

Global rating sub-scale score (that is, global clinical rating of akathisia) was assessed which was scored separately and is the most relevant measure of severity of akathisia. Higher scores indicates worsening akathisia. Final evaluation is the last post-baseline visit with data.</description>
