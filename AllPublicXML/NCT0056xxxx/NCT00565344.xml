    <textblock>
      We will obtain data from the robust Agency for Healthcare Reimbursement and Quality (AHRQ)
      Healthcare Utilization Project (HCUP), as well as from the State of Tennessee. If our
      hypotheses are true, such data will provide strong evidence that Medicaid disenrollment has a
      negetive health impact on uninsured populations. The data may also provide evidence for
      increased public funding of safety-net EDs after Medicaid disenrollment.
