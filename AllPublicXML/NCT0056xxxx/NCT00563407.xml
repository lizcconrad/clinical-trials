  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Radiotherapy is standard treatment for breast cancer after lumpectomy. Although this
      treatment showed substantial patient benefits and decrease of local recurrence and deaths
      from breast cancer, it also results in some severe late side-effects, such as skin fibrosis
      and cardiac failure. It's possible to offer breast irradiation (RT) and minimizing toxicities
      radiation dose to skin, lung and heart. This will be achieved with highly conformal RT
      delivery using Tomotherapy. We plan to evaluate this approach in clinical study. We plan also
      to evaluate the value of genomic, cellular and functional imaging endpoints as predictive
      markers of toxicity in our breast cancer population. This program is expected to
      prospectively validate that Tomotherapy for breast RT can decrease skin, lung and heart
      toxicities and maintaining excellent cancer control after lumpectomy.

      Radiotherapy is standard treatment after conservative surgery for early-stage breast cancer.
      Although this approach substantially improves local control and reduces deaths from breast
      cancer, it also results in some severe late side-effects, including skin fibrosis, deaths
      from radiation-induced cardiac disease and lung cancer. We will undertake a novel approach to
      the evaluation of radiation-induced toxicity during and after whole breast irradiation (RT)
      following breast-conserving surgery, with the long-term strategic goal of minimizing RT
      toxicity in early breast cancer. Theoretically, it is possible to achieve this goal through
      very highly conformal RT delivery and avoidance of RT in toxicity-prone individuals where
      possible. We plan to evaluate the utility of genomic analysis, cellular DNA repair
      competence, and functional imaging endpoints as predictive markers of toxicity in our breast
      cancer population. This program is expected to (a) prospectively validate that HT for breast
      RT can decrease acute toxicity whilst maintaining excellent cancer control after BCS; (b)
      demonstrate that novel surrogate markers will aid in the prediction of acute and/or late
      normal tissue toxicity with a view to identify toxicity-prone (or conversely, robust)
      individuals from amongst the breast cancer population.
