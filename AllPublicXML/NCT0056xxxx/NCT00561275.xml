      This is a phase 1 study of multiple peptide vaccine therapy and GM-CSF in treating patients
      with esophageal cancer.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      LY6K (lymphocyte antigen 6 complex, locus K) was identified as a new target of tumor
      associated antigen using cDNA microarray technologies combined with the expression profiles
      of normal and cancer tissues. On the other hand, anti-angiogenic therapy is now considered to
      be one of promising approaches to treat of cancer. In this clinical trial, we evaluate the
      safety and immune responses of multiple peptide cocktail including LY6K and vascular
      endothelial growth factor receptor 1 (VEGFR1) and vascular endothelial growth factor receptor
      2 (VEGFR2) together with IFA and GM-CSF as immunoadjuvants in patients who had LY6K expressed
      primary esophageal cancer. Toxicity profiles will be monitored, and antigen specific T cell
      responses will be described.
