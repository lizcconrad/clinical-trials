  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate molecular breast imaging in the workup of patients
      with a history of bloody nipple discharge, not reproducible in the office who have a negative
      clinical breast examination, and a negative diagnostic mammogram and breast ultrasound.

      Although the cause of bloody nipple discharge is benign in most cases, the evaluation is
      focused on excluding a malignant cause. When bloody nipple discharge is clinically
      reproducible, management traditionally involves surgical duct excision. When bloody nipple
      discharge is not reproducible and mammogram and ultrasound are negative the management relies
      on &quot;watchful waiting&quot; - serial breast imaging to exclude a focal finding and continued
      observation for recurrent bloody nipple discharge. This approach provokes anxiety among
      patients who do not have a clear explanation for the bloody nipple discharge. Galactography
      is useful when positive, but has a high false-negative rate. MRI has not been studied in this
      context and is costly. Ductoscopy may play a diagnostic role in the future, but experience
      and equipment are limiting variables. The availability of a less costly method of excluding
      breast cancer would be of great value in this population.

      Molecular Breast Imaging (MBI) is a highly promising novel methodology for breast cancer
      detection developed under the leadership of Dr. Michael O'Connor at Mayo Clinic, Rochester,
      MN. Preliminary patient studies with our dual-detector system indicate that this system is
      capable of reliably detecting very small (5-10 mm) malignant lesions in the breast.
