      RATIONALE: Studying samples of urine in the laboratory from women with breast cancer may help
      doctors learn whether tamoxifen and aromatase inhibitors alter the metabolism of estrogens.

      PURPOSE: This clinical trial is studying the effect of tamoxifen or an aromatase inhibitor on
      estrogen metabolism in women undergoing treatment for newly diagnosed breast cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Learn the effects of selected chemotherapy agents on the profile of estrogen
           metabolites, glutathione conjugates, and depurinating DNA adducts in urine from women
           with breast cancer.

        -  Determine whether tamoxifen citrate or aromatase inhibitor alters the metabolism of
           estrogens.

      OUTLINE: Patients are stratified according to planned therapy (tamoxifen citrate vs aromatase
      inhibitor).

      Patients receive tamoxifen citrate or an aromatase inhibitor as planned. Urine samples (and
      nipple aspirate fluid, if possible) are collected before beginning treatment and after 2-6
      months of treatment. Samples are analyzed for 40 estrogen metabolites, conjugates, and
      depurinating DNA adducts by ultraperformance liquid chromatography with tandem mass
      spectrometric detection.

      Patients' information, including race, body mass index, age at menarche, menopausal status,
      age at menopause if applicable, smoking history, alcohol consumption, pregnancy history
      including age at each pregnancy, lactation, history of benign breast disease, hysterectomy,
      and disease type, is collected through medical record review.
