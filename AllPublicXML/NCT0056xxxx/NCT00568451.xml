      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor
      cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. It is not yet known
      whether giving paclitaxel together with carboplatin is more effective than giving
      temozolomide alone in treating patients with melanoma.

      PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying the side effects and how well giving paclitaxel
      together with carboplatin or giving temozolomide alone works in treating patients with stage
      IV melanoma.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  To assess the anti-tumor activity and toxicity profile of timed delivery of conventional
           paclitaxel and carboplatin (PC) in patients with stage IV melanoma who have received
           prior chemotherapy for their metastatic disease.

        -  To assess the anti-tumor activity and toxicity profile of timed delivery of conventional
           temozolomide (TMZ) chemotherapy in patients with stage IV melanoma who have received
           prior chemotherapy for their metastatic disease.

        -  To assess the anti-tumor activity and toxicity profile of timed delivery of conventional
           PC in patients with stage IV melanoma who have not received prior chemotherapy for their
           metastatic disease.

        -  To assess the anti-tumor activity and toxicity profile of timed delivery of conventional
           TMZ chemotherapy in patients with stage IV melanoma who have not received prior
           chemotherapy for their metastatic disease.

        -  To evaluate the changes of T-regulator cells, melanoma-specific functional parameters as
           a function of time in all four patient cohorts.

      OUTLINE: Patients are stratified according to prior chemotherapy for metastatic disease (yes
      vs no) and scheduled chemotherapy regimen (paclitaxel and carboplatin vs temozolomide).

      Beginning at the predicted day of C-reactive peptide (CRP) peak levels, patients receive
      paclitaxel IV and carboplatin IV on days 1, 8, and 15 OR oral temozolomide alone on days 1-5.
      Treatment repeats every 4 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity.

      Patients undergo blood sample collection periodically for pharmacological studies. Samples
      are analyzed for CRP quantification via ELISA; presence and number of circulating blood
      T-regulator cells via immunophenotyping for CD4/CD25+ and CD4/fox-p3+ T cells; level of
      functional immunity against melanoma specific antigens (MART-1, tyrosinase, and gp100) and
      survivin in patients that are HLA-A2+ via intracellular staining; total number of cytotoxic T
      lymphocytes (CTLs) capable of reacting against melanoma targets via tetramer staining
      (Becton-Coulter); and quantification of interferon γ-producing, peptide-specific CTLs via
      multicolor conventional flow cytometry.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 3 months for up to 2 years.

          <title>Number of Participants Who Experienced Changes in Immunologic Profile (MART-1, Tyrosinase, and gp100) Within a Treatment</title>
          <description>For those patients who are HLA-A2+, the maximum post-treatment levels of MART-1, tyrosinase, and gp100 will be determined. For each of these specific melanoma specific antigens, the number of participants (within a given treatment) who gained or maintained immunity based on the maximum post-treatment level of that specific melanoma specific antigen will be determined.</description>

        <description>For each patient, a time series plot of the number of IFNγ producing peptide specific CTLs will be constructed. The resulting plots will be visually inspected for trends within and between treatments. A point and an interval estimate of the number of participants (receiving a given treatment) who had at least a 2-fold increase in the number of the number of IFNγ producing peptide specific CTLs will be constructed using the properties of the binomial distribution.</description>
