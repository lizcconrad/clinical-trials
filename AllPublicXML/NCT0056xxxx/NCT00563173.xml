  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate if the DNA vaccine CHRONVAC-C® intended for future
      treatment of Hepatitis C infections is safe and tolerated when administered to HCV infected
      individuals with a low viral load. In addition the capability of the vaccine to induce an
      immune response and the effect on viral load will be studied. In order to increase the uptake
      of the vaccine the intra muscular injection is combined with electroporation, meaning that a
      brief electric field is applied to the injection site resulting in temporary pores in the
      cell membranes that allows the vaccine to enter the cells.
