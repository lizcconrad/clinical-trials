  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Herbs are physiologically active substances which can significantly affect the outcome of
      medical treatment, either by inhibiting or promoting drug disposition or through additive and
      synergistic effects when used in conjunction with conventional medications. Herb-drug
      interactions are potentially dangerous, and may be difficult to predict since regulation of
      the preparations is often lacking, and patients most often do not report the use of these
      products to their physicians. The risk for toxic effects and adverse interactions increases
      among high-risk groups, such as the elderly or patients with renal or hepatic disease. The
      purpose of this study is to study the prevalence of use of herbal medicine among patients
      hospitalized in the internal medicine department of an Israeli hospital, as well as examine
      the effect of herbal remedies on patient health, either beneficial or harmful. For this
      purpose, a questionnaire evaluating demographic data, medical history (both current and
      past), use of and attitudes towards herbal medicine will be administered to patients in the
      Department of Internal Medicine at the Shaare Zedek Medical Center in Israel. The Beck
      Depression Questionnaire will be used as well.
