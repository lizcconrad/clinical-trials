  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background:

      Dupuytren's contracture is a common hand problem that causes certain fingers to bend towards
      the palm. Patients with this condition cannot perform daily activities and many are unable to
      work. It is usually treated by an operation to straighten the fingers followed by therapy if
      the angle that the fingers are bent at is large enough. However, no treatment has been able
      to completely prevent the angle from persisting.

      Objective:

      This study is designed to examine whether or not the use of a drug in combination with
      surgery will improve the angle at which the fingers are bent more than surgery alone.

      Hypothesis:

      Subjects who receive triamcinolone acetonide will have straighter fingers compared with
      subjects who only have the operation and no triamcinolone acetonide at both 3 months and 6
      months after the operation.

      Methods:

      Eligible patients interested in having the operation to treat Dupuytren's contracture will be
      asked if they would like to join the study. Subjects will be randomly placed into one of two
      groups: the steroid injection group or the control group. Subjects will have a pre-operative
      visit, the surgery, and follow-ups at 6 weeks, 3 months and 6 months. All subjects will have
      the operation, but only those in the steroid injection group will receive an injection of the
      drug. During the 6 week and 3 month follow-ups, subjects in the steroid injection group may
      receive another injection if their fingers are still bent. Angles are measured at the
      pre-operative visit and at 3 and 6 months. The change in angle from before to after and any
      differences in the groups, in time points and interactions between the two will be analyzed.

    <description>Triamcinolone acetonide will be administered into the cord following surgery with a tuberculin syringe and a 25-gauge needle.
Doses will range from 60-120 mg depending on extent of the disease.
Patients will receive injections at 6 weeks and 3 months for persisting nodules or cords.
PI will determine the dosages. Estimates will be made based on the following:
Size of nodule/cord: 1-2 cm2, dosage 20-40 mg
Size of nodule/cord: 2-6 cm2, dosage 40-80 mg
Size of nodule/cord: 6-10 cm2, dosage 80-100 mg
Size of nodule/cord: &gt;10 cm2, dosage 100-120 mg</description>
