  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare kidney function, long term patient and graft
      survival, and incidence of acute rejection in liver transplant recipients between one group
      receiving thymoglobulin induction and delayed initiation of tacrolimus and another group of
      liver transplant recipients having immediate administration of tacrolimus without any
      induction immunosuppression.

    <textblock>
      Renal insufficiency following liver transplantation in adult recipients is a major cause of
      morbidity and a major contributor to mortality. One of the key factors contributing to this
      renal dysfunction is the use of calcineurin inhibitors. There is some evidence to suggest
      that the first 7-10 days following liver transplantation are crucial in terms of renal
      function and the ability to avoid the use of nephrotoxic agents such as calcineurin
      inhibitors may have a significant impact on long-term outcome.
