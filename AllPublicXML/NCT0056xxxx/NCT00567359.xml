  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this research study erlotinib will be given to eligible participants whose lung cancer has
      been removed by surgery. Eligible patients have adenocarcinoma, a type of non-small lung
      cancer, and must have 1 or more of the following characteristics: be female, be of Asian or
      Pacific Rim descent and/or be a never smoker. The potential participant's tumor will be
      examined for Epidermal growth factor (EGFR) mutations. EGFR is a protein that is
      overexpressed in most non-small cell lung cancers. Some EGFR has been found to have specific
      mutations and the participant must have one of these mutations in his tumor.

      Erlotinib blocks this protein and may control tumor growth and increase survival. Previous
      research has shown that erlotinib is most effective for people who have these specific
      mutations in the EGFR.

      -  Erlotinib is a pill taken daily and participants may continue to receive erlotinib for
           up to two years, as long as the cancer does not return and they do not experience any
           unacceptable side effects.

        -  While participants are receiving erlotinib, they will be asked to return to the clinic
           for study visits to monitor the status of their disease and their general health. For
           the first 5 months of erlotinib, they will return to the clinic monthly. After that they
           will return to the clinic every three months.

          -  Pathologically confirmed diagnosis of NSCLC of adenocarcinoma histology

          -  Stage IA-B, IIA-B, or IIIA by the American Joint Committee on Cancer 7th edition
             staging criteria

          -  Sufficient tumor tissue available for EGFR mutation analysis

          -  At least ONE of the following patient characteristics: previously detected deletion 19
             or L858R EGFR mutation, female sex, history of never smoking, or Asian/Pacific Rim
             ethnicity (to be enrolled in the screening portion of trial).

          -  18 years of age or older

          -  Tumor samples must have either exon 19 deletion mutations or the exon 21 L858R point
             mutation

          -  Adequate organ function as outlined in protocol

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Radiographic evidence of recurrent NSCLC prior to erlotinib treatment

          -  Confirmed T790M resistance mutation in the primary tumor sample

             it undesirable for the patient to participate in the study

          -  Use of any non-FDA approved or investigational agent within 2 weeks of enrolling onto
             the trial, or failure to recover from the side effects of any of these agents
