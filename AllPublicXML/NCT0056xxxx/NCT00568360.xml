  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Endoscopy is a standard part of the evaluation of patients with head and neck cancer used for
      determining the extent of tumor involvement. However, not all areas involved by tumor are
      apparent visually. Preliminary results indicate that compared with normal tissues, tumors
      have abnormal levels of capillary oxygenation. The purpose of this study is to determine the
      ability of non-pulsatile visible light tissue oxygen monitoring to differentiate normal and
      tumor tissue based on capillary oxygenation during endoscopy Should this be possible, this
      method could be used to mark tumor extent and invasion, even when that invasion is up to 5mm
      blow the tissue surface.
