  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a randomized controlled trial designed to evaluate the effectiveness of a nurse
      delivered stage-matched intervention to cardiac patients for cessation of tobacco use. Review
      of literature shows that there is a clear lack of empirical evidence on (1) using nurses to
      deliver stage-matched smoking cessation interventions, and (2) the effectiveness of such
      intervention for cardiac patients in Chinese populations. The ultimate goal of the
      intervention achieve a higher quit rate in the intervention group than in the controls. In
      addition, the change in the patient's smoking behaviour such as reduction of the number of
      cigarettes smoked, and progression to a higher stage of readiness to quit, will also be
      measured. This study is the first step to address the urgently needed data for (1) promoting
      the delivery of nurse-run stage-matched smoking cessation interventions to help patients stop
      smoking, (2) developing smoking cessation policy and programmes in the hospitals and for the
      health care system, and (3) contributing an evidence-based approach to orientate clinical
      services towards prevention, so as to reduce premature deaths and the enormous disease burden
      of our society.
