      Background:

        -  The relation between eye movement and brain function is a subject of interest to the
           National Eye Institute.

        -  By comparing eye movement in healthy volunteers to research conducted on patients who
           have difficulty moving their eyes, the National Eye Institute hopes to develop and
           improve diagnostic procedures for people with eye diseases.

      Objectives:

      -The purpose of this study is to understand how we see visual patterns and how we move our
      eyes to see.

      Eligibility:

        -  Normal volunteers:

             -  must have no serious illnesses and must be 18 years of age or older

             -  who are 18 years of age or older must be willing to wear contact lenses that record
                eye movement.

             -  individuals with a history of eye or brain diseases, or previous eye or eye muscle
                surgery, are not allowed to participate in this study. Individuals who are
                currently using eye medications also are not eligible for the study.

        -  Patients:

             -  who are 18 years of age or older must be willing to wear contact lenses that record
                eye movement.

      Design:

        -  Participants will visit the National Eye Institute outpatient clinic for examination and
           testing.

        -  Participants will be screened with a medical history and eye examination (including eye
           pressure and eye movement tests).

        -  Participants with healthy eyes will participate in eye movement testing experiments:

             -  One or more sessions lasting less than three hours each.

             -  Eye movements will be recorded with either a special contact lens or a
                video/infrared camera system.

             -  For the majority of the studies done under this protocol, only one or two sessions
                will be required. A few studies recording very small eye movements will require
                three or more sessions....

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This natural history study will investigate eye movements and other responses to visual
      stimuli in normal individuals (normal volunteers) and patients. This protocol replaces a
      similar protocol (80-EI-0093) which served the same purpose. Normal adult volunteers will be
      recruited and will undergo an eye exam to assure that there are no visual system problems.
      Volunteers will be studied in one or more sessions where eye movement, verbal or hand
      movement responses are recorded in response to visual stimuli. Patients with diseases
      affecting the oculomotor or visual systems will also be recruited to help us better
      understand these systems and to help characterize their specific disease.

          -  Participant must be able to follow directions and actively pay attention to visual
             stimuli and respond as appropriate.

          -  Participant has a history of ocular or visual diseases or diseases affecting the
             nervous system (including myasthenia, MS, etc.) or any diseases which might affect
             control of eye movements or affect vision.

          -  Participant has had prior eye or eye muscle surgery.

          -  Participant has a history of eye patching (amblyopia or lazy eye).
