    <textblock>
      This is a study to assess the safety, efficacy, and tolerability of MK0859 in patients with
      primary hypercholesterolemia (large amounts of cholesterol in the blood) or mixed
      hyperlipidemia (high levels of LDL cholesterol, triglycerides, and low levels of HDL
      cholesterol in blood) This is an early phase trial and some specific protocol information is
      in progress and not publicly available at this time. (Full information is available to trial
      participants).
