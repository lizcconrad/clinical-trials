  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Much has been learned in recent years about the mechanisms by which breastfeeding improves
      child health and survival. However, there has been little progress in using these insights to
      improve pediatric care. Factors that are important for protecting the breast fed infant might
      be expected to decrease the adverse effects of weaning on diarrhea, growth, and development.
      The proposed study is meant to begin addressing this important gap by a clinical trial of
      lactoferrin supplementation in previously weaned children. Lactoferrin,an iron-binding
      protein with multiple physiological functions (anti-microbial, anti-inflammatory, and
      immunomodulatory), is one of the most important proteins present in mammalian milk. Our
      hypothesis is that lactoferrin (given as a daily supplement in amounts similar to those
      consumed if the child were still breastfed) will improve health by mimicking its protective
      roles in milk. The significance of these studies is that they will prove feasibility of
      improving child health after the end of breastfeeding by continuing ingestion of a major
      protective milk protein. Diarrhea and malnutrition after weaning is a global problem that may
      be amenable to this approach.

      The proposed community-based study will be conducted in a previously weaned population at
      risk for repeated intestinal infections. Infants who are 12-18 months of age living in the
      District of Independencia, Lima, Peru will be eligible for enrollment. We will conduct a
      randomized double blind placebo controlled trial comparing twice daily supplementation with
      bovine lactoferrin versus a placebo (maltodextrin) Therapy will be continued for 6 months
      with close monitoring of all study participants for diarrhea and growth.

      Specific aim 1: Determine the effect of bovine lactoferrin supplementation on prevention of
      diarrhea,measured by the number of episodes of diarrhea during a 6 month trial in previously
      weaned Peruvian children enrolled at 12 to 18 months of age.

      Specific aim 2: Determine the effect of bovine lactoferrin supplementation on growth.
