  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The prescribed antibiotic for prophylaxis of infection following PRK should be effective at
      eradicating a potential infection. In addition, the antibiotic should have a rapid onset of
      action, effectively penetrate the target tissue, and be safe and not toxic to any layer of
      the healing cornea, especially the epithelium. Several studies have investigated the toxicity
      of the fourth generation fluoroquinolones on the corneal epithelium and studies have
      demonstrated that gatifloxacin is less deleterious to the healing cornea than moxifloxacin.
      Most of these studies, however, have been conducted in animals. This was a retrospective
      chart review.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Prior generation fluoroquinolones predominantly either inhibit topoisomerase II (DNA Gyrase)
      or topoisomerase IV and therefore only require one genetic mutation for bacteria to develop
      resistance. Fourth-generation fluoroquinolones are equally effective against topoisomerase II
      and IV, which significantly expands their spectrum of action against gram-positive agents and
      atypical mycobacteria and Nocardia . This duality of action of the fourth generation
      fluoroquinolones requires that for bacteria to become resistant to these agents, the bacteria
      must undergo two genetic mutations resulting in a significantly decreased chance of an
      organism developing resistance.Minimum inhibitory concentrations determined in vitro suggest
      that fourth-generation fluoroquinolones are more effective than second- and third-generation
      fluoroquinolones against gram-positive bacteria including Staphylococcal species found in
      endophthalmitis and bacterial keratitis cultures. The increased efficacy of fourth-generation
      fluoroquinolones make these antibiotics important agents to evaluate for prophylaxis against
      post-PRK infections. This was a retrospective chart review.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients were eligible for inclusion if they were a healthy male or female 18 years of
             age or older and were candidates for bilateral PRK.

          -  Eligible patients had a best-corrected Early Treatment of Diabetic Retinopathy Study
             (ETDRS) visual acuity score equivalent to a Snellen score of 20/30 or better in each
             eye, had a stable prescription for 1 year, were willing to participate in the study,
             and were able to comprehend and sign the informed consent form.

          -  All subjects were instructed that if they decide not to participate they could
             withdraw from the study at any time.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients were excluded from the study if they had a history of refractive or other
             ocular surgery in either eye.

          -  Patients with any condition which could delay wound healing were not eligible to
             participate.

          -  They were excluded if they had poor tolerance to any component of the masked study
             fluoroquinolones, Acular® LS (Allergan) or Pred Forte® (Allergan).

          -  Patients were also excluded if they required the use of a systemic antibiotic during
             the study period, were involved in another investigational study or had participated
             in a study within 30 days prior to the start of this study.
