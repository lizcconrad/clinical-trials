  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Despite treatment with aspirin a large number of patients suffer a myocardial infarction. It
      has been speculated that these patients might be &quot;resistant&quot; to aspirin, and studies have
      indicated that this phenomenon is related to a less favourable prognosis. Furthermore,
      patients with diabetes mellitus have an increased risk of myocardial infarction and other
      vascular events and, recently, it has been suggested that diabetics do not respond adequately
      to aspirin. The purpose of this study is to compare the prevalence of &quot;aspirin resistance&quot; in
      diabetics and non-diabetics. Furthermore, patients who suffered a myocardial infarction while
      being treated with aspirin are included. We hypothesize that the prevalence of &quot;aspirin
      resistance&quot; will be higher among diabetics compared to other patients and to healthy
      individuals.

      A considerable number of patients suffer acute coronary events despite being treated with
      antiplatelet therapy such as aspirin. Taken together with laboratory findings of a low
      response to aspirin, the term &quot;aspirin resistance&quot; has been coined. Diabetics have an
      increased risk of suffering ischemic vascular events and, recently, an increased prevalence
      of &quot;aspirin resistance&quot; was reported in these patients. The purpose of the present study is
      to compare the aspirin response in diabetics and non-diabetics in a population with
      angiogram-verified coronary artery disease. Furthermore, healthy volunteers and patients who
      suffered a myocardial infarction while being treated with aspirin are included. Eligible
      patients are identified in the Western Denmark Heart Registry.
