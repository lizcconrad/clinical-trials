  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      German stroke units are hesitating to use Aggrenox for secondary ischaemic stroke / transient
      ischaemic attack (TIA) prevention in a sub-acute treatment setting. They argue that clinical
      experience with sub-acute Aggrenox treatment is limited and poorly documented when compared
      with sub-acute acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) treatment. However, long term treatment (started
      after 3-6 months after stroke/TIA) with Aggrenox was safe and superior to ASA treatment in
      preventing recurrent strokes. There is no evidence for ASA to prevent from neurological
      progression after stroke during the first 3 months. Results from a cohort study suggest that
      starting Aggrenox within 72 hours after stroke predicts clinical improvement in the National
      Institute of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) at discharge from the hospital. Dipyridamole
      suppresses acute inflammatory responses to stroke.

      This study is designed to investigate the tolerability and efficacy of a secondary stroke
      prevention treatment with Aggrenox when initiated within 24 hours of stroke onset on a stroke
      unit compared to later initiation after a 7 day ASA treatment and outside off a stroke unit
      setting.
