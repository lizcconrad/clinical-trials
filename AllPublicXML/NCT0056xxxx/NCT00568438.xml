      The goal of this study is to study NIS expression in benign and malignant breast and thyroid
      samples using archival formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue sections.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The objective of the study is to further understanding of proteins that occur in both normal
      cells and tumor cells and to learn more about certain diseases and potential alternative
      treatments for these diseases.

      Cases will be identified from clinic patient medical records and linked to pathology reports.
      The surgical pathology record number will thus be obtained and used to retrieve the archival
      blocks and slides. Approximately three representative blocks will be selected and 4-6 four
      micron thick sections will be cut on a microtome. Cases with limited archived diagnostic
      material will not be selected nor blocks where there is little materials.

        Cases will be identified from clinic patient medical records and linked to pathology
        reports. The surgical pathology record number will thus be obtained and used to retrieve
        the archival blocks and slides. In addition, all these participants will be clinical
        patients of the Protocol Director, thus the Physician will always be familiar with the
        participants.
