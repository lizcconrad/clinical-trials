  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      SB-681323 is a p38 MAP kinase inhibitor and is currently under development by
      GlaxoSmithKline. This will be an open label study conducted at one site. Six healthy male
      subjects will be enrolled to ensure at least four fully evaluable subjects. Each subject will
      receive a single 10mg/ 50 µCurie oral dose of [14C]SB-681323. Urine and faecal samples will
      be collected until 216 h after dosing but subjects may be discharged after 168 h if 90% of
      the dose is recovered and/or &lt;1% of the dose is excreted in a 24 h period. Blood and plasma
      will be collected at various sample times after dosing to measure parent drug and total
      drug-related material. Samples of urine, faeces and plasma will be transferred into separate
      study to characterise and quantify metabolites in these matrices. Safety will be assessed by
      adverse event monitoring, vital signs, ECG and clinical laboratory tests.
