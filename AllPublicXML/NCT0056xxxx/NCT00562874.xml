  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Many of the 28 million people with immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and acquired immunodeficiency
      syndrome (AIDS) estimated to be living in sub-Saharan Africa also suffer from malnutrition.
      Reproductive age women, their infants and young children are among the most vulnerable for
      malnutrition and progression of HIV to AIDS and mortality is increased in the malnourished,
      as seen in Eastern and Southern Africa. The HIV Nutrition Project (HNP) research evaluates
      the effect of protein and micronutrients in meat on the health and nutritional well being of
      Kenyan women living with HIV in rural Kenya and the health and development of their children,
      by means of a randomized nutrition intervention. We will determine if meat in the diets of
      HIV- infected women and their children (1) protects the immune system and prevents severe
      infection, (2) prevents the loss of body mass and enhances the quality of life among drug
      naïve women not yet ill enough to warrant antiretroviral drugs and (3) positively impacts
      growth and development of vulnerable children of the HIV-infected women when compared to
      those given supplements with the same amount of energy but with either soya or wheat protein.
      The intervention food with beef protein provides significant vitamin B12, lysine and
      bio-available iron, zinc and selenium when compared to the soya and wheat supplements.
      Deficiencies of these nutrients may hasten HIV disease progression.

      The findings from our project may have implications for the development of initiatives that
      are either sustainable or subsidized by the local, regional and/or global economies that
      ensure that all HIV-infected individuals have access to adequate nutrition support that
      includes foods that provide enough nutrients that are needed to optimize health and
      well-being. The knowledge gained may significantly impact other populations at high risk for
      decreased immune function such as those with tuberculosis and malaria.

      This is a 3 arm randomized design where 225 HIV-infected rural Kenyan mothers with a CD4
      between 250 and 500, WHO Stage 1 or 2, and with no co-existing infections, receive with their
      child, a nutrition biscuit supplement daily (5 days/week) for 12 months. These women are not
      yet ill enough to warrant treatment with antiretroviral drugs in Kenya and therefore a food
      intervention may keep them healthy longer and delay the need for drugs.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        HIV-infected women and their children who live in the Turbo catchment area in the Uasin
        Gishu District of Kenya and attend the AMPATH clinic there will be invited to participate
        in the study.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Women will be included if drug naïve and classified as WHO Stage 1 or 2 54 with a CD4
             count greater than 250.

          -  The youngest child in the household between 6 months and 10 years who has no evidence
             of one or more OIs or illnesses will also be followed.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Women will be excluded if the initial CD4 is less than or equal to 250, they suffer
             from one or more OIs, are pregnant, or qualify as recipients of the AMPATH standard of
             care HHI, World Food Program or USAID Unimix food supplement interventions.

          -  Should the designated child be HIV positive with advanced disease and therefore not
             meet inclusion criteria, the next oldest child less than 10 years who meets the study
             criteria will be the designated child.
