      The purpose of the study is to evaluate the effectiveness of the study drug on the libido
      (sexual desire) of women who are taking oral contraceptives and who have experienced libido
      reductions as a side-effect of this contraceptive method The hypothesis is that there is
      superiority in the change in sexual desire and arousal component scores of the FSFI
      questionnaire from baseline to cycle 6 of the treatment with the study drug as compared to
      Placebo.
