  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, six-week, randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled, multi-center
      study in patients with schizophrenia who are experiencing an acute exacerbation of psychosis.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study consists of a 5- to 14-day screening period to include antipsychotic medication
      washout, followed by a six-week double blind treatment period. Patients completing the 6-week
      treatment period may continue double-blind treatment in an optional extension period of at
      least 6 weeks' duration. Patients randomized to placebo during the initial 6-week period will
      be randomized to BL-1020 low or high dose during the extension treatment period.
      Approximately 40 study centers in four countries will participate.
