  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      We propose to investigate structural and biochemical brain abnormalities in depressed
      subjects, and the relationship between the presence of such abnormalities and treatment
      outcome. We will recruit N=20 subjects with major depression disorder and N=20 matched normal
      controls. The depressed subjects would have previously not responded to an adequate trial
      with a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI). These depressed subjects will be
      treated for 4 weeks with the same SSRI antidepressant and with adjuvant triiodothyronine
      (T3). Structural magnetic resonance images (MRI) and then Phosphorus-31 magnetic resonance
      spectroscopic imaging (31P-MRSI) data will be obtained two times for each patient (at the
      beginning and at the end of the study) and one time for the normal controls. We will measure
      for each depressed subject the number of white matter hyperintensities (WMH); we will also
      measure the degree of change from baseline in several compounds characteristic for the
      cellular high-energy phosphate metabolism: the phosphocreatine/inorganic phosphate ratio and
      the beta-nucleoside triphosphate. We will compare the severity of WMH and the high-energy
      phosphate metabolism in two groups of depressed subjects (those responding and those not
      responding to thyroid hormone augmentation) and the normal controls.

      We hypothesize that:

        1. All depressed subjects, when compared with normal controls, will present lower baseline
           levels of compounds characteristic for the high-energy phosphate metabolism.

        2. Depressed subjects responding to T3 augmentation, when compared with subjects not
           responding to T3 augmentation, will present a larger increase of the high-energy
           phosphate metabolism.
