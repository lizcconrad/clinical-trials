      Determination of efficiency of nimotuzumab in children with diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Due to the poor prognosis of diffuse intrinsic pontine gliomas, the limited therapy options,
      the relevant portion of EGFR expression and the unexpected good response to the therapy with
      OSAG 101 in the phase II study, a phase III study was planned in newly diagnosed diffuse
      intrinsic pontine gliomas in children and adolescents. A phase II study in patients of
      recurrence/resistance high grade glioma in childhood or adolescence showed that, in
      particular, a part of the intrinsic pontine glioma response to the monotherapy with OSAG 101
      resulting in a reduction in the size of the tumour or stabilisation in the growth of the
      tumour. Together with clinical improvement, stabilisation lasted markedly over 6 months in
      two thirds of the patients. The current phase III study was scheduled to provide evidence of
      the effectiveness in the case of newly diagnosed intrinsic pontine glioma. In this study,
      OSAG 101 will be given concomitantly to the only standard therapy for this kind of tumour,
      i.e. the fractionated radiotherapy, to show effectiveness in the primary endpoint of median
      progression-free survival, the secondary endpoint of median overall survival and the side
      effect profile.

      Evidence from the median progression-free survival and the side effect profile of this
      combination met the expected results and one may consider that combination therapy of this
      therapeutic approach with other immunotherapeutic or antiangiogenic approaches and/or mild
      chemotherapy could lead to a better prognosis and quality of life for these patients.
