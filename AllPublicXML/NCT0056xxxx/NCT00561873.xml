      Determination of efficiency of nimotuzumab in children with high grade glioma.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      High grade malignant gliomas are tumors grade III and IV according to WHO classification,
      that originate from oligodendroglia and astrocytes, where the latter are also known as
      anaplastic astrocytoma(WHO grade III) and glioblastoma(WHO grade IV). This also includes
      intrinsic pontine gliomas of adolescents, which are usually not documented histologically due
      to their localisation, but they have a similar clinical progress when compared to high grade
      malignant astrocytic tumors. Among various molecular alterations, malignant gliomas
      overexpress EGFR (epidermal growth factor) in nearly 50% of cases, which is particularly
      pronounced in glioblastoma.(Schlegel 2003) Standard therapy consists of radical surgery as
      extensive as medically responsible followed by radiotherapy dose of 60 Gy, which is aimed at
      the area with a safety margin. The long-term efficacy of additional chemotherapy has been a
      subject for controversy for several decades. The combination of all three treatment
      modalities in grade III tumors can lead to median survival times of 3-5 years in adults.

      For this treatment group reports of 5 year recurrence free periods in 33-50% of cases have
      been reported in children and adolescents.

      For glioblastoma(WHO grade IV) 5year recurrence free periods are 3% in elderly patients and
      10-20% for adolescents.(Schlegel 2003) In German speaking territories chemotherapy with
      Cisplatin, Etoposid and Ifosfamid is used as a postoperative treatment option for adolescents
      and this disease.(Wolff HIT-GBM) In case of recurrence therapy choices are even more limited,
      thus if medically feasible the enrolment in clinical trials is an option.

      In this study the aim is to use an antibody directed against the EGF-receptor to effect the
      proliferation of the tumor cells negatively. Pilot studies conducted in adults indicate that
      the median survival time for patients with malignant glioma can be prolonged by the antibody
      treatment.
