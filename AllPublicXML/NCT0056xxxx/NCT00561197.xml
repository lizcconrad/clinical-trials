    <description>Patients will receive AT-101 starting at 10 mg once daily for 5 of 7 days in conjunction with RT (50.4 Gy for 28 fractions) for approximately 5.5 weeks. Concurrently, patients will receive docetaxel (20 mg/m2) IV weekly (Monday) and 5-fluorouracil (300 mg/m2) as a 24 hour continuous infusion for 5 of 7 days (Monday-Friday) of each RT week for approximately 5 weeks. Patients will continue for full 5.5 weeks unless unacceptable toxicity occurs.</description>

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Male or female patients age â‰¥18 years

          -  Histologically confirmed primary (non-recurrent) adenocarcinoma (AC) or squamous cell
             carcinoma of the esophagus or AC of the gastroesophageal (GE) junction.

          -  For Phase 1: Phase 1 patients must have unresectable disease (Stage II to IVa). A
             patient can be unresectable for medical reasons or technical reasons but eligible for
             chemoradiation.

          -  For Phase 2: Phase 2 patients must have resectable cancer defined as: T2, T3, N0; OR
             T1-3, N+

          -  Patients must have archived tumor tissue to correlate tumor biomarker expression with
             clinical response. Availability of tumor specimens in paraffin blocks or at least two
             unstained slides must be confirmed prior to study entry. Results will not be used to
             determine patient eligibility for the study.

          -  ECOG performance status 0-1

          -  Adequate hematologic function

          -  Adequate liver and renal function

          -  Ability to swallow and retain oral medication.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with distant metastasis, including M1b lymph node status. (M1b status allowed
             on Phase I only for patients appropriate for chemoradation). Lymph nodes suspicious of
             M1b status by diagnostic imaging must be verified by fine-needle aspiration cytology.
             (Phase 2 only)

          -  For Phase 2: Patients with positive pleural, pericardial, or peritoneal cytology.

          -  For Phase 2: Patients with carcinoma of the cervical esophagus.

          -  For Phase 2: Patients with clinical evidence of metastasis to cervical or
             supraclavicular lymph nodes.

          -  Prior chemotherapy or radiotherapy for esophageal or gastroesophageal junction cancer.
             Phase 1 patients with prior chemotherapy are permitted to enter.

          -  Prior radiotherapy that would overlap the anticipated study treatment fields or
             radiotherapy to &gt;30% of the marrow cavity (no prior chest irradiation).

          -  Patients with malabsorption syndrome, disease significantly affecting gastrointestinal
             function, or resection of the stomach or small bowel are excluded. Subjects with
             ulcerative colitis, inflammatory bowel disease, or partial or complete small bowel
             obstruction are also excluded.

          -  Pregnant or nursing females. Fertile patients (male and female) must use effective
             contraception.
