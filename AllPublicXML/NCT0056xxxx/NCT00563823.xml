      RATIONALE: Vatalanib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes
      needed for cell growth and by blocking blood flow to the tumor.

      PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well vatalanib works in treating patients with
      metastatic cutaneous melanoma that cannot be removed by surgery.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  To determine the response rate in patients with unresectable metastatic cutaneous
           melanoma treated with vatalanib.

      Secondary

        -  To determine the time to progression in these patients.

        -  To determine the 6-month and 1-year survival of these patients.

        -  To determine the overall survival of these patients.

        -  To determine the safety and toxicity of this drug in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive oral vatalanib twice daily on days 1-28. Courses repeat every 28 days in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study therapy, patients are followed at 8 weeks and then periodically
      thereafter.
