    <time_frame>0-2 hours</time_frame>
    <description>This outcome measures when the antipyretic effect begins by statistical analysis of WSTD2, which is the weighted sum of temperature differences from the subject's core temperature at each assessment time point through the first 2 hours compared with the subject's core temperature at T0, weighted by the time elapsed between each 2 consecutive time points. The subject's core temperature was measured using an ingestible temperature monitoring capsule and associated data recorder.</description>

          <description>mITT(modified intent to treat) population was used for age continuous baseline measure. mITT is defined as the all randomized subjects who received at least one full dose of oral or intravenous study medication without vomiting less than 2 hours after the oral study medication dose.
81 subjects were included in the mITT group with 36 subjects in the oral acetaminophen arm and 45 subjects in the IV acetaminophen arm.</description>

The subject's core temperature was measured using an ingestible temperature monitoring capsule and associated data recorder.</description>
