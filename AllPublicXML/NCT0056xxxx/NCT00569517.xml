    <textblock>
      The purpose of this pilot study is to assess patient accessibility, interest and response in
      order to design an adequately powered study to compare brief, group cognitive behavioral
      therapy (CBT) for weight loss to usual care in non-demented patients above the age of 18
      years old who are currently taking atypical antipsychotic medications. This pilot study is
      necessary, with current limitations of data in this area, to design an adequately powered
      study to address the difficulties managing metabolic syndrome risk factors in patients on
      antipsychotics.
