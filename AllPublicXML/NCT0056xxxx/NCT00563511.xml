  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this proposed RCT is to test (a) the effectiveness of smoking cessation
      intervention (counseling and NRT) among patients with ED; and (b) the effectiveness of
      adherence intervention (ADIN) to increase adherence to NRT use in order to increase quit
      rate.
