      PROTOCOL SUMMARY

      Type of Study: Pilot, randomized and single center trial Test Procedure: Omentectomy Aim 1.
      Determine the effect of omentectomy on 1) insulin sensitivity, 2) beta cell function and 3)
      plasma markers of inflammation We hypothesize that removal of omental fat increases insulin
      sensitivity and pancreatic sensitivity to glucose, and decreases systemic inflammation.

      Aim 2. Identify genes and proteins in adipocytes from obese patients that affect clinical
      presentation versus those that are affected by obesity for future study.

      We hypothesize that the genetic samples will help us to identify genes and proteins in
      adipocytes from obese patients that affect clinical presentation versus those that are
      affected by obesity and help us to design future obesity genetic studies.

      Total Enrollment Number: 30 patients who are scheduled to undergo bariatric surgery for
      weight loss at New York University Medical Center will be invited to participate in this
      study. Subjects will be randomly assigned, by using a computer-generated randomization
      scheme, in a single-blind fashion to either the omentectomy (n=15) or control group (n=15).
