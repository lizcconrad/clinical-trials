  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The current study combines a molecular genetic perspective, self report and brain imaging to
      the study of human sexuality in control subjects and individuals from a sexual disorder
      clinic. The investigators hypothesize that the variability in components of the brain
      dopaminergic system expressed in the mesolimbic reward system can explain variability in
      human sexuality, especially in desire and pleasure associated with sex.

      We intend to combine molecular genetics of the dopamine receptors (D2, D3 D4 and D5) and
      brain imaging using 11 C Raclopride in Positron Emission Tomography (PET). 11 C Raclopride is
      a ligand which binds to the dopamine receptor D2 and can measure dopamine release during
      pleasure or anticipatory reward associated with sex. The current proposal will measure
      changes in DRD2 receptor occupancy using 11 C Raclopride following explicit visual sexual
      desire cues in healthy control subjects and individuals who suffer from sexual dysfunction.
      This is in order to determine how individual genotypes modulate dopamine release in vivo in
      the human brain.
