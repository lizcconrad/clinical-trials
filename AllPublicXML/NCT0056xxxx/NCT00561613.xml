      This was a Phase I multi-center, randomized study in 40 healthy, sexually active women not at
      risk for pregnancy due to previous female sterilization. The male partners of the
      participants were consented to participate in the study. The clinician evaluating the
      cervical mucus for midcycle characteristics and presence of sperm was blinded as to gel used.
      The product tested was the SILCS diaphragm with Gynol II (spermicide) and the SILCS diaphragm
      with KY Jelly (lubricant). The sequence of diaphragm and gel use was determined by
      randomization. The study was conducted at two centers, Magee-Womens Hospital in Pittsburgh,
      Pennsylvania and CONRAD's Clinical Research Center at the Eastern Virginia Medical School in
      Norfolk, Virginia.

      The study consisted of a screening visit, a baseline cycle, and up to 2 cycles of post-coital
      tests (PCTs) for a total of 7 visits. The first PCT was a baseline PCT, performed without the
      use of any product, in order to demonstrate the subject's ability to produce receptive,
      midcycle cervical mucus. The partner's ability to produce motile sperm capable of penetrating
      the cervical mucus was evaluated in this cycle. Test PCTs were carried out during the second
      and third menstrual cycle using either the SILCS diaphragm with N-9 or the SILCS diaphragm
      with lubricant. Cycles were repeated depending on the characteristics of the cervical mucus
      and the number of sperm found in the vaginal pool and endocervical specimens; thus, some
      women may undergo more than three PCTs. An additional test cycle with a modified polymer
      spring device was performed in a subset of participants.

      Colposcopy was performed during the mucus check and post-coital test visits in all three
      cycles in order to document the baseline condition of the vagina and cervix pre- and
      post-intercourse and, in test cycles, to note the effect of product.

      Vaginal samples were taken from the posterior fornix of the vagina and the cervical os at
      each visit during the baseline and test cycles to measure for the presence of PSA.
