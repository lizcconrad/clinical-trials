      To determine if the rate of cytomegalovirus reactivation during treatment with alemtuzumab
      (Campath) is reduced by the use of valganciclovir prophylaxis.

      Researchers will study the effectiveness of valganciclovir to help prevent cytomegalovirus
      infections in patients receiving alemtuzumab. Since alemtuzumab eliminates T-cells, which are
      the body's usual defense against viruses, patients taking alemtuzumab have an increased risk
      of developing CMV.

      Before treatment, you will have a physical exam. You will also have around 3-4 tablespoons of
      blood drawn for routine tests and for tests to see if you have ever been exposed to CMV.

      You will be randomly assigned (as in the toss of a coin) to one of two treatment groups.
      Participants in one group will be given treatment with valganciclovir. Participants in the
      other group will be given treatment with valacyclovir. This drug protects against herpes
      infections but not CMV.

      If you are assigned to the group that will receive valganciclovir, you will take
      valganciclovir by mouth once a day starting of your first day of alemtuzumab therapy. You
      will continue to take valganciclovir for 2 months after the end of alemtuzumab therapy.

      If you are assigned to the group that will receive valacyclovir, you will take valacyclovir
      by mouth once a day starting of your first day of alemtuzumab therapy. You will continue to
      take valacyclovir for 2 months after the end of alemtuzumab therapy.

      Every 2 weeks while you are receiving alemtuzumab (usually 4-12 weeks)you will have a repeat
      blood test to look for CMV.

      Your participation in this study will last for a maximum of 5 months.

      This is an investigational study. Both valganciclovir and valacyclovir are FDA approved and
      commercially available. However, the use of valganciclovir for this study is experimental.
      valganciclovir will be provided free of charge during the study.
