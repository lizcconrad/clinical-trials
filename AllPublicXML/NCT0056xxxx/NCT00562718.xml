  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as capecitabine, work in different ways to stop
      the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing.
      Radiation therapy uses high energy x-rays to kill tumor cells. Capecitabine may also make
      tumor cells more sensitive to radiation therapy. Giving radiation together with capecitabine
      after surgery may kill any remaining tumor cells.

      PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying the side effects and how well giving capecitabine
      together with radiation therapy works in treating patients with nonmetastatic breast cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  To determine the safety and feasibility of concurrent capecitabine and standard
           external-beam irradiation in patients with high-risk early stage breast cancer.

      Secondary

        -  To determine the effects of concurrent treatment on cosmesis and wound healing at 1
           year.

        -  To determine the short-term (1-year) risk of recurrence of breast cancer in these
           patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients undergo external-beam radiotherapy once daily, 5 days a week and concurrently
      receive oral capecitabine twice daily, 5 days a week Monday through Friday, for approximately
      6-7 weeks.

      After completion of study therapy, patients are followed at approximately 1 week, 1 month, 6
      months, and 12 months.
