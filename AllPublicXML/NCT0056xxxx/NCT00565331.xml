  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Our standard immunosuppressive treatment after renal transplantation is a combination of
      tacrolimus, mycophenolate mofetil, and prednisolone. With this regimen the incidence of acute
      rejection within the first six months after transplantation has dropped to about 20%. The
      main challenge at present remains to improve long-term outcome by preventing chronic
      allograft nephropathy (CAN). Since acute rejection is a strong predictor of CAN, a further
      decrease in the incidence of acute rejection can improve the long-term graft survival.
      Current strategies to prevent rejection are mainly directed at alloreactive T cells.
      Recently, the attention for the role of antibodies in the pathogenesis of acute rejection has
      increased. In addition, anti-B cell therapy was shown to be effective in diseases that were
      considered to be mainly T cell driven, like rheumatoid arthritis. In the latter case it has
      been suggested that anti-B cell antibodies may impair the antigen presenting function of B
      cells. We therefore decided to investigate the effectiveness and safety of the anti-B cell
      monoclonal antibody rituximab for prophylaxis of acute rejection after renal transplantation.

      Study design: Double-blind, placebo controlled intervention study. One group receives a
      single dose of rituximab of 375 mg/m2 intravenously at the time of transplantation, and the
      other group receives a placebo infusion.

      Primary Objective:

      To determine the incidence and severity of biopsy-confirmed acute rejection within the first
      six months after transplantation.

      Secondary Outcomes:

        -  Renal function as estimated by the endogenous creatinine clearance at 6 months

        -  Occurrence of chronic allograft nephropathy at 6 months

        -  Cumulative incidence of infections and malignancies at 6 months

        -  Medical costs during the first 6 months after transplantation

        -  Patient and graft survival
