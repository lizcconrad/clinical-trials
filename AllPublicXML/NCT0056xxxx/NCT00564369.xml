  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Advocacy groups have voiced concerns about the ethics of some of tenets of the CDC's new HIV
      testing recommendations for the healthcare setting. Three concerns are paramount: (1) the
      opt-out approach to HIV testing can potentially be coercive and not truly voluntary; (2) by
      replacing informed consent with general consent for medical care, test participants might not
      know or be adequately informed of the benefits and consequences of testing; and (3)
      eliminating HIV prevention counseling from the HIV testing process presumes that test
      participants are aware of how to prevent an HIV infection, which might not be correct. This
      study involves conducting interviews of HIV advocates who are raising these concerns,
      surveying outpatient and emergency department clinical providers about their beliefs and
      opinions regarding the tenets of the new guidelines, and then conducting a multi-center,
      randomized, controlled trial in which the ethical concerns of opt-out vs. opt-in testing are
      directly compared. We will conduct a multi-center, randomized, controlled, trial whereby
      patients will be surveyed on their perspectives and perceptions regarding opt-out or opt-in
      rapid HIV testing. We will survey the participants regarding their perception of coercion,
      their understanding of the elements contained in the informed consent process, their HIV risk
      factors, and their knowledge of HIV prevention. We will evaluate whether or not the
      CDC-recommended approaches regarding opt-out testing, consent, and decoupling of prevention
      counseling are supported. If there are no differences regarding these ethical concerns
      between testing approaches, then the opt-out approach would be considered not to be inferior
      to the opt-in approach.
