      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as cisplatin and paclitaxel, work in different
      ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from
      dividing. Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to kill tumor cells. Giving combination
      chemotherapy together with radiation therapy before surgery may make the tumor smaller and
      reduce the amount of normal tissue that needs to be removed. Giving these treatments after
      surgery may kill any tumor cells that remain after surgery.

      PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well giving cisplatin and paclitaxel together
      with radiation therapy and surgery works in treating patients with advanced cancer of the
      oral cavity, oropharynx, or hypopharynx that can be removed by surgery.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Determine the feasibility of a new intensification regimen comprising cisplatin and
           paclitaxel in combination with radiotherapy and surgery in patients with resectable
           advanced squamous cell carcinoma of the oral cavity, oropharynx, or hypopharynx.

      Secondary

        -  Assess the disease-free interval and failure sites in patients treated with this
           regimen.

        -  Correlate molecular markers with treatment outcome in these patients.

        -  Correlate quality of life with treatment outcome in these patients.

        -  Determine the frequency and severity of toxicities of this regimen in these patients.

        -  Evaluate treatment completion in these patients.

      OUTLINE:

        -  Preoperative therapy (weeks 1 and 2): Patients receive cisplatin IV over 2 hours on days
           1-3. Patients also undergo intensity-modulated external beam radiotherapy once daily on
           days 1-5 and 8-12.

        -  Surgery (week 3): Patients undergo surgical resection of the primary tumor (with or
           without neck dissection) and intraoperative boost radiotherapy.

        -  Postoperative therapy (weeks 7-10): Patients receive cisplatin IV over 2 hours on days
           1-3 and 22-24 and paclitaxel IV over 3 hours on days 1, 8, 15, and 22. Patients also
           undergo intensity-modulated external beam radiotherapy on days 1-5, 8-12, 15-19, and
           22-26.

      Patients undergo blood and tissue sample collection at baseline, in weeks 3, 7-10, and 14,
      and then periodically thereafter for biomarker correlative studies.

      Quality of life is assessed at baseline, at 3, 6, and 12 months after completion of
      treatment, and then annually thereafter.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 2 months for 1 year and then
      periodically thereafter.
