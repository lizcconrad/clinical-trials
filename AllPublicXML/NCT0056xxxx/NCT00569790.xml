    <description>S-1 is administered orally on days 1 to 14 of a 28-day cycle. Patients are assigned on the basis of body surface area (BSA) to receive one of the following oral doses twice daily: 40 mg (BSA &lt;1.25m2), 50 mg (BSA &gt;1.25 to &lt;1.50 m2), or 60 mg (BSA &gt;1.50 m2).
Irinotecan 100 mg/m2 is administered by intravenous infusion on days 1 and 15. Bevacizumab 5 mg/kg (body weight)is administered by intravenous infusion on days 1 and 15.</description>

             Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST)

          3. Patients with no previous treatment (radiotherapy or chemotherapy). Patients who have
             received postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy are eligible if relapse is diagnosed more
             than 180 days after the end of such treatment.

          5. Life expectancy of at least 3 months

          6. ECOG PS of 0 or 1

          7. Adequate function of major organs as defined below:

               1. Hemoglobin ≥9.0g/dL

               3. Neutrophil count ≥1,500/mm3

               4. Platelet count ≥100,000/mm3

               5. Total bilirubin ≤1.5 mg/dL

               7. Serum creatinine ≤1.2 mg/dL

               8. Creatinine clearance estimate by the Cockcroft-Gault method &gt;50 mL/min (reduce
                  initial dosage by one step if ≥50 but &lt;80 mL/min)

          8. Able to take capsules orally.

          9. No electrocardiographic abnormalities within 28 days before enrollment that would
             clinically preclude the execution of the study, as judged by the investigator.

         10. Voluntary written informed consent.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Serious drug hypersensitivity or a history of drug allergy

             failure, renal failure, hepatic failure, or poorly controlled diabetes)

          7. Moderate or severe ascites or pleural effusion requiring treatment

          8. Watery diarrhea

          9. Treatment with flucytosine or atazanavir sulfate
