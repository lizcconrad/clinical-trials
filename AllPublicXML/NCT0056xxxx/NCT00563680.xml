      Single-arm, open-label study of AMG 479 in up to 35 subjects with Ewing's Family Tumors
      (EFTs) and Desmoplastic Small Round Cell Tumors (DSRCTs) who have progressed or recurred
      after at least one prior chemotherapy regimen. An exploratory cohort of an additional up to
      10 subjects with prior exposure to anti-IGF-1R therapy and who have progressed or recurred
      after at least one prior chemotherapy regimen will also be assessed.

    <description>AMG 479 is a fully human monoclonal antibody (IgG1) against the insulin-like growth factor receptor-1 (IGF-1R). IGF-1R signaling has been shown to play a critical role in the survival of cancer cells. AMG 479 inhibits the binding of both IGF-1 and IGF-2 to IGF-1R, thus inhibiting ligand‑dependent receptor activation. Inhibition of IGF-1R signaling with AMG 479 provides a potential mechanism for inhibiting tumor growth and survival.</description>
