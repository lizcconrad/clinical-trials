      Patients will receive Corlux (mifepristone) daily for up to 24 weeks. Assessments of the
      signs and symptoms of Cushing's syndrome will be obtained.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cushing's syndrome is a relatively rare disorder caused by prolonged exposure to high levels
      of the glucocorticoid hormone cortisol. Cushing's syndrome may result from elevated
      endogenous or exogenous sources of cortisol. Endogenous Cushing's syndrome resulting from
      cortisol overproduction by the adrenal glands is the subject of this protocol. Patients with
      exogenous Cushing's syndrome, which develops as a side effect of chronic administration of
      high doses of glucocorticoids, are not eligible for enrollment in this study.

      This will evaluate the safety and efficacy of mifepristone for treatment of the signs and
      symptoms of hypercortisolemia in patients with endogenous Cushing's syndrome from
      ACTH-dependent or adrenal disorders.

      The study will enroll subjects for whom the investigator has determined that medical
      treatment of endogenous hypercortisolemia is needed. Medical treatment may be intended to
      treat the effects of persistent or recurrent hypercortisolemia after surgery and/or radiation
      for Cushing's syndrome, to bridge the period of time for radiation to become effective, or
      when surgery is not feasible.

    <description>Patients take mifepristone by mouth once a day. The dose is increased during scheduled timepoints during the study or until symptoms improve or the highest dosage allowed is reached. Dose escalation will be based upon weight. During clinic visits, blood pressure, glucose tolerance and blood chemistries are measured and EKG and urinalysis will be performed.</description>

                  pituitary, or is not treatable with surgery, or exists in patients who are not
                  candidates for surgery, and is confirmed by documentation of ACTH
                  immuno-reactivity on a pathological evaluation of pituitary tissue from a
                  previous surgical specimen or IPSS with a central-to-peripheral gradient (ratio)
