  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Blood and marrow stem cell transplant has improved the outcome for patients with high-risk
      hematologic malignancies. However, most patients do not have an appropriate HLA (immune type)
      matched sibling donor available and/or are unable to identify an acceptable unrelated HLA
      matched donor through the registries in a timely manner. Another option is haploidentical
      transplant using a partially matched family member donor.

      Although haploidentical transplant has proven curative in many patients, this procedure has
      been hindered by significant complications, primarily regimen-related toxicity including GVHD
      and infection due to delayed immune reconstitution. These can, in part, be due to certain
      white blood cells in the graft called T cells. GVHD happens when the donor T cells recognize
      the body tissues of the patient (the host) are different and attack these cells. Although too
      many T cells increase the possibility of GVHD, too few may cause the recipient's immune
      system to reconstitute slowly or the graft to fail to grow, leaving the patient at high-risk
      for significant infection.

      For these reasons, a primary focus for researchers is to engineer the graft to provide a T
      cell dose that will reduce the risk for GVHD, yet provide a sufficient number of cells to
      facilitate immune reconstitution and graft integrity. Building on prior institutional trials,
      this study will provide patients with a haploidentical (HAPLO) graft engineered to specific T
      cell target values using the CliniMACS system. A reduced intensity, preparative regimen will
      be used in an effort to reduce regimen-related toxicity and mortality.

      The primary aim of the study is to help improve overall survival with haploidentical stem
      cell transplant in this high risk patient population by 1) limiting the complication of graft
      versus host disease (GVHD), 2) enhancing post-transplant immune reconstitution, and 3)
      reducing non-relapse mortality.

      This study will explore the following objectives:

        1. To assess if the event-free survival at one-year post-transplant for research
           participants with high-risk hematologic malignancies can be improved following HAPLO
           hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) using a graft depleted of CD3+ cells ex vivo
           and a reduced intensity-conditioning regimen.

      Secondary objectives:

        1. To estimate the one-year overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) for
           research participants who receive this study treatment.

        2. To estimate the cumulative incidence of relapse for research participants who receive
           this study treatment.

        3. To estimate the rate of overall grade III-IV acute GVHD, and the rate and severity of
           chronic GVHD in research participants.

        4. To estimate the incidence of non-hematologic regimen-related toxicity and
           regimen-related mortality in the first 100 days post-transplant.

      Exploratory objectives:

        1. To explore the biologic significance of soluble interleukin-2 receptor and immunologic
           state [quantitative lymphocyte studies, V beta spectratyping, T-cell receptor excision
           circles (TREC) assay] to predict the development of acute and chronic GVHD in these
           research participants.

        2. To measure the pharmacokinetics of Campath-1H in pediatric HAPLO HSCT recipients

      NOTE: This protocol originally used muromonab (OKT3) in the conditioning regimen to prepare
      participants for haploidentical HCT. After muromonab became unavailable from the manufacturer
      in 2010, muromonab was replaced by alemtuzumab (Campath-1H) for use in subsequent
      participants.
