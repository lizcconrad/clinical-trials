      RESTORE SR II is a feasibility study on the minimally invasive use of the AtriCure Bipolar
      System for PV Isolation on a beating heart for the treatment of all types of atrial
      fibrillation in a sole therapy operation (not concomitant to another cardiac operation).

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Male or female patient between 18 and 80 years of age

          2. Patient with symptomatic AF and failure or intolerance of one or more Class I or Class
             III AADs and:

               -  Who describes 3 or more symptomatic AF episodes during the 6 month period prior
                  to enrollment, with at least 1 electrocardiographically documented episode of AF
                  in the 4 months prior to enrollment or,

               -  Who has documented AF within the 6 months proceeding enrollment that did not
                  terminate spontaneously (including patients in continuous AF) or,

               -  Who is unwilling or unable to take anticoagulants, with 3 or more symptomatic
                  episodes during the 6 month period prior to enrollment with at least 1
                  electrocardiographically documented episode of AF in the 4 months prior to
                  enrollment.

          3. Left Atrial Size &lt; 6 cm (determined by echocardiography performed within 60 days of
             enrollment), unless the LV dysfunction is thought to result (at least in part) from AF

          4. Left Ventricular Ejection Fraction â‰¥ 30% (determined by echocardiography performed
             within 60 days of enrollment)

          5. Patient is willing and able to provide written informed consent.

          6. Patient has a life expectancy of at least 2 years.

          7. Patient is willing and able to attend the scheduled follow-up visits.

          8. Weight &lt; 325 lbs

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Prior cardiac catheter ablation for the treatment of arrhythmia within 4 months

          2. Prior cardiac surgery

          3. Patients requiring any open heart procedure (e.g. CABG, valve replacement or repair,
             atrial septal defect repair, etc.)

          4. Class IV NYHA heart failure symptoms, unless these symptoms are considered to be due
             to uncontrolled AF

          5. Cerebrovascular accident within previous 6 months

          6. Known carotid artery stenosis greater than 80%

          7. Evidence of significant active infection

          8. Patient unable to undergo TEE

          9. Pregnant woman

         10. Requires anti-arrhythmic drug therapy for the treatment of ventricular arrhythmia

         11. Presence of thrombus in the left atrium

         12. Patient has co-morbid condition that in the opinion of the investigator poses undue
             risk of general anesthesia or port access cardiac surgery

         13. Patient is enrolled in another investigational study
