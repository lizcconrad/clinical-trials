      This was a single-center, randomized, double-masked, placebo-controlled, parallel-group,
      4-visit, CAE (Controlled Adverse Environment) study lasting approximately 4 weeks. Subjects
      were randomized to receive loteprednol etabonate ophthalmic suspension, 0.5% or placebo
      (vehicle of loteprednol etabonate ophthalmic suspension, 0.5%) and instructed to dose
      bilaterally either TID or QID according to randomization.

             glaucoma) or over-the-counter (OTC) solutions, artificial tears, gels or scrubs and
             could not discontinue these medications for the duration of the study

          -  presently taking any medication known to cause ocular drying that had not been a
             stable dose for at least 30 days

          -  currently taking oral antihistamines that could not be discontinued during the study

          -  a systemic disease, uncontrolled medical condition that in the opinion of the
             investigator could interfere with study measurements or subject compliance

          -  received another experimental drug or device within 30 days prior to screening
