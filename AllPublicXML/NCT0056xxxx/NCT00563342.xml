  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of the study is to examine the risk of catheter dysfunction during the
      dialysis session that follows the instillation of ethanol 60% as lock solution in tunneled
      silicone catheters of end stage renal failure patients treated by hemodialysis.

      The catheters dysfunction rate is the primary outcome. The dysfunction is defined as partial
      or complete occlusion or infection associated with dialysis catheter.

      As a secondary outcome, the dialysis quality is also examined (urea reduction rate, total
      ultrafiltration)
