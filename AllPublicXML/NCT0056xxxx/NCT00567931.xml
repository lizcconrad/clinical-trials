    <textblock>
      This phase I trial is studying the side effects and best dose of 1-methyl-D-tryptophan in
      treating patients with metastatic or refractory solid tumors that cannot be removed by
      surgery. Biological therapies, such as 1-methyl-D-tryptophan, may stop the growth of tumor
      cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth and by stimulating the immune
      system.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the toxicity, safety, and pharmacokinetics of escalating doses of
      1-methyl-d-tryptophan (1-MT), a competitive inhibitor of the enzyme indoleamine 2,
      3-dioxygenase (IDO), in patients with advanced malignancies.

      II. To establish a maximally tolerated dose (MTD) or maximally biological effective dose
      (MBED) of 1-MT for future phase II and III trials.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the ratio of kynurenine to tryptophan in patient blood samples as a means of
      assessing the effect of 1MT on in vivo IDO activity.

      II. To ascertain the ability of 1-MT to decrease the number of T-regulatory cells thereby
      allowing the immune system to target tumor antigens more effectively.

      III. To analyze the IDO expression of different tumor types through IDO immunohistochemical
      staining of paraffin-preserved specimens.

      IV. To perform high performance liquid chromatography on patient urine samples to assess how
      1-MT is cleared renally.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study.

      Patients receive oral 1-methyl-d-tryptophan (1-MT) once or twice daily on days 1-28.
      Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 12 courses in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      Blood and urine samples are assessed to characterize the pharmacokinetics of 1-MT and renal
      clearance rate by high performance liquid chromatography, measure tryptophan and kynurenine
      levels by functional assays, and measure the response of regulatory CD4+ CD25+ T cells by
      intracellular staining and flow cytometry. Paraffin-embedded tissue samples are analyzed for
      indoleamine 2, 3-dioxygenase (IDO) expression by immunohistochemical staining.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 4 weeks.
