    <textblock>
      This is a study involving a 12 week treatment phase. During the treatment phase subjects
      receive Flutiform® or Flixotiole® and Foradil® as individual componements. Efficacy will be
      assessed by lung function tests and asthma symptoms, sleep disturbance. Safety will be
      assessed by adverse events, vital signs, lab tests and ECGs.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion criteria:

          1. Male or female subjects at least 12 years or older (females less than one year
             post-menopausal must have a negative serum or urine pregnancy test recorded at the
             screening visit prior to the first dose of study medication, be non-lactating, and
             willing to use adequate and highly effective methods of contraception throughout the
             study if they are sexually active. A highly effective method of birth control is
             defined as those which result in a low failure rate (i.e. less than 1% per year) when
             used consistently and correctly such as sterilization, implants, injectables, combined
             oral contraceptives, some IUDs (Intrauterine Device, hormonal), sexual abstinence or
             vasectomised partner).

          2. Known history of mild to moderate-severe persistent, reversible asthma for ≥ 6 months
             prior to the screening visit.

          3. Demonstrate a FEV1 of ≥40% to ≤85% for predicted normal values (Quanjer et al, 19931)
             during the screening phase following appropriate withholding of asthma medications (if
             applicable).

               -  No β2-agonist use on day of screening.

               -  No use of inhaled combination asthma therapy on day of screening.

               -  Inhaled corticosteroids are allowed on day of screening.

          4. Documented reversibility of ≥15% in FEV1 in the screening phase.

          5. Demonstrate satisfactory technique in the use of the study medications.

          6. Willing and able to enter information in the diary and attend all study visits.

          7. Willing and able to substitute study medication for their pre study prescribed asthma
             medication for the duration of the study.

          8. Written informed consent obtained

        Exclusion criteria:

          1. Near fatal or life-threatening (including intubation) asthma within the past year.

          2. Hospitalization or an emergency visit for asthma within the past year.

          3. History of systemic (oral or parenteral) corticosteroid medication within 1 month
             before the Screening Visit.

          4. History of omalizumab use within the past 6 months.

          5. History of leukotriene receptor antagonist use, e.g. montelukast, or theophylline
             within the past week.

          6. Current evidence or history of any clinically significant disease or abnormality
             including uncontrolled coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure, myocardial
             infarction, or cardiac dysrhythmia. 'Clinically significant' is defined as any disease
             that, in the opinion of the Investigator, would put the patient at risk through study
             participation, or which would affect the outcome of the study.

          7. In the investigators opinion a clinically significant upper or lower respiratory
             infection within 4 weeks prior to the Screening Visit.

          8. Significant, non-reversible, active pulmonary disease (e.g., chronic obstructive
             pulmonary disease (COPD), cystic fibrosis, bronchiectasis, tuberculosis).

          9. Known Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV)-positive status.

         10. A smoking history equivalent to &quot;10 pack years&quot; (i.e., at least 1 pack of 20
             cigarettes /day for 10 years or 10 packs/day for 1 year, etc.).

         11. Current smoking history within 12 months prior to the Screening Visit.

         12. Current evidence or history of alcohol and/or substance abuse within 12 months prior
             to the Screening Visit.

         13. Subjects who have taken B-blocking agents, tricyclic antidepressants, monoamine
             oxidase inhibitors, astemizole (Hismanal), quinidine type antiarrhythmics, or potent
             CYP 3A4 inhibitors such as ketoconazole within the past week.

         14. Current use of medications that will have an effect on bronchospasm and/or pulmonary
             function.

         15. Current evidence or history of hypersensitivity or idiosyncratic reaction to test
             medications or components.

         16. Receipt of an investigational drug within 30 days of the Screening Visit (12 weeks if
             an oral or injectable steroid).

         17. Current participation in a clinical study
