    <textblock>
      Primary objective:

      Immunogenicity To demonstrate that a second dose of ZOSTAVAX® elicits higher varicella-zoster
      virus (VZV) antibody titres than a first dose of ZOSTAVAX® whether given as a 0-1 month
      schedule or as a 0-3 month schedule in subjects ≥70 years of age as measured at 4 weeks
      post-vaccination

      Secondary objectives Immunogenicity

        -  To summarise the VZV antibody titres at 4 weeks post-vaccination after a 1-dose regimen
           and 4 weeks post-vaccination after each dose of each 2-doses regimen of ZOSTAVAX®.

        -  To compare the VZV antibody titres at 12 months after completion of a 1-dose regimen
           with the VZV antibody titres at 12 months after completion of each 2-doses regimen of
           ZOSTAVAX®

        -  To summarise the VZV antibody titres at 24 and 36 months after completion of a 1-dose
           regimen and at 24 and 36 months after completion of each 2-doses regimen of ZOSTAVAX®
