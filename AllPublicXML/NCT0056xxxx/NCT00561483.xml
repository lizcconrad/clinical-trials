      Renal Compromise after treatment of decompensated heart failure with diuretics is not
      uncommon. The purpose of our study is to investigate the relationship between cystatin C and
      worsening renal function in this setting. Cystatin C is a biomarker produced at a constant
      rate by all cells that is a sensitive biomarker of renal function.Cystatin C and Plasma amino
      terminal proB-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) levels will be obtained at baseline and
      daily. Our goal is to enroll 100 subjects with an estimated 5 samples per each subject. The
      time course of changes in cystatin C in relation to serum creatinine levels over time will be
      plotted.

      Our hypothesis is that sequential changes in cystatin C levels following initial treatment
      with diuretic therapy in the setting of acute decompensated heart failure may provide early
      insight into cardio-renal compromise. Understanding the natural history and time course of
      the changes in sequential cystatin C levels may facilitate further studies to guide the
      judicious use of diuretic therapy in acute decompensated heart failure, and to predict the
      risk of subsequent development of worsening renal function. If serial testing of cystatin C
      can provide accurate assessment and prediction of worsening renal function, clinical
      applications of these observations can be evaluated in future prospective studies.

      This is a single-center, prospective, cohort study. The design of this pilot study focuses on
      the feasibility to complete the project in a short period of time by the applicant. Subjects
      will be identified in the morning after their hospital admission and informed consent will be
      obtained for the study. At the time of enrollment blood samples and urine samples will be
      collected as baseline, together with a brief history and physical examination to document
      degree of congestion and basic vital signs. In addition their unused (to be discarded) blood
      samples from previous clinical labs from this admission may be retrieved from the clinical
      laboratory.

      Patients will be followed daily, and each day a blood draw and urine sample will be obtained
      for research purposes until the day of discharge. Changes in vital signs, available
      laboratory data for serum creatinine and BUN, and congestion score will be documented.
      Physicians treating the patient will be blinded from the laboratory results. Because of the
      small sample size and the low anticipated rate of adverse events, this study uses a combined
      outcome of either death in hospital, death within 90 days after discharge or readmission to
      the hospital facility for heart failure within 90 days. Patients will be called after 90 days
      for follow up if readmission or death information is not available in the Electronic Medical
      Record.

      Specific aims include:

      Specific Aim 1 - To examine the natural history of changes in sequential cystatin C levels
      during diuretic therapy in Acute Decompensated Heart Failure.

      Specific Aim 2 - To determine the predictive value of changes in sequential cystatin C levels
      to subsequent development of worsening renal function (WRF) and WRF in association with
      aminoterminal pro B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) levels.
