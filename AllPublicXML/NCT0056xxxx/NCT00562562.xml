  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a pilot project intended to determine the feasibility of detecting soft tissue
      changes in response to osteopathic manipulative treatment (OMT). MRIs of the lumbar and
      pelvic regions of low back pain (LBP) patients will be taken once before and at two different
      time points after OMT. Images obtained will be quantitatively analyzed for changes in the
      volumes of back muscles and for changes (T2 signals) indicative of activity levels or
      pathological conditions. Electromyography (EMG) will be used as an independent measure of
      back muscle activity for comparison with MRI results.
