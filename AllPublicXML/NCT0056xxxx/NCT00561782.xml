  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to compare the changes that occur in sensation and chemical
      properties of the brain following SCI between individuals that experience chronic pain and
      those that do not, and between those with SCI and the able-bodied.

      This study investigates the differences in certain neurochemicals present in areas of the
      brain linked to pain processing in people with SCI and neuropathic pain, in people with SCI
      but no pain, and in able-bodied persons. We will also investigate the relationship between
      these concentrations of neurochemicals and different aspects of chronic neuropathic pain,
      including the intensity of pain, quality of life issues, sensitivity changes in areas of the
      body that are both painful and non-painful, and neurological status.

        Both spinal cord injured (85) and able-bodied (25) subjects will be studied. Of those with
        spinal cord injury, 60 will be those who experience central neuropathic pain and 25 will
        not. An additional 25 people who screen positive for mild to moderate TBI symptoms and pain
        attributable to TBI will be studied.
