  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Motilin is a peptide whose action is controlled by motilin receptors located in the gut.
      Action of Motilin at motilin receptors increases the gastric emptying rate (rate of emptying
      of food and fluid from the stomach). Compounds which stimulate motilin receptors therefore
      provide a potential approach to the treatment of a range of clinical conditions where delayed
      gastric emptying may contribute to symptoms, such as enteral feeding intolerance
      (post-operative or intensive care patients), gastroparesis, diabetic gastroparesis, and
      functional dyspepsia.

      This study is the First Time In Human study for the motilin receptor agonist, GSK962040.

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Healthy male or female subjects aged between 18 and 55 years inclusive. Healthy
             subjects are defined as individuals who are free from clinically significant illness
             or disease as determined by their medical history (including family), physical
             examination, laboratory studies, and other tests.

        A female subject may be enrolled in the study regardless of whether she is currently of
        non-childbearing potential or of childbearing potential, as long as the following
        conditions are observed:

        - Females of non-childbearing potential: These are defined as females, regardless of their
        age, with functioning ovaries and who have a current documented tubal ligation [Hatcher,
        2004] or hysterectomy, or females who are post-menopausal.

        - Females of childbearing potential: These are defined as females, regardless of their age,
        with functioning ovaries and no documented impairment of oviductal or uterine function that
        would cause sterility. This category includes females with oligomenorrhea and females who
        are perimenopausal.

        To be eligible for the study, the female of childbearing potential

          -  must have a negative pregnancy test at screening before enrolment into the study; and

          -  must agree to use one of the highly effective methods for avoiding pregnancy in the
             protocol, from the Screening Visit throughout the duration of the study up to and
             including the follow-up clinic visit, which is anticipated to take place 7-10 days
             after the last dose of study medication (however the timing of the follow-up visit may
             be adjusted by File Note if it is indicated from the interim PK analyses). At this
             stage of development, there is no information on the potential pharmacokinetic
             interaction between GSK962040 and hormonal birth control methods, so the hormonal
             methods will not be acceptable.

               -  A 12-lead ECG at pre-study screening, which in the opinion of the Principal
                  Investigator or physician designee has no abnormalities that will compromise
                  safety in this study. QT/QTc criteria are defined in the protocol.

               -  A 24h Holter ECG at pre-study screening which in the opinion of the Principal
                  Investigator or physician designee has no abnormalities that will compromise
                  safety in this study.

               -  Normal physical examination (physical exam demonstrates no evidence of clinically
                  active disease or physical or mental impairment).

               -  No abnormality on relevant clinical chemistry or haematology examination at the
                  pre-study medical examination.

               -  Body weight â‰¥50 kg and BMI within the range 18.5-29.9 kg/m2 inclusive where BMI =
                  Weight in kg (height in meters)2

               -  The volunteer is able to understand and comply with protocol requirements,
                  instructions and protocol-stated restrictions.

               -  Signed and dated written informed consent prior to the performance of any study
                  related procedure.

               -  Subjects will have negative Helicobacter pylori status or have received
                  eradication within the last calendar year.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Use of any hormonal method of contraception or any form of HRT (female subjects only).

          -  History or presence of any clinically significant metabolic, gastrointestinal or
             endocrinological condition.

          -  History or presence of clinically significant gastro-intestinal, hepatic or renal
             disease or other condition known to interfere with the absorption, distribution,
             metabolism or excretion of drugs.

          -  History of major gastrointestinal surgical procedure within the last 10 years.

          -  History of cholecystectomy or biliary tract disease.

          -  History of immediate or delayed hypersensitivity reaction or idiosyncrasy to any drug,
             or other allergy that, in the opinion of the Principal Investigator or physician
             designee, contraindicates the subject's participation in the study. Additionally
             subjects with a known latex allergy should not be enrolled in C3.

          -  History or presence of corrected thyroid dysfunction (NOTE: subjects with
             hypothyroidism on a stable dose of thyroid replacement therapy are not eligible).

          -  Abnormal TSH or free T4 at screening/baseline.

          -  Unwillingness to commit to avoid excessive exposure to sunlight (or exposure whilst on
             a tanning bed) which would cause a sunburn reaction from Day -1 up to and including

             use (as determined by the Investigator) of tobacco or nicotine-containing products,
             including nicotine patches/gum, during the course of the study.

          -  Consumption of grapefruit juice or grapefruit within 7 days prior to the first dose of
             study medication until the follow-up visit.

          -  Use of prescription or non-prescription drugs, including vitamins, herbal and dietary
             supplements (including St John's Wort) within 3 weeks prior to the first dose of study
             medication until final evaluation, unless in the opinion of the Investigator and
             sponsor the medication will not interfere with the study procedures or compromise
             subject safety.

          -  Has received an investigational drug or has participated in any other research trial
             within 30 days or 5 half-lives, or twice the duration of the biological effect of any

          -  Exposure to more than four new chemical entities within 12 months prior to the first
             dosing day.

          -  Where participation in study would result in donation of blood in excess of 500 ml
             within a 56 day period.

          -  For male volunteers: An unwillingness of the male subject to use a condom/spermicide
             in addition to having their female partner use another form of contraception such as
             an IUD, diaphragm with spermicide, oral contraceptives, injectable progesterone,
             subdermal implants or a tubal ligation if the woman could become pregnant from the
             time of the first dose of study medication until 90 days following administration of
             the last dose of study medication.
