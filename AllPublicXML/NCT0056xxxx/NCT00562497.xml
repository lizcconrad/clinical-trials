  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase III, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study to investigate the
      efficacy and safety of Prochymal™ versus placebo in combination with corticosteroids as
      initial therapy for acute GVHD. Corticosteroids have been the primary therapy for patients
      with previously untreated acute GVHD and the historical published data define an expected 35%
      complete response (CR) at Day +28 using this therapy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Subjects will be treated with a total of 6 infusions of investigational agent during the
      first 4 weeks of the study. Four infusions will be administered during the first two weeks
      (twice weekly), then two infusions administered during the next two weeks (once weekly).
      Subjects assigned to the active treatment group will receive Prochymal™. Subjects assigned to
      the non active treatment group will receive placebo (excipient, less cells). It is
      recommended that all subjects receive all six infusions. The discontinuation of
      investigational agent is allowed for GVHD worsening with subsequent need for salvage therapy.
      All infusions must be given at least 3 days apart.

      Subjects will be evaluated for efficacy and safety until death, withdrawal or 90 study days
      after randomization, whichever occurs first. Study will be unblinded and data analyzed at Day
      90 post 1st infusion (Day 0)following final subject enrollment. Subjects will be followed for
      safety for 12 months post 1st infusion (Day 0).

             is strongly recommended but not required. Randomization should not be delayed awaiting
             biopsy or pathology results.

          -  Subjects must be randomized and treated with corticosteroid (1-2 mg/kg/d
             methylprednisolone, or equivalent) and Prochymal™/placebo within 72 hours of onset of
             acute GVHD.

          -  Subjects must have adequate renal function as defined by: Calculated Creatinine
             Clearance of &gt;30mL/min using the Cockroft-Gault equation

          -  Subjects who are women of childbearing potential, must be non-pregnant, not

             including uncontrolled infection, heart failure, pulmonary hypertension, etc.

          -  Subjects may not receive any other investigational agents (not approved by the FDA for
             any indication) concurrently during study participation or within 30 days of
             randomization.

          -  Subject has a known allergy to bovine or porcine products or DMSO

          -  Subject has received a transplant for a solid tumor disease.
