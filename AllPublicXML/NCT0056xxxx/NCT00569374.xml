    <textblock>
      This 7 week, open-label pilot clinical trial will examine the safety and tolerability of
      modafinil up to 400mg/day as a potential treatment to reduce methamphetamine use in
      methamphetamine-dependent volunteers.

    <measure>&quot;Modafinil Side Effects Checklist&quot;</measure>
    <time_frame>Weekly for 7 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Modafinil side effects were measured weekly by means of the Modafinil Side Effects Checklist which asked participants to rate their experience of the following potential side effects: headaches, nausea, nervousness, runny nose, diarrhea, back pain, anxiety, insomnia, dizziness and upset stomach. Participants rated their experience on a 4 point scale ranging from &quot;not at all&quot; (0) to &quot;very much (4). The score was determined by units on a scale.</description>

    <measure>Anxiety as Measured by the Hamilton Anxiety Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Thrice weekly for 7 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Participants were administered the Hamilton Anxiety Scale thrice weekly throughout the study. The scale is a 14 item questionaire with scores ranging from 0 to 56.</description>

    <measure>Depression as Measured by the Hamilton Depression Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Thrice weekly for 7 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Participants were administered the Hamilton Depression Scale thrice weekly throughout the study. The scale is a 21 item questionaire with scores ranging from 0 to 62 with a cutoff for depression of 15.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Methamphetamine Withdrawal as Measured Using the Amphetamine Withdrawal Questionaire.</measure>
    <time_frame>Thrice weekly for the first three weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Amphetamine Withdrawal Questionaire was given at intake and 3 times weekly during the first 3 weeks of the study. This time span was chosen due to the tendency of methamphetamine withdrawal to enter an acute phase in the first week after last use with a subsequent subacute phase following for the next two weeks(McGregor et al, 2005). This questionaire is comprised of 10 items which describe symptoms associated with the cessation of chronic amphetamine use for which participants indicate severity on a 4-point scale. The minimum score is 0 and the maximum score is 40.</description>

        <title>Methamphetamine Withdrawal as Measured Using the Amphetamine Withdrawal Questionaire.</title>
        <description>The Amphetamine Withdrawal Questionaire was given at intake and 3 times weekly during the first 3 weeks of the study. This time span was chosen due to the tendency of methamphetamine withdrawal to enter an acute phase in the first week after last use with a subsequent subacute phase following for the next two weeks(McGregor et al, 2005). This questionaire is comprised of 10 items which describe symptoms associated with the cessation of chronic amphetamine use for which participants indicate severity on a 4-point scale. The minimum score is 0 and the maximum score is 40.</description>
