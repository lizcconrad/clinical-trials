  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study evaluated the safety and efficacy of 10 cm^2 rivastigmine patch in patients with
      Alzheimer Disease (MMSE 10-26). The primary objective was the percentage of patients who
      stayed on the target size of 10 cm^2 for at least 8 weeks. This proportion was then compared
      to historical data of the percentage of patients who could reach a rivastigmine capsule
      target dose of 12 mg and stay on it at least 8 weeks.

    <measure>Mean Change From Baseline in the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) Score at Week 24</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>The MMSE is a brief, practical screening test for cognitive dysfunction. The test consists of five sections (orientation, registration, attention-calculation, recall, and language); the total score can range from 0 to 30, with a higher score indicating better function. A positive change score indicates improvement.</description>

    <measure>Mean Change From Baseline in the Trail-making Test Part A Score at Week 24</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>The Trail-making test is a neuropsychological test of visual attention and task switching. The task requires a subject to 'connect-the-dots' of 25 consecutive numbers (1,2,3, etc.) on a sheet of paper or computer screen. The goal of the subject is to finish the test as quickly as possible, and the time taken to complete the test is used as the primary performance metric (in seconds). The maximum time allowed is 300 seconds. A negative change score indicates improvement.</description>

    <measure>Mean Change From Baseline in the Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study-Activities of Daily Living (ADCS-ADL) Score at Week 24</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>The ADCS-ADL scale is composed of 23 items developed to assess a patient's performance of both basic and instrumental activities of daily living such as those necessary for personal care, communicating and interacting with other people, maintaining a household, conducting hobbies and interests, as well as making judgments and decisions. Responses for each item will be obtained from the caregiver through an interview. The range for the total ADCS-ADL score is 0 to 78; a higher score indicates a more self-sufficient individual. A positive change score indicates improvement.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline to Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>The ADCS-CGIC is an assessment tool to make a judgment of change in a patient's condition. Change is derived from comparing an assessment performed at baseline versus an assessment at the end of the study. Change is categorized into 1 of 7 categories: No change; minimal, moderate, or marked improvement; or minimal, moderate, or marked decline. Results are reported as number of patients in the indicated change category.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline to Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>The Mini-Zarit Inventory assesses the burden of a caregiver in caring for a patient. The inventory is composed of 5 questions which are rated according to the following answers: 0 = never, ½ = sometimes, 1 = often. The ratings on the 5 questions are added together resulting in a total score of 0 to 7 with a higher score indicating greater caregiver burden. A negative change score indicates reduced burden.</description>

        <title>Mean Change From Baseline in the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) Score at Week 24</title>
        <description>The MMSE is a brief, practical screening test for cognitive dysfunction. The test consists of five sections (orientation, registration, attention-calculation, recall, and language); the total score can range from 0 to 30, with a higher score indicating better function. A positive change score indicates improvement.</description>

        <title>Mean Change From Baseline in the Trail-making Test Part A Score at Week 24</title>
        <description>The Trail-making test is a neuropsychological test of visual attention and task switching. The task requires a subject to 'connect-the-dots' of 25 consecutive numbers (1,2,3, etc.) on a sheet of paper or computer screen. The goal of the subject is to finish the test as quickly as possible, and the time taken to complete the test is used as the primary performance metric (in seconds). The maximum time allowed is 300 seconds. A negative change score indicates improvement.</description>

        <description>The ADCS-ADL scale is composed of 23 items developed to assess a patient's performance of both basic and instrumental activities of daily living such as those necessary for personal care, communicating and interacting with other people, maintaining a household, conducting hobbies and interests, as well as making judgments and decisions. Responses for each item will be obtained from the caregiver through an interview. The range for the total ADCS-ADL score is 0 to 78; a higher score indicates a more self-sufficient individual. A positive change score indicates improvement.</description>

        <description>The ADCS-CGIC is an assessment tool to make a judgment of change in a patient’s condition. Change is derived from comparing an assessment performed at baseline versus an assessment at the end of the study. Change is categorized into 1 of 7 categories: No change; minimal, moderate, or marked improvement; or minimal, moderate, or marked decline. Results are reported as number of patients in the indicated change category.</description>

        <description>The Mini-Zarit Inventory assesses the burden of a caregiver in caring for a patient. The inventory is composed of 5 questions which are rated according to the following answers: 0 = never, ½ = sometimes, 1 = often. The ratings on the 5 questions are added together resulting in a total score of 0 to 7 with a higher score indicating greater caregiver burden. A negative change score indicates reduced burden.</description>
