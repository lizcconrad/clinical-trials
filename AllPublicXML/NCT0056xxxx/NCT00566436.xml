  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to compare remote superficial femoral artery endarterectomy
      with suprageniculate bypass surgery in the treatment of long occlusions of the superficial
      femoral artery. The study hypothesis is that patency rates are comparable and therefore the
      minimal invasive remote superficial femoral artery endarterectomy can be considered in
      patients presenting with a long occlusion of the superficial femoral artery.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Different strategies exist in the treatment of chronic long occlusions of the superficial
      femoral artery and yet we still suffer a significant percentage of restenosis, re-occlusions
      and even major amputations, reason for continuous development of new techniques. One such
      technique is the recently developed minimal invasive remote endarterectomy, which shows
      promising patency rates and possibly less complications with earlier recovery. A more
      experienced and the most implemented technique is the suprageniculate femoropopliteal bypass
      graft, which, when using the saphenous vein, has proved durable. A randomized trial comparing
      both modalities was lacking so far, what makes the objective of this study a comparison of
      patency rates between those 2 techniques in a randomized fashion.

    <description>Exposure of the common femoral, superficial femoral and profunda femoral artery through a single groin incision. Arteriotomy in the proximal SFA followed by dissection of the intima core beyond the occluded segment using the Vollmar ringstripper. The ringstripper is exchanged for a Mollring cutter all under fluoroscopic guidance. With the Mollring Cutter transection of intima core is carried out, remote from the site of entry. After removal of the intima core the transection zone is secured with an aSpire stent after balloon angioplasty. A completion arteriography will verify a patent artery, and embolectomy can be performed when necessary. As indicated a common femoral artery and profundaplasty can be performed and the arteriotomy may be closed with or without patch.</description>
