    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to assess the safety and efficacy of 0.03% tacrolimus ointment
      as long-term treatment in paediatric patients with atopic dermatitis.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a long-term, multi-centre, non-comparative phase II study. All centres participating
      in the FG-506-06-32 pharmacokinetics study will be offered the protocol as a follow-up. Only
      patients enrolled by those centres for the above mentioned study, who applied at least one
      dose of study medication and benefited from treatment with 0.03% tacrolimus ointment, can be
      enrolled.

      During episodes of active disease, a thin coat of ointment is applied on each lesion. In the
      first three weeks, frequency of application is twice a day; after three weeks treatment is
      continued once a day. All atopic dermatitis lesions are treated until clearance (i.e. itch
      has gone). In case of a flare-up or worsening treatment twice daily treatment is re-started
      for three weeks and thereafter reduced to once daily.

      Safety is assessed from adverse events reported by the patient and/or his parents or observed
      by the investigator at the site of application and elsewhere. The safety evaluation includes
      monitoring of routine haematology and serum chemistry parameters. Blood samples are analysed
      by local laboratories. Blood samples are taken to determine concentrations of tacrolimus.

      Height, weight and pulse of the patient are recorded at each visit.

      Efficacy is assessed by physician's global evaluation of clinical response, patient's
      parent/guardian's assessment of global response, physician's assessment of individual signs
      and the affected area assessment.
