    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is show that intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT), as compared
      with conventional radiotherapy, improves the precision of tumor targeting and reduces the
      acute and late effects of radiation toxicity when used to treat anal cancer. Results from
      this work will provide a basis for incorporating the use of IMRT to treat anal cancer in
      future treatment protocols.

      The objectives of this study are three-fold. First, we would like to learn and compare the
      doses of radiation received by the tumor and the normal tissues in anal cancer patients
      treated with IMRT, and in those treated with conventional radiotherapy. Second, we wish to
      compare the acute effects of radiation treatment in both groups of patients. Our third
      objective is to evaluate the late effects of radiation treatment in both groups of patients.
      The first two objectives will be studied using a retrospective analysis of patients with anal
      cancer treated at Stanford University Medical Center. The third objective will require these
      patients to complete and return three quality of life questionnaires.
