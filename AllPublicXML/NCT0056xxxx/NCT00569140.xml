      The objectives of this study are to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetic
      profile of E10030 intravitreous injection when administered as monotherapy or in combination
      with Lucentis® 0.5 mg/eye in subjects with subfoveal choroidal neovascularization secondary
      to age-related macular degeneration (AMD).
