      The purpose of this study is to determine whether QR-333 is safe and effective in the
      treatment of diabetic neuropathy as compared to placebo.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Diabetic neuropathy is among the most common complication of diabetes, resulting in pain and
      numbness, which affects the patients sleep, functioning and well-being. The pain is often
      accompanied by unpleasant sensations described as buzzing, cramp-like, burning, or jolting.
      The pain is usually symmetrical and occurs in the upper and lower extremities following a
      &quot;glove and stocking&quot; distribution.

      To date there is no fully effective treatment for diabetic neuropathy. Therapy is tailored
      individually according to subject complaints and may be selected from categories including
      Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and adjuvant analgesics (including tricyclic
      antidepressants and anticonvulsants).

      The clinical trial is being conducted to determine the safety and efficacy of QR-333 in the
      treatment of diabetic neuropathy as compared to placebo.
