      Prior work (Chris, M. et al, Clinical Science 2005; 109, 55-60) has demonstrated that
      drinking a cup of coffee (80-100 mg of caffeine) an hour before endothelium-dependent FMD
      (flow-mediated dilatation) of the brachial artery, effects endothelial function in healthy
      adults subjects.

      This effect might be attributed to caffeine, given that decaffeinated coffee (&lt;2 mg of
      caffeine) was not associated with any change in endothelial performance.

      In the current study we intend to further examine the impact of caffeine on brachial
      endothelial function among healthy subjects &amp; in patients with proven ischemic heart disease.

      Background:

      Prior work (Chris, M. et al, Clinical Science 2005; 109, 55-60) has demonstrated that
      drinking a cup of coffee (80-100 mg of caffeine) an hour before endothelium-dependent FMD
      (flow-mediated dilatation) of the brachial artery, effects endothelial function in healthy
      adults subjects.

      This effect might be attributed to caffeine, given that decaffeinated coffee (&lt;2 mg of
      caffeine) was not associated with any change in endothelial performance.

      In the current study we intend to further examine the impact of caffeine on brachial
      endothelial function among healthy subjects &amp; in patients with proven ischemic heart disease.

      Aim:

      To evaluate the impact of 200 mg caffeine tablet intake (equivalent to 2 cups of coffee),
      compared to placebo on brachial endothelial function in healthy subjects &amp; in patients with
      proven ischemic heart disease.

      Methods:

        1. Patients will be invited for two endothelial function tests 1 week apart.

        2. ECG, heart rate &amp; blood pressure will be recorded at rest prior to each test.

        3. Following overnight fasting and discontinuation of all medications for â‰¥ 12 hours and
           absence of &gt; 48 hour caffeine consumption, patients will receive 200 mg of caffeine
           tablets or placebo, in a double-blind, cross-over study design. An hour later the
           patient will undergo endothelium-dependent flow-mediated dilation (FMD) and
           endothelium-independent, nitroglycerin (NTG)-mediated vasodilation will be assessed
           non-invasively in the brachial artery, using a high resolution (15 MHz) linear array
           ultrasound.

        4. Prior to and after the FMD, blood will be drawn to test caffeine levels, adiponectin,
           CBC, electrolytes, CRP and lipids.

    <description>Patients with prior history of coronary artery disease (CAD) (myocardial infarction, cerebrovascular accident, coronary angioplasty, S/p CABG operation) who will be given on the first day either caffeine of placebo tablet and 1-2 hours thereafter a brachial artery endothelial function testing (BRT) will be assessed for measuring the FMD. After 1 week the patients will come for a second BRT on placebo/caffeine tablets. If the patient received caffeine tablet the first BRT, he will be receiving placebo tablet the second week, however, if the patient received placebo the first BRT, a caffeine tablet will be given prior to the second BRT.</description>
