  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Stroke is a major cause of disability in Canadian adults. Following a stroke, many people
      have difficulty walking in their home and in the community. The purpose of this study is to
      compare the effect of two different approaches to walking retraining in people who have had a
      stroke.

      Individuals living in the community who have had recently had a stroke will be asked to
      participate in this study. Participants will be randomly assigned to one of two five week
      walking training programs. In one program, individuals will re-learn to walk in a variety of
      real-life situations. Practice sessions will encourage active problem solving by the
      participants. The other program will have participants practice walking on a treadmill while
      some of their body weight is supported by a special harness system. Participants will also be
      assisted by a physiotherapist to walk in a more normal manner.

      Participants' will be assessed at the beginning of the study, after the 5 week training
      program and again, eight weeks later. The research assistant will assess their ability to
      walk, their confidence level and the average daily walking activity.

      Primary Hypothesis: Individuals assigned to the Motor Learning Walking Program will improve
      their walking ability from baseline to follow up assessment significantly more than
      individuals assigned to the Treadmill Training Program.

      The results of this study will help physiotherapists plan effective treatment programs for
      individuals with walking difficulties following stroke. It will also give researchers
      direction for future studies in the areas of walking retraining and motor skill development
      post-stroke.

    <description>Over a 9 m track - participants are required to perform 5 balance and walking related tasks. Participants are required to 1) rise from a chair, walk 3 m, 2) step up and down an 8 inch step, walk 3 m, 3) bend down to pick up and return a 2.5 kilo weight off floor, walk 3 m to marked spot on the floor, 4) turn 180 degrees and walk 9 m back to the chair, 5. sit back down in the chair.
Each task is scored on a 4 point scale (total score of out 20) Participants are timed on how long it takes them to perform the entire circuit.</description>

    <description>In this measure, participants are asked to identify 3 walking related functional activities that they currently have some difficulty performing and would like to improve with treatment. For each activity, the participant rates their current ability to perform the task on a numeric rating scale of 0 to 10.
At Post-intervention and Follow-up, participants re-rate their current ability on the same activites (without seeing their previous score).</description>
