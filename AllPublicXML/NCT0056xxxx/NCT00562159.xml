      This purpose of this study is to determine the efficacy and safety of a grass sublingual
      (under-the-tongue) tablet.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study in
      participants 18 to 65 years of age, of either sex, and of any race with a history of grass
      pollen induced rhinoconjunctivitis with or without asthma. While receiving treatment,
      participants will receive either grass sublingual tablet or placebo. Open-label rescue
      medications for the hinoconjunctivitis and asthma symptoms will be provided. Participants
      will visit the study site for at least 12 visits. A total of 10 allergic symptoms, 6
      rhinoconjunctivitis and 4 lung symptoms, will be recorded daily on an electronic diary by the
      participant.

      The start and end of the grass pollen season (GPS) was determined based on the regional grass
      pollen count, and lasted up to 162 days. For each region, the GPS is defined as the first day
      of 3 consecutive recorded days with a grass pollen count of ≥ 10 grains/m^3, to the last day
      of the last occurrence of 3 consecutive recorded days with a grass pollen count ≥ 10
      grains/m^3, inclusively.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Participant Total Combined Symptom (TCS) Score Over the Entire Grass Pollen Season (GPS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Start of the GPS to End of the GPS</time_frame>
    <description>The TCS is the sum of the rhinoconjunctivitis daily symptom score (DSS) and rhinoconjunctivitis daily medication score (DMS) averaged over the entire GPS. The TCS ranged from 0-54, with increasing score indicating a higher level of symptom severity. The DSS is composed of 6 rhinoconjunctivitis symptoms with scores from 0-18, with increasing score indicating increased severity. The DMS is composed of a sum of the scores associated with rescue medication use per day. The range for the DMS was 0-36, with a lower score indicating less use of rescue medication.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Participant Average Rhinoconjunctivitis Daily Symptom Score (DSS) Over the Entire GPS</measure>
    <time_frame>Start of the GPS to End of the GPS</time_frame>
    <description>The DSS is composed of six rhinoconjunctivitis symptoms which were recorded daily including runny nose, blocked nose, sneezing, itchy nose, gritty feeling/red/itchy, and watery eyes, and the symptoms were measured on a scale of 0 (no symptom) to 3 (severe symptoms). A higher score indicated a higher level of symptoms and the total daily score could range from 0 to 18.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Participant Average Rhinoconjunctivitis Daily Medication Score (DMS) Over the Entire GPS</measure>
    <time_frame>Start of the GPS to End of the GPS</time_frame>
    <description>The DMS is composed of a sum of the scores associated with rescue medication use per day. Rescue medications were implemented when a participant had a symptom score &gt;= 4. Rescue medications for allergic rhinoconjunctivitis were to be utilized in a step-wise fashion: loratadine, olopatadine hydrochloride 0.1% opthalmic solution, mometasone, and prednisone, in that sequence. The score for the DMS ranged from 0-36. A lower medication score indicated less impact on symptomology and was suggestive of less use of rescue medication.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Participant Average Weekly Rhinoconjunctivitis Quality-of-Life Questionnaire With Standardized Activities (RQLQ(S)) Total Score Over the Entire GPS</measure>
    <time_frame>Start of the GPS to End of the GPS</time_frame>
    <description>The RQLQ(s) has 28 questions and focusses on 7 domains that may be significantly impaired in participants with seasonal allergic rhinoconjunctivitis: sleep impairment, non-nasal symptoms, practical problems, nasal symptoms, eye symptoms, activity limitations, and emotional difficulty. The RQLQ score is the mean of all 28 responses and the individual domain scores are the means of the items in those domains. RQLQ scores range from 0-6, with a higher score indicating more significant impairment.</description>

          -  Participants with any clinically significant condition or situation, other than the
             condition being studied that, in the opinion of the investigator, would interfere with
             the study evaluations or optimal participation in the study. Specific examples include
             but are not limited to hypertension being treated with beta blockers, coronary artery
             disease, arrhythmia, stroke, ocular conditions requiring topical beta blockers, any

          -  Participants that are unlikely to be able to complete the trial, for any reason, or
             likely to travel for extended periods of time during the GPS, which in the opinion of
             the investigator will compromise the data.

          -  Participants with a clinically significant abnormal vital sign or laboratory value
             that would preclude participation in the study.

          -  Participants participating in this study may not participate in this same study at
             another investigational site.

          -  Participants must not be randomized into this study more than once.

             epinephrine.

          -  Participants that may be at greater risk of developing adverse reactions after
             epinephrine administration.

The DMS is composed of a sum of the scores associated with rescue medication use per day. The range for the DMS was 0-36, with a lower score indicating less use of rescue medication.</description>

        <description>The DMS is composed of a sum of the scores associated with rescue medication use per day. Rescue medications were implemented when a participant had a symptom score &gt;= 4. Rescue medications for allergic rhinoconjunctivitis were to be utilized in a step-wise fashion: loratadine, olopatadine hydrochloride 0.1% opthalmic solution, mometasone, and prednisone, in that sequence. The score for the DMS ranged from 0-36. A lower medication score indicated less impact on symptomology and was suggestive of less use of rescue medication.</description>

        <description>The RQLQ(s) has 28 questions and focusses on 7 domains that may be significantly impaired in participants with seasonal allergic rhinoconjunctivitis: sleep impairment, non-nasal symptoms, practical problems, nasal symptoms, eye symptoms, activity limitations, and emotional difficulty. The RQLQ score is the mean of all 28 responses and the individual domain scores are the means of the items in those domains. RQLQ scores range from 0-6, with a higher score indicating more significant impairment.</description>

          <description>The RQLQ(s) has 28 questions and focusses on 7 domains that may be significantly impaired in participants with seasonal allergic rhinoconjunctivitis: sleep impairment, non-nasal symptoms, practical problems, nasal symptoms, eye symptoms, activity limitations, and emotional difficulty. The RQLQ score is the mean of all 28 responses and the individual domain scores are the means of the items in those domains. RQLQ scores range from 0-6, with a higher score indicating more significant impairment.</description>
