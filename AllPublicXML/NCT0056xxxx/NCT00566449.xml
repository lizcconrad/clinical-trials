      compared to placebo in adults with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD).

    <textblock>
      This study is being done to assess safety and tolerability and to explore the effectiveness
      of a new, experimental drug in the treatment of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder in
      adults. Approximately 144 adult patients with ADHD will be recruited for the study. Patients
      who meet study criteria will need to stop taking any ADHD medications they are currently
      using. They will be randomly assigned to one of 3 treatment arms; each patient has an equal
      chance of receiving 10 mg JNJ-31001017, 30 mg JNJ-31001074, or placebo. Placebo has no active
      drug. This is a blinded study, i.e. the patient, the study doctor and the study sponsor will
      not know what treatment the patient receives until all patients complete the study. Patients
      will be dispensed a bottle containing study drug for the upcoming week at 4 of the study
      visits. The study doctor and the sponsor will monitor the study for the occurrence of
      possible side effects. In addition to a screening visit, patients will return weekly for 6
      additional study visits including an end of study visit and a follow-up visit. Patients will
      take study drug for a total of 4 weeks. After completing the study, patients may resume other
      ADHD medications. Medical and ADHD history, physical examination, blood pressure, heart rate,
      temperature, weight and ECGs will be checked periodically throughout the study. Blood samples
      will be taken for standard safety laboratory tests as well as for the measurement of the drug
      blood level. Questionnaires relating to ADHD and cognitive testing will be administered
      throughout the study. Each day for four weeks, patients will take orally, at least one hour
      before eating in the morning, 1 tablet containing either 10 mg JNJ-31001074, 30 mg
      JNJ-31001074 or placebo.
