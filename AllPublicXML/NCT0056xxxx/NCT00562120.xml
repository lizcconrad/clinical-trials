  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      An H3 receptor antagonist should reduce the congestion associated with allergic rhinitis. A
      nasal allergen challenge will be given to patients to induce rhinitis symptoms and acoustic
      rhinometry will be used to measure the congestion.

    <measure>Minimum Cross-Sectional Area (Amin) Proportion Measured Using Acoustic Rhinometry</measure>
    <time_frame>2 hrs 10 min, 2 hrs 25 min, 2 hrs 40 min post dose (Baseline); 2 hrs 55 min, 3 hrs 10 min, 3 hrs 25 min post dose on Day 1 of each intervention period</time_frame>
    <description>Acoustic rhinometry: a technique intended for assessment of the geometry of nasal cavity and nasopharynx and for evaluating nasal obstruction. At each time point, there were 2 acoustic rhinometry measurements taken, one for each nostril. Mean of the left and right nostril measurements was taken as measurement at each time point. Minimum Cross-Sectional Area (Amin) at Baseline was defined as mean of 3, 'post-diluent, pre-allergen challenge' measures for each intervention period at 2 hours (hrs) 10 minutes (min), 2 hrs 25 min and 2 hrs 40 min post PF-03654746/placebo dose. Amin 'post-allergen challenge' measures recorded at 2 hrs 55 min, 3 hrs 10 min and 3 hrs 25 min post PF-03654746/placebo dose for each intervention period was averaged to derive single 'post-allergen challenge' value. Amin proportion was defined as ratio of 'post-allergen challenge' value and 'Baseline/pre-allergen challenge value'. Diluent used was saline and allergen was short ragweed extract.</description>

Amin 'post-allergen challenge' measures were recorded at 2 hrs 55 min, 3 hrs 10 min and 3 hrs 25 min post PF-03654746/placebo dose for each intervention period.

    <description>Nasal symptoms included; nasal congestion: participants rated sensation of nasal blockage on 0 (no blockage) to 5 (total blockage) scale, nasal itching: participants rated sensation of nasal itch on 0 (no itch) to 5 (very itchy) scale, rhinorrhea: participants rated sensation of runny nose on 0 (no running) to 5 (very runny) scale. Symptom scores were assessed as mean of each intervention period at specified time-points for 'post-diluent, pre-allergen challenge' measure and 'post-challenge' measure. Post-diluent, pre-allergen challenge (for congestion, itching, rhinorrhea) included 2 hrs 10 min, 2 hrs 25 min and 2 hrs 40 min post PF-03654746/placebo dose at each intervention period and post-allergen challenge (for congestion, itching, rhinorrhea) included 2 hrs 55 min, 3 hrs 10 min and 3 hrs 25 min post PF-03654746/placebo dose at each intervention period and (for congestion only) 3 hrs 40 min post PF-03654746/placebo dose (Post-oxymetazoline) at each intervention period.</description>

        <title>Minimum Cross-Sectional Area (Amin) Proportion Measured Using Acoustic Rhinometry</title>
        <description>Acoustic rhinometry: a technique intended for assessment of the geometry of nasal cavity and nasopharynx and for evaluating nasal obstruction. At each time point, there were 2 acoustic rhinometry measurements taken, one for each nostril. Mean of the left and right nostril measurements was taken as measurement at each time point. Minimum Cross-Sectional Area (Amin) at Baseline was defined as mean of 3, ‘post-diluent, pre-allergen challenge’ measures for each intervention period at 2 hours (hrs) 10 minutes (min), 2 hrs 25 min and 2 hrs 40 min post PF-03654746/placebo dose. Amin ‘post-allergen challenge’ measures recorded at 2 hrs 55 min, 3 hrs 10 min and 3 hrs 25 min post PF-03654746/placebo dose for each intervention period was averaged to derive single ‘post-allergen challenge’ value. Amin proportion was defined as ratio of ‘post-allergen challenge’ value and ‘Baseline/pre-allergen challenge value’. Diluent used was saline and allergen was short ragweed extract.</description>

        <title>Nasal Volume Proportion Measured Using Acoustic Rhinometry</title>
        <description>Acoustic rhinometry: a technique intended for assessment of the geometry of nasal cavity and nasopharynx and for evaluating nasal obstruction. At each time point, there were 2 acoustic rhinometry measurements taken, one for each nostril. Mean of the left and right nostril measurements was taken as measurement at each time point. Nasal volume at Baseline was defined as mean of 3, ‘post-diluent, pre-allergen challenge’ measures for each intervention period at 2 hrs 10 min, 2 hrs 25 min and 2 hrs 40 min post PF-03654746/placebo dose. Nasal volume ‘post-allergen challenge’ measures recorded at 2 hrs 55 min, 3 hrs 10 min and 3 hrs 25 min post PF-03654746/placebo dose for each intervention period was averaged to derive single ‘post-allergen challenge’ value. Nasal volume proportion was defined as ratio of ‘post-allergen challenge’ value and ‘Baseline/pre-allergen challenge value’. Diluent used was saline and allergen was short ragweed extract.</description>

        <title>Nasal Volume Maximum Fall Measured Using Acoustic Rhinometry</title>
        <description>Acoustic rhinometry: a technique intended for assessment of the geometry of the nasal cavity and nasopharynx and for evaluating nasal obstruction. At each time point, there were 2 acoustic rhinometry measurements taken, one for each nostril. The mean of the left and right nostril measurements was taken as the measurement at each time point. Nasal volume at Baseline was defined as mean of the 3, ‘post-diluent, pre-allergen challenge’ measures for each intervention period at 2 hrs 10 min, 2 hrs 25 min and 2 hrs 40 min post PF-03654746/placebo dose. Nasal volume ‘post-allergen challenge’ measures were recorded at 2 hrs 55 min, 3 hrs 10 min and 3 hrs 25 min post PF-03654746/placebo dose for each intervention period. The maximum fall for nasal volume was calculated as baseline measure minus smallest ‘post-allergen challenge’ nasal volume measurement among the 3 measures.</description>
