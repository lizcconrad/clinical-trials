      The purpose of this study is to: 1.) Evaluate how your body reacts to sorafenib when taken
      daily (continuously) in combination with docetaxel given every 3 weeks, and to determine the
      safety of the two drugs together.2.) Measure your blood levels of sorafenib and docetaxel at
      specific times after taking the medications.
