  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This protocol is designed to assess the efficacy and safety of inotuzumab ozogamicin given
      with rituximab compared to a defined investigator's choice therapy. Subjects will be
      randomized to one of these two arms of the study.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      On January 14th 2009, enrollment in the study was discontinued because of poor enrollment and
      because it was unlikely that the study would meet the estimated enrollment of approximately
      978 subjects. The decision was not prompted by the identification of any safety signals in
      this or other studies. Active treatment and follow-up of the already enrolled subjects was
      continued. On July, 22th 2010 , the study was amended to shorten the long-term follow-up to
      one year after active treatment.

    <measure>Progression-Free Survival (PFS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline until disease progression or death or up to 1 year after last dose of study drug</time_frame>
    <description>PFS was defined as the time from randomization to disease progression or death due to any cause, whichever occurred first, censored at the last tumor evaluation date. PFS calculated as (Months) = (first event date minus randomization date plus 1) divided by 30.44.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of Participants With Objective Response (OR)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, every 6 to 12 weeks during treatment period, end of treatment (EOT) (42 days after last dose), every 12 weeks during follow-up for up to 1 year after the last dose of study drug</time_frame>
    <description>OR was based on assessment of complete response(CR),unconfirmed CR(Cru),partial response(PR) as per International Response Criteria for Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma.Confirmed response=response persists on repeat imaging at least 4 weeks after initial response.CR=complete disappearance of all detectable clinical/radiographic evidence of disease,lymph nodes regressed to normal size [at least 1.5 centimeter(cm) or less],spleen regressed,not palpable on physical examination,bone marrow infiltrate cleared on repeat aspiration/biopsy.PR=at least 50 percent (%) decrease in sum of product diameters of 6 greatest dominant nodes,no increase in other nodes,liver/spleen,no new sites of disease. CRu=residual lymph node greater than 1.5 cm in transverse diameter that has regressed more than 75% in product diameter.Individual nodes previously confluent,regressed more than 75% in product diameters.Indeterminate bone marrow (increased number/size of lymph aggregates without cytologic/architectural atypia).</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Overall Survival Probability at Months 6, 12 and 24</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline up to Month 6, 12, 24</time_frame>
    <description>Overall survival was defined as the time from randomization to death due to any cause, censoring at the date of last contact or the end of the study. Participants who withdrew or lost to follow-up from study without having death documented were censored at the date of last contact. Kaplan-Meier estimates of the probability of survival at 6, 12 and 24 months was used to estimate the survival function.</description>

    <measure>Number of Participants With Clinically Significant Change From Baseline in QT Interval Findings</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline up to 42 days post-treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Assessments of QT interval was performed only in rituximab + inotuzumab ozogamicinin group. QT interval corrected using Fridericia's formula (QTcF) and Bazett's formula (QTcB) was analyzed as per common terminology criteria for adverse events (CTCAE) version 3.0, where Grade 1 = mild AE, Grade 2 = moderate AE, Grade 3 = severe AE, Grade 4 = life-threatening or disabling AE, Grade 5 = death related to AE. Number of participants with change in CTCAE grading at post-baseline time point compared to the baseline were presented. The post-baseline value was defined as the maximum grade after the first dose date on or before the end of treatment.</description>

  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Participants With Grade 3 or 4 Treatment Emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline up to 42 days post-treatment</time_frame>
    <description>AE=any untoward medical occurrence in participant who received study drug without regard to possibility of causal relationship. Grade 3 (Severe) events=unacceptable or intolerable events, significantly interrupting usual daily activity, require systemic drug therapy/other treatment. Grade 4 (Life-threatening) events caused participant to be in imminent danger of death. TEAE=between first dose of study drug and up to 42 days after last dose that were absent before treatment or that worsened relative to pretreatment state.</description>
