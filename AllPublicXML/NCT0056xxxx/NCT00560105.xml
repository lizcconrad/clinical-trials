    <textblock>
      This is an eight-week, randomized, controlled, two arm parallel study. The study consists of,
      a screening visit, two weeks of intervention-free run-in randomization, clinic visits week 0,
      1, 2, 4, 6, and 8 weeks during the intervention period to collect 24 hour sputum and to
      confirm techniques of device use and entries into daily diaries. Twenty-four (24) hour sputum
      samples will be collected and weighed at each clinic visit. In addition to clinic visits,
      subjects will be expected to make daily diary entries of COPD symptoms. Clinical evaluation
      will include adverse event surveillance, and St. Georges Respiratory questionnaire.

    <measure>Safety and Efficacy of the Lung Flute Versus the Acapella for the Treatment of COPD in Adults. Twenty-four (24) Hour Dry Sputum Weight</measure>
    <time_frame>8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>In order to test the overall treatment effect on dry sputum weight over the course of the study, mixed effects analysis were performed. These models allow us to account for the longitudinal nature of the data. We assumed that the observations collected within each patient were correlated; however, observations collected across patients were assumed to be independent. Dry sputum weights obtained prior to and at randomization were regarded as baseline measurements, while those obtained at week 1, 2, 4, 6 and 8 were examined for treatment effects.</description>

Participants who were compliant with the 24 hr sputum collection and at least 50% of the daily dairy entries were randomized to either the Lung Flute® or the Acapella®</description>

          <title>Safety and Efficacy of the Lung Flute Versus the Acapella for the Treatment of COPD in Adults. Twenty-four (24) Hour Dry Sputum Weight</title>
          <description>In order to test the overall treatment effect on dry sputum weight over the course of the study, mixed effects analysis were performed. These models allow us to account for the longitudinal nature of the data. We assumed that the observations collected within each patient were correlated; however, observations collected across patients were assumed to be independent. Dry sputum weights obtained prior to and at randomization were regarded as baseline measurements, while those obtained at week 1, 2, 4, 6 and 8 were examined for treatment effects.</description>
