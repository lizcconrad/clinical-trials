  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      National Kidney Foundation guidelines recommend a dietary protein intake of 1.2 grams per
      kilogram per day (g/kg/d) in hemodialysis patients. However, it is unclear whether
      consumption of high amounts of protein in dialysis patients has beneficial or harmful
      nutritional and cardiovascular effects in this population. High protein intake might improve
      nutritional status, but it has been argued that the state of low muscle mass, small body size
      and low serum protein levels is not the result of decreased dietary intake, rather a result
      of hypercatabolism induced by metabolic acidosis, inflammation and oxidative stress.

      The specific aims of this study are to examine in a prospective cohort of hemodialysis
      patients the longitudinal associations of absolute total protein intake or dietary protein
      intake with muscle mass and arterial stiffness.

  <detailed_description>

      It is hypothesized that in the dialysis population overall: (1) Protein intake is a major
      determinant of muscle mass while inflammation, oxidative stress and metabolic acidosis play a
      lesser role; (2) Malnutrition is not an uremic cardiovascular risk factor hence low protein
      intake does not cause cardiovascular disease; and (3) In the other extreme, high protein
      intake is also not a major cause of cardiovascular disease since high serum phosphorus
      associated with high protein intake can usually be controlled by the use of phosphorus
      binders in routine clinical practice.

      The specific aims of this proposal are to examine in a prospective cohort of hemodialysis
      patients the longitudinal associations of absolute total protein intake (TPI) in grams/day,
      or dietary protein intake (DPI) normalized to body weight in grams/kilogram/day) with

        1. Nutritional status (mid-thigh muscle mass as measured by Magnetic Resonance Imaging )
           and functional status (6-min walk) and

        2. Arterial stiffness (aortic pulse wave velocity)

      Understanding the relationship between protein intake with body composition (muscle mass) and
      intermediate cardiovascular outcomes (arterial stiffness) in stage 5 CKD patients in
      hemodialysis is of great scientific and practical significance
