      Case matched study on 50 consecutive patients undergoing robotic assisted cholecystectomy (Da
      Vinci Robot, Intuitive Surgical). These patients are matched 1:1 to 50 patients with
      conventional laparoscopic cholecystectomy, according to age, gender, ASA score, histology and
      surgical experience.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cholecystectomy is used as a starting procedure for robotic-assisted technology in general
      surgery by most centers. Surprisingly, data is lacking regarding patient outcome or
      associated costs compared to the use of conventional laparoscopic surgery.

      The study is designed to assess the potential benefits of robotic-assisted cholecystectomy.
      To achieve a high level of evidence we chose a prospective case matched controlled
      methodology. Three experienced and one junior (2nd yr) surgeon are involved, and were fully
      trained with the robot prior to initiating the study including tasks in a training box on pig
      livers and 5 cholecystectomies performed on humans with this technology. Each patient
      operated with the robotic system is retrospectively matched one by one with patients who
      underwent a laparoscopic cholecystectomy.

      The robotic assisted operations are performed with the 3- arm Da Vinci robot system (Da Vinci
      Robot, Intuitive Surgical). Similar to the laparoscopic technique an additional fourth trocar
      was used to retract the gallbladder. The positioning (French) of the patients and the trocars
      are also comparable to the conventional laparoscopic cholecystectomy.
