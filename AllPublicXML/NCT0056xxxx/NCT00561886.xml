  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic obstructive bronchitis and emphysema (COPD) are pathophysiologically characterized by
      inflammatory and structural changes in the lung. These changes lead to a reduction in elastic
      recoil as well as reduction in lung parenchyma. As a consequence collapse of the small airway
      occurs during expiration leading to expiratory flow limitation. In severe cases this flow
      limitation occurs even during resting condition. This expiratory collapse is suspected to
      mask changes in bronchial smooth muscle tone, especially if these changes in bronchial smooth
      muscle tone are assessed using expiratory manoeuvres. This might leave the impression of
      non-reversible airway obstruction und ineffectiveness of treatment with bronchodilators.
      Several studies suggest that in patients with COPD symptomatic changes following application
      of a bronchodilating compound do not correlate with changes in forced expiratory volumes. In
      contrast inspiratory lung function parameters (especially forced inspiratory volume in one
      second (FIV1)) is much more associated with symptomatic changes in patients with COPD.
      Comparable effects were also detected regarding peak inspiratory flow (PIF) values.Changes in
      inspiratory parameters following administration of a bronchodilator in patients with COPD and
      asthma are reproducible. PIF can easily be measured by inspiratory peak flow meters. So far
      no data exists on the usability of these devices following bronchodilation in patients with
      COPD. Formoterol is a rapid acting bronchodilator, which has been proven save in asthma and
      COPD
