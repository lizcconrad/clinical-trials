  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The treatment of fibrotic choroidal neovascular lesions with presence of residual peripheral
      activity in age related macular degeneration currently presents a great challenge. With
      visual loss threatening, there are only very few therapeutic options.

      While these patients are neither suitable for laser therapy nor for photodynamic therapy with
      Verteporfin, antiangiogenic drugs applied intravitreally are now available.

      Some patients however reject this therapeutic option because of potential complications such
      as endophthalmitis and the frequency of necessary injections. 20 patients who rejected
      intravitreal therapy were treated with Anecortave acetate (Retaane®) which was applied as a
      juxtascleral depot injection.
