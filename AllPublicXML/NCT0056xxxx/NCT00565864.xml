  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with hypothyroidism are routinely treated with thyroid hormone (l-thyroxine) for
      replacement therapy. Physicians monitor the thyroid hormone dose by measuring a thyroid
      stimulating hormone (TSH) level in the blood, with the goal of a normal level. However,
      recent data suggest that the &quot;normal&quot; TSH range is too broad, and that patients may still
      have symptoms if their TSH levels are at the top or bottom part of the normal range.

      To study this issue, it is useful to address issues such as general health status,
      psychological symptoms, mood, memory, and metabolic status, since thyroid hormone has major
      effects on the brain adn metabolism, and since patients with treated hypothyroidism often
      have symptoms related to these areas.

      In the present study, otherwise healthy subjects with treated hypothyroidism, ages 20-75
      years, will be enrolled in a 7-11month study. At baseline, they will have tests of health
      status, psychological symptoms, mood, memory, body composition, and energy expenditure
      performed. Following these baseline measurements, subjects will receive either their usual
      doses of l-thyroxine, or a slightly higher or lower dose. The doses will be chosen to try to
      achieve either a low-normal TSH level, a high-normal TSH level, or a mildly elevated TSH
      level. Which target TSH the patient is assigned will be determined randomly, and neither the
      subject nor the study contacts will know which dose the patient is receiving. Subjects will
      be seen every 6 weeks during the study for brief visits to make sure they are not having any
      side effects, and to adjust the l-thyroxine doses if the TSH has not yet reached the target
      range. At the 24-week visit (end of study), the subjects will undergo the same tests that
      they had on the baseline visit.

      Results from the study will be examined to see if minor changes in TSH or other thyroid
      hormone levels cause changes in any of the outcomes, and if the degree of TSH change
      correlates with the degree of outcome changes. These results may help physicians caring for
      patients with thyroid disease better determine the optimal dose of thyroid hormone for each
      patient.
