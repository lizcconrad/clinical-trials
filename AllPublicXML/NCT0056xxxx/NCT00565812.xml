    <textblock>
      The objective of this 2-year study is to evaluate the safety, tolerability and disease
      modifying efficacy of SD 6010, an inhibitor of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), in
      overweight and obese subjects with knee osteoarthritis. The efficacy of SD-6010 will be
      evaluated by radiography using joint space narrowing in the medial tibiofemoral compartment
      of the study knee as the primary endpoint.

    <measure>Outcome Measures in Rheumatology-Osteoarthritis Research Society International (OMERACT-OARSI) Responder Index</measure>
    <time_frame>Month 24</time_frame>
    <description>The OMERACT-OARSI responder index was used to determine whether participants may be considered responders to treatment. An OMERACT-OARSI responder was a participant who had a better response on the WOMAC pain subscale score, a better response on the WOMAC physical function subscale score or improvement on at least two of the three domains: WOMAC pain subscale score (overall score range of 0 [minimum] to 20 [maximum], higher scores indicating more pain), WOMAC physical function subscale score (overall score range of 0 [minimum] to 68 [maximum], higher scores indicating worse physical function) and patient global assessment of arthritic condition score (overall score range of 1 [minimum] to 5 [maximum], higher scores indicating worse condition). Number of participants who were OMERACT-OARSI responder were reported in this measure.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline up to 7-10 days after last dose of study drug (Week 111)</time_frame>
    <description>An AE was any untoward medical occurrence in a participant who received study drug without regard to possibility of causal relationship. An SAE was an AE resulting in any of the following outcomes or deemed significant for any other reason: death; initial or prolonged inpatient hospitalization; life-threatening experience (immediate risk of dying); persistent or significant disability/incapacity; congenital anomaly. Treatment-emergent were events between first dose of study drug and up to 7-10 days after last dose that were absent before treatment or that worsened relative to pre-treatment state. Adverse events included both serious and non-serious adverse events.</description>

          <title>Rate of Progression of Joint Space Narrowing in Participants With Kellgren and Lawrence Grade Equal to (=) 3</title>
          <description>Rate of progression of JSN was defined as narrowing in joint space width over the course of the study. It was measured radiographically in the medial tibiofemoral of knee of participants with OA. The slope reported in mm/year over a 2 year period was used to assess the rate of progression of JSN. KLG system was a method of classifying the severity of knee OA using five grades (0 [no severity] to 4 [maximum severity], higher grade indicating worse knee function). Negative values of slope indicating a worsening of osteoarthritis.</description>
          <population>FAS included all participants randomized to the study. Here, 'N' signifies participants with KLG =3 and evaluable for this outcome measure.</population>

        <description>The WOMAC was a self-administered, disease-specific instrument which probed clinically important, participant relevant symptoms in the areas of pain, stiffness, and physical function in participants with OA of the knee. The WOMAC composite index was the sum of 24 individual questions regarding subscales of pain, stiffness and physical function (for each item score range: 0 [minimum] to 4 [maximum], higher score indicating worse knee condition). Total score was sum of the 3 subscale scores, giving a possible overall score range of 0 (minimum) to 96 (maximum). Higher score indicating the worse level of pain, stiffness and physical function.</description>

        <description>Stiffness was defined as a sensation of decreased ease in which the participant moved the knee with OA. The WOMAC stiffness subscale was comprised of 2 questions regarding the degree of stiffness experienced in the study knee. The WOMAC stiffness subscale score for each question ranged from 0 (minimum) to 4 (maximum), higher scores signified worse stiffness. An overall score range of 0 (minimum) to 8 (maximum), with higher scores indicating more stiffness.</description>

        <description>The WOMAC physical function subscale referred to the participant's ability to move around and perform usual activities of daily living. The WOMAC physical function subscale was comprised of 17 questions regarding the degree of difficulty experienced due to OA in the study knee. The WOMAC physical function subscale score for each question ranged from 0 (minimum) to 4 (maximum), higher scores signified worse physical function. An overall score range of 0 (minimum) to 68 (maximum), with higher scores indicating worse physical function.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score – Physical Function Short Form (KOOS-PS) Score at Month 3, 6, 12, 18 and 24</title>
        <description>The KOOS-PS was used to rate participant’s opinions about the difficulties they experienced with activity due to problems with their knee. It was a 7-item scale, each item scored from 0 (minimum) to 4 (maximum), where 4 indicated worst health condition. Total score was calculated by adding the responses to 7 items and rescaled to a 0 (minimum) to 100 (maximum) scale, where higher scores indicating worse health condition.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Short Form-36 (SF-36) Physical Functioning Domain Score at Month 12 and 24</title>
        <description>The SF-36 was a participant administered scale assessing general quality of life. It consisted of self-administered 36-item questionnaire that measured 8 health domains: physical functioning, role-physical, bodily pain, general health, vitality, social functioning, role-emotional, and mental health. These 8 domains were also summarized as physical and mental component scores. The score for each domain and component score was the mean of the individual question scores, which were scaled from 0 (minimum) to 100 (maximum), where higher scores indicated highest level of health/functioning. Linear transformations were performed to transform scores and rescaled to a score range of 16.18 (minimum) to 57.11 (maximum), with higher scores indicating better physical functioning.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Short Form-36 Bodily Pain Domain Score at Month 12 and 24</title>
        <description>The SF-36 was a participant administered scale assessing general quality of life. It consisted of self-administered 36-item questionnaire that measured 8 health domains: physical functioning, role-physical, bodily pain, general health, vitality, social functioning, role-emotional, and mental health. These 8 domains were also summarized as physical and mental component scores. The score for each domain and component score was the mean of the individual question scores, which were scaled from 0 (minimum) to 100 (maximum), where higher scores indicated highest level of health/functioning. Linear transformations were performed to transform scores and rescaled to a score range of 19.23 (minimum) to 60.88 (maximum), with higher scores indicating lower bodily pain.</description>

        <description>The SF-36 was a participant administered scale assessing general quality of life. It consisted of self-administered 36-item questionnaire that measured 8 health domains: physical functioning, role-physical, bodily pain, general health, vitality, social functioning, role-emotional, and mental health. These 8 domains were also summarized as physical and mental component scores. The score for each domain and component score was the mean of the individual question scores, which were scaled from 0 (minimum) to 100 (maximum), where higher scores indicated highest level of health/functioning. Linear transformations were performed to transform scores and rescaled to a score range of 22.02 (minimum) to 69.92 (maximum), with higher scores indicating better vitality.</description>

        <description>The SF-36 was a participant administered scale assessing general quality of life. It consisted of self-administered 36-item questionnaire that measured 8 health domains: physical functioning, role-physical, bodily pain, general health, vitality, social functioning, role-emotional, and mental health. These 8 domains were also summarized as physical and mental component scores. The score for each domain and component score was the mean of the individual question scores, which were scaled from 0 (minimum) to 100 (maximum), where higher scores indicated highest level of health/functioning. Linear transformations were performed to transform scores and rescaled to a score range of 10.25 (minimum) to 55.68 (maximum), with higher scores indicating better role-emotional.</description>

          <title>Change From Baseline in Short Form-36 Mental Health Domain Score at Month 12 and 24</title>
          <description>The SF-36 was a participant administered scale assessing general quality of life. It consisted of self-administered 36-item questionnaire that measured 8 health domains: physical functioning, role-physical, bodily pain, general health, vitality, social functioning, role-emotional, and mental health. These 8 domains were also summarized as physical and mental component scores. The score for each domain and component score was the mean of the individual question scores, which were scaled from 0 (minimum) to 100 (maximum), where higher scores indicated highest level of health/functioning. Linear transformations were performed to transform scores and rescaled to a score range of 8.02 (minimum) to 63.43 (maximum), with higher scores indicating better mental health.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Short Form-36 Mental Health Component Score at Month 12 and 24</title>
        <description>The SF-36 was a participant administered scale assessing general quality of life. It consisted of self-administered 36-item questionnaire that measured 8 health domains: physical functioning, role-physical, bodily pain, general health, vitality, social functioning, role-emotional, and mental health. These 8 domains were also summarized as physical and mental component scores. The score for each domain and component score was the mean of the individual question scores, which were scaled from 0 (minimum) to 100 (maximum), where higher scores indicated highest level of health/functioning. Linear transformations were performed to transform scores and rescaled to a score range of 11.11 (minimum) to 61.67 (maximum), with higher scores indicating better mental health.</description>

        <title>Number of Participants With EuroQo-5D Pain and Discomfort Domain Score</title>
        <description>EQ-5D: participant rated questionnaire to assess health-related quality of life. Health state profile component assessed level of current health for 5 domains: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain and discomfort, anxiety and depression. EQ-5D pain and discomfort domain score scale ranged from 1 (minimum) to 3 (maximum), where 1 =better health (no pain and discomfort), 2 =moderate health (moderate pain and discomfort) and 3 =worst health state (extreme pain and discomfort). Higher scores indicated worse health condition. Participants with EQ-5D pain and discomfort domain score were reported in this measure.</description>
