    <textblock>
      The study purpose is to gain experience with the TOPAS system, a minimally- invasively
      delivered self-fixating mesh for the treatment of pelvic floor weakness in women with
      symptoms of moderate fecal incontinence

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a multi-center study under a common protocol. Approximately 20-30 patients will be
      enrolled across 5 sites in the U.S. The study population is females at least 21 years of age
      who have attempted but have not been satisfied with conservative therapy for their fecal
      incontinence symptoms. The study follow-up is two years.

    <measure>Fecal Incontinence Incidence From Baseline (Pre-treatment) Through 24 Months Post-treatment</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (pre-treatment), 6 Week, 3 Month, 6 Month, 12 Month and 24 Month post-treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Includes solid and liquid stools, as measured by the mean rate obtained using a subject-reported bowel diary. The 3 month post-treatment visit was the primary endpoint time period.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Incidence Rate of Complications During the 24 Month Post-Treatment Follow-up Period</measure>
    <time_frame>Through 24 month post-treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Complications are defined as all adverse events reported during the 24 month follow-up period including serious/non-serious events and events related/not related to the device and/or procedure. Incidence rate is calculated as: (total number of adverse events reported in the 24 month follow-up period) / (total number of subjects implanted = 29)</description>

    <measure>Fecal Incontinence Symptoms as Measured by the Wexner Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (pre-treatment), 6 Week, 3 Month, 6 Month, 12 Month and 24 Month post-treatment</time_frame>
    <description>The Wexner Score (also known as the Cleveland Clinic Florida Incontinence Score) is a subject-completed questionnaire that asks about the frequency of incontinence to gas, liquid, solid, of the need to wear pads, and of lifestyle changes (scored on a frequency scale from 0 (=absent) to 4 (daily). An overall Wexner Score is computed from these five components and a score of 0 means perfect control and 20 means complete incontinence.</description>

    <measure>Fecal Incontinence Symptoms as Measured by Symptom Severity Scale in Fecal Incontinence</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (pre-treatment), 6 Week, 3 Month, 6 Month, 12 Month and 24 Month post-treatment</time_frame>
    <description>The Symptom Severity Scale in Fecal Incontinence is a subject-completed questionnaire that asks about the symptoms of fecal incontinence in the following areas: frequency, stool composition, stool amount, and degree of urgency. The total score is measured on a 0 (best) to 13 (worst) scale. Scores of 1-6, 7-10, and 11-13 were categorized as mild, moderate, and severe fecal incontinence, respectively.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline (pre-treatment), 3 Month, 6 Month, 12 Month and 24 Month post-treatment</time_frame>
    <description>The Fecal Incontinence Quality of Life Assessment is a subject-completed questionnaire. It is measured in each of four areas of depression (7 items), lifestyle (10 items), coping (9 items), and embarrassment (3 items). Area scores are measured on a 1 (worse) to 4 (best) scale and are each the average of their component individual item scores measured on the same scale.</description>

    <measure>Pain Intensity as Measured by the Pain Intensity Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (pre-treatment), 6 Week post-treatment</time_frame>

    <measure>Pudendal Nerve Terminal Motor Latency</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (pre-treatment), 6 Month post-treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Pudendal Nerve Terminal Motor Latency is a measure of the time it takes for stimulation of the pudendal nerve to elicit contraction of the pelvic floor muscles and anal sphincter. It is a surrogate marker of pudendal nerve injuries and a means of ascertaining whether anal sphincter weakness is attributable to pudendal nerve injury, sphincter defect, or both.</description>

        <description>The Wexner Score (also known as the Cleveland Clinic Florida Incontinence Score) is a subject-completed questionnaire that asks about the frequency of incontinence to gas, liquid, solid, of the need to wear pads, and of lifestyle changes (scored on a frequency scale from 0 (=absent) to 4 (daily). An overall Wexner Score is computed from these five components and a score of 0 means perfect control and 20 means complete incontinence.</description>

        <title>Fecal Incontinence Symptoms as Measured by Symptom Severity Scale in Fecal Incontinence</title>
        <description>The Symptom Severity Scale in Fecal Incontinence is a subject-completed questionnaire that asks about the symptoms of fecal incontinence in the following areas: frequency, stool composition, stool amount, and degree of urgency. The total score is measured on a 0 (best) to 13 (worst) scale. Scores of 1–6, 7–10, and 11–13 were categorized as mild, moderate, and severe fecal incontinence, respectively.</description>

It is measured in each of four areas of depression (7 items), lifestyle (10 items), coping (9 items), and embarrassment (3 items). Area scores are measured on a 1 (worse) to 4 (best) scale and are each the average of their component individual item scores measured on the same scale.</description>

        <description>Pudendal Nerve Terminal Motor Latency is a measure of the time it takes for stimulation of the pudendal nerve to elicit contraction of the pelvic floor muscles and anal sphincter. It is a surrogate marker of pudendal nerve injuries and a means of ascertaining whether anal sphincter weakness is attributable to pudendal nerve injury, sphincter defect, or both.</description>
