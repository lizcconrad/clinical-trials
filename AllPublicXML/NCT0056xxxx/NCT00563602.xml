  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective trial of random distribution, open, parallel group, in which patients
      with esophagic variceal bleeding will be randomized into two treatment groups, after
      controlling acute bleeding. All patients received standard medical therapy with b-blockers
      and endoscopic ligation (LEV) of esophageal varices.

      The control group will be assigned to receive LEV + Nadolol + MNI. The experimental group
      will be assigned to receive treatment according to the hemodynamic response.

      All patients included in the experimental group received LEV and pharmacological treatment
      nadolol alone or combined with MNI or Prazosin (PZ)

      This is a prospective trial of random distribution, open, parallel group, in which patients
      with esophagic variceal bleeding will be randomized into two treatment groups, after
      controlling acute bleeding. All patients received standard medical therapy with b-blockers
      and endoscopic ligation (LEV) of esophageal varices.

      The control group will be assigned to receive LEV + Nadolol (N) + Isosorbide Mononitrate
      (MNI) The experimental group will be assigned to receive treatment according to the
      hemodynamic response.

      All patients included in the experimental group received LEV and pharmacological treatment
      nadolol alone or combined with MNI or Prazosin (PZ)

      A hepatic hemodynamic study will be performed to patients in both groups, at baseline (In
      which basal values and acute b-blockers response will be assessed), and a second study at the
      3 rd -4 th week after the drug therapy start, after the titration of the doses.

      In the experimental group, responders to the acute administration of b-blockers will receive
      LEV + Nadolol alone, and those patients with no response will receive LEV + N + MNI, and
      another hemodynamic study will be performed 3 rd -4 th week after the drug therapy start,
      after the titration of the doses, to assess response. The non-responders in this control
      study will switched to LEV+ N + PZ, and a 3erd hemodynamic study will be performed.

      Randomization will be stratified according to the degree of hepatic insufficiency, assessed
      by the Child-Pugh classification (classes A and B vs C)

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  All the patients admitted in emergencies in which 1) with gastrointestinal bleeding
             due to esophageal varices assessed by endoscopy, will be included.

          -  We define esophagic variceal bleeding as the endoscopic finding of any the following
             signs: 1) active variceal bleeding 2) clot or platelet cluster or 3 ) esophageal
             varices associated to red blood in esophagogastric lumen in the absence of other
             sources of bleeding.

          -  Clinical criteria and / or analytical, ultrasound and / or liver biopsy consistent
