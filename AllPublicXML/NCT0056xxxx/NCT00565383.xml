  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      We aim to answer the clinical question: Does combined spinal-epidural analgesia improve the
      success rate of external cephalic version? We hypothesize that neuraxial analgesia (spinal or
      epidural analgesia) during version for breech presentation increases successful fetal
      rotation and decreases the incidence of Cesarean delivery for malpresentation.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      At term 2 to 3% of singleton pregnancies are in breech presentation. Many of these deliveries
      are managed by cesarean delivery due to higher neonatal morbidity associated with vaginal
      breech delivery. Cesarean delivery, the safer option for the baby, however, is associated
      with a higher incidence of maternal complications for both the current and subsequent
      pregnancies. External cephalic version is a procedure commonly used to attempt to manually
      rotate the fetus into vertex position. This facilitates vaginal delivery and thus avoids
      higher maternal and/or neonatal complications.

      Obstetricians perform versions after 36 weeks gestational age with a reportable success rate
      of 30-80%. The most common technique involves external manipulation of the fetal position
      preceded by pharmacologic uterine relaxation. Pain relief is most commonly provided in the
      form of intravenous opioids such as fentanyl. A more efficacious form of analgesia is the use
      of neuraxial opioids and local anesthetics (neuraxial analgesia), a technique commonly used
      for labor and delivery analgesia.

      Although the use of neuraxial analgesia and anesthesia techniques improve maternal pain and
      satisfaction, there is conflicting evidence if they improve the success rate of version
      procedures. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) has stated,
      &quot;Currently there is not enough evidence to make a recommendation favoring or opposing
      anesthesia during ECV (external cephalic version) attempts.&quot;

      We propose to conduct a prospective, single blinded, randomized clinical trial to assess the
      impact of combined spinal-epidural analgesia on the success rate of external version for
      breech fetal position and the subsequent incidence of vaginal vs. Cesarean delivery as a
      secondary outcome.
