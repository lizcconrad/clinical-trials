  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Inhaled corticosteroids are largely used in patients with asthma or chronic obstructive lung
      diseases. The purpose of this study is to determine if the use of inhaled corticosteroids is
      associated with suppression of endogenous cortisol production, as seen in patients treated
      with pharmacologic doses of oral or parenteral steroids.

      The normalcy of the hypothalmic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis of enrolled subjects will be
      assessed by low dose (1mcg) corticotropin (ACTH)stimulation test. Serum cortisol levels will
      be measured before , 30 minutes and 60 minutes after 1 mcg ACTH intravenous injection.
