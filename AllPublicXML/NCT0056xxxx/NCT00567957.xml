      The purpose of this study is to determine whether remifentanil use in preeclamptic patients
      may blunt hemodynamic response to intubation during general anesthesia for cesarean section.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      General anesthesia for cesarean section involves rapid sequence induction with a muscle
      relaxant and barbiturate followed by endotracheal intubation. Although the use of opioids may
      blunt haemodynamic responses to endotracheal intubation, they are avoided in pregnant
      patients due to possible respiratory depressants effects on neonates.Preeclamptic patients
      response with exaggerated sympathoadrenal reflex to anesthesia induction and intubation. The
      resulting hypertension and tachycardia may result in cerebrovascular accident, pulmonary
      edema, arrhythmias, increased myocardial oxygen consumption and fetal hypoxia by uterine
      vasoconstriction. Several drugs have been used to blunt the hemodynamic disturbances to
      intubation, but none of them have been implicated for routine use for general anesthesia in
      preeclamptic patients.

      Recently remifentanil has started to be used in general anesthesia of high risk obstetric
      patients. Remifentanil is a Î¼-opioid receptor agonist that is metabolized by nonspecific
      blood and tissue esterase hydrolysis. It has a low distribution volume with a context
      sensitive half life of 3 minutes. Its elimination half life is 12 minutes even after repeated
      boli. Previously remifentanil use in pregnant patients with cardiac pathology has been
      reported with minimal neonatal side effects. A randomized controlled study in normal
      parturient has shown that remifentanil is transferred through placenta and may cause mild
      neonatal depression that is easily managed. Umbilical artery and vein remifentanil
      concentrations has shown that remifentanil is quickly redistributed or metabolized in fetus.
      Thus, remifentanil may be an appropriate drug for induction and maintenance of general
      anesthesia in severe preeclamptic patients.
