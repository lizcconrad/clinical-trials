    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to determine if inhaled nitric oxide, a potent and selective
      pulmonary vasodilator, is beneficial in patients with acute pulmonary embolism causing
      increased right ventricular afterload.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The early phase of severe pulmonary embolism is associated with high mortality. Right
      ventricular failure induced by the increase in right ventricular afterload is the final cause
      of deterioration leading to circulatory failure in patients who die from severe pulmonary
      embolism. Therefore, reduction of right ventricular afterload remains the central therapeutic
      strategy. In acute pulmonary embolism, the increase in pulmonary vascular resistance is
      caused by reduction in the cross-sectional area of the pulmonary vascular bed from
      obstructing emboli. Pulmonary arterial constriction further increases pulmonary vascular
      resistance, whereby vasoactive humoral factors may be contributing, which are released from
      activated platelets accumulating at the site of the clot. Consequently, administration of
      vasodilators of the pulmonary circulation may be regarded as a therapeutic option to
      antagonize increased pulmonary vasoconstriction or compensate for impaired vasodilation.
      Inhaled nitric oxide (NO) acts as a powerful selective pulmonary vasodilator. The aim of the
      study is to determine, if short-term inhalation of NO is beneficial in respiratory
      compromised patients with right ventricular dysfunction after acute pulmonary embolism.
