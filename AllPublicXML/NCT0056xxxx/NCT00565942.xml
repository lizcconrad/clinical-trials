  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Research over the last years have reported an increased popularity of complementary therapies
      (CTs) and an integration of CTs into mainstream medical settings, health care organizations
      and insurance plans. These trends may present both new challenges and new opportunities for
      health care provision. In Sweden and elsewhere, major challenges include the great variety
      and quality of CT provision within health care and a lack of national and international
      recommendations of how integrations of CTs with conventional care should be modelled, i.e.
      lack of conceptual models for delivering integrative medicine (IM). This may partly be a
      result of a scarce evidence base in support of IM provision within public health care
      services, e.g. lack of IM compared to usual care in randomised clinical trials. It remains
      largely unknown whether comprehensive models of IM are clinically or cost effectively
      different from conventional care provision.

      Back and neck pain are costly, conventionally managed in primary care and two of the most
      common conditions treated by CTs. We have developed a comprehensive collaborative consensus
      model for IM adapted to Swedish primary care. The aim of this pilot study is to explore if
      the developed IM model will help patients with back/neck pain better than usual primary care
      management, i.e. to test the hypothesis that IM would be more effective than treatment as
      usual.

    <description>In short, integrative care was up to 10 complementary therapy treatments delivered to the patient in addition to the usual care over an intervention period of up to 12 weeks. The integrative care was provided by a multidisciplinary team coordinated by a gate keeping general practitioner with clinical knowledge and experience of CTs and senior licensed/certified CT providers representing Swedish massage therapy, manual therapy/naprapathy, shiatsu, acupuncture and qigong.</description>

    <description>The usual care treatment was coordinated by the patient's general practitioner and complied with the clinical practice routines at the participating primary care units. Conventional procedures included but were not exclusive to advice, prescription of drugs, sick leave and physiotherapy/physical therapy. There were no constraints to the provided usual care as the study aimed to pragmatically reflect the general practitioners' standard care and treatment as usual.</description>
