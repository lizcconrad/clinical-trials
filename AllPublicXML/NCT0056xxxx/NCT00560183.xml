    <textblock>
      This study will explore the efficacy and safety of a fixed dose combination of morphine and
      oxycodone for management of acute postoperative pain. The study will explore the efficacy
      dose response and dosing interval required to maintain adequate analgesia at each tested
      dosage strength.

      This study is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, rising-dose/by-cohort study of
      the efficacy and safety of Q8003 in inpatients with acute pain following unilateral
      bunionectomy surgery. Patients in each dosing group will receive either Q8003 (approximately
      50 per dosing group) or placebo (approximately 13 per dosing group), determined by random
      sequential assignment and blinded to patients and managing Investigators. Dosing groups will
      be enrolled sequentially in ascending order; only one dosing group will be open at a time for
      enrollment.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patient is scheduled for bunionectomy surgery and is willing to stay in the study
             center for at least 48 hours from the initial dose of study medication post surgery.

          -  Females must be non-pregnant, non-lactating, and practicing an acceptable method of
             birth control, or be surgically sterile or postmenopausal (amenorrhea for ≥12 months).

          -  Patient has normal laboratory values or abnormal values judged not clinically
             significant by the Investigator for clinical chemistry and hematology (&lt; 1.5 ULN).

          -  Patient is in general good health based on physical examination, medical history and
             clinically acceptable results for the following assessments: vital signs and a 12-lead
             electrocardiogram (ECG).

          -  Patient gives written informed consent and is able to understand the requirements of
             the study, adhere to the study restrictions, and be available for the required
             follow-up assessment.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patient has a current acute or chronic disease that would interfere with evaluations
             of postoperative Q8003 efficacy or safety.

          -  Patient has a history of poor tolerance to short term opiate use in prior surgeries,
             based on patient self-report.

          -  Patient used opiates continuously (including tramadol) for more than five days in the
             past year.

          -  Patient has a history of pulmonary, cardiovascular, neurologic, endocrine, hepatic,
             gastrointestinal, or kidney disease or therapy that, in the opinion of the
             Investigator, would jeopardize the patient's well-being by participation in this
             study.

          -  Patient has positive HIV serology or signs of HIV infection or AIDS.

          -  Patient has positive HBsAg or HCV antibody.

          -  Patient is currently receiving any medications that are not at a stable dose (the same
             dose for &gt;2 month prior to date of surgery).

          -  Patient is currently receiving muscle relaxants, antipsychotic drugs, monoamine
             oxidase inhibitors, or any medications for the treatment of depression.

          -  Patient has used systemic corticosteroids within previous fourteen (14) days.

          -  Patient was dosed with another investigational drug within 30 days prior to the
             Screening Visit.

          -  Patient has current evidence of alcohol abuse (regularly drinks more than 4 units of
             alcohol per day; 1 unit = ½ pint of beer, 1 glass of wine, or 1 ounce of spirit).

          -  Patient has a history of abusing licit or illicit drug substances within five (5)
             years of study entry.

          -  Patient is obese with a body mass index &gt;32.
