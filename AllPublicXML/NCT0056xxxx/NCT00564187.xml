      Primary:

        -  To evaluate the efficacy of two regimens of irbesartan in patients responding but not
           normalized at 6 weeks of treatment (schema N°1: maintenance 150 mg/day, schema n°2: 300
           mg/day for 6 more weeks)

      Secondary:

        -  To evaluate the percentage of patients with DBP &lt; 90 mmHg at 6 and 12 weeks

        -  To evaluate the percentage of patients with SBP &lt; 140 mmHg at 6 and 12 weeks

        -  To evaluate rate of adverse events during the study
