  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A SpetiFast multiplex PCR kit has recently been placed on the market witch can evidence the
      DNA of 90% of micro-organisms (bacteria and fungus) implicated in sepsis. However, the
      clinical impact of being able to detect the DNA of these various agents is unknown. We
      propose to assess the benefit to patient care of the SeptiFast multiples PCR by answering
      three questions : 1/in patients with septic immunosuppression, does this kit evidence
      etiologic agents not revealed by classical methods? 2/Does the use of PCR results permit
      different diagnostic hypotheses to be considered? 3/Does having the SeptiFast results entail
      changes to the therapeutic plan?

      This study has double purpose :

        1. To compare the results obtained from the SeptiFast system with the results from
           classical microbiological sampling, in particular hemoculture, for immunosuppressed
           patients presenting sepsis.

        2. To perform a blind assessment of the benefit of septiFast care of these patients.
