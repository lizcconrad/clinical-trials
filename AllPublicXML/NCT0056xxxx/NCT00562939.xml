  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether TLR-9 adjuvanted pneumococcal is more
      immunogenic than pneumococcal vaccination alone in HIV-infected adults.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Pneumococcal disease is a major source of morbidity and mortality in HIV-patients.
      HIV-patients are vaccine hyporesponders. A good immune response to pneumococcal vaccination
      enhances vaccine effectiveness, thereby preventing the morbidity and mortality caused by
      pneumococcal disease. Even when an optimized regimen containing both conjugated and
      polysaccharide pneumococcal vaccine is used, only 13% of the immunized HIV patients are high
      responders at week 96. Recent data indicate that TLR9-agonists have excellent vaccine
      adjuvant potential and are safe to use in immunocompetent as well as immunocompromised
      individuals. The aim of this study is to evaluate the qualitative and quantitive immune
      response to pneumococcal vaccination with or without TLR9-agonist in HIV-infected adults
