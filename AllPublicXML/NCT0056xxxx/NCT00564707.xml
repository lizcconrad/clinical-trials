  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Purpose: To assess whether EMG directed biofeedback therapy or Botulinum toxin type A
      injection of the levator ani muscles has any effect on pain from the levator ani syndrome,
      and, in addition, to what extent either treatment is superior to the other in terms of
      anorectal physiologic measurements, and quality of life.

      Study Design: Randomized, prospective, unblinded double-armed study with crossover.

      Methodology: Female subjects, aged 18 and over, with painful levator ani muscle spasm for at
      least one month duration will be randomized to receive either biofeedback therapy or
      Botulinum toxin type A injection. After randomization they will all undergo visual analog
      pain scoring, anorectal manometry, colonoscopy (if clinically indicated), and self-reported
      SF-36 quality of life measurement. Each patient will also complete numerical pain scale
      scoring, an SF-36, and a satisfaction questionnaire at each treatment visit and follow-up
      visit. Patients will submit these by mail. Identification numbers will be assigned to each
      subject for use on the SF-36 and Satisfaction Questionnaires throughout the study. Subjects
      will again undergo anorectal manometry at the end of their treatment arms. In the biofeedback
      arm patients will be treated biweekly for up to eight treatments and be provided exercises to
      practice at home based on their muscle function noted during the biofeedback training
      session. Subjects will keep a treatment diary of the exercises they do at home to help ensure
      compliance with the protocol. In the Botulinum toxin injection arm patients will be treated
      with scheduled injections of the levator ani muscles every six weeks for up to three total
      injections of 100U each. These injections will be directed to the painful areas of the
      levator muscles as guided by physical exam and EMG measurements. Should any patient fail
      their initial randomized treatment assignment (failure defined as &quot;very dissatisfied&quot; or
      &quot;dissatisfied&quot; on the satisfaction questionnaire), they will then be allowed to cross over to
      the other study arm. In addition to numerical pain scale scoring, an SF-36 questionnaire and
      anorectal manometry will also be repeated at the time of crossover. We intend to include all
      randomized patients in the final data analysis (according to their originally assigned
      treatment arm), regardless of outcome or reason for dropout, thus making this an
      &quot;intent-to-treat&quot; analysis.

      Pivotal Study Definitions: The definition of adequate pain reduction, for the purposes of
      data analysis, will be a reduction in a subject's mean pain score of two on a numerical pain
      scale (0-10). Failure of either therapy will be defined as a response of &quot;very dissatisfied&quot;
      or &quot;dissatisfied&quot; on the satisfaction questionnaire at the end of either biofeedback (eight
      treatment visits) or Botulinum toxin (three injections) both before and after crossover.

      Outcomes: We will determine the following for biofeedback therapy and Botulinum toxin type A
      injection: mean pain reduction, any differences in anorectal physiologic measurements (such
      as mean resting anal sphincter pressure), any changes in self-reported quality of life, and
      overall patient satisfaction.
