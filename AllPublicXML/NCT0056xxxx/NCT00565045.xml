  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Impaired hand function is one of the most frequently persisting consequences of stroke. The
      purpose of this study is to investigate whether two different types of treatment improve
      recovery of hand function after stroke.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Loss of hand function is common after stroke. Previous research suggests that treatments that
      focus on movement of both hands at the same time or treatments that electrically stimulate
      the paretic (weak) hand muscles may help the recovery of hand function after stroke. In this
      study, two electrical stimulation treatments will be compared in their effectiveness in
      restoring hand movement and hand function. One of the treatments is stimulation only, and the
      other is stimulation linked to movement of the contralateral hand.

      Study participants will be stroke survivors who are enrolled while they are still within
      their first 6 months after their stroke. After enrolling, their hand movement and function
      will be tested. Then they will be randomly assigned to one of the two treatments. Each
      treatment will last 6 weeks. The treatment will require the participant to perform specific
      exercises at home for a total of 2 hours every day and to come to the laboratory twice a week
      for study-related occupational therapy. At the end of the 6-week treatment, tests of hand
      movement and hand function will be repeated. The same tests will be repeated again at 1 and 3
      months after the end of treatment to see if the effects of the treatment persist as time goes
      on. Changes in upper extremity impairment and activity limitation will be compared across
      treatment groups.

    <measure>Maximum Voluntary Finger Extension Angle (a Measure of Hand Impairment)</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months post-treatment.</time_frame>
    <description>A custom-built electrogoniometer recorded the angles of the metacarpophalangeal (MP) and proximal interphalangeal (PIP) joints of the index finger simultaneously. Participants were seated with the forearm and wrist supported and stabilized in a neutral posture. From this resting postion, they were instructed to extend their fingers as fully as possible in response to a 4-sec audio cue. The MP and PIP angles were added together, providing a composite measure of degree of finger extension, where 0 degrees corresponds to full extension of the MP and PIP joints. The more negative the angle, the more flexed the finger.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Finger Tracking Error</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months post-treatment.</time_frame>
    <description>A 30-sec 0.1Hz sine wave track scrolled from right to left on a computer screen in front of the participant. The amplitude of the sine wave was scaled to match the middle 70% of the participant's voluntary finger active range of motion (AROM). A cursor on the computer screen moved up and down as the participant extended and flexed their index finger. The task was to trace the scrolling sine wave with the cursor. Tracking error was the average vertical distance between the cursor and the target trace. Since the track was scaled to the participant's finger AROM, the distance between the cursor and the target trace (and therefore the tracking error) is in units corresponding to the percentage (%) of the participant's finger active range of motion (AROM), hereafter abbreviated %AROM.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Arm Motor Abilities Test</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months post-treatment.</time_frame>
    <description>The Arm Motor Abilities Test (AMAT) score is an average across 9 different compound activities of daily living (ADL) tasks composed of 1 to 3 component tasks, each of which was scored by a therapist using a 0 to 5 ordinal scale: 0, no attempt to use affected limb; 1, attempt to use affected limb but it doesn't participate functionally; 2, affected limb is used only as a helper or stabilizer; 3, affected limb is used slowly or within synergy patterns; 4, affected limb use almost normal; 5, normal use. Each of the 9 tasks is scored and then the average score across the 9 tasks is calculated, with a range of 0 to 5.</description>

    <measure>Fugl-Meyer Assessment (Upper Extremity)</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months post-treatment.</time_frame>
    <description>The participant was asked to perform specific coordinated and isolated shoulder, elbow, wrist, and hand movements. Each movement was rated by a therapist using a 3-point ordinal scale: 0, cannot perform; 1, perform partially; 2, perform fully) and summed to produce an overall score, with a range of 0 to 66 (the higher the score the better).</description>

        <title>Maximum Voluntary Finger Extension Angle (a Measure of Hand Impairment)</title>
        <description>A custom-built electrogoniometer recorded the angles of the metacarpophalangeal (MP) and proximal interphalangeal (PIP) joints of the index finger simultaneously. Participants were seated with the forearm and wrist supported and stabilized in a neutral posture. From this resting postion, they were instructed to extend their fingers as fully as possible in response to a 4-sec audio cue. The MP and PIP angles were added together, providing a composite measure of degree of finger extension, where 0 degrees corresponds to full extension of the MP and PIP joints. The more negative the angle, the more flexed the finger.</description>

        <title>Finger Tracking Error</title>
        <description>A 30-sec 0.1Hz sine wave track scrolled from right to left on a computer screen in front of the participant. The amplitude of the sine wave was scaled to match the middle 70% of the participant's voluntary finger active range of motion (AROM). A cursor on the computer screen moved up and down as the participant extended and flexed their index finger. The task was to trace the scrolling sine wave with the cursor. Tracking error was the average vertical distance between the cursor and the target trace. Since the track was scaled to the participant's finger AROM, the distance between the cursor and the target trace (and therefore the tracking error) is in units corresponding to the percentage (%) of the participant's finger active range of motion (AROM), hereafter abbreviated %AROM.</description>

          <title>CCFES</title>
          <description>CCFES - Contralaterally Controlled Functional Electrical Stimulation
Stimulation to finger and thumb extensors and flexors only in response to and with an intensity proportional to opening and closing of the contralateral unimpaired hand
A glove instrumented with sensors and worn on the unimpaired hand detects the degree of hand opening and determines stimulation intensity
Therapy sessions are done with the subject being assisted by the CCFES system.</description>

        <group group_id="E2">
          <title>cNMES</title>
          <description>cNMES - Cyclic NeuroMuscular Electrical Stimulation.
Preprogrammed cycles of finger and thumb flexor and extensor stimulation repeatedly and automatically close and open the hand without any effort or voluntary intent required by the subject.
Subject instructed to relax, not attempt to assist the stimulation, and not to move the contralateral arm/hand during stimulation
Therapy sessions are done without the stimulation system</description>
