      The objective of the study was to assess the prevalence, timing, and co-occurrence of
      positive screens for maternal postpartum depression (PPD) and intimate partner violence (IPV)
      for women bringing their young infants for pediatric primary care and examine relationships
      between PPD, IPV and children's healthcare utilization from birth to 2 years.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Post-partum depression (PPD) and intimate partner violence (IPV) negatively affect the health
      and well-being of millions of women each year. In turn, PPD and IPV frequently compromise
      women's ability to form a strong mother-infant bond, which potentially impacts their
      children's health and well-being. Limited information exists regarding the prevalence of PPD,
      IPV, and the co-occurrence of the two. Similarly, empirically tested interventions designed
      to improve outcomes for these women and their infants are lacking.

      The objective of the research was to assess the prevalence, timing, and co-occurrence of
      positive screens for maternal postpartum depression and intimate partner violence and examine
      their relationships with children's healthcare utilization from birth to 2 years.

      As per routine protocol in the Harriet Lane Clinic (HLC), all mothers bringing their infants
      for a well baby visit (birth to 6 month visit) are screened for PPD and IPV using a brief,
      self-administered paper-based questionnaire at the start of the visit. Appropriate resource
      and referral materials will be provided by a Family Support Counselor (FSC) in the clinic.
      Between February and March 2008, mothers bringing newborn, 2-, 4-, or 6-month-old children to
      an urban primary care clinic were screened for postpartum depression and intimate partner
      violence. A retrospective chart review abstracted demographic data, maternal responses on the
      postpartum depression/intimate partner violence screen at the initial and subsequent visits,
      and, from the child's birth to second birthday, adherence with well-child care and use of
      pediatric acute care and emergency department visits. Descriptive, bivariate, and
      multivariate analyses were conducted.
