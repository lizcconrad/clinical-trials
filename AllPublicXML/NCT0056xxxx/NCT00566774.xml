  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this randomized trial is to evaluate the effect of providing full
      prescription drug coverage (i.e. no co-pays, co-insurance or deductibles) for statins,
      beta-blockers, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers
      to patients recently discharged from hospital after acute myocardial infarction.

    <description>Patients randomized to first-dollar coverage will have their pharmacy benefits changed so that they have no out-of-pocket costs for any beta-blocker, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) or angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB) antagonist, or statin for every subsequent prescription after randomization. All co-pays and co-insurance will be waived at the point of care (i.e. pharmacy) as will any contribution that the cost of these drugs contributes to a patient's deductible</description>
