  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the effect of telaprevir on early hepatitis
      (inflammation of the liver) C virus (HCV) viral kinetics in treatment-naive participants who
      are chronically (lasting a long time) infected with genotype 2 or 3 HCV.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 2a multicenter (when more than one hospital or medical school team work on a
      medical research study), partially blinded, randomized (study drug assigned by chance)
      stratified (arrange in groups for analysis of results e.g., stratify by age, sex, etc.) for
      genotype, multiple dose study. The trial will consist of Screening period (6 weeks),
      Treatment period (24 or 26 weeks) and Follow-up period (24 weeks). The Treatment period will
      include 2 weeks investigational treatment phase and a 24 week standard treatment phase. All
      the eligible participants who were never treated for HCV will be enrolled for the trial and
      will receive the investigational treatment regimen to which they have been randomly assigned
      for 2 weeks. After this in the standard treatment phase participants will receive the
      standard treatment of care consisting of pegylated interferon (Peg-IFN)-alfa-2a 180 microgram
      once weekly and ribavirin (RBV) 400 milligram twice per day. Efficacy will primarily be
      evaluated by HCV viral load quantification. Participant's safety will be monitored throughout
      the study.

      <pre_assignment_details>Out of 26 participants infected with genotype 2 hepatitis C virus (HCV) who were randomly assigned to treatment, only 23 participants received treatment. 2 participants withdrew and 1 participant was infected with HCV genotype 4. All the 26 participants infected with genotype 3 HCV received treatment.</pre_assignment_details>

          <description>Participants who were never treated for chronic hepatitis (inflammation of liver) C genotype 2 received telaprevir (TVR) 750 milligram (mg) tablet orally 3 times a day during investigational treatment phase from Day 1 to Day 15. Participants were then treated with standard treatment regimen of pegylated interferon (Peg-IFN)-alfa-2a and ribavirin (RBV) from Day 15 to Week 26 (standard treatment phase). Each dose of Peg-IFN-alfa-2a 180 microgram (mcg) was administered as a subcutaneous injection once a week. RBV was taken orally as 400 mg tablets 2 times a day. Total duration of treatment was 26 weeks.</description>

Lower limit of quantification was 25 international units/milliliter (IU/ml) and limit of detection was 10 IU/ml.

        <description>Relapse was defined as confirmed detectable HCV RNA (&gt;=10 IU/ml) during the follow-up period up to 24 weeks after last medication intake and after previous undetectable HCV RNA (&lt; 10 IU/ml) at EOT. No relapse was defined as having no confirmed detectable HCV RNA (&gt;=10 IU/ml) during the follow-up period and after previous undetectable HCV RNA (&lt; 10 IU/ml) at EOT. Missing follow-up means no HCV RNA measurements during the follow-up period and after previous undetectable HCV RNA (&lt; 10 IU/ml) at EOT.
