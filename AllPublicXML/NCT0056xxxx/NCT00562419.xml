    <textblock>
      RATIONALE: CT-322 may stop the growth of glioblastoma multiforme by blocking blood flow to
      the tumor. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as irinotecan, work in different ways to stop the
      growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Giving
      CT-322 together with irinotecan may kill more tumor cells.

      PURPOSE: This phase 2 trial is studying the side effects, tolerability, and efficacy of
      CT-322 when given alone and in combination with irinotecan to patients with glioblastoma
      multiforme.
