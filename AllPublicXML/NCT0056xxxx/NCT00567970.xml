      RATIONALE: Stereotactic radiation therapy may be able to send x-rays directly to the tumor
      and cause less damage to normal tissue.

      PURPOSE: This phase I trial is studying the side effects and best dose of stereotactic
      radiation therapy in treating patients with liver metastases.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  To identify the maximum tolerated dose of stereotactic radiation therapy in patients
           with hepatic metastases.

        -  To determine the toxicity and adverse events profile of this patient population.

        -  To examine patient response, treatment effect on blood chemistry, and hematology values
           and patient quality-of-life in this patient population.

      OUTLINE: Patients are stratified according to stereotactic radiotherapy level (1 vs 2 vs 3)
      and the number of liver lesions present (1-2 vs 3-5 vs &gt; 5).

      Patients undergo percutaneous placement of metallic fiducial markers within the liver for
      stereotactic targeting and planning. Patients then undergo 1 fraction of stereotactic
      radiotherapy within 1 week of the marker placement.

      Patients complete Brief Pain Inventory and Brief Fatigue Inventory questionnaires to assess
      quality of life at weeks 2, 4, 6, 8 and months 3, 6, and 9 after completion of study
      treatment.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed for at least 8 weeks.
