  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Due to Quetiapine's particulars and the promising receptor profile, we want to examine the
      efficacy concerning relapse prevention of alcoholics suffering from persisting craving and/or
      affective symptoms (persisting sleep disorder, persisting excitement, persisting depressive
      symptoms, persisting anxiety symptoms) in comparison to matching placebo in a double-blind
      pilot study.

      We further want to compare the course of the above mentioned craving and affective symptoms
      under medication with quetiapine / matching placebo.

      Naltrexone and Acamprosate are the best evaluated and established therapy options in relapse
      prevention of alcoholics at present (Litten et al. 1996, Mann et al. 2004). Studies on cue
      exposure showed that Naltrexone (Monti et al. 1999) and Haloperidol (Modell et al. 1993)
      block stimuli triggered craving. In addition, they indicate that both may also stop the
      craving for further alcohol consumption that is induced by a priming dose of alcohol (Modell
      et al. 1993). However, the clinical relevance of Haloperidol is rather limited due to the
      risk of extrapyramidal side effects. New atypical dopamine antagonists are reported to have
      this profile as well, but without the risk of developing extrapyramidal side effects. In a
      placebo-controlled clinical trial, the atypical antipsychotic Olanzapine has proved to reduce
      craving for alcohol both after alcohol exposure and a priming dose of alcohol in
      non-dependent heavy social drinkers (Hutchison et al. 2001). However, Amisulpride in a dose
      of 50 mg per day failed to prevent alcohol relapse in a double-blind, placebo-controlled
      study in 71 patients over 6 months (Marra et al. 2002).

          -  Women of childbearing potential must use a medically accepted method of contraception.

        Only methods with a Pearl-index lower than 1% are regarded as acceptable such as hormonal
        contraception, surgical sterilization, bilateral ovarectomy, and postmenopause (WHO
        definition: natural menopause retrospectively for at least one year amenorrhoe) without
