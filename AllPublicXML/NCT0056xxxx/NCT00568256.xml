  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Ulcerative Colitis is an Inflammatory Bowel disease that is a life-long, relapsing disabling
      disorder. Current treatments for Ulcerative Colitis are not satisfactory. Most medications
      provide only partial relief, are not successful for at least 30% of patients, and have major
      negative side effects. Mounting evidence indicates that stress is one of the important
      triggers that activates symptoms of ulcerative colitis and therefore causes flare-up. The
      primary aim of this study is to see if either of two 8-week Mind-Body courses has an effect
      in reducing stress and affecting the course and severity of UC.

      Hypotheses: Stress causes Ulcerative Colitis flare-up and stress reduction will prevent
      Ulcerative Colitis flare-up.

      Methods: We will enroll 100 subjects in a Phase I/IIa randomized, double-blind,
      placebo-controlled trial. Subjects will be assigned to one of two Mind/Body courses, each of
      which will be held once a week for 8 consecutive weeks. Each class will last 1.5-2 hours.
