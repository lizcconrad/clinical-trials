      The purpose of this study is to evaluate markers of immune response in human tumor samples.

      Cancer immunotherapy has been shown to be effective in isolated instances, but ineffective in
      most patients. The reason for this inconsistency, and the conditions necessary for successful
      immunotherapy, are not well understood. Our studies in animal tumor models indicate that the
      effectiveness of IL-12-based immunotherapy depends upon the presence of a preexisting immune
      response to the tumor. The presence of T cell infiltrates and IFN-gamma expression in tumor
      indicate such an immune response. We therefore plan to evaluate the existing immune response
      in human tumor samples in an effort to identify those patients most likely to respond to
      therapy with IL-12.
