  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test the safety and tolerability of tivozanib (AV-951) and
      Torisel™ given in combination for renal cell cancer. The study will also assess the effects
      of the combination of tivozanib (AV-951) and Torisel™ on the tumor. Tivozanib (AV-951) is a
      VEGF-receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor, and may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking
      blood flow to the tumor. Temsirolimus is an mTOR inhibitor which is approved for the
      treatment of advanced renal cell carcinoma.

      This is a Phase 1b, open-label, dose-finding study of tivozanib (AV-951) in combination with
      temsirolimus to include approximately 36 subjects with metastatic renal cell carcinoma
      (mRCC). This study is designed to evaluate the safety, tolerability, dose-limiting toxicities
      (DLT), maximum tolerated dose (MTD), pharmacokinetic, pharmacogenomic, and antineoplastic
      activity of tivozanib (AV-951) when administered in combination with temsirolimus. Tivozanib
      (AV-951) will be administered once daily for 3 weeks beginning on Day 1 of Cycle 1, followed
      by 1 week off (1 cycle = 4 weeks). Temsirolimus will be administered intravenously once
      weekly starting on Day 8 of Cycle 1.
