      The objectives of this trial are: to establish a safety profile for use of Hydroxyurea in
      children with Type I Spinal Muscular Atrophy; to identify reliable outcome measures for HU
      treatment in Type I SMA; and to detect the clinical efficacy of HU treatment in children with
      Type I SMA.

    <textblock>
      SMA is a neuromuscular disorder characterized by degeneration of spinal cord motor neurons
      and muscular atrophy. SMA is classified into three clinical subtypes according to the
      severity and age of onset (Types I, II and III). Type I SMA (also called severe, infantile or
      acute SMA, or Werdnig-Hoffman disease) is the most severe phenotype. The onset of symptoms is
      within the first 6 months of life, and weakness of intercostal muscles and lack of airway
      protection lead to respiratory insufficiency and aspiration pneumonia, often resulting in
      early infant death.

      In our laboratory, our preliminary results indicate that HU treatment significantly increases
      both SMN mRNA expression and intact SMN protein levels in vitro. These data confirm previous
      observations that in vitro treatments of SMA lymphocytes with hydroxyurea resulted in
      augmentation of the SMN2 gene expression in a dose and time related manner. Based on these
      exciting pre-clinical data, coupled with the well-documented side-effect profile of HU in
      children, we are conducting a pilot clinical trial using HU in children with Type I SMA. This
      clinical trial study is intended to establish the safety profile in children with Type I SMA;
      to identify reliable outcome measures; and to detect the possible clinical efficacy of HU
      treatment in children with Type I SMA.
