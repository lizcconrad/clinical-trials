  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to measure the relative &quot;barrier&quot; function of the top layer of
      the cornea (called the epithelium), or the degree to which the cornea can prevent the
      penetration of the colored dye sodium fluorescein into the eye. This is a clinical
      investigation of the effect on corneal barrier function following wear of two contact lens
      materials and two contact lens care systems, approved for marketing in the US by the Food and
      Drug Administration. These contact lenses will be worn for two hours, following soak in one
      of two marketed contact lens disinfecting solutions. Approximately 25 young, adapted contact
      lens wearers will participate.

               -  Understand your rights as a research subject and give written informed consent by
                  signing the Informed Consent Form, Subject Bill of Rights, and Patient
                  Authorization for Use and Release of Health and Research Study Information (HIPAA
                  form).

               -  Be likely to finish the entire study, understand the study instructions, and be
                  willing to follow the instructions.

               -  Contact lens prescription between +4.00 D to -9.00 D (spherical equivalent).

               -  Best correctable visual acuity of at least 20/40 in each eye.

               -  Willing to de-adapt (do not wear) from habitual contact lenses for periods of
                  three days prior to barrier function determination.

               -  Possess a functional spectacle prescription to allow adequate vision during the
                  de-adaptation and barrier function determination periods.

               -  No known ocular or systemic allergies, which may interfere with contact lens
                  wear.

                  lens wear (i.e. antihistamines, beta-blockers, steroids).

                  scale), corneal blood vessel growth) (vascularization), corneal staining, bulbar
                  redness, tarsal redness, or any other abnormality of the cornea that may cause
                  unsafe contact lens wear.

               -  Any active ocular infection.

               -  Prior corneal refractive surgery (i.e., LASIK, PRK, etc).

               -  Have used medications within 24 hours of study entry or have an ongoing need to

               -  Have a medical condition that your study eye doctor thinks may make it not
