  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Asthma is a chronic inflammatory condition in which the airways develop increased
      responsiveness to various stimuli such as exposure to an allergen, cold air or exercise. It
      is characterized by airway hyper-responsiveness, inflammation, increased mucus production,
      and airway obstruction. Since inflammation is an important feature of asthma, the use of
      non-invasive tests to measure lung inflammation to monitor asthma are of interest.The purpose
      of the study is to relate costs associated with healthcare utilization and loss of work and
      school time to the primary health outcome of cumulative number of symptom-free days. This
      will enable the researchers to determine whether the costs of monitoring exhaled NO to
      regular management strategy in recently diagnosed asthma will be offset by reductions in
      other costs of asthma-related care, and, if not, whether the additional costs are likely to
      be acceptable in terms of the improvement in health outcomes as measured by the additional
      number of symptom-free days.
