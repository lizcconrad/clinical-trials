  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Idiopathic or functional constipation is a common disorder, affecting up to 20% of the
      population depending on demographic factors, the sampling situation and the definitions used.
      Constipation is a symptom of many diseases and is a collective term, used by the patient to
      imply that stools are too hard, too infrequent or too difficult to pass. A recent survey
      conducted in Hong Kong showed a prevalence of 14% according to the Rome criteria. Based on an
      epidemiological study in US, there were 2.5 million annual physician visits for this problem.
      Exact epidemiological data however are lacking, mainly because of the difference between
      self-reported constipation and scientifically defined constipation.

      Treatment of constipation is usually based on increased dietary fiber and supplementation
      with bulking agents, exercise, and habit training. However, often only partial relief is
      obtained, and the majority of patients use non-bulking laxatives on a regular basis without
      medical supervision. Chronic use of non-bulking laxatives is often inappropriate3, and may
      lead to side effects such as dependency and progressive tolerance, electrolyte imbalance,
      and, for the anthraquinones, melanosis coli. In addition, stimulant laxatives may damage the
      myenteric plexus4, resulting in cathartic colon5. A more appropriate approach to the therapy
      of constipation consists of physiologically stimulating intestinal motility.

      Tegaserod, an aminoguanidine indole compound, is a representative of a new class of 5-HT4
      agonists, with regard to both chemistry and pharmacology. Activation of 5-HT4 receptors
      triggers the release of neurotransmitters from the enteric nerves resulting in increased
      contractility and stimulation of the peristaltic reflex.

      In animal models, tegaserod acts as a motility-enhancing agent, exerting activity throughout
      the gastrointestinal tract11. Tegaserod has also been shown to significantly accelerate bowel
      transit in healthy volunteers and in patients with constipation-predominant irritable bowel
      syndrome (C-IBS).

      Based on the pharmacodynamic properties, tegaserod is a promotile compound suitable for the
      treatment associated with small and/or large bowel dysfunction e.g. constipation.

      From phase III adequate and well-controlled studies in patients with C-IBS it has been shown
      that tegaserod was effective in relieving symptoms of C-IBS. The effect was seen as early as
      the first week of treatment with sustained effects over 12 weeks. Both tegaserod 4 mg/d (2 mg
      bid) and 12 mg/d (6 mg bid) significantly increased bowel frequency and decreased stool
      consistency. It is proposed to test both doses for the phase III program in chronic
      constipation.

      The aim of this study is to demonstrate the effect of tegaserod on bowel habits in patients
      suffering from chronic idiopathic constipation.

        Inclusion Criteria for entry into the study (Performed at screening):

          -  Male and females of at least 18 years of age (no upper limit).

          -  History of constipation for at least 12 months before screening. Constipation is
             defined as follows: less than three spontaneous bowel movements per week that result
             in a feeling of complete evacuation, and one or more of the following:

               -  At least 25% of the stools are very hard and/or hard stools (Type 1 and/or 2 on
                  the Bristol Stool Form scale)14,

               -  Sensation of incomplete evacuation following at least 25% of the bowel movements

               -  Straining on at least 25% of the defecations The above criteria are only
                  applicable for spontaneous bowel movements, i.e. not preceded within a period of
                  24 hours by the intake of a laxative agent or by the use of an enema. Patients
                  who never have spontaneous bowel movements (that is, all bowel movements are
                  preceded by laxatives) are considered constipated and eligible for the study.

          -  Patients who are able to communicate well with the investigator and to comply with the
             requirements for the entire study, including the withdrawal period.

          -  Patients who provide written informed consent before participating in the study after
             being given a full description of the study.

        Exclusion Criteria for entry into the study (Performed at screening):

          -  With a history of fecal impaction which necessitated surgical intervention

          -  Whose chronic constipation, according to the investigator's clinical judgment, is
             thought to be a result of: bowel surgery, gynecological surgery, neurologic disorders
             (e.g. aganglionosis, hypoganglionosis, autonomic neuropathy, Parkinson's disease,
             spinal cord injury or tumor, cerebrovascular accidents, multiple sclerosis), systemic
             sclerosis, myloidosis, scleroderma, myotonic dystrophy

             outlet obstruction, congenital anorectal malformation, rectocele, intestinal
             carcinoma, inlammatory bowel disease.

          -  An endoscopic/radiologic bowel evaluation (colonoscopic examination and/or a
             sigmoidoscopy + barium enema) is required in order to rule out cancer, inflammatory
             bowel disease or other structural disease. This evaluation must have been performed
             within the past 5 years. In addition, there should not be history or evidence of
             weight loss, anemia or rectal bleeding since the evaluation was performed.

          -  Existence of surgical or medical conditions which interfere with the absorption,
             distribution, metabolism and excretion of the study medication.

          -  With hypo or hyper thyroidism (clinically significant abnormal TSH level at screening)

          -  With clinical evidence (including physical exam, vital signs, ECG, laboratory tests)
             of significant cardiovascular, respiratory, renal, hepatic, gastrointestinal,
             hematology, endocrine or metabolic disorders, neurologic disease, or of any disease
             that may interfere with the patient successfully completing the study . Patient with
             insulin-dependent diabetes are excluded from the study.

          -  With psychosis, schizophrenia, mania or major psychiatric illness needing
             pharmacological treatment. A well-compensated depression does not exclude a potential
             patient.

          -  With symptoms of a significant clinical illness in the two weeks preceding baseline.

          -  With other relevant intercurrent medical condition that may interfere with the
             objectives of the study.

          -  Women who are pregnant or breast-feeding.

          -  Fertile women who are not currently using or complying with a medically approved
             method of contraception such as, but not exclusively, one of the following:Oral birth
             control pills administered for at least 1 full monthly cycle prior to study medication
             administration, Progesterone implanted rods inserted for at least 1 month prior to
             study medication administration, Intra-uterine device (IUD), Medroxyprogesterone

             barrier methods (such as condoms and spermicide), Abstinence, when in the opinion of
             the investigator, their occupation or life style gives sufficient evidence that
             abstinence will be maintained throughout the study and for 1 month thereafter. In the
             case of abstinence, it should be recorded in the source documents that the patient was
             appropriately counseled.

        Fertile woman is defined as a woman who is not surgically sterile (i.e. hysterectomy,
        bilateral oophorectomy or bilateral tubal ligation), or is not post-menopausal (a
        post-menopausal patient is defined as a patient who has not menstruated for 12 months or

             the start of the treatment period.

          -  Who did not comply with completing the daily diary assessments. To be randomized, a
             patient must have at least 11 days of complete daily diary data during the last 14
             days of the baseline period.

          -  Who did not comply with completing the weekly diary assessments. To be randomized, a
             patient must have completed at least 1 complete weekly diary assessment during the
             last 14 days of the baseline period.
