  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to look at how people respond to the treatment of warts through
      use of the Candida antigen to get an immune response to rid the body of human papillomavirus
      (HPV). The immune system is the part of the body that fights infections like HPV which causes
      warts. This research study will examine the response of your wart when injected with a
      portion of a common yeast (candida) which is the study drug. Your immune system response will
      also be looked at by doing a test called an ELISPOT assay. This test is done on blood
      samples. The results of this test may help us to determine how the Candida antigen affects
      your wart.

      The use of recall antigens for treating warts is not yet Food and Drug Administration (FDA)
      approved. The primary goal of this work was to assess the safety of Candin as an
      investigational new drug (IND) for the treatment of warts. In addition, clinical resolution
      of treated and untreated warts was evaluated and immunologic responses were examined using an
      ex vivo interferon-γ enzyme-linked immunospot (IFN-γ ELISPOT) assay in order to elucidate the
      immunologic mechanisms behind the successful regression of warts in patients undergoing
      Candin injection immunotherapy.

    <description>When the participant completed the protocol, clinical resolution of the injected wart was determined by the overall percentage of resolution from the initial visit. Participants were classified as 'complete responders' if they had complete resolution of the injected wart, 'partial responders' if the injected wart regressed between 25% and 99%, and 'non-responders' if they had not achieved at least 25% regression of the injected wart.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects must be ages 18-50.

          -  Female subjects of child-bearing potential must have a negative urine pregnancy test
             before each treatment.

          -  Female subjects of child-bearing potential agree to use a reliable form of birth-
             control as the risks associated with candida antigens during pregnancy are not known.

          -  Subjects must have two or more cutaneous, non-genital, non-facial warts.

          -  Subjects must be able to provide written, informed consent.

          -  Subjects must be willing to comply with the requirements of the protocol.

          -  Subjects vital signs must be within the following parameters at time of enrollment:

               -  Blood Pressure - &lt;150/95 mmHg

               -  Temperature - &lt;100.4° F

               -  Pulse Rate - 50 to 100 beats/minute

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects who have a history of disease or treatment that has caused the subject to be
             immunosuppressed to include, but not limited to, cancer, HIV, or organ
             transplantation. Immunosuppression will be determined only by medical history.
