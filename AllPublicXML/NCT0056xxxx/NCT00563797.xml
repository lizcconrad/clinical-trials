      The objective of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of mecamylamine (MEC, 10 mg/day)
      versus placebo in reducing depressive and alcohol symptoms in patients with depression and
      co-morbid alcohol dependence. The researchers hypothesize that MEC will significantly reduce
      depressive symptoms and decrease alcohol consumption compared to placebo in patients with
      depression and alcohol dependence who are on a stable dose of a selective serotonin reuptake
      inhibitor (SSRI).

      Depression with co-morbid alcohol dependence is very prevalent and it is very costly to
      treat. The co occurrence of the two disorders leads to greater severity and worse long-term
      outcome, including suicide. Although a number of treatment strategies have been implemented
      for depressed patients with alcohol dependence the controversy concerning best treatment
      options for those patients persists.

      The clinical relationship between depression and alcohol dependence suggests some common
      mechanism underlying both disorders. It has been hypothesized that medications that block
      presynaptic nAChR may be effective in the treatment of alcoholism and depression.
      Mecamylamine (Inversine ®) is a noncompetitive, high affinity nAChR antagonist with low
      selectivity for the alpha-7 receptor. Mecamylamine has never been investigated as an
      effective adjunct treatment for dually diagnosed patients with depression and alcohol
      dependence. Methods: Thirty participants with a current diagnosis of depression and alcohol
      dependence will be recruited for this 12-week treatment study. Fifteen participants will be
      randomized to mecamylamine and fifteen to placebo. Participants will be included in the study
      if: they meet current DSM-IV criteria for Major Depression and Alcohol Dependence and have
      been on a stable SSRI dose for 2 weeks. All participants will come weekly to take their
      medications and complete weekly assessments. Weekly assessments will consist of questioners
      that will assess depressive symptoms and alcohol consumption over the entire treatment
      period. Significance: This study is the first to evaluate the efficacy of mecamylamine as an
      augmenting agent for treatment of depression and alcohol dependence.

    <description>The Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D) has proven useful for many years as a way of determining a patient's level of depression before, during, and after treatment. It should be administered by a clinician experienced in working with psychiatric patients.
Although the HAM-D form lists 21 items, the scoring is based on the first 17. It generally takes 15-20 minutes to complete the interview and score the results. The Scale ranges from 0 (normal) to &gt;23 (Very Severe Depression)</description>

          <title>Total Alcohol Dependence Scale (ADS) score</title>
          <description>The Alcohol Dependence Scale is made of 25 items that cover alcohol withdrawal symptoms, impaired control over drinking, awareness of a compulsion to drink, increased tolerance to alcohol, and salience of drink-seeking behavior. The scale can range from 0 to 47. The higher the value the greater the dependence. A score of 9 or more is highly predictive of DSM diagnosis of alcohol dependence. More specifically, a score from 1-13 indicates low dependence, 14-21 indicates intermediate, 22-30 indicates substantial, and 31-47 severe level of alcohol dependence.</description>

          <description>The Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D) has proven useful for many years as a way of determining a patient’s level of depression before, during, and after treatment. It should be administered by a clinician experienced in working with psychiatric patients.
Although the HAM-D form lists 21 items, the scoring is based on the first 17. It generally takes 15-20 minutes to complete the interview and score the results. The Scale ranges from 0 (normal) to &gt;23 (Very Severe Depression)</description>

Data were calculated as number of heavy drinking days (heavy drinking days is defined as 5 drinks on a single occasion for men and 4 for women) over the number of days in the study for smokers and non smokers receiving either mecamylamine or placebo.</description>
