      In this study, we investigate the role of Cardiac Magnetic Resonance Imaging in patients with
      suspected, but not yet proven, &quot;acute cardiac syndrome ACS&quot;. Patients are included if they
      presented to the local Emergency Department with chest pain, but the first tests in the
      Emergency Department are negative or not clearly indicative of cardiac ischemia. For example,
      the first lab value Troponin T is negative or borderline elevated; or the first ECG is not
      clearly indicative of ischemia. The standard procedure for these patients is to wait 4-6
      hours and then repeat the test; if they continue to be negative, the patients are discharged
      home, if the have become positive, an invasive coronary artery angiography has to be
      performed. We think, that a CMR study can shorten the time needed to make the decision of
      either &quot;discharge&quot; or &quot;admit to CCU and perform a coronary artery angiography&quot;. CMR has been
      shown to be the gold standard for heart function (thus, can see even subtle wall motion
      abnormalities), for tissue characterization (so-called T2-weighted images can identify tissue
      edema (swelling); perfusion images can identify areas with reduced blood supply; late
      enhancement images can safely identify fibrotic or irreversibly damaged tissue) and can even
      be used to stress the patients to exclude a critical or non-critical narrowing of coronary
      arteries.

      The primary endpoint of this study will be the impact of CMR on the time-to-decision in these
      patients.

      It should be possible to a) identify all patients WITH an acute infarct by CMR and send them
      to a cath lab sooner compared to waiting for a second test; b) identify all patients WITHOUT
      an acute infarct and c) perform a stress test in those patients to exclude severe coronary
      artery disease.

      Background

      Unstable angina (UA) and non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) are serious forms of
      acute coronary syndromes1. They require rapid clinical assessment, diagnosis and
      therapeutical intervention. A delay in the diagnosis and a delay in treatment may lead to
      serious complications such as ventricular arrhythmias, heart failure and sudden cardiac
      death. In NSTEMI, time delay to diagnosis might lead to irreversible loss of salvageable
      myocardium.

      The current recommendations of the American Heart Association for the management of patients
      with UA/ NSTEMI rely on the patient's symptoms, ECG changes and serum markers (Troponin) 1.
      The algorithm for diagnosis and therapy is straight-forward for patients presenting with
      positive Troponin and/ or ongoing ECG changes; however, an up to 8 hours delay occurs in a
      patient presenting with chest pain, but without diagnostic ECG changes and negative Troponins
      (figure 1). During this period, repeat ECGs are recommended to observe changes, and the
      Troponin test will be repeated at 8 hours.

      This delay in diagnosis and treatment might be abbreviated by the diagnosis of UA/NSTEMI with
      the help of cardiac MRI.

      A growing body of evidence supports the capability of MRI to diagnose and rule out UA/
      NSTEMI:

      In 2003, Kwong et al could show that CMR has not only a high sensitivity and specificity for
      detecting acute coronary syndromes in the Emergency Room, but it also was the strongest
      predictor of acute coronary syndromes as compared to ECG, Troponin and a TIMI risk score ≥3.
      The method appeared suitable for triage of patients presenting with chest pain to the
      Emergency Room; it was also found to be very safe2. In another study, Plein et al found that
      CMR could be useful to diagnose coronary artery disease with high sensitivity and specificity
      in patients presenting to the Emergency Room with chest pain3. Furthermore, it was recently
      shown that in patients presenting to the ER with chest pain, in whom negative Troponin tests
      had excluded an acute coronary syndrome, an adenosine stress CMR study was a very powerful
      predictor of adverse outcomes if positive for perfusion deficits, and a powerful negative
      predictor if no perfusion deficits were found4.

      CMR can visualize irreversible myocardial injury, even if those lesions affect as little as
      less than 2 grams of myocardial tissue5. Our own data show that CMR is an accurate tool to
      diagnose acute myocardial infarcts, when T2-weighted imaging for the detection of acute edema
      is used in conjunction with imaging for irreversible injury6; we also showed that
      irreversible myocardial injury can be detected as soon as 1 hour after infarction7.

      Although it has been shown that CMR can diagnose UA/ NSTEMI2, 3 as well as rule those out
      with an excellent negative predictive and prognostic value4, it has not been shown whether
      CMR can lead to a shortening of time-to-diagnosis. It has also not been studied yet, whether
      or not the incorporation of CMR into the diagnostic pathway would be cost-efficient.

      Hypothesis:

      Cardiac MRI can shorten the time to diagnosis of acute coronary syndromes in patients
      presenting with a differential diagnosis of UA/NSTEMI, in whom the initial ECG and Troponin
      tests are non-diagnostic.

      The implementation of CMR into the diagnostic pathway is cost efficient.

      Methods:

      We will examine patients admitted to the ER with chest pain suggestive of a first acute
      coronary syndrome. If the initial ECG and Troponin tests are inconclusive and the patient is
      supposed to wait for a second Troponin test, an urgent CMR study will be performed to
      diagnose UA/NSTEMI (see figure 2).

      The time will be measured from the initial Troponin test to the second decisive Troponin test
      (control variable). The time will as well be measured from the first Troponin test to the
      result of the CMR test (test variable).

      In patients with a negative CMR study, the CMR study will be extended by a stress perfusion
      study, and the time will be measured from first negative Troponin to the result of the stress
      test (test variable). In patients in whom the second Troponin returns negative, and a
      conventional stress test is scheduled for further diagnostic work-up (independent of the CMR
      test), the time from the first Troponin to the result of the stress test will be measured.

      The CMR study will be performed to assess

        1. LV function (global and regional function)

        2. Myocardial edema

        3. Myocardial perfusion at rest

        4. Myocardial infarction

        5. If all of the above do not show any pathological result: adenosine stress perfusion

      The following protocol will be used for the CMR study:

        -  Localizer

        -  LV function in multiple long axes

        -  T2w STIR in 3 short axis views

        -  BOLD study in 3 short-axis views

        -  Rest perfusion study in 3 long axes and 1 short axis view

        -  Late enhancement study

        -  If all of the above do not show any pathological result: stress perfusion study with
           adenosine in 3 long axes and 1 short axis views

      The study will be rated positive for an Acute Coronary Syndrome if any one or more of the
      following will be present:

        -  Regional wall motion abnormality (in the presence of late enhancement: regional wall
           motion abnormality in conjunction with positive STIR, or regional wall motion
           abnormality exceeding the area of late enhancement)

        -  Regional myocardial edema on the STIR images

        -  Regional perfusion deficit (in presence of late enhancement: regional perfusion deficit
           exceeding the area of late enhancement)

        -  If performed: stress-induced perfusion deficit

      The CMR study will be positive for coronary artery disease, but without Acute Coronary
      Syndrome, when the following criteria will be met:

      - Late enhancement without corresponding high signal on STIR, and with or without a regional
      wall motion abnormality corresponding to but not exceeding the area of late enhancement
