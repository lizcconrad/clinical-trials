  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 3, randomized, double blinded, placebo-controlled study designed to compare
      the safety, tolerability, antiviral activity and immunological effect of raltegravir added to
      a previously stable HAART regimen in the treatment of HIV-1 infected subjects with
      undetectable viraemia and low CD4 recovery.

      HYPOTHESIS:

      Adding raltegravir to a stable HAART in patients with undetectable plasma viral load and low
      CD4 recovery will result in further viral suppression and therefore higher CD4 recovery.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Although HAART has reduced the morbidity and mortality from HIV-1 infection, some patients
      experience a discordant response characterized by HIV-1 RNA plasma levels below the limit of
      detection and low CD4 T-cell recovery (immunologic discordant responders). At present,
      recommendations for the clinical management of patients with discordant responses to
      antiretroviral therapy are largely based on observational, uncontrolled data.

      The effect on CD4 count of adding raltegravir in already undetectable patients has not yet
      been evaluated.

      The primary purpose of this study is to assess the ability of the HIV-1 integrase inhibitor,
      raltegravir, added to a stable HAART, to increase CD4 count in patients with undetectable
      plasma viral load and low CD4 recovery.
