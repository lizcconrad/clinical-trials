  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Depression is a serious illness that affects a person's mood, thoughts, and physical
      well-being. There are multiple types of depressive disorders, with major depressive disorder
      being one of the most common. The following symptoms may be signs of major depression:
      persistent feelings of anxiety, guilt, or hopelessness; irregular sleep and appetite
      patterns; lethargy; disinterest in previously enjoyed activities; excessive irritability and
      restlessness; suicidal thoughts; and inability to concentrate. Despite the widespread use of
      drug treatment for major depression in the United States, it continues to be underutilized in
      the Hispanic population. The retention rate in antidepressant therapy (ADT) among the
      Hispanic population is half that of the Caucasian population. It is believed that cultural
      factors and ambivalence toward seeking treatment interfere with ADT retention in Hispanic
      adults. Motivational antidepressant therapy (MADT) involves the use of motivational
      interviewing (MI) to discuss treatment with patients. This study will compare the
      effectiveness of culturally-specific MADT versus standard antidepressant therapy (SADT) in
      treating Hispanic adults with major depression.

      Participants in this single-blind study will be randomly assigned to receive either MADT or
      SADT. A psychiatrist will conduct all medication visits and will recommend an initial
      antidepressant for each participant. Depending on treatment assignment, psychiatrists will
      use either the MADT or SADT approach in the medication visits. During the visits,
      participants will complete questionnaires, undergo vital sign measurements, and receive
      medication. Medication visits will occur weekly during the first two weeks, every 2 weeks for
      the next 6 weeks, and then on a monthly basis until the end of the study. In addition to
      visits with the psychiatrist, participants will complete 15-minute individual interviews with
      a clinician from the Hispanic Treatment Program. Individual interviews will take place every
      2 weeks in the first month of treatment, monthly until the third month, and then every other
      month thereafter. The association between treatment, retention, and response will be assessed
      after 3 months of treatment. Preliminary outcome data will be obtained after 6 more months of
      continued treatment. After the end of treatment, participants may randomly be asked to
      participate in a small &quot;focus group&quot; to discuss personal experiences with study treatments.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Days in ADT (Retention)</measure>
    <time_frame>Measured at Months 3 and 9</time_frame>
    <description>A continuous measure of the total number of days in treatment, based on visit attendance. At each kept visit, patients will be credited as having been in treatment for the number of days since their last scheduled visit. For example, patients attending sessions on weeks 0, 1, and 12 would have been in treatment for 35 days (7 [week 0 to week 1] + 28 [week 8 to week 12]).</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Mean of Depressive Symptoms Over 36-week Follow-up Using Hamilton Depression Scale -17-item Version (Symptoms)</measure>
    <time_frame>HAMD-17 assessed at follow-up weeks 2, 4, 8, 12, 20, 28, and 36.</time_frame>
    <description>Depressive symptoms were assessed using the 17-item standard clinician-administered version of the Hamilton Depression Scale (HAMD-17). We analyzed the HAMD-17 score, calculated as the sum of the individual items and ranging from 0 to 35 with higher numbers indicating more symptoms. HAMD-17 was assessed at baseline and the follow-up visits specified below.
We calculated the model-estimated mean of the HAMD-17 over 36 weeks using repeated measures.</description>

    <measure>Mean Disability Over 36-week Follow-up Using Sheehan Disability Scale (Impairment)</measure>
    <time_frame>SDS at follow-up weeks 2, 4, 8, 12, 20, 28, and 36.</time_frame>
    <description>Psychosocial functioning was assessed using the Sheehan Disability Scale (SDS), a self-report instrument composed of three visual analog subscales assessing degree of disruption caused by symptoms in three domains: work, social/leisure activities, and family/home life. We analyzed the 3 subscale scores for the 3 domains separately which ranged from 0 to 10 with higher scores indicating worse functioning. The SDS was assessed at baseline and the follow-up visits specified below. We calculated the model-estimated mean of the SDS over 36 weeks using repeated measures.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Mean Perceived Quality of Life Over 36-week Follow-up Using Quality of Life Enjoyment and Satisfaction Questionnaire (QLESQ)</measure>
    <time_frame>QLESQ at follow-up weeks 2, 4, 8, 12, 20, 28, and 36.</time_frame>
    <description>Quality of life was assessed using the 16-item Short Form of the Quality of Life Enjoyment and Satisfaction Questionnaire (QLESQ), a self-reported measure of quality of life in 8 domains that is sensitive to depressive symptom severity and treatment response. We analyzed the QLESQ total score as a percentage of the maximum possible score (ranging from 0-100) to facilitate comparisons across areas of functioning. It was calculated as such: % Max = (Raw score - minimum possible score) / (maximum possible score-minimum possible score) where raw score is the sum of the first 14 items. Higher numbers indicate better quality of life, greater enjoyment, and satisfaction. The QLESQ was assessed at baseline and the follow-up visits specified below. We calculated the model-estimated mean of the QLESQ over 36 weeks using repeated measures.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Mean Patient Satisfaction Over 36-week Follow-up Using Client Satisfaction Questionnaire (CSQ)</measure>
    <time_frame>CSQ at follow-up weeks 2, 4, 8, 12, 20, 28, and 36.</time_frame>
    <description>Patient satisfaction was assessed using the 8-item Client Satisfaction Questionnaire (CSQ) which assesses patients' satisfaction with the services received. CSQ total score ranges from 8-32 with higher scores indicating greater satisfaction. The CSQ was assessed at baseline and the follow-up visits specified below. We calculated the model-estimated mean of the CSQ over 36 weeks using repeated measures.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Proportion of Fully Adherent Days</measure>
    <time_frame>Measured at each visit, up to 36 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>We used the Composite Adherence Score (CAS) described in our grant application to calculate medication adherence levels from all data sources (electronic caps [eCaps], pill count, self-report) and compare these across arms. Calculated via a statistically calibrated algorithm, the CAS relied first on eCaps data, secondarily on pill count, and the adherence questionnaire if eCaps data was missing due to an eCap malfunction. We calculated the number of the days the patient was fully adherent, number of days of partial adherence (e.g., opened the eCap fewer times than prescribed), or number of days of nonadherence when they did not take any prescribed pills. Patients who dropped out of the study and provided no further follow-up data were considered nonadherent for the remainder of the study period. We calculated the therapy-adherent period as a proportion of the total intended treatment period or proportion of days of full adherence, # of fully adherent days / # of days in treatment.</description>

        <description>Psychosocial functioning was assessed using the Sheehan Disability Scale (SDS), a self-report instrument composed of three visual analog subscales assessing degree of disruption caused by symptoms in three domains: work, social/leisure activities, and family/home life.

        <title>Mean Perceived Quality of Life Over 36-week Follow-up Using Quality of Life Enjoyment and Satisfaction Questionnaire (QLESQ)</title>
        <description>Quality of life was assessed using the 16-item Short Form of the Quality of Life Enjoyment and Satisfaction Questionnaire (QLESQ), a self-reported measure of quality of life in 8 domains that is sensitive to depressive symptom severity and treatment response. We analyzed the QLESQ total score as a percentage of the maximum possible score (ranging from 0-100) to facilitate comparisons across areas of functioning. It was calculated as such: % Max = (Raw score - minimum possible score) / (maximum possible score-minimum possible score) where raw score is the sum of the first 14 items. Higher numbers indicate better quality of life, greater enjoyment, and satisfaction. The QLESQ was assessed at baseline and the follow-up visits specified below. We calculated the model-estimated mean of the QLESQ over 36 weeks using repeated measures.</description>

        <title>Proportion of Fully Adherent Days</title>
        <description>We used the Composite Adherence Score (CAS) described in our grant application to calculate medication adherence levels from all data sources (electronic caps [eCaps], pill count, self-report) and compare these across arms. Calculated via a statistically calibrated algorithm, the CAS relied first on eCaps data, secondarily on pill count, and the adherence questionnaire if eCaps data was missing due to an eCap malfunction. We calculated the number of the days the patient was fully adherent, number of days of partial adherence (e.g., opened the eCap fewer times than prescribed), or number of days of nonadherence when they did not take any prescribed pills. Patients who dropped out of the study and provided no further follow-up data were considered nonadherent for the remainder of the study period. We calculated the therapy-adherent period as a proportion of the total intended treatment period or proportion of days of full adherence, # of fully adherent days / # of days in treatment.</description>
