    <textblock>
      The goal of this trial to see if repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) to the
      hearing area of the brain can lessen the perception of tinnitus. rTMS uses a strong magnet
      and when placed against the scalp generates a small electrical field within the brain.
      Depending on the frequency of the stimulation, this electrical field can either decrease or
      increase the electrical excitability of the brain. In this study, low-frequency stimulation
      will be used, which is thought to decrease nerve activity. It is this electrical excitability
      of the brain that is thought to be responsible for tinnitus.

      The hypothesis of this study is that rTMS can decrease the perception of tinnitus.

      This will be a cross-over randomized trial. The order of the treatments received will be
      randomly selected and the participant will not be told which treatment they are receiving.
      Subjects will fall into one of the four treatment groups described below:

        1. 2 weeks of active rTMS treatment followed by washout and then by 2 weeks sham

        2. 2 weeks of sham followed by washout and then 2 weeks of active rTMS treatment

        3. 4 weeks of active rTMS treatment followed by washout and then 4 weeks of sham

        4. 4 weeks of sham followed by washout and then 4 weeks of active rTMS treatment

      For the washout period between the two interventions, we will plan a minimum of 2 weeks to
      avoid the problem of carryover effects. Prior to starting the next intervention after the
      washout period, we will re-assess subject's tinnitus severity. To ensure no carryover effect,
      the washout period will be extended for those subjects whose tinnitus severity, as defined by
      the THI, is more than 20 points different than their baseline THI score.

    <description>Tinnitus Handicap Inventory (THI) is a measure of bother from tinnitus. THI is measured as a score in a scale ranging from 0=No bother to 100=Extremely Bothered. THI score post active rTMS treatment minus THI score pre active rTMS treatment will provide the change in THI score due to active treatment. THI score post rTMS sham minus THI score pre rTMS sham will provide change in THI due to sham. The difference of THI change due to active treatment minus THI change due to sham will provide the THI change that is our primary outcome measure.</description>

    <measure>Perceived Global Impression of Change (PGIC: Number of Participants With Perceived Global Impression of Change (PGIC) of 1 or Greater</measure>
    <time_frame>End of each treatment period (2 or 4 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>PGIC is a 7 point scale ranging from -3 to +3,with 0 meaning no change,negative values reporting worsening of symptoms(Tinnitus), and values of +1 or above reporting perceived improvement of Tinnitus.
PGIC score post active rTMS treatment treatment will provide subject's impression of change in tinnitue due to active treatment.PGIC score post rTMS sham will provide subject's impression of change in tinnitus due to sham. Number of subjects with scores of 1 or above are recorded to perceive improvement due to treatment of the corresponding study arm.</description>

        <title>Change in THI (Tinnitus Handicap Inventory)</title>
        <description>Tinnitus Handicap Inventory (THI) is a measure of bother from tinnitus. THI is measured as a score in a scale ranging from 0=No bother to 100=Extremely Bothered. THI score post active rTMS treatment minus THI score pre active rTMS treatment will provide the change in THI score due to active treatment. THI score post rTMS sham minus THI score pre rTMS sham will provide change in THI due to sham. The difference of THI change due to active treatment minus THI change due to sham will provide the THI change that is our primary outcome measure.</description>
