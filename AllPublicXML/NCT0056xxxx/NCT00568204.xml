      Atomised Methoxymethane-in-Aqua (MEXYN-A) a new topical self-chilled, non-steroidal,
      non-flammable, pressurised spray which embodies in one simultaneous application, most of the
      currently recognised and effective chemical, mechanical and thermal anti-pruritic therapies
      and hydrotherapy.

    <textblock>
      The primary clinical endpoint was to establish MEXYN-A efficacy and safety in abolishing or
      reducing pruritus related to cutaneous diseases, insect bites and poison ivy, within few
      seconds of the application. The secondary endpoint was to measure the itch free period as a
      result of the new intervention.
