    <measure>Positive and Negative Symptom Scale (PANSS) Total Score at Baseline</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>PANSS assesses the positive symptoms, negative symptoms, and general psychopathology specifically associated with schizophrenia. The scale consists of 30 items. Each item is rated on a scale from 1 (symptom not present) to 7 (symptoms extremely severe). The sum of the 30 items is defined as the PANSS total score and ranges from 30 to 210; higher score indicates greater severity.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in Positive and Negative Symptom Scale (PANSS) Total Score at Day 28</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Day 28</time_frame>
    <description>PANSS assesses the positive symptoms, negative symptoms, and general psychopathology specifically associated with schizophrenia. The scale consists of 30 items. Each item is rated on a scale from 1 (symptom not present) to 7 (symptoms extremely severe). The sum of the 30 items is defined as the PANSS total score and ranges from 30 to 210; higher score indicates greater severity.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Positive and Negative Symptom Scale (PANSS) Positive Subscale Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Day 7, 14, 21, 28</time_frame>
    <description>PANSS positive subscale assesses positive symptoms associated with schizophrenia. The positive subscale consists of 7 items (delusions, conceptual disorganization, hallucinatory behavior, excitement, grandiosity, suspiciousness/persecution, and hostility). Each item is rated on a scale from 1 (symptom not present) to 7 (symptoms extremely severe). Total positive subscale scores range from 7 to 49; higher score indicates greater severity.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Positive and Negative Symptom Scale (PANSS) Negative Subscale Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Day 7, 14, 21, 28</time_frame>
    <description>PANSS negative subscale assesses negative symptoms associated with schizophrenia. The negative subscale consists of 7 items (blunted affect, emotional withdrawal, poor rapport, passive/apathetic social withdrawal, difficulty in abstract thinking, lack of spontaneity and flow of conversation, and stereotyped thinking). Each item is rated on a scale from 1 (symptom not present) to 7 (symptoms extremely severe). Total negative subscale scores range from 7 to 49; higher score indicates greater severity.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Positive and Negative Symptom Scale (PANSS) General Psychopathology Subscale Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Day 7, 14, 21, 28</time_frame>
    <description>General psychopathology subscale assesses general psychopathology symptoms associated with schizophrenia. The general psychopathology subscale consists of 16 items (somatic concern, anxiety, guilt feelings, tension, mannerisms/posturing, depression, motor retardation, uncooperativeness, unusual thought content, disoriented, poor attention, lack of judgment/insight, disturbance of volition, poor impulse control, preoccupation, and active social avoidance). Each item is rated on a scale from 1 (symptom not present) to 7 (symptoms extremely severe). Total general psychopathology subscale scores range from 16 to 112; higher score indicates greater severity.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Positive and Negative Symptom Scale (PANSS) Cognition Cluster Subscale Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Day 7, 14, 21, 28</time_frame>
    <description>Cognition cluster subscale assesses cognitive symptoms associated with schizophrenia. The cognition cluster subscale score is a sum of 5 items from positive, negative and general psychopathology subscales (conceptual disorganization, difficulty in abstract thinking, poor attention, lack of judgment and insight, and preoccupation). Each item is rated on a scale from 1 (symptom not present) to 7 (symptoms extremely severe). Total cognition cluster subscale scores range from 5 to 35; higher score indicates greater severity.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of Participants With Response As Per Positive and Negative Symptom Scale (PANSS) Total Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Day 7, 14, 21, 28</time_frame>
    <description>Responders were defined as 20 percent (%) responders and 50 % responders. A 20% responder was a participant whose PANSS total score was decreased by at least 20% from baseline to the week of assessment. A 50% responder was a participant whose PANSS total score was decreased by at least 50 % from baseline to the week of assessment. PANSS total score assesses the positive symptoms, negative symptoms, and general psychopathology specifically associated with schizophrenia. The scale consists of 30 items. Each item is rated on a scale from 1 (symptom not present) to 7 (symptoms extremely severe). The sum of the 30 items is defined as the PANSS total score and ranges from 30 to 210; higher score indicates greater severity.</description>

          <title>Change From Baseline in Positive and Negative Symptom Scale (PANSS) Total Score at Day 28</title>
          <description>PANSS assesses the positive symptoms, negative symptoms, and general psychopathology specifically associated with schizophrenia. The scale consists of 30 items. Each item is rated on a scale from 1 (symptom not present) to 7 (symptoms extremely severe). The sum of the 30 items is defined as the PANSS total score and ranges from 30 to 210; higher score indicates greater severity.</description>
          <population>mITT population included all randomized participants who received at least 1 dose of double-blind test article, had baseline and at least 1 on-therapy PANSS total score. Here “N” (number of participants analyzed) signifies those participants who were evaluable for this measure.</population>

        <title>Positive and Negative Symptom Scale (PANSS) Negative Subscale Score</title>
        <description>PANSS negative subscale assesses negative symptoms associated with schizophrenia. The negative subscale consists of 7 items (blunted affect, emotional withdrawal, poor rapport, passive/apathetic social withdrawal, difficulty in abstract thinking, lack of spontaneity and flow of conversation, and stereotyped thinking). Each item is rated on a scale from 1 (symptom not present) to 7 (symptoms extremely severe). Total negative subscale scores range from 7 to 49; higher score indicates greater severity.</description>

A 20% responder was a participant whose PANSS total score was decreased by at least 20% from baseline to the week of assessment. A 50% responder was a participant whose PANSS total score was decreased by at least 50 % from baseline to the week of assessment. PANSS total score assesses the positive symptoms, negative symptoms, and general psychopathology specifically associated with schizophrenia. The scale consists of 30 items. Each item is rated on a scale from 1 (symptom not present) to 7 (symptoms extremely severe). The sum of the 30 items is defined as the PANSS total score and ranges from 30 to 210; higher score indicates greater severity.</description>
