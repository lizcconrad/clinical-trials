      Insulin resistance typically characterizes type 2 diabetes (T2DM) and prediabetic states and
      is the prominent feature of the metabolic syndrome.Adiponectin plays an important part in
      glucose metabolism,insulin resistance, the deterioration of renal function.we hypothesize
      there is a difference serum adiponectin levels between obese and non-obese women with type 2
      diabetic nephropathy. Furthermore, these two groups would respond difference to the RAs
      blocker(Losartan).

      it would be a prospective cohort study. According to BMI, all the women, aged&gt;30yr, diagnosed
      type 2 diabetic nephropathy, chronic kidney disease stage range from 1 to 4, will be divided
      to two group. Renal function index(included SCr, GFR, et al),glucose metabolism index(
      fasting glucose, plasma insulin et al),and adiponectin concentration will be observed and
      recorded. both two groups females will accept the treatment of RAS blocker(losartan, 100mg
      daily, 6 month). during the study, the above mentioned parameters will also be recorded 3
      month intervals. Meanwhile, any side effects would be pay attention.
