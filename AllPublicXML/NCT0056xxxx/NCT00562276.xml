  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this multi-center clinical trial is to evaluate the safety and effectiveness
      of inserting an intrauterine device (IUD) immediately after a suction aspiration procedure
      compared to inserting the IUD 2-6 weeks after the procedure. This study will also evaluate
      how satisfied women are with the timing of their IUD placement. Subjects will be able to
      choose between the Paraguard IUD or the Mirena IUD.

      The researchers hypothesize that:

        1. the expulsion rates measured at 1, 3 and 6 months will be clinically equivalent with
           immediate insertion compared with delayed insertion,

        2. satisfaction and tolerance of side effects will be higher with immediate IUD insertion
           compared with delayed insertion, and

        3. overall IUD use/continuation rates measured at 1, 3 and 6 months will be higher with
           immediate IUD insertion compared with delayed insertion.

               -  If no embryonic pole present: EGA (days) = mean sac diameter (mm) + 30 (Mean sac
                  diameter =[length+width+depth]/3)

               -  If embryonic pole is present: EGA (days) determined by Hadlock scale for measured
                  crown-rump length

          -  Desiring intrauterine contraception

          -  In general good health

          -  Willing to comply with randomization and study follow-up schedule

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Pelvic exam with evidence of active cervicitis or PID (eg. purulent discharge, adnexal

          -  Any prior surgical aspiration during this current pregnancy

          -  Use of osmotic dilators (eg. laminaria) or misoprostol for cervical preparation during
             the aspiration procedure

          -  Allergy to polyethylene

          -  Allergy to levonorgestrel (for levonorgestrel-containing IUS only)

          -  Allergy to copper (for copper T380A IUD only)
