    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of this study is to determine the maximally tolerated dose and spectrum
      of toxicities encountered with intraperitoneal delivery of a RGD modified conditionally
      replicative adenovirus (Ad5-Delta 24RGD) in patients with recurrent ovarian cancer.

      Secondary objectives :

        -  To determine the biologic effects encountered with intraperitoneal delivery of Ad5-Delta
           24RGD in patients with recurrent ovarian cancer cells

        -  To determine immunologic response generated against Ad5-Delta 24RGD when administered
           intraperitoneally to patients with recurrent ovarian adenocarcinoma

        -  To determine potential clinical activity of Ad5-Delta 24RGD when administered
           intraperitoneally to patients with recurrent ovarian adenocarcinoma

    <description>Within two weeks before the start of the study, a physical exam, blood tests, removal of fluid from abdominal cavity through the catheter and a CT scan of abdomen and pelvis will be performed.
The procedure will involve receiving the Ad5-delta24RGD virus once a day for 3 days. The virus will be put into the abdominal cavity through a 'Tenckhoff catheter'.</description>
