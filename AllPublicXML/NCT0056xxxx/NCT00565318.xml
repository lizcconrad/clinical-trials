      The purpose of this study is to investigate the effect of benfotiamine supplementation in
      patients with diabetic nephropathy, and to determine whether it will slow down the
      progression to end-stage renal disease (ESRD).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There is a worldwide increase in prevalence in type 2 diabetes mellitus, which is being
      paralleled by an increasing number of patients reaching dialysis because of diabetic
      nephropathy. Much of the fivefold increase in patients receiving dialysis treatment that
      occurred over the past two decades is attributable to type 2 diabetes and diabetic
      nephropathy. Diabetes is now the leading cause of end-stage renal disease (ESRD), with more
      than 40% of all new cases of ESRD occurring in patients with diabetes.

      Benfotiamine has been shown to reduce diabetic nephropathy and retinopathy in animal
      experimental models. We hypothesize that benfothiamine supplementation in patients with
      diabetic nephropathy will ameliorate the effects of both albuminuria/proteinuria and
      hyperglycaemia on oxidative stress and advanced glycation end-products (AGEs) accumulation in
      renal tissue, and thereby decrease inflammatory responses and fibrotic responses, causing
      slowing down of progression to ESRD as a consequence.

      Intervention:

      The intervention duration is 12 weeks for each group.

        -  Group A: Benfotiamine (300 mg) 3x 1 film coated tablet daily (900 mg daily dose
           benfotiamine)

        -  Group B: Placebo 3x 1 film coated tablet daily

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Type 2 diabetes mellitus

          -  Patients are on treatment with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEi) and/or
             angiotensin II antagonists (AIIA) in an unchanged dose for at least 3 months

          -  Active diabetic nephropathy as indicated by presence of microalbuminuria (15-300 mg/24
             h urine) in at least two samples within 2-6 weeks in advance of inclusion in the trial

          -  HbA1c &lt; 8.5%, a higher HbA1c &lt; 9.5% is acceptable if the treating physician and the
             patient have accepted that striving for lower values is an unreachable goal (patients
             with high HbA1c values are the ones that one would expect to be benefit most from
             treatment with benfotiamine)

          -  eGFR (estimated by MDRD formula) &gt; 30 ml/min
