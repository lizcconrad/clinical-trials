  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer deaths worldwide. It is estimated that, in 2004,
      173,700 new cases of lung cancer will be diagnosed in the United States alone and 164,440
      deaths due to this disease will occur(13) . NSCLC accounts for approximately 80% of all lung
      cancers. Among NSCLC cases approximately 30% present with locally advanced and 40% with
      metastatic disease (14,15) . In metastatic disease, chemotherapy is the treatment of choice,
      but benefits obtained in survival have been modest. Five-year survival is less than 15%,
      probably due to diagnosis at late stages. Surgical results in earlier stages are poor
      compared to other tumor types (about 40% of recurrence in stages I-II). Results of
      chemotherapy in advanced stages are also poor (one-year survival of 40%) (15,17). It is
      commonly accepted that the standard treatment for advanced disease (stage IV and IIIb with
      malignant pleural effusion) consists of platinum-based chemotherapy(15,16) . However, there
      are many open questions in the management of these patients, such as the role of 3-drugs
      combinations, non-platinum-based therapies, and new biologic therapeutics' approaches.
      Currently, in the treatment of advanced NSCLC response rates of about 20%-30% and median
      survival times of 6 to 11 months have been achieved (16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22,). Several
      combinations of drugs are used and show similar efficacy. Cisplatin plus vinorelbine or
      Cisplatin plus Gemcitabine are among the most commonly used regimens in the first-line
      therapy of NSCLC.
