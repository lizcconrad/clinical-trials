    <textblock>
      This study was conducted to investigate the efficacy of treatment with Org 50081
      (Esmirtazapine)

      compared to placebo in elderly participants with chronic primary

      insomnia. Primary efficacy variable is Wake time After Sleep

      Onset (WASO), averaged over all in-treatment time points

      and measured by polysomnography (PSG).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Insomnia is a common complaint or disorder throughout the

      world. About one third of the population in the industrial

      countries reports difficulty initiating or maintaining sleep,

      resulting in a non-refreshing or non-restorative sleep. The

      majority of the insomniacs suffer chronically from their

      complaints.

      The maleic acid salt of Org 4420, code name Org 50081, known as Esmirtazapine, was

      selected for development in the treatment of insomnia. The

      first clinical trial with Esmirtazapine was a proof-of-concept trial

      with a four-way cross-over design. All 3 Esmirtazapine dose

      groups showed a statistically significant positive effect on

      TST (objective and subjective) and WASO, as compared to

      placebo.

      The current study is designed to assess the efficacy and safety

      of Esmirtazapine in a double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel,

      randomized trial in elderly participants suffering from chronic

      primary insomnia.

          <description>Wake time after sleep onset (WASO) is the total time awake between sleep onset and &quot;lights on&quot;; i.e. from the onset of persistent sleep until the end of the 8-hour PSG recording. WASO was recorded in the first quarter of the night, for at most 2 hours, by PSG. PSG assesses the quality of sleep by monitoring brain waves, breathing, heart function, muscle activity and eye movement. PSG measurements of WASO (observed data only) taken during the 16-day double-blind treatment period, over days 1 and 2 and days 15 and 16, were averaged.</description>
          <population>The ITT population consisted of all randomized participants who received at least one dose of double-blind study medication and had at least one post-randomization efficacy assessment. Data from 11 participants located at one treatment site were not analyzed due to their lack of credibility.</population>

        <description>Satisfaction of Sleep Duration (SSD) is a subjective number on a Visual Analog Scale ranging from 0 to 100, where very unsatisfied is rated at 0, up to fully satisfied, rated at 100. Daily recordings by the participant in an electronic diary (observed data only) were averaged over the entire 16-day, double-blind treatment period.</description>
