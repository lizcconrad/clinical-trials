  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In parallel with the increasing prevalence of obesity worldwide, type 2 diabetes mellitus
      (T2DM) has reached epidemic proportions. Despite a multitude of available therapies, only
      bariatric surgery (e.g., roux-en-Y gastric bypass (GBP)) has proven to be an effective long
      term treatment modality for morbid obesity. Moreover, the majority of T2DM patients who
      undergo GBP experience normalization of their blood glucose and are able to discontinue their
      anti-diabetes medications soon after the procedure. The insulin resistant state commonly seen
      in non-diabetic obese subjects also improves after GBP. Evidence from recent animal studies
      suggests that the rapid return to euglycemia seen in T2DM patients after GBP might in part
      result from excluding the duodenum from the flow of nutrients. With the use of enteral
      feeding tubes, we hope to better understand the factors in the human gut that may predispose
      obese individuals to the development of insulin resistance and T2DM.
