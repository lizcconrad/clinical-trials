  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Elderly patients who undergo anesthesia and non-cardiac surgery are subject to deterioration
      of brain function including the development of postoperative delirium (PD) and postoperative
      cognitive dysfunction (POCD). These disorders cause disability, distress for both patients
      and their families, are associated with other medical complications and account for
      significant additional health care costs. We currently use relatively primitive approaches to
      preventing and treating PD and POCD.

      Dexmedetomidine is a drug used for sedation in critically ill patients that provides some
      pain relief and controls the bodies response to stress. The sedation produced by
      dexmedetomidine appears more similar to natural sleep than any other drug used for anesthesia
      and postoperative sedation. Data suggesting that dexmedetomidine can prevent delirium
      following cardiac surgery and the developing understanding of the causes of PD and POCD
      suggest that dexmedetomidine will be particularly effective.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Postoperative Delirium or PD and Postoperative Cognitive Dysfunction or POCD are syndromes of
      central nervous system dysfunction that significantly complicate the recovery of a proportion
      of elderly patients following surgery.

      Delirium is typically a transient syndrome characterized by a de-novo appearance of several
      pathognomonic behaviors, including disorientation, decreased attention span, sensory
      misperceptions, a waxing-and-waning type of confusion, and disorganized thinking. PD
      typically occurs on postoperative days 1 to 3 and is associated with prolonged hospital
      stays, increased risks for morbidity and mortality and significant health care expenditures.

      The neuroendocrine stress response to surgery, including the immediate postoperative period,
      remains an important potential etiologic factor. In particular, our data suggests that stress
      in the immediate postoperative period is poorly controlled by all anesthetic techniques and
      the normal diurnal variation in cortisol is suppressed in subjects who develop POCD.

      Dexmedetomidine is a highly selective alpha 2A agonist currently approved for sedation in the
      ICU. Dexmedetomidine produces analgesia, sympatholysis, and a light sedation characterized by
      easy arousal. Its action converges on the endogenous substrates for natural sleep to produce
      their sedative action, an effect that could prove beneficial to elderly postoperative
      patients.

      We hypothesize that treatment with dexmedetomidine will diminish both PD and POCD. The
      essential proposition is that modulation of perioperative stress can ameliorate perioperative
      delirium and cognitive dysfunction.

      Based on both the concept of cognitive reserve as well as clinical experience, there is
      concern that patients with preoperative cognitive impairment are particularly vulnerable to
      POCD. In general, such patients have been excluded from previous studies. This study is
      unique in that we will assess all participants for mild cognitive impairment prior to
      surgery. Assessment of the impact of preexisting cognitive impairment is a secondary aim. A
      broad goal of this interdisciplinary project is to evaluate POCD, which is primarily an
      anesthesia concept, in the more general context of dementing illness as explored by geriatric
      psychiatry.
