  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a Phase III, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter
      international clinical trial. Participants who have HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer
      (MBC) and have not received chemotherapy or biological therapy (including approved or
      investigational tyrosine kinase/HER inhibitors or vaccines) for their metastatic disease are
      eligible for study. Participants could have received one prior hormonal treatment for MBC.
      Participants may have received systemic breast cancer treatment in the neo-adjuvant or
      adjuvant setting, provided that the participant has experienced a disease-free interval (DFI)
      of greater than or equal to (&gt;/=) 12 months from completion of adjuvant systemic treatment
      (excluding hormonal therapy) to metastatic diagnosis. Participants may have received
      trastuzumab and/or a taxane during the neo-adjuvant or adjuvant treatment.

      Participants will be randomized in 1:1 ratio to receive pertuzumab or placebo along with
      trastuzumab and docetaxel every 3 weeks (Q3W) in the treatment phase of the study until
      investigator-assessed radiographic or clinical progressive disease, unmanageable toxicity, or
      study termination. Participants who were on placebo arm will be offered to receive after
      completion of treatment phase but participants who discontinue from the study, will not
      receive pertuzumab during open-label phase.

    <time_frame>Baseline to primary data cut-off on 13 May 2011 (up to 3 years, 3 months)</time_frame>
    <description>PFS was defined as the time from randomization to first documented disease progression (PD) using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) or death from any cause (within 18 weeks of last tumor assessment), whichever occurred first. For target lesions, PD was defined as at least a 20% increase in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum of the longest diameter recorded since treatment started or the appearance of 1 or more new lesions. For non-target lesions, PD was defined as the appearance of 1 or more new lesions and/or unequivocal progression of existing non-target lesions. Target lesions were selected on the basis of their size (those with the longest diameter) and their suitability for accurate repeated measurements by imaging techniques or clinically. All measurable lesions up to a maximum of 5 lesions per organ and 10 lesions in total, representative of all involved organs, were identified as target lesions.</description>

    <description>Overall survival was defined as the time from randomization to death from any cause. The median and 95 percent (%) confidence interval (CI) for time to event were estimated using Kaplan-Meier methodology.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline to primary data cut-off on 13 May 2011 (up to 3 years, 3 months)</time_frame>
    <description>A patient had an objective response if they had a complete response or a partial response determined on two consecutive occasions ≥ 4 weeks apart as determined by the investigator using RECIST. For target lesions, a complete response was defined as the disappearance of all target lesions; a partial response was defined as at least a 30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum longest diameter. For non-target lesions, a complete response was defined as the disappearance of all non-target lesions; a partial response was defined as the persistence of 1 or more non-target lesions.</description>

    <measure>Time to Symptom Progression</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to primary data cut-off on 13 May 2011 (up to 3 years, 3 months)</time_frame>
    <description>Time to symptom progression was defined as the time from randomization to the first symptom progression as measured by the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-for patients with Breast Cancer (FACT-B) questionnaire with the Trial Outcomes Index-Physical/Functional/Breast (TOI-PFB) subscale. The FACT-B TOI-PFB subscale contains 24 items from 3 subsections of the FACT-B questionnaire: Physical well-being, functional well-being, and additional concerns for breast cancer patients (breast cancer subscale [BCS]). All items in the questionnaire were rated by the patient on a 5-point scale ranging from 0 (&quot;not at all&quot;) to 4 (&quot;very much&quot;). The total score ranged from 0 to 96. A higher score indicates better perceived quality of life. A positive change score from baseline indicates improvement. Symptom progression was defined as a decrease from baseline of 5 points or more.</description>

        <title>Progression-free Survival (PFS) Determined by an Independent Review Facility</title>
        <description>PFS was defined as the time from randomization to first documented disease progression (PD) using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) or death from any cause (within 18 weeks of last tumor assessment), whichever occurred first. For target lesions, PD was defined as at least a 20% increase in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum of the longest diameter recorded since treatment started or the appearance of 1 or more new lesions. For non-target lesions, PD was defined as the appearance of 1 or more new lesions and/or unequivocal progression of existing non-target lesions. Target lesions were selected on the basis of their size (those with the longest diameter) and their suitability for accurate repeated measurements by imaging techniques or clinically. All measurable lesions up to a maximum of 5 lesions per organ and 10 lesions in total, representative of all involved organs, were identified as target lesions.</description>

        <title>Progression-free Survival (PFS) Determined by the Investigator</title>
        <description>PFS was defined as the time from randomization to first documented disease progression (PD) using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) or death from any cause (within 18 weeks of last tumor assessment), whichever occurred first. For target lesions, PD was defined as at least a 20% increase in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum of the longest diameter recorded since treatment started or the appearance of 1 or more new lesions. For non-target lesions, PD was defined as the appearance of 1 or more new lesions and/or unequivocal progression of existing non-target lesions. Target lesions were selected on the basis of their size (those with the longest diameter) and their suitability for accurate repeated measurements by imaging techniques or clinically. All measurable lesions up to a maximum of 5 lesions per organ and 10 lesions in total, representative of all involved organs, were identified as target lesions.</description>

The FACT-B TOI-PFB subscale contains 24 items from 3 subsections of the FACT-B questionnaire: Physical well-being, functional well-being, and additional concerns for breast cancer patients (breast cancer subscale [BCS]). All items in the questionnaire were rated by the patient on a 5-point scale ranging from 0 (“not at all”) to 4 (“very much”). The total score ranged from 0 to 96. A higher score indicates better perceived quality of life. A positive change score from baseline indicates improvement. Symptom progression was defined as a decrease from baseline of 5 points or more.</description>
