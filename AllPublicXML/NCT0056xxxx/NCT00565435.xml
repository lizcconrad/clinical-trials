      Since Chiari malformation is a common disease, many patients require surgical operation to
      relieve pressure from the back portion of the skull. The purpose of this research is to
      compare two different materials that are routinely used to repair the opening in the brain
      covering during the surgery on the back portion of the skull in patients with symptomatic
      Chiari Malformation. None of the materials used in this study nor any procedures are
      experimental.

      Subjects are randomly assigned to receive either Duragen or Duraguard and then followed for a
      period of three months after surgery for follow-up evaluation as part of their routine care.
      The research portion of the study involves subjects completing a quality of life
      questionnaire each month and the research team reviews each subject's chart for any
      post-surgical complications.
