  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary efficacy parameter is the number of observed unintended pregnancy during 1 year
      of treatment. Secondary efficacy parameter include bleeding parameters and menstrual related
      symptoms Safety parameters included assessment of adverse events, laboratory evaluations.

    <measure>Pearl Index</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 1 year</time_frame>
    <description>The Pearl Index (PI) is the number of pregnancies per 100 woman years. The PI is obtained by dividing the number of pregnancies during treatment (conception date on/after the 1st day of treatment and not later than last day of treatment +14 days) by the treatment exposure time (in 100 women years) that the women were under risk of getting pregnant. The Pearl Index was not calculated individually for either the Flexible (Extended) Regimen no. 2 of EE20/DRSP (BAY86-5300) treatment arm, nor for the Conventional Regimen of EE20/DRSP (YAZ, BAY86-5300) treatment arm, because the low sample size in these treatment arms (approximately. 200 subjects per group) did not allow a reliable PI calculation of these groups alone.</description>

For the flexible and stop and go extended treatment arms, a treatment cycle started with the first day of pill intake after a tablet-free interval and ended with the last day of the subsequent tablet-free interval. A tablet-free interval (treatment withdrawal) was defined as at least 3 consecutive days without tablet intake. For the standard 24+4 treatment arm, a new cycle started each time a new blister pack of medication was started.</description>

The minimum period between 2 tablet-free intervals was 24 days.

      <recruitment_details>The date of first subject, first visit was 22 Oct 2007. The date of last subject, last visit was 11 Nov 2009.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>A total of 2450 subjects were screened ; 563 failed screening. The remaining 1887 subjects were assigned to treatment. Of these, 1864 (98.8%) were in the Full Analysis Set (FAS), ie, study medication was dispensed to them and they had at least 1 post-baseline observation. A total of 1196 (63.4%) subjects completed the study.</pre_assignment_details>

        <title>Pearl Index</title>
        <description>The Pearl Index (PI) is the number of pregnancies per 100 woman years. The PI is obtained by dividing the number of pregnancies during treatment (conception date on/after the 1st day of treatment and not later than last day of treatment +14 days) by the treatment exposure time (in 100 women years) that the women were under risk of getting pregnant. The Pearl Index was not calculated individually for either the Flexible (Extended) Regimen no. 2 of EE20/DRSP (BAY86-5300) treatment arm, nor for the Conventional Regimen of EE20/DRSP (YAZ, BAY86-5300) treatment arm, because the low sample size in these treatment arms (approximately. 200 subjects per group) did not allow a reliable PI calculation of these groups alone.</description>

        <description>A withdrawal bleeding episode (WBE) for the two flexible (extended) treatment arms 1) Ended at the earliest 4 days before the first day of the pill break of that cycle or later, AND 2) Started before or at the latest on the 4th day of the next cycle.

If more than one episode satisfied the above criteria, the first episode to occur was considered to be the WBE.</description>
