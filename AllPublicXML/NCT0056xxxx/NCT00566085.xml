  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Molecular Breast Imaging is a highly promising novel methodology for breast cancer detection.
      Preliminary patient studies with our dual-detector system indicate that this system is
      capable of reliably detecting very small (5-10 mm) malignant lesions in the breast. Besides
      the usefulness of Molecular Breast Imaging for tumor detection, we speculate that tumor
      uptake and washout may be predictors to response to neoadjuvant therapy for patients with the
      diagnosis of breast cancer. We propose that in patients with breast cancer who undergo
      neoadjuvant chemotherapy or neoadjuvant hormone therapy that molecular breast imaging is an
      accurate test for assessing response rate to neoadjuvant therapy.

    <textblock>
      Adjuvant therapy after surgery for breast cancer has provided significant benefits to
      patients at risk for relapse. However, the success of therapy for each individual patient
      will often take years to reveal. Preoperative (neoadjuvant) medical therapy is very potent as
      an initial treatment for inoperable and large operable breast cancers. Tumor regression can
      be achieved in the great majority of patients and downstaging frequently reduces the need for
      mastectomy and it has become clear that pathologic complete response is a good prognostic
      marker. Data from current trials suggest that survival is at least as good with preoperative
      as with postoperative neoadjuvant therapies (1). With this observation preoperative medical
      therapy has the advantage over post-operative neoadjuvant therapy that it can be used as a
      short term surrogate marker for long-term outcome. With this translational approach, the
      therapy for each patient can be more targeted and individualized leading to higher success
      rates; and further, new therapies for early breast cancer can be assessed much more quickly
      than is currently possible through protracted trials of neoadjuvant therapy (2). This
      approach is therefore being increasingly utilized in patients with lower stage breast
      cancers.
