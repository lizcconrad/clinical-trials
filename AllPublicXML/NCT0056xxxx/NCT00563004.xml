      Design:

      Four out-patient visits, at enrollment and every month thereafter At enrollment (visit 1)
      physical examination will be performed and a full set of blood tests will be withdrawn At 1
      week (visit 2) adjustment of hypoglycemic medications will be done and full chemistry and
      blood count will be taken At 6 weeks (visit 3) adjustment of hypoglycemic medications will be
      done and full chemistry and blood count will be taken At 12 weeks (visit 4), the end of the
      study, physical examination will be performed and a full set of blood tests will be withdrawn
      On the 2nd 3rd and 4th visits pill-count will be performed Glucose monitoring: patients will
      be asked to monitor fasting glucose levels at home, in the morning, on a daily basis
