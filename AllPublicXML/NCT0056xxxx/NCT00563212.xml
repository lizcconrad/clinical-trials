  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a progressive disease for which there is no effective
      treatment. Interferon-gamma is a medication that has been used for other lung diseases to
      decrease scarring and fibrosis. Studies of interferon-gamma injected under the skin did not
      show any improvement in survival in patients with IPF. We hypothesize that giving
      interferon-gamma as a nebulized mist directly into the lungs can affect the immune system in
      a way that decreases fibrosis.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with mild-to-moderate idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) will be enrolled in a
      phase I study of aerosol interferon-gamma (IFN-γ). Prior to initiation of treatment, patients
      will undergo CT of the chest, pulmonary function testing, and bronchoscopy with
      bronchoalveolar lavage. They will also undergo a lung deposition study to determine the lung
      dose of IFN-γ that will be delivered with each treatment. Patients will then receive aerosol
      IFN-γ 100mcg delivered three times weekly via nebulizer for one year. Study patients will be
      followed monthly to monitor potential side effects, vital signs, and progression of IPF
      symptoms. Labs will be drawn at regular intervals to monitor for side effects and to measure
      cytokine levels. Bronchoscopy will be performed at the 6 and/or 12 month visit to compare
      cytokine levels pre-, during, and post-treatment.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients diagnosed with IPF based on accepted criteria (see above) within 12 months
             prior to screening.

          -  Age 40-75.

          -  Absence of significant pulmonary hypertension as measured by right heart
             catheterization (mPAP ≥ 30 mmHG) or echocardiography (RVSP ≥ 50 mmHg).

          -  FVC ≥ 55% of predicted baseline value at screening; DLCO ≥ 30% predicted.

          -  PaO2 ≥ 65 mm Hg at rest on room air

          -  Patient able to understand and willing to sign a written informed consent and willing
             to comply with all requirements of the study protocol including lung deposition
             studies.

          -  Patient fits criteria for research bronchoscopy and is willing to undergo procedure.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Six minute walk distance of &lt; 200 meters.

          -  Patient unwilling or unable to undergo research bronchoscopy.

          -  Patient with known life threatening asthma or severe COPD.

          -  Patient requiring oxygen therapy for maintenance of adequate arterial oxygenation at
             rest.

          -  Patient with hypersensitivity to study medication or other component medication.

          -  Patient with known severe cardiac disease, severe peripheral vascular disease or
             seizure disorder which may be exacerbated by study drug administration
             (contraindications to drug administration as per package insert).

             negative pregnancy test and be required to use accepted form of birth control

             limit of normal, albumin &lt; 3.0 at screening.
