  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      GW856553 is a novel compound, currently in development for the treatment of Major Depressive
      Disorder (MDD), and other indications. GW856553 inhibits a protein which is responsible for
      the production of some pro-inflammatory molecules, called cytokines. Increased blood levels
      of these molecules were seen in populations of MDD patients and this was more apparent in
      subjects with severe symptoms, psychomotor retardation and loss of energy. Aim of the present
      study is to assess whether GW856553, by inactivating this protein, is able to suppress the
      production of the cytokines, and ultimately relieving depression symptoms. In this study
      GW856553 or placebo is given to MDD patients 7.5md twice daily for 6 weeks.

    <description>HAMD is an instrument for evaluating severity of symptoms of depression, was completed by the participant. The instrument used in this study was the 17-item version (HAM-D17). The Bech subscale of the HAMD-17 is composed of 6 identified items out of the 17 items rated in HAMD-17 scale. Each item is rated on either a 3-point scale (0 to 2) or a 5-point scale (0 to 4). The following symptoms were rated on a 5-point scale (0-4): depressed mood, low self-esteem (guilt), work and interests, psychomotor retardation, and anxiety (psychic). The following symptom was rated on a 3-point scale (0-2): somatic symptoms (general). Total score ranged from 0 to 22, with 0 indicating absence of symptoms and a higher score indicating greater severity of symptoms. Randomization value was defined as the assessment done on Day 1 (Week 0). Change from Randomization was calculated by subtracting the Randomization value from the post-Randomization (Week 6) value.</description>

    <description>The IDS-C is a standardized 30-item, clinician rated scale to assess the severity of a participant's depressive symptoms. The items were rated on a 4-point scale of 0-3, where 0 indicated absence of symptom and higher score indicated greater severity of symptom. In order to calculate the total score of IDS-C, the following procedures were used: either item 11 or 12 were scored; either item 13 or 14 were scored; if both items 11 and 12 (or 13 and 14) were scored, the highest of the items was scored. The total score was obtained by adding the scores of 28 items of the 30 items. Total scores range from 0-84, with a score of 0 indicating no depression and a score of 84 indicating the most severe depression. Randomization value was defined as the assessment done on Day 1 (Week 0). Change from Randomization was calculated by subtracting the Randomization value from the post-Randomization (Week 6) value.</description>

Fatigue/Tiredness was based on score of item 3 and 4 and sleepiness on score of item 1 and 2. All item scores do not move in same direction. Score for item 1 and 3 ranged from 0-100, where 0=absence of symptom and higher score=greater severity of symptom. Score for item 2 and 4 ranged from 0-100, where 0=most severe symptom and higher score=less severe symptom. Randomization value defined as assessment done on Day 1 (Week 0, pre-dose). Change from Randomization was calculated by subtracting Randomization value from individual post-Randomization (Week 0-6) values.</description>

    <measure>Median time to Cmax (tmax) and the terminal phase half-life (t1/2)</measure>
    <time_frame>Pre-dose and 4 h post-dose at Week 2 and Week 6</time_frame>
    <description>Plasma concentration of GW856553X and of the metabolite GSK198602 was assessed during the treatment period. Blood samples were collected at 8:00 h (before dosing) and 12:00-13:00 h (about 4 h after dosing) at Weeks 2 and 6 of the treatment period. The time at which Cmax observed was planned to be determined directly from the raw concentration-time data. The apparent t1/2 was planned to be obtained as the ratio of ln2/λz, where λz is the terminal phase rate constant estimated by linear regression analysis of the log transformed concentration-time data. The data for this outcome measure was not derived due to early termination.</description>

    <measure>The area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC)</measure>
    <time_frame>Pre-dose and 4 h post-dose at Week 2 and Week 6</time_frame>
    <description>Blood samples were collected at 8:00 h (before dosing) and 12:00-13:00 h (about 4 h after dosing) at Weeks 2 and 6 of the treatment period. The AUC was planned to be assessed from time zero (pre-dose) extrapolated to infinite time (AUC0-infinity) and from time zero (pre-dose) to last time of quantifiable concentration within a participant across all treatments (AUC0-t). AUC0-t was planned to be determined using the linear trapezoidal rule for increasing concentrations and the logarithmic trapezoidal rule for decreasing concentrations. The AUC0-infinity was planned to be calculated, where data permitted, as the sum of AUC0-t and Ct/z, where Ct is the observed plasma concentration obtained from the log-linear regression analysis of the last quantifiable time-point and z is the terminal phase rate constant. The data for this outcome measure was not derived due to early termination.</description>
