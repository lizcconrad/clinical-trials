      The purpose of the study is to investigate whether blockade of the histamine H2 receptors in
      the brain will have any beneficial effect on the symptoms of subjects with schizophrenia.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Histamine functions as a neurotransmitter in the brain. It has an important role as modulator
      of the release of other neurotransmitters, including dopamine.

      The histamine receptors are widely expressed in the brain, H1 and H2 receptors are
      post-synaptic, H3 a pre-synaptic autoreceptor. There is an abundance of neurobiologic data
      from animal and human studies supporting the role of histamine in the pathogenesis and
      treatment of psychoses.

      In 1990 a case report of a treatment resistant subject with schizophrenia whos symptoms
      improved markedly when he was prescribed a H2 antagonist because of peptic ulcer. Later, a
      open-label trial including 18 patients has been performed, reporting significant symptom
      reduction, especially on negative symptoms. Also the subjective comments both by the subjects
      and the investigators in that study were optimistic and suggested an effect primarily on
      negative symptoms.

      The present study will be the first double-blind, randomized, placebo controlled, parallel
      group study of the subject matter. The study focuses on treatment resistant schizophrenia
      cases in the stable phase.
