  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Dental erosions in 30 male and female patients with proven abnormal gastrooesophageal reflux
      will be assessed clinically and using a novel optical coherence tomography (OCT) laser
      technique before and after double-blind randomization to antisecretory treatment with
      esomeprazole 20mg or placebo bid for 3 weeks.

      The primary objective is to quantify tooth substance loss as well as changes in optical
      reflectance and scattering of dental hard tissues with and without acid inhibition.

      Secondary objectives are:

      To compare standardised visual scoring with OCT quantification of reflux damage at the
      different time points on different teeth.

      To assess sex differences in OCT- quantified dental tissue loss.

             study begin until the end of the study, except usual dental hygiene with usual
             toothpaste.

          7. Allergy to or other contraindication for treatment with esomeprazole.

          8. Use of proton pump inhibitors in 2 weeks or other acid inhibitory drugs in 3 days
             before study inclusion.

          9. Substantial change or planned change in dietary pattern, esp. diets within 2 weeks of
             study start and for the duration of the entire study.

         10. Change or planned change in normal medication or use of herbal, mineral, vitamin
