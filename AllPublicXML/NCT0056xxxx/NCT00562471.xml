  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study was to determine whether the adhesion prevention gel was safe to
      use, and was effective for the prevention/reduction of adhesion formation that typically
      occurs following gynecological surgery to remove myomas

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Postoperative adhesions are a common medical complication of gynecologic and pelvic
      surgeries, and are frequently associated with chronic or recurrent pelvic pain, intestinal
      obstruction and infertility. This randomized, controlled, multicenter, clinical study was
      designed to evaluate the safety and performance of Adhibit™ Adhesion Prevention Gel versus
      the standard of care for the reduction of postoperative adhesions in subjects undergoing
      myomectomy via laparotomy or laparoscopy. Subjects were scheduled to return within 6-8 weeks
      after the initial surgical procedure. At that time, a second-look laparoscopy was performed
      for postoperative adhesion assessment. Adhesions were graded using a modified American
      Fertility Society (mAFS) scoring method.

    <description>A resorbable hydrogel, which adheres to itself and the tissues it contacts, is approved for use in sealing vascular reconstructions. The hydrogel is formed when two synthetic derivatized polyethylene glycol (PEG) polymers are mixed together and applied to tissue. Using a gas-assisted delivery device, the hydrogel is sprayed over all myomectomy suture lines and all surgically treated areas during the myomectomy surgery. The hydrogel is totally resorbed within 30 days post-application.</description>

          -  Been scheduled for myomectomy via laparotomy or laparoscopy.

          -  Agreed to a second-look laparoscopic procedure to assess and lyse any adhesions formed
             at 6 to 8 weeks following myomectomy.

          -  Been &gt;=18 years of age.

          -  Provided voluntary written informed consent.

        Intra-operatively, subjects must have had:

          -  Had at least one 2 cm incision length on posterior uterine surface, which may include
             the fundal surface.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Preoperatively, subjects must not have had:

          -  Been pregnant.
