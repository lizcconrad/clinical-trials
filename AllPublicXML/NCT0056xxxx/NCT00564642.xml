  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Tuberculosis is one of the major health problems in developing countries. Isoniazid, rifampin
      and pyrazinamide, the first line drugs used for tuberculosis chemotherapy, are associated
      with hepatotoxicity. The rate of hepatotoxicity has been reported to be much higher in
      developing countries compared to that in advanced countries with a similar dose schedule.
      Oxidative stress has proposed as one of the mechanisms responsible for anti-tuberculosis
      drugs induced hepatic injury. The oxidative stress is closely associated with decrease of
      glutathione levels. In the present study N acetylcysteine, a precursor of glutathione, was
      investigated for hepatoprotective effect against anti-tuberculosis drugs induced liver
      injury.
