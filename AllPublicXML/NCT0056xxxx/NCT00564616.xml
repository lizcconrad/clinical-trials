  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether adding interactive video communication to
      dispatch instruction improves the quality of bystander cardiopulmonary resuscitation in
      simulated cardiac arrests.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Sudden cardiac death (SCD) is a leading cause of adult death and bystander cardiopulmonary
      resuscitation (CPR) significantly improves survival. Dispatch assistance increases the chance
      of bystander CPR but the quality of dispatcher-assisted CPR (DA-CPR) remains unsatisfactory.
      This study is conducted to assess the effect of adding interactive video communication to
      dispatch instruction on the quality of bystander CPR, including chest compressions and rescue
      breathing, in simulated cardiac arrests.
