    <measure>The Mean Change From Baseline to Week 20 in the Overall Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire (AQLQ)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 20</time_frame>
    <description>The AQLQ was administered to all patients at Baseline, Week 12 and Week 20. The 32 questions in the AQLQ were divided into four domains; activity limitations, symptoms, emotional function, and environmental stimuli. Individual questions are equally weighted. The overall AQLQ score is the mean of the responses to each of the 32 questions, and ranges from 1 to 7. A score 7.0 indicates that the patient has no impairments due to asthma and a score of 1.0 indicates severe impairment.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 20</time_frame>
    <description>The AQLQ was administered to all patients at Baseline, Week 12 and Week 20. The 32 questions in the AQLQ were divided into four domains; activity limitations, symptoms, emotional function, and environmental stimuli. Individual questions are equally weighted. The overall AQLQ score is the mean of the responses to each of the 32 questions and ranges from 1 to 7. AQLQ of each domain is the mean of the responses to each of the questions within that domain. A score 7.0 indicates that the patient has no impairments due to asthma and score 1.0 indicates severe impairment.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>The Mean Change From Baseline to the End of Study in AQLQ Domain Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 20</time_frame>
    <description>AQLQ was administered to all patients at Baseline, Week 12 and Week 20, and prior to any clinic visit evaluation and drug administration.
The 32 questions in the AQLQ were divided into four domains: activity limitations, symptoms, emotional function, and environmental stimuli. AQLQ domain scores were calculated by adding the responses to each of the questions in the domain and dividing by the number of questions in the domain. Each domain score was between 1 and 7. Score 7.0 meant that the patient had no impairments due to asthma and score 1.0 indicated severe impairment.</description>

    <measure>Number of Asthma Exacerbation Episodes Per Participant</measure>
    <time_frame>From Baseline through 20 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>For the purpose of evaluating efficacy, a clinically significant asthma exacerbation was defined as a worsening of asthma symptoms as judged clinically by the investigator, requiring doubling the baseline ICS dose for at least 3 days and/or treatment with rescue systemic (oral or IV) corticosteroids. The initiation of the above corticosteroid regimens marked the start of an asthma exacerbation episode and cessation of the additional corticosteroid regimens marked the end of an exacerbation episode.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of Participants Using Rescue Medication</measure>
    <time_frame>From Baseline through 20 Weeks</time_frame>
    <description>When necessary, patients were allowed to take rescue medication using inhaled salbutamol or terbutaline for symptoms of intercurrent bronchospasm.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Free Days With no Rescue Medication</measure>
    <time_frame>From Baseline through 20 weeks (140 days)</time_frame>
    <description>When necessary, patients were allowed to take rescue medication using inhaled salbutamol or terbutaline for symptoms of intercurrent bronchospasm. Days with no rescue medication intake were the variable of interest for this analysis.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Mean Number of Puffs of Rescue Medication Taken Per Day</measure>
    <time_frame>From Baseline through 20 Weeks</time_frame>
    <description>When necessary, patients were allowed to take rescue medication using inhaled salbutamol or terbutaline for symptoms of intercurrent bronchospasm. The number of puffs taken during each 24 hour period was recorded in the patient dairy. The total number of puffs over 20 weeks of treatment was divided by the number of treatment days (140 days) to calculate the mean number of puffs per day.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Physician's Global Assessment of Treatment Effectiveness</measure>
    <time_frame>20 Weeks</time_frame>
    <description>At the end of Week 20 a global evaluation of the treatment effectiveness was performed by the investigator using the following scale: Excellent: complete control of asthma; Good: marked improvement of asthma; Moderate: discernible, but limited improvement in asthma; Poor: no appreciable change in asthma; Worsening of asthma</description>

    <description>Omalizumab was administered subcutaneously every 2 or 4 weeks over a period of 20 weeks to provide a dose of at least 0.016 mg/kg per UI/ml of immunoglobulin E (IgE). Doses (mg) and dosing frequency were determined by serum total IgE level (IU/mL) and body weight (kg). Also, participants continued using their current formulation of inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) and long-acting beta 2-adrenergic agonist (LABA). Home use of nebulized beta 2-agonist was allowed for the treatment of symptoms of intercurrent bronchospasm or during an asthma exacerbation if this treatment regimen was already established prior to screening visit.</description>

          <description>Omalizumab was administered subcutaneously every 2 or 4 weeks over a period of 20 weeks to provide a dose of at least 0.016 mg/kg per UI/ml of immunoglobulin E (IgE). Doses (mg) and dosing frequency were determined by serum total IgE level (IU/mL) and body weight (kg). Also, participants continued using their current formulation of inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) and long-acting beta 2-adrenergic agonist (LABA). Home use of nebulized beta 2-agonist was allowed for the treatment of symptoms of intercurrent bronchospasm or during an asthma exacerbation if this treatment regimen was already established prior to screening visit.</description>

        <description>The AQLQ was administered to all patients at Baseline, Week 12 and Week 20. The 32 questions in the AQLQ were divided into four domains; activity limitations, symptoms, emotional function, and environmental stimuli. Individual questions are equally weighted. The overall AQLQ score is the mean of the responses to each of the 32 questions and ranges from 1 to 7. A score 7.0 indicates that the patient has no impairments due to asthma and score 1.0 indicates severe impairment.</description>

        <title>The Mean Change From Baseline to the End of Study in AQLQ Domain Score</title>
        <description>AQLQ was administered to all patients at Baseline, Week 12 and Week 20, and prior to any clinic visit evaluation and drug administration.
The 32 questions in the AQLQ were divided into four domains: activity limitations, symptoms, emotional function, and environmental stimuli. AQLQ domain scores were calculated by adding the responses to each of the questions in the domain and dividing by the number of questions in the domain. Each domain score was between 1 and 7. Score 7.0 meant that the patient had no impairments due to asthma and score 1.0 indicated severe impairment.</description>
        <time_frame>Baseline and Week 20</time_frame>
        <population>Patients who took at least one dose of double-blind study drug and who had at least one post-baseline safety or efficacy assessment made up the intent-to treat (ITT) population. Last observation carried forward (LOCF) approach was used. Scores of completed AQLQ at Week 12 were used at Week 20 for dropped out patients or for missing values.</population>

            <description>Omalizumab was administered subcutaneously every 2 or 4 weeks over a period of 20 weeks to provide a dose of at least 0.016 mg/kg per UI/ml of immunoglobulin E (IgE). Doses (mg) and dosing frequency were determined by serum total IgE level (IU/mL) and body weight (kg). Also, participants continued using their current formulation of inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) and long-acting beta 2-adrenergic agonist (LABA). Home use of nebulized beta 2-agonist was allowed for the treatment of symptoms of intercurrent bronchospasm or during an asthma exacerbation if this treatment regimen was already established prior to screening visit.</description>

Also, participants continued using their current formulation of inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) and long-acting beta 2-adrenergic agonist (LABA). Home use of nebulized beta 2-agonist was allowed for the treatment of symptoms of intercurrent bronchospasm or during an asthma exacerbation if this treatment regimen was already established prior to screening visit.</description>

          <description>When necessary, patients were allowed to take rescue medication using inhaled salbutamol or terbutaline for symptoms of intercurrent bronchospasm. The number of puffs taken during each 24 hour period was recorded in the patient dairy. The total number of puffs over 20 weeks of treatment was divided by the number of treatment days (140 days) to calculate the mean number of puffs per day.</description>
          <population>All randomized patients who took at least one dose of double-blind study medication and who had at least one post-baseline safety or efficacy assessment made up the intention-to-treat (ITT) population.
