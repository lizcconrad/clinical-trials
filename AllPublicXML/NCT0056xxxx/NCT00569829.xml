  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Although cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) has been found to be efficacious in the treatment
      of child anxiety disorders, little progress has been made in the dissemination of such
      treatments to real-world practice settings. Clinical trials conducted in practice settings
      can demonstrate the degree to which evidence-based treatments are appropriate for larger
      scale dissemination. This study evaluates CBT as a treatment for child anxiety disorders in
      the elementary school clinic setting. A randomized, controlled trial design has been
      employed, comparing immediate treatment and a three-month waitlist. The trial is being
      conducted in several Los Angeles area elementary schools and is only available to children in
      these particular schools. To ensure that the CBT intervention is flexible and capable of
      matching the characteristics of various school settings, clinicians, and referred children, a
      modular treatment approach is employed. The study design includes elements to ensure high
      quality data, such as the use of independent evaluators and tests of treatment fidelity.
      Children, ages 5 to 12 years, are referred by teachers and staff or are identified as having
      high anxiety in concurrent studies. All participating children have DSM-IV diagnoses of
      separation anxiety disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, or social phobia, according to a
      semi-structured diagnostic interview. Therapy and clinical supervision is provided by the
      research team. It is hypothesized that children receiving immediate treatment will have
      significantly lower anxiety scores than children assigned to the waitlist at the
      posttreatment/postwaitlist assessment. If results are favorable, further exploration of
      dissemination of CBT into school clinic settings may be indicated.
