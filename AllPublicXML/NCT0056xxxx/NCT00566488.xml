  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study has three primary purposes: to assess parathyroid function after parathyroid
      transplantation in infants with Complete DiGeorge syndrome; to assess immune function
      development after transplantation; and, to assess safety and tolerability of the procedures.
      This is a Phase 1, single site, open, non-randomized clinical protocol. Enrollment is closed
      and study intervention is complete for all enrolled subjects; but subjects continue for
      observation and follow-up. Subjects under 2 years old with complete DiGeorge syndrome
      (atypical or typical) received thymus transplantation. Subjects received pre-transplant
      immune suppression with rabbit anti-human-thymocyte-globulin. Subjects with
      hypoparathyroidism and an eligible parental donor received thymus and parental parathyroid
      transplantation. A primary hypothesis: Thymus/Parathyroid transplant subjects will need less
      calcium and/or calcitriol supplementation at 1 year post-transplant as compared to historical
      controls.

      Detailed: DiGeorge Syndrome is a complex of three problems, 1) cardiac defects, 2)
      parathyroid deficiency, and 3) absence of the thymus, resulting in profound T-cell
      deficiency. There is a spectrum of disease in DiGeorge syndrome with respect to all three
      defects. There is no safe and effective treatment for DiGeorge Syndrome and most patients die
      by the age of two. For patients with a severe T cell defect, the PI has shown that thymus
      transplantation is safe and efficacious under other clinical protocols. Research subjects
      with complete typical and atypical DiGeorge syndrome were eligible for this study. Subjects
      with athymia and profound hypoparathyroidism were eligible for parental parathyroid
      transplantation in this protocol. DiGeorge syndrome infants, who have successful thymus
      transplants but have hypoparathyroidism, must go to the clinic for frequent calcium levels
      and to the hospital for calcium infusions; infants with hypoparathyroidism are at risk for
      seizures from low calcium. Approximately Â½ of infants with profound hypoparathyroidism will
      develop nephrocalcinosis. Depending on T cell phenotype and function, subjects were given one
      of two different immunosuppression regimens. Typical complete DiGeorge subjects (with
      proliferative T cell function &lt; 50,000 cpm) received Thymoglobulin pre-transplantation.
      Typical complete DiGeorge subjects (with proliferative cell response to PHA &gt; 50,000 cpm) and
      atypical DiGeorge subjects (with proliferative T cell response to PHA &lt; 75,000 cpm) received
      Thymoglobulin (pre-transplantation) and cyclosporine (pre-transplantation and
      post-transplantation). Thymoglobulin was used in part to prevent graft rejection and also to
      deplete any T cells in the donor parathyroid. Cyclosporine was used to deplete activated T
      cells in the recipient. For all subjects, acetaminophen, diphenhydramine, and
      methylprednisolone were given concurrently with the rabbit anti-human thymocyte globulin. The
      thymus was cultured in standard medium for 10-21 days to deplete mature thymocytes which
      could cause GVHD. In the operating room, thymus tissue was placed in the quadriceps muscle in
      one or both legs. The parathyroid donation was preferably done at the same time as the thymus
      transplantation. Parathyroid tissue was placed in the quadriceps muscle in only one leg,
      using the same incision as the thymus transplantation. Depending on post-transplant immune
      status, subjects may have received cyclosporine and steroids.

      For 3 months after thymus transplantation, T cells were monitored by flow cytometry
      approximately every 2-4 weeks. Alternatively, absolute lymphocyte count was used as the
      maximum possible T cell number. At 2-3 months post-transplant, the subject had a thymus
      allograft biopsy, done under general anesthesia in the operating room. The biopsy was
      approximately 4 pea-sized (3x3mm) portions of muscle tissue where the thymus transplant had
      been inserted. Using immunohistochemistry, the biopsy determined thymopoiesis and any graft
      rejection. The parathyroid was not biopsied because it is very small; doing a biopsy could
      remove all of the parathyroid tissue. A research skin biopsy (at site of skin incision at the
      time of transplantation) was done to determine whether T cells were present
      pre-transplantation. A skin biopsy was also done at the time of thymus graft biopsy to look
      for clonal T cell populations. For all subjects who developed T cells, post-transplantation
      pneumocystis prophylaxis was used for approximately 1 year and IV immunoglobulin for
      approximately 2 years.

Depending on T cell phenotype &amp; function, subjects were given 1 of 2 immunosuppression regimes. All received rabbit anti thymocyte globulin pretransplantation. Others also received cyclosporine pre &amp; post-transplantation. The thymus dose was over 0.2 grams/kg recipient weight. Thymus transplant occurred in operating room; thymic slices were placed in quadriceps. Parathyroid harvest was done under general anesthesia. One parathyroid gland was minced and placed in quadriceps muscle. There was no dose in mg. An open biopsy of thymus allograft was done 2-3 months post-transplant. Biopsy tissue was examined by immunohistochemistry to evaluate for thymopoiesis &amp; graft rejection.</description>
