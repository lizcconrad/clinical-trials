  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to measure the effects of the drug, esomeprazole 40 mg
      (Nexium) or placebo (inactive drug) on vocal cord granulomas.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Vocal cord granulomas (VCG) are common structural lesions of vocal cords attributed to vocal
      abuse / misuse and recently to gastroesophageal reflux. Vocal process granulomas are
      reactive/reparative process, in which an intact or ulcerated squamous epithelium is underlaid
      by granulation tissue or fibrosis (4, 5). Ulualp et al (6) have reported a higher prevalence
      of pharyngeal acid reflux (PAR) events in patients with vocal cord lesions. In a case control
      study they showed that the prevalence of pharyngeal reflux, documented with 3 site
      pharyngoesophageal pH monitoring, is higher among patients with posterior laryngitis and
      vocal cord lesions than control (78% vs. 21%). Most recently our cohort trial in over 80
      patients with laryngeal findings suggestive of GERD suggested that vocal cord abnormalities
      such as granulomas may be more specific sign of GERD than any other (7). Thus, there is
      reasonable scientific intrigue regarding this laryngeal finding and the causal role from
      gastroesophagopharyngeal acid reflux requiring better studies. However, no study has
      evaluated the potential causal association between GERD and VCGs.
