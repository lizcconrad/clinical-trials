      The primary objective of the study is to evaluate the postprandial time course of
      nitrotyrosine after injection of insulin glulisine compared with regular human insulin.

      The secondary objectives are to evaluate the postprandial time course of the following
      efficacy parameters after injection of insulin glulisine compared with regular insulin on

        -  Blood Glucose

        -  Insulin

        -  Intact proinsulin

        -  Asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA)

        -  Metal matrix proteasis (MMP-9)

        -  Oxidative status (per ox)

        -  Interleukin 18 (IL-18)

        -  Free fatty acids (FFA)

        -  Oxidised LDL (ox-LDL)

        -  Microvascular blood circulation measured with laser Doppler at 37 °C (LDF37)

        -  Microvascular blood circulation measured with laser Doppler at 44 °C (LDF44)

      Phase III b Indication Type 2 Diabetes Trial Objectives 1) Primary objective: The primary
      objective of the study is to evaluate the postprandial time course of nitrotyrosine after
      injection of insulin glulisine compared with regular human insulin. 2) Secondary objectives:
      The secondary objectives are to evaluate the postprandial time course of blood glucose,
      insulin, intact proinsulin, asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA), metal matrix proteasis
      (MMP-9), free fatty acids (FFA), oxidised LDL (ox-LDL), oxidative status (per ox), IL-18 as
      well as postprandial time course of microvascular blood circulation measured with
      laserdopplerflux at 37 °C (LDF37) and 44 C (LDF44).

      Efficacy Variables Primary efficacy variablePostprandial time course of
      nitrotyrosineSecondary efficacy variablePostprandial time course of glucose, insulin, intact
      proinsulin, ADMA, MMP-9, FFA, ox-LDL, per-ox, and IL-18 as well as postprandial time course
