  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open, randomised, active-controlled, 2-period crossover study comparing the effect
      of single doses of Stalevo 200 and Sinemet on striatal (putamenal and caudate) 11C-raclopride
      BP in PD patients with wearing-off symptoms. The study consists of 4 visits: a screening
      visit (visit 1), 2 treatment periods (period 1=visit 2, period 2=visit 3) separated by a
      minimum wash-out period of at least 3 days, and an end-of-study visit (visit 4). Subjects
      will be randomly allocated to start the period 1 with a single dose of Stalevo 200 or
      Sinemet. After the wash-out the study drug on period 2 will be administered according to a
      crossover design.

      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Male or female patients with idiopathic Parkinson's disease according to the UK Brain
             Bank criteria.

          2. Predictable wearing-off symptoms with a response to standard release
             levodopa/carbidopa (200/50 mg)during the levodopa challenge test lasting for a minimum
             of 1.5 h and a maximum of 4 h.

          3. The magnitude of response (peak effect) in the levodopa challenge test is at least
             30%. The magnitude of response is defined to be the difference between the baseline
             score and the lowest UPDRS III score during the levodopa challenge test.

          4. Hoehn and Yahr stage of at least 2.0 performed during the &quot;ON&quot; state.

          5. Treatment with at least 4 daily doses of levodopa/dopa decarboxylase inhibitor (DDCI)
             (± entacapone(Comtess® or Stalevo) with total daily levodopa dose in the range of
             400-1200mg.

          6. Unchanged levodopa/DDCI ± entacapone and other antiparkinsonian medication [dopamine
             agonists,monoamine oxidase B (MAO-B) inhibitor, amantadine and/or anticholinergics
             with an approved dose], if any, for at least 2 weeks prior to period I.

          7. Written informed consent obtained.

          8. Age of 45-80 years, inclusive.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Secondary or atypical parkinsonism.

          2. Patients with any unpredictable &quot;OFF&quot;-periods.

          3. Patients with moderate to severe treatment-related peak-dose dyskinesia likely to
             affect the quality of brain magnetic resonance image (MRI) or positron emission
             tomography (PET) imaging.

          4. Failure to adequately respond to the levodopa (levodopa/carbidopa 200/50 mg) challenge
             test with the duration of response lasting less than 1.5 h or more than 4 h.

          5. Presence of a basal ganglia lesion in the MRI image or any other factor(s) that would
             make MRI or PET imaging likely to be unsatisfactory.

          6. Presence of any ferromagnetic objects that would make brain MRI imaging
             contraindicated.

          7. Patients with a history of laboratory abnormality consistent with, or clinically
             significant cardiovascular,pulmonary, gastrointestinal, hepatic, renal, neurological
             or psychiatric disorder or any other major concurrent illness, which may influence the
             outcome of the study including the interpretation and usage of MRI and PET images for
             the study purposes.

          8. History of neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS) and/or non-traumatic rhabdomyolysis,

             inhibitors.

         14. Concomitant treatment with any drugs with antidopaminergic action (e.g. with D2
             receptor blocking properties) less than two weeks or within five times the elimination
             half-life of a given drug prior to the first study drug administration. As an
             exception, the use of domperidone is allowed.

             duration of the study

         16. Patients who are likely to need a rescue dose of levodopa after the withdrawal from
             their own levodopa/DDCI ± entacapone medication prior to PET imaging.
