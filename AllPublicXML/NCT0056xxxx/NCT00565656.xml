  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objectives of this phase II trial are to test the efficacy and tolerance of Bevacizumab
      in MDS patients with excess of marrow blasts and to evaluate the impact of Bevacizumab on
      angiogenesis and erythropoiesis.

      To limit the myelotoxicity observed in the preliminary phase II study, Bevacizumab will be
      administrated at the initial dose of 5 mg/kg.

      The primary endpoint will be response: Complete Remission (CR), Partial Remission (PR) and
      hematological improvement (HI) according to IWG criteria (see appendix 3).

      The secondary endpoints will be survival, response duration, side effects, evaluation of
      angiogenesis (bone marrow microvessel density, VEGF plasma level, VEGF mRNA expression,
      HIF-1alpha expression).

      The design of this study consists of three study periods: pre-treatment (screening),
      treatment (loading and maintenance), and follow-up. All patients will participate in the
      study for at least 12 weeks of therapy, a 4-week follow-up visit, and long-term follow-up
      unless the criteria for planned or unplanned early discontinuation are met.

          -  IPSS int-1, int-2 or high

          -  Age &gt; 60 years (younger adults may be included, but only in the absence of donor for
