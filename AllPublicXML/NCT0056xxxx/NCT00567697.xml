    <textblock>
      A prospective multicenter study comparing patients with CRVO amd secondary macular edema
      treated with ranibizumab versus sham. Safety and efficacy will be evaluated. Patients will be
      randomized in a 1:1 ratio to one of the two arms. 32 patients, 6 months follow up. There will
      be monthly visits with injection the first three months and subsequently new injection if
      present edema.

          3. Use of other investigational drugs

          4. Prior treatment in the study eye with verteporfin, external-beam radiation therapy,
             subfoveal laser photocoagulation, vitrectomy, or transpupillary thermotherapy.

             intervention during the study period for the next 6 months

         16. Ocular condition that requires chronic concomitant therapy with systemic or topical
             ocular corticosteroids.

         17. Current treatment for active systemic infection.

         18. Current use or likely need for systemic medications known to be toxic to the lens,

         19. History of other diseases, metabolic dysfunction, physical examination finding, or
             clinical laboratory finding giving reasonable suspicion of a disease or condition that
             contraindicates the use of an investigational drug or might affect interpretation of
             the results of the study or render the subject at high risk for treatment
             complications

         20. History of hypersensitivity or allergy to fluorescein
