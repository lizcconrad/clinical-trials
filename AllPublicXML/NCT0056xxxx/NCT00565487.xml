  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of this study is to determine the best dosage of Capecitabine and Tarceva
      combination in the setting of radiation and to assess treatment effectiveness,
      progression-free survival and overall survival.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Over the past several decades, 5-fluorouracil based chemoradiation has been the cornerstone
      for the treatment of locally advanced non-operable pancreatic cancer. However, the survival
      of these patients is disappointing. The majority of the patients suffer either local
      progression or metastatic disease. With the availability of Capecitabine, a few pilot studies
      showed the the drug is convenient, tolerable and safe in combination with radiation therapy.
      Capecitabine demonstrated its superior anti-tumor activity with 14 months of median survival.
      However, these are small Phase I studies and the survival benefit needs to be further
      validated with larger studies. Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) has been implicated in
      tumor growth and angiogenesis. Inhibiting EGFR by Tarceva has demonstrated effective
      treatment in metastatic pancreatic cancer. Anti-epidermal growth factor therapy in
      combination with radiotherapy has been demonstrated efficacious in other solid tumors such as
      head and neck cancer. We hypothesize that the combination of Tarceva and Capecitabine has
      synergistic anti-tumor effect. Hence, improvement of median survival could be potentially
      achieved with this novel combination.

    <description>Capecitabine is a self-administered (oral) medication &amp; will be dose escalated and administered in four dose levels: Level I - 600 mg/m2 bid; Level II - 700 mg/m2 bid; Level III - 825 mg/m2 bid; Level IV - 925 mg/m2 bid. Tarceva will be self-administered(orally) in an open-label, unblinded manner to all patients enrolled in the study. During the treatment period, patients will receive single agent Tarceva 100 mg/day. Treatment of Capecitabine &amp; Tarceva is continued daily until the completeness of the radiation or toxicity.</description>
