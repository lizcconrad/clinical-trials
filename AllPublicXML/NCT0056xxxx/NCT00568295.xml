      An initial screening visit was performed in order to assess subject medical history and the
      potential eligibility of subjects. Following the initial screening visit, all potential
      subjects underwent a washout period from their usual arthritis medication and returned to the
      study center for a baseline visit to verify their eligibility.

      At the completion of the baseline visit, all eligible subjects were randomly assigned to a
      treatment group and instructed on the dosing regimen for their assigned study medication.

      Subjects returned to the study center for follow-up visits after Week 1 and Week 2 of
      treatment and a final visit after Week 4 of treatment or upon discontinuation from the study.

             excretion of the study medications or interfere with interpretation of adverse
             reactions to the study drug.

          -  History of allergy, sensitivity, contraindication or non-response to acetaminophen,
             rofecoxib, or drugs classified as NSAIDs including aspirin.

          -  Use of concomitant medications that might interfere with study drug assessments,
             including intra-articular corticosteroids.

          -  Signs of active knee inflammation, morning stiffness of greater than 30 minutes
             duration.

          -  Rheumatoid factor quantitative value greater than or equal to 40 IU/mL or a Westergren
             erythrocyte sedimentation rate greater than or equal to 40 mm/hour.

          -  ACR functional class III or IV, or unable to walk without assistive devices.
