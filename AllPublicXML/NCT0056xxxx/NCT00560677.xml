      We propose to establish a database characterizing the presence or absence of comorbid PTSD in
      veterans with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder (SAD) receiving services at the
      Durham VA Medical Center. In addition to the evaluation of PTSD symptoms in veterans with
      schizophrenia or SAD, this database will facilitate the investigation of a number of
      additional specific research questions relevant to veterans with psychotic disorders.

    <description>The Brief Assessment of Cognition in Schizophrenia (BACS) includes brief assessments of executive functions, verbal fluency, attention, verbal memory, working memory and motor speed. Z-scores are calculated from composite scores. Higher z-scores are indicative of better cognitive performance, lower z-scores are indicative of lower cognitive performance. Range of z-scores anticipated to be between -3 and 3.</description>
