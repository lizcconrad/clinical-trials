      Background:

      Sj(SqrRoot)(Delta)gren s Syndrome (SS) is an autoimmune disease that affects the glands that
      produce saliva and tears, causing dry eyes and dry mouth.

      Researchers do not know the exact cause of SS, but they believe that it may be caused by
      abnormalities in the autonomic nervous system (ANS) that stimulate these glands.

      Objectives:

      To better understand ANS function in patients with SS.

      To compare information about ANS function in healthy individuals and in patients with SS.

      Eligibility:

      Patients with Sj(SqrRoot)(Delta)gren s Syndrome who are 18 years of age and older, and who
      are not pregnant or breastfeeding.

      Participants will be asked to taper or discontinue the use of certain medications or dietary
      supplements before the ANS testing.

      Participants must be willing to discontinue the use of alcohol and tobacco 24 hours prior to
      testing.

      Design:

      The study will require one inpatient admission and/or outpatient visits to the NIH Clinical
      Center.

      The following tests and procedures will be performed:

        -  Saliva, tear, and sweat production measurements to evaluate the function of glands.

        -  Testing of changes to the cardiovascular system, including blood pressure and blood flow
           testing, and an electrocardiogram designed to evaluate hemodynamic changes controlled by
           the ANS.

        -  Testing of changes to the gastrointestinal system, including a swallowing assessment
           study, barium swallow study, and gastric emptying study designed to evaluate
           gastrointestinal function controlled by the ANS.

        -  Tests to evaluate the ANS function in response to certain drugs (edrophonium, glucagon
           and acetylcholine).

        -  Self-reported questionnaire on ANS function and emotional/psychological well-being.

      Additional procedures and tests may include the following:

        -  Blood samples.

        -  Optional skin biopsy to study sweat glands and nerve supply of the skin.

      Sj(SqrRoot)(Delta)gren s syndrome (SjS) is a systemic exocrinopathy that affects as high as 5
      percent of the population. It is manifested predominantly as dry eyes, dry mouth, and
      fatigue. The exocrinopathy can be encountered alone (primary SjS) in approximately one half
      of the patients or in the presence of another autoimmune disorder such as rheumatoid
      arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, or systemic sclerosis (secondary SjS). The most
      widely accepted classification for SjS is the American-European consensus classification
      criteria for SjS.(Vitali, Bombardieri et al. 2002)

      Current understanding about the pathogenesis of SjS stems from the assumption that the
      autoimmune destruction of the exocrine glands leads to their hypofunction and symptoms of
      dryness. The existing evidence however does not fully support this assumption and cannot
      explain the underlying pathogenic mechanisms of SjS for the following reasons: 1) Discordance
      between severely affected function and abundance of histologically normal and ex vivo
      functional salivary glands; 2) at least 20% of patients have no evidence of systemic
      autoimmunity; 3) Animal models of SjS develop glandular dysfunction long before they develop
      autoimmunity; 4) Dryness and related symptoms respond poorly to immunosuppressive, including
      newer biologics, but fairly well to secretagogues such as pilocarpine. 5) No pathogenic
      antibodies or target epitopes have been identified to date to unify the pathogenesis of the
      syndrome.

      All exocrine glands are innervated by the autonomic nervous system (ANS) and dysautonomia can
      mimic the phenotype of SjS, particularly cardinal manifestations, such as xerostomia and
      xerophthalmia. Thus we hypothesize that ANS dysfunction is central to the pathogenesis of SjS
      and propose to systematically study the ANS function in our cohort of patients with primary
      SjS compared with normative data from age and sex-matched controls. This protocol calls for a
      comprehensive evaluation of autonomic function, using physiological, neuropharmacologic,
      neurochemical, and imaging approaches, to identify consistent distinctive patterns of ANS
      involvement in SjS and thereby improve the diagnosis and understanding of pathophysiologic
      mechanisms of SjS.

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:

               1. Diagnosis of primary Sjogren s syndrome based on American-European Consensus
                  Group Sjogren s syndrome classification criteria or healthy volunteers.

               2. Both genders and all minorities.

               3. Age at entry at least 18 and less than 65 years.

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:

          1. Current use of medications known to significantly influence the activity of the
             sympathetic or parasympathetic nervous system if they cannot be held safely at the
             time of ANS testing

          2. Known co-existing diagnosis of ANS dysfunction (for healthy volunteers)

          3. Medications-requiring diabetes mellitus

          4. Diabetic autonomic neuropathy

          5. Vitamin B12, folate deficiency, requiring replacement

          6. Hepatic failure (AST or ALT greater than 1.5 x upper limit of normal)

          7. Renal failure (GFR less than 30 ml/min, as estimated by the MDRD)

          8. Congestive heart failure (Class II-IV)

          9. Refractory ventricular arrhythmias

         10. Symptomatic coronary heart disease

         13. Psychosis

         14. Pregnant or lactating women

         15. A candidate subject is excluded if, in the judgment of the Principal Investigator,
             protocol participation would place the subject at substantially increased acute
             medical risk.

         16. Not able to provide informed consent

        Medications: A candidate subject is excluded if clinical considerations require that the
        subject continue treatment with a drug likely to interfere with the scientific results i.e.
        a tricyclic antidepressant or fludrocortisone. Subjects with known or suspected allergy or
        hypersensitivity to any test drug are excluded from receiving that drug. Subjects who must
        take medications daily in the following categories are excluded: tricyclic antidepressants,
        beta blockers, barbiturates, if they cannot be safely held during testing. Subjects unable
        to discontinue nicotine or alcohol temporarily are excluded. Subjects are not to
        discontinue any medications before the subject or the subject s physician discusses this
        with the Principal Investigator, Dr. Nikolov, or the Associate Investigator, Dr. Goldstein.
        If it is decided that discontinuing medications would be unsafe, then the subject is
        excluded from the study. Subjects must discontinue use of alcohol and tobacco throughout
        the period of testing in the protocol.

        Herbal Medicines and Dietary Supplements: Certain herbal medicines or dietary supplements
        are known or suspected to interfere with the experimental results, and such herbal
        medicines or dietary supplements must be discontinued before enrollment in the study. For
        many herbal medicines or dietary supplements, the mechanisms of action and therefore the
        possible effects on the experimental results are unknown. In cases where the subjects wish
        to continue their herbal medicines or dietary supplements while on study, and search of the
        available medical literature fails to identify effects that are known or expected to
        interfere with the experimental results, then the subjects may participate.
