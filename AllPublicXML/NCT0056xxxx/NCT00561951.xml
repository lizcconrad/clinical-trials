        <title>Change From Baseline in Each Domain Scores of Overactive Bladder Questionnaire (OAB-q) at Week 12.</title>
        <description>The overactive bladder questionnaire (OAB-q) is used to assess the extent of participants who had been bothered by selected bladder symptoms and to assess the effect on their health-related quality of life (HRQL).
The each domain score ranges from 0 to 100 is a calculated value, where 0=minimal symptom severity and 100=greatest symptom severity for Symptom Bother Score, and where 0=worst HRQL outcome/response and 100=best HRQL outcome/response for HRQL domains including total score of HROL domain.
Change: mean at Week 12 minus mean at Baseline.</description>
