      224 adults with diabetic foot ulcers will be randomized to either magainin peptide (MSI-78)
      or ofloxacin (FLOXIN, Ortho-McNeil Pharmaceutical Corporation) an oral fluoroquinolone
      antibiotic.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Approximately 224 adults will be enrolled in an outpatient Phase III study to compare the
      safety and efficacy of topically applied magainin peptide (MSI-78) to that of ofloxacin
      (FLOXIN, Ortho-McNeil Pharmaceutical Corporation) an oral fluoroquinolone antibiotic, in the
      treatment of infected diabetic foot ulcers.

      This is a randomized, controlled, double-blind trial that will involve twenty or more
      clinical centers.
