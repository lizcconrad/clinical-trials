      The study examines the relative efficacy of two active aftercare interventions (i.e.,
      face-to-face , brief phone) with no-active aftercare for adolescents who completed outpatient
      treatment for alcohol use disorders(AUD)

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In this study 177 adolescents meeting criteria for alcohol use disorders (AUD) received
      weekly cognitive-behavioral therapy group sessions. 144 completers were randomized into the 3
      individual aftercare (AR) conditions noted above. Manualized active interventions were
      composed of 5 sessions of integrated motivational enhancement and cognitive behavioral
      therapies. Outcomes assessments were done at end of aftercare, 3-6-and 12 months post AC
      completion.
