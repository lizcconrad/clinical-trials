    <textblock>
      This trial is designed to determine if administering repetitive transcranial magnetic
      stimulation (rTMS) simultaneously to two sites in the temporal lobes, one on the left and one
      on the right, produces greater improvements in &quot;voices&quot; and other symptoms of schizophrenia
      compared to rTMS given to just one site in the temporal lobes.

    <textblock>
      This study is an extension of an ongoing clinical trial (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT
      00308997) that was initiated in 2006. The primary objective of the ongoing clinical trial
      (hereafter called the &quot;parent trial&quot;) is to determine efficacy of rTMS in curbing auditory
      hallucinations when delivered to a part of the left temporal lobe called Wernicke's area and
      a corresponding region in the right temporal lobe. The parent trial appears to show robust
      effects for active rTMS compared to effects of sham stimulation. However, observed responses
      following active rTMS have often been incomplete. Moreover, in some cases there has been a
      subsequent return of symptoms 1 to 6 months after the trial ended.

      We consequently have initiated a trial where patients who have participated in the parent
      trial and demonstrated an incomplete response or a subsequent return of symptoms may return
      to receive additional active rTMS. We hypothesize that efficacy of suppressive rTMS will be
      enhanced if directed simultaneously to right/left Wernicke's area (the site used in the
      parent trial) as well as to a second site located in the opposite middle temporal cortex.
      Roughly half of subjects in the re-enrollment will be randomized to receive active rTMS to
      right/left Wernicke's area plus active rTMS to opposite hemisphere middle temporal region,
      while half of subjects will be randomized to receive active rTMS to right/left Wernicke's
      area plus sham rTMS to opposite hemisphere middle temporal region. The position of the middle
      temporal regions will be determined by two recently completed brain imaging studies of
      auditory hallucinations suggesting that activation in these sites triggers auditory
      hallucinations. The two-position design will allow us to determine if active rTMS delivered
      to the middle temporal cortex is superior in amplifying efficacy of active rTMS targeting
      Wernicke's area and in reducing auditory hallucinations to sham stimulation to the same site.
      The re-enrollment protocol will utilize two rTMS devices simultaneously where one directly
      triggers the other.

      We have added a third arm to the protocol (3/2012) where the same intervention described for
      Arm 1 is provided to enrollees, but no randomization or comparison with Arm 2 is pursued. The
      primary purpose of this Arm is to conduct fMRI neuroimaging studies prior to and subsequent
      to the rTMS intervention. Our intent is to ascertain changes in regional brain activation and
      connectivity that most robustly predict level of improvement in auditory hallucinations
      elicited by bilateral rTMS as assessed by our primary outcome variables. This combined
      fMRI/rTMS study will provide critical new insights into the neurobiological basis of auditory
      hallucinations.

    <description>Week 1 treatment includes rTMS for 5 sessions to either to left or right Wernicke's area (BA22) synchronous with rTMS to opposite hemisphere middle temporal cortex (BA21). Week 2 treatment includes rTMS given for 5 sessions with positions reversed (e.g., if Wernicke's stimulation was on the left during Week 1, position of rTMS will switch to the right side during Week 2 and vice-versa). As in Week 1, active rTMS will also be given synchronously to the opposite hemisphere middle temporal cortex. Weeks 3 and 4 include 10 stimulation sessions to the configuration of sites producing greater improvement in comparing results of Week 1 and Week 2. rTMS for each stimulation session will be given at 1-Hertz (once per second) for 16 minutes without interruption.</description>
