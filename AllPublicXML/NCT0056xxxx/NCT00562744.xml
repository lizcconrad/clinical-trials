  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patient simulation is a new and expanding technology that has proven effective as a teaching
      tool in various clinical settings, but data on pediatric simulation is lacking. Mock
      resuscitation scenarios have been shown in prior studies to be effective for improving
      knowledge, skill, and confidence in pediatric housestaff. Our objective is to assess the
      utility of a training program utilizing a human patient simulator of an infant as a teaching
      tool for pediatric housestaff training in resuscitation skills. We hypothesize that mock
      resuscitation exercises performed by pediatric housestaff on a patient simulator will result
      in improved performance on test scenarios when compared to the same training on a standard
      manikin.

      Patient simulation is a new and expanding technology that has proven effective as a teaching
      tool in various clinical settings, but data on pediatric simulation is lacking. Mock
      resuscitation scenarios have been shown in prior studies to be effective for improving
      knowledge, skill, and confidence in pediatric housestaff. Our objective is to assess the
      utility of a training program utilizing a human patient simulator of an infant as a teaching

      resuscitation exercises performed by pediatric housestaff on a patient simulator will result
      in improved performance on test scenarios when compared to the same training on a standard
      manikin.

      We propose a randomized trial of pediatric residents of identical training levels from three
      children's hospitals. Participants will be assigned to a control group or an intervention
      group. The control group will undertake mock resuscitation scenarios on a standard manikin;
      the intervention group will perform the same exercises on a simulator. A test scenario will
      be administered at the end of each set of training scenarios and frequency and timing of a
      predetermined list of critical clinical assessments and interventions will be recorded.
      Analysis will consist of a comparison between control and intervention groups for success
      rates and time to completion for clinical assessments and interventions.
