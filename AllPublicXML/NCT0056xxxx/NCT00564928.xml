      To determine:

        -  Anti-tumor activity of IPI-504 in 2 groups of subjects with hormone resistant prostate
           cancer.

        -  Group A - subjects who have not previously received chemotherapy

        -  Group B - sujects who have received prior chemotherapy or could not tolerate
           chemotherapy.

        -  Clinical response will be determined by PSA and radiological response

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      IPI-504 is a novel, water-soluble analog of 17-AAG and a potent inhibitor of Hsp90. Hsp90's
      role in the cell is to control the proper folding, function, and viability of various
      &quot;client&quot; proteins. Many of these client proteins (such as AKT, Her-2, Bcr-Abl, PDGFR-Î±, and
      c-Kit) are oncoproteins or important cell signaling proteins. Inhibition of HSP-90 leads to
      the proteasomal degradation of these proteins.

      In patients with HRPC,there are several proteins that are important in the progression of
      HRPC, including AR, AKT and Her-2. All of these are client proteins of Hsp90 and in response
      to Hsp90 inhibition are degraded by their proteasome. Preclinical studies have shown that
      Hsp90 inhibition causes a dose dependent degradation of these client proteins and growth
      inhibition of prostate cancer in xenograft tumors.
