    <description>S-1 is administered orally on days 1 to 28 of a 42-day cycle. Patients are assigned on the basis of body surface area (BSA) to receive one of the following oral doses twice daily: 40 mg (BSA &lt;1.25 m2), 50 mg (BSA &gt;1.25 to &lt;1.50 m2), or 60 mg (BSA &gt;1.50 m2).
Bevacizumab 5 mg/kg (body weight) is administered by intravenous infusion on days 1, and 15.</description>

          5. Age &gt;65 years

          6. Life expectancy of at least 3 months

          7. ECOG PS of 0, 1, or 2

          8. Adequate function of major organs as defined below:

               6. AST and ALT &lt;100 U/L (&lt;200 U/L in patients with liver metastasis)

               7. Serum creatinine &lt;1.2 mg/dL

               8. Creatinine clearance estimate by the Cockcroft-Gault method &gt;50 mL/min

          9. Able to take capsules orally.

         10. No electrocardiographic abnormalities within 28 days before enrollment that would
             clinically preclude the execution of the study, as judged by the investigator.

         11. Voluntary written informed consent.
