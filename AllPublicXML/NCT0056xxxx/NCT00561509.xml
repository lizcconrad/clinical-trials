      with any SSRI or a Dual antidepressant as per the best clinical decision of their treating
      psychiatrist. Sexual dysfunction will be identified along the 6 months of active observation.
      Psychiatrists will decide to change dose, augment, shift or combine antidepressants at their
      clinical discretion in the benefit of their patients and all clinical decisions will be
      recorded.Comparisons among antidepressants will be made in terms of their sexual dysfunction
      potentiality.
