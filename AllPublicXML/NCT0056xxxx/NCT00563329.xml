    <textblock>
      The aims of this study are (1) to examine the effect of smoking reduction intervention
      (reduction counseling and nicotine replacement therapy, NRT) (a) on smoking cessation and (b)
      on reducing daily cigarette consumption among smokers not willing to quit smoking but want to
      reduce smoking, and (2) to examine the effect of adherence intervention in producing a higher
      (a) adherence rate, (b) reduction rate, and (c) quit rate.
