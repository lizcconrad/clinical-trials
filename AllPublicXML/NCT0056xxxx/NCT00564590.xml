      We hypothesize that melatonin as compared to PPI and to placebo, improves GERD symptoms by
      decreasing esophageal acid exposure and esophageal acid sensitivity in GERD. We hypothesize
      that melatonin as compared to PPI and to placebo reduce the frequency and duration of
      transient lower esophageal sphincter relaxations (TLESRs). In addition we hypothesize that
      melatonin as compared to PPI and to placebo improves quality of life and quality of sleep of
      GERD patients.

      Background: Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) is a chronic, persistent and common
      medical problem. The standard of care for GERD includes chronic administration of
      acid-suppressive drugs. However, clinical failure in GERD is increasingly reported.

      Aim: To determine the efficacy of treatment with melatonin as compared to standard dose
      proton pump inhibitor (PPI) as compared to placebo in patients with GERD.

      Study objectives: [1] To compare the degree of GERD symptoms improvement and esophageal acid
      sensitivity before and after treatment. [2] To determine the effect of treatment on the %
      total, upright and supine time pH &lt;4 using 24-hour esophageal pH monitoring. [3] To determine
      the effect of treatment on frequency and duration of lower esophageal sphincter relaxation.
      [4] To compare the quality of life and quality of sleep in GERD patients before and after
      treatment.

      Methods: This is a randomized, double blind, parallel groups study of 150 patients with GERD.
      Patients with classic heartburn symptoms (heartburn and/or regurgitation) and normal upper
      endoscopy from the gastroenterology department at Rabin Medical Center will be enrolled into
      the study. At baseline, all enrolled patients will have 24-hour esophageal pH monitoring and
      a modified acid perfusion test to assess the extent of distal esophageal acid exposure and
      esophageal acid sensitivity, respectively. Patients will be evaluated by a demographics
      questionnaire, the GERD Symptom Questionnaire, the Quality of Sleep questionnaire and the
      SF-36. Baseline urinary excretion of the main melatonin metabolite, 6-sulfatoxymelatonin
      (6SMT) will be assessed in all subjects at baseline. Patients will be randomized to either
      melatonin or standard dose PPI or placebo over a period of 4 weeks. In addition patients will
      fill a diary on a daily basis that documents severity and frequency of GERD-related symptoms.
      Symptom score (frequency x severity) will be calculated for previous 7 days at baseline and
      at the end of treatment in all groups. After 4 weeks of treatment, patients will undergo a
      second 24-hour esophageal pH monitoring, a modified acid perfusion test and will complete the
      GERD Symptom Questionnaire, the Quality of Sleep Questionnaire and the SF-36.

      Implications: This study will determine if melatonin decreases GERD symptoms, acid esophageal
      exposure and improves quality of life and sleep in patients with GERD. Furthermore, if there
      will be a significant clinical response to melatonin it will be possible to add this compound
      to the treatment armamentum of GERD.
