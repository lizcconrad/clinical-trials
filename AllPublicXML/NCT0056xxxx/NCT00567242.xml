  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if an &quot;intentional act&quot; improves treatment response
      for patients with nonfluent aphasia. The treatment involves naming pictures and saying
      members of categories. The &quot;intentional act&quot; requires initiating picture naming or category
      member trials with a left-hand movement sequence. Nonfluent aphasia is a disorder of language
      production in which patients with damage to the brain's language system have trouble
      initiating and maintaining spoken communication. All patients participating in the study take
      part in functional MRI scans to determine how treatments affect brain systems.

    <textblock>
      A new treatment manipulating intention substrates for language production in &quot;nonfluent&quot;
      aphasia patients was developed. The intention component involves initiating word-finding
      trials with a complex left-hand movement. The study addresses (1) whether or not the
      intention manipulation (complex left-hand movement) makes a unique contribution to treatment
      outcome and (2) whether or not the intention manipulation helps to shift word production
      mechanisms from the left to the right frontal lobe. All study participants take part in
      functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) scans of word-finding before and after treatment
      and at 3-month follow-up to measure changes in lateralization of frontal lobe activity during
      word finding. Only patients with a substantial degree of left frontal activity on the
      pre-treatment fMRI scan can participate. There are three specific aims: (1) to determine if
      repetitive initiation of word production with a complex left-hand movement leads to increased
      right-hemisphere lateralization of frontal activity and if these changes can be attributed to
      the intention component of treatment, (2) to determine whether activity in posterior
      perisylvian cortices that is entrained to right frontal activity shows a greater increase in
      right-hemisphere lateralization from pre- to post-treatment fMRI when the intention component
      is included in treatment, and (3) to determine whether onset of hemodynamic responses (HDRs)
      in right motor/premotor cortex becomes more closely associated with the temporal onset of
      participants' spoken responses across treatment when the intention component is included in
      treatment. If successful, the treatment can provide a new treatment vehicle for increasing
      language function in patients with &quot;nonfluent&quot; aphasia.

    <time_frame>immediately post-treatment scan minus pre-treatment baseline scan</time_frame>
    <description>Functional MRI laterality indices (LIs)were calculated for lateral frontal, medial frontal, and posterior perisylvian cortex regions of interest (ROIs): L=number of active voxels in left hemisphere ROI and R=number of active voxels in right hemisphere ROI using the following formula: (L-R)/(L+R). LIs could vary from -1 (completely right lateralized) to +1 (completely left lateralized). Then, change in LIs was calculated by subtracting the pre-treatment from the post-treatment and 3-mo follow-up LI. It was expected the intention manipulation would show a rightward shift in LI.</description>

    <description>Improvement for the time series from 8 baseline sessions through 30 treatment sessions for naming probes was computed with the C statistic using Tryon's (1982, 1983) formula for each subject. C statistics were converted to Z scores, using the formula provided by Tryon (1982). Z scores indicated treatment change for each subject, with a positive and significant Z score indicating substantive treatment gains. Z scores were then compared between groups with a t statistic. It was expected that the intention manipulation would lead to greater treatment gains than when it was not used.</description>

      <pre_assignment_details>Prior to trial assignment, subjects underwent a functional MRI scan to determine degree of lateralization of frontal activity during word generation. Subjects with a high degree of right frontal lateralization of activity were excluded. Further, patients whose naming scores indicated that they were no more than minimally anomic were excluded.</pre_assignment_details>

        <title>Lateralization of Frontal Lobe (and Posterior Perisylvian) Activity During Word Production</title>
        <description>Functional MRI laterality indices (LIs)were calculated for lateral frontal, medial frontal, and posterior perisylvian cortex regions of interest (ROIs): L=number of active voxels in left hemisphere ROI and R=number of active voxels in right hemisphere ROI using the following formula: (L-R)/(L+R). LIs could vary from -1 (completely right lateralized) to +1 (completely left lateralized). Then, change in LIs was calculated by subtracting the pre-treatment from the post-treatment and 3-mo follow-up LI. It was expected the intention manipulation would show a rightward shift in LI.</description>

        <description>Improvement for the time series from 8 baseline sessions through 30 treatment sessions for naming probes was computed with the C statistic using Tryon's (1982, 1983) formula for each subject. C statistics were converted to Z scores, using the formula provided by Tryon (1982). Z scores indicated treatment change for each subject, with a positive and significant Z score indicating substantive treatment gains. Z scores were then compared between groups with a t statistic. It was expected that the intention manipulation would lead to greater treatment gains than when it was not used.</description>
