      · What we know: Hydrosalpinx and IVF About 40% of patients undergoing IVF have tubal disease
      and in 25%-30% of tubal disease patients there is fluid collection within the tube;
      hydrosalpinx. The amount of fluid in the hydrosalpinx is known to increase with ovarian
      stimulation (as in IVF) and often empties into the uterine cavity. Fluid from hydrosalpinges
      has been found to be detrimental to the growth and development of mouse embryos in vitro, and
      associated with reduced levels of endometrial integrins in vivo. This could be the
      explanation of the reduced pregnancy rates after IVF in patients with tubal disease and
      hydrosalpinx compared with those with tubal disease but no hydrosalpinx. This effect was
      evidence in both fresh and frozen embryo transfer cycles. Also there was a significant
      increase in miscarriage in association with hydrosalpinx.

      The study aims to answer the question: does ultrasound-guided aspiration of ultrasound
      diagnosed hydrosalpinx at the time of egg collection improve the pregnancy rate in IVF?

      · What we do not know: Treatment of hydrosalpinx and IVF Several studies in the literature
      have suggested that the treatment of hydrosalpinx pre-IVF would improve the pregnancy rate to
      a level similar to tubal disease patients without hydrosalpinx. The treatment modalities
      explored were salpingectomy, salpingostomy, tubal occlusion and ultrasound-guided aspiration
      either one month before or at the time of egg collection. All studies reported to date have
      been retrospective and with poor control design. A prospective randomised controlled trial is
      needed. All modalities have been associated with a similar improvement in pregnancy rate, but
      the least invasive modality is ultrasound-guided aspiration at the time of oocyte collection.
      We propose to conduct a prospective randomised controlled trial to evaluate the effect of
      ultrasound-guided aspiration (versus no aspiration) of hydrosalpinx at the time of egg
      collection on the pregnancy rate in IVF.

    <description>For those assigned to Group 1, the hydrosalpinx will be aspirated after all the eggs have been collected, under GA. Under ultrasound-guidance, the aspiration (egg collection) needle will be inserted into the hydrosalpinx and suction applied until no more fluid is obtained.
