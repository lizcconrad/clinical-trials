  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Vorinostat (Suberoylanilide Hydroxamic Acid; NSC 701852) is a drug that inhibits an enzyme
      that plays a key role in the regulation of cell survival, growth, and eventual cell death,
      all of which play a role in cancer. As a result, this drug has the potential to affect a
      tumor's ability to survive. Vorinostat is the most potent drug of its kind that is currently
      under investigation in clinical trials. The primary objective of this study is to define the
      maximum safest dose of vorinostat in combination with a standard chemotherapy agent,
      docetaxel, in patients with advanced and relapsed lung, bladder, or prostate cancer.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Vorinostat (also known as Suberoylanilide Hydroxamic Acid) is a new investigational drug that
      is not approved by the Food and Drug Administration. This drug has shown promising activity
      against a number of cancers. We want to determine if treatment with vorinostat in combination
      with a standard type of chemotherapy (docetaxel [Taxotereâ„¢]) is safe and possibly better than
      treatment with docetaxel alone. We also want to find out more about how patients and the
      cancer will react to the drugs, what happens to vorinostat in the human body (how your body
      reacts to this drug and breaks it down) and about its side effects when used in combination
      with chemotherapy (docetaxel).

      The purpose of this study is to:

        -  Test the safety of the research study drug, vorinostat

        -  To determine if any toxicities or severe side effects occur when combining vorinostat
           with docetaxel (a standard chemotherapy treatment)

        -  To study how your body takes in, breaks down and responds to vorinostat

        -  To obtain more evidence of the ability of vorinostat to react against cancer, such as
           the kind that you have.

      The use of vorinostat in combination with chemotherapy such as docetaxel may result in
      improved response of the cancer to treatment. Indeed, vorinostat may have an added benefit
      with docetaxel by promoting cancer cell death. This is because both drugs can interfere with
      the ability of the cancer to grow, although the way vorinostat does this is not clearly
      defined. Vorinostat and docetaxel both can disrupt the cancer's ability to produce daughter
      cancer cells and therefore, the administration of vorinostat before docetaxel is hoped to be
      better then either drug alone.
