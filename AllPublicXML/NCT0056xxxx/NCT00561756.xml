      RATIONALE: Vaccines made from mouse DNA may help the body build an effective immune response
      to kill cancer cells.

      PURPOSE: This phase I trial is studying the side effects and best dose of mouse DNA vaccine
      in treating patients with recurrent B-cell lymphoma.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  To evaluate the safety and feasibility of intramuscular DNA vaccination with a plasmid
           DNA vector expressing the mouse extracellular domain of CD20, namely pINGmminiCD20.
           Doses of pING-mminiCD20 will be escalated by group to determine the optimal biological
           dose.

      Secondary

        -  To evaluate antibody and T-cell responses to CD20 after vaccination.

        -  To observe patients for evidence of any antitumor response generated after vaccination.

      OUTLINE: The entire immunization schedule comprises five injections administered every three
      weeks (for a total of approximately four and one half months). After the second injection,
      blood will be drawn for assessment of antibody and T-cell responses. After the fifth and
      final injection, blood will again be drawn for assessment of antibody and T-cell responses.

    <description>This single arm, open-label, phase I clinical trial of xenogeneic CD20 DNA vaccination is designed to evaluate its safety in patients with B cell lymphoma. The study is a dose escalation study at three test doses, 0.5 mg, 2 mg and 4 mg of purified plasmid DNA per injection. There will be an initial cohort of three patients receiving a pre-level 1 dose of 0.1 mg/vaccination before proceeding to the three test doses.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients must have a functional immune system as determined by the following tests:

          -  Serum proteins immunoelectrophoresis (serum IgG levels ≥ 0.5 g/dL are required)

          -  No evidence of anergy as shown by positive skin test with tetanus toxoid, mumps or
             Candida. OR

          -  Circulating T-cells as measured by flow cytometry (serum CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell counts ≥
             250 and 150 cells/μL, respectively) Patients must have histologically proven (and
             confirmed at MSKCC) B-cell lymphoma of any histology, excluding Burkitt's lymphoma,
             Lymphoblastic lymphoma (due to their aggressiveness and low likelihood of response to
             immune therapy).

          -  CD20 surface expression must be confirmed by immunohistochemical staining or flow.

          -  Measurable disease is not a pre-requisite for enrollment in the study. However, if a
             patient does have measurable disease as evidenced by imaging studies, these have to be
             done within eight weeks of starting treatment.

          -  Patients must have a Karnofsky performance status ≥ 70%.

          -  Patients with evidence of active disease, progression of disease or relapsed disease
             following one or more prior regimens of chemotherapy, immunotherapy or radiation
             therapy (including autologous stem cell transplants), not requiring immediate
             cytoreductive chemotherapy. All treatment must be completed at least four weeks prior
             to administration of the first vaccination, except immunotherapy and
             radioimmunotherapy, which must be completed at least 90 days prior to receiving the
             first vaccination. Active disease includes patients with minor or partial responses
             after therapy as evidenced by FDG-avid disease or biopsy.

          -  Age ≥ 18.

          -  Adequate contraception during study enrollment.

          -  Avoidance of breast-feeding their infants during the study enrollment.

          -  Patients must have adequate organ and marrow function as defined below:

          -  Absolute Neutrophil Count ≥ 1,000/uL

             entering the study.

          -  Patients who have undergone an allogeneic stem cell transplant at any time.

          -  Patients who have not recovered from adverse events due to agents administered more
             than 4 weeks earlier.

          -  Patients who have received immunotherapy (i.e. rituximab) or radioimmuno therapy (i.e.
             tositumomab or ibritumomab) within the past 90 days.

        Patients who display signs of anergy as indicated by skin testing.

          -  Patients with Burkitt's lymphoma and Lymphoblastic Lymphoma.

          -  Patients who have been previously immunized with any type of DNA vaccine.

          -  Patients who have positive anti-DS-DNA antibodies.

          -  Patients with life expectancy less than 3 months from the time of enrollment.

          -  Patients with active Hepatitis C (HC) or Hepatitis B (HB) infection, the latter
             defined as a positive test for HBsAg or measurable viral load. In patients who are
             HBsAg negative but HBsAg positive (regardless of HBsAb status), a HB viral load will
             be performed and if positive the subject will be excluded. If the subject is HBsAg
             negative, HBcAb positive (regardless of HBsAb status) but with negative HBV viral
             load, the subject may be included but must undergo HBV DNA PCR testing at least every
             two months from the start of treatment during the routine study visits for as long as
             the subject remains on study. Prophylactic antiviral therapy, in addition to the
             monitoring described above, may be initiated at the discretion of the investigator.

        Patients with documented HIV infection or other immunodeficiency disorder or on chronic
        steroids treatment.

          -  Patients with autoimmune diseases such as but not limited to rheumatoid arthritis,
             Sjogren disease, ulcerative colitis, autoimmune hepatitis.
