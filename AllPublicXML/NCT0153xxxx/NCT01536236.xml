    <textblock>
      There is a medication arm and a stimulation arm. Patients will randomized to one or the
      other. If patients are randomized to the medication arm, after 6 months they have the option
      of going into the stimulation arm. There is a 3 week trial which includes a crossover period
      from &quot;no stimulation&quot; to subthreshold stimulation. The 3rd week patients will receive
      &quot;optimal&quot; stimulation. If they qualify, they will be implanted with the permanent device.

    <measure>Neuropathy Impairment in the Lower Limbs (NIS-LL)</measure>
    <time_frame>24 months</time_frame>
    <description>Neuropathy Impairment Score in the Lower Limbs (NIS-LL):
The NIS-LL is a quantitative neurological examination that evaluates changes in motor, sensory and reflex activity in the lower limbs. The test has 14 items: 8 to evaluate muscle strength (64 possible points), 2 items to evaluate reflex activity (8 possible points), and 4 items to evaluate sensory activity (16 possible points). All items are tested bilaterally and the maximum score is 88 points.</description>

    <measure>Nerve conduction studies and Electromyogram (EMG)</measure>
    <time_frame>24 months</time_frame>
    <description>Electromyography (EMG) is a technique for evaluating and recording the electrical activity of muscles. This test will be performed according to standard practice.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Inflammatory mediators (IL-6, IL-1β, and CRP)</measure>
    <time_frame>24 months</time_frame>
    <description>A complete blood count (CBC), comprehensive metabolic panel (CMP) and PT, (Prothrombin Time), PTT (Partial Thromboplastin Time) will be performed as well as assessment of hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), interleukin-6 (IL-6), interleukin-1 beta (IL-1β), and C-reactive protein (CRP) levels. HbA1c is used to evaluate the amount of glycosylated hemoglobin in the blood which is indicative of blood glucose levels. IL-6 and IL-1β, and CRP are indicators of an inflammatory response and are consistently associated with diabetic polyneuropathy.</description>

    <measure>Vascular Doppler</measure>

    <description>The SF-36 is a 36-item tool for measuring health related quality of life from the patient's point of view. The items on the questionnaire are scored and divided into 8 sub-scales, and each subscale is also categorized as a physical component or a mental component.</description>
