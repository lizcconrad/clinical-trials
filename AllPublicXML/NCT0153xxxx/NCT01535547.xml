  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the effect of multiple doses of isavuconazole on the
      pharmacokinetics (PK) of tacrolimus after single dose administration.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Subjects will receive a single dose of tacrolimus on Day 1 followed by a 15 day wash-out
      period (time from tacrolimus dosing to isavuconazole dosing).

      On Days 16 and 17, isavuconazole will be dosed three times daily (TID). TID doses will be
      administered 8 hours apart. On Days 18 through 28 isavuconazole will be administered once
      daily (QD). All subjects will be administered a single dose of tacrolimus on Day 20. A follow
      up visit will occur approximately 7 days after the last dose of isavuconazole. Blood samples
      for pharmacokinetics will be collected throughout the study.
