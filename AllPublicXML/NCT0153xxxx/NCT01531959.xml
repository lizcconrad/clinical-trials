      We hypothesize that midodrine treatment of refractory hypotension in patients otherwise ready
      for discharge from the ICU shortens duration of receiving IV vasopressors and SICU length of
      stay without increasing MGH length of stay or putting the patient at risk of being readmitted
      to an ICU.

    <textblock>
      Persistent hypotension in critically ill patients remains a major barrier to discharging
      patients from the intensive care unit (ICU). In our hospital, in patients with adequate
      tissue perfusion, midodrine has been observed to treat hypotension in order to wean
      continuous intravenous (IV) vasopressors and therefore promote ICU discharge. There are
      several possible etiologies of hypotension in the ICU. The most frequently seen causes
      include septic shock, hypovolemia, adrenal insufficiency, and idiosyncratic reactions from
      medications. For patients whose reversible causes of hypotension have been addressed but
      still require vasopressors, midodrine may prove to be a useful adjunctive medication to
      successfully increase blood pressure. No previous studies have examined the use of midodrine
      for the treatment of hypotension in an ICU setting. Therefore, we are investigating a new
      indication for midodrine as the treatment of hypotension in critically ill patients.
