    <textblock>
      The effect of Tranexamic acid on blood loss, hemoglobin and transfusions in patients with
      pertrochanteric hip fractures.

      Tranexamic acid is a well known drug used in many types of surgery. The investigators wish to
      investigate if the use of tranexamic acid can reduce the peri- and post-operative blood loss
      in patients who undergo surgery with a short intramedullary nail, for a pertrochanteric hip
      fracture.

      An interim analysis was planned when reaching 60 inclusions. The interim analysis was
      conducted only on the primary outcome (TBL). A difference in TBL of no less than 500 ml was
      considered a reason to halt the study. The 0.001 level was chosen as a simple approach to
      this interim analysis from the Haybittle-Peto boundary

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Studies have shown that hip fractures have a hidden blood loss besides the recorded
      perioperative blood loss. Patients who are osteosynthesised with an intramedullary nail have
      been shown to have the largest hidden blood loss.

      Postoperative anaemia is associated with a higher morbidity and mortality. We wish to
      investigate the possibility of reducing this hidden blood loss, with the use of a well known
      drug (tranexamic acid) that is widely used to reduce blood loss in other forms of surgery and
      in multitraumatized patients.
