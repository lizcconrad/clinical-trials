      Objective:

        -  To evaluate the efficacy of preoperative administration of fibrinogen in liver
           transplantation by maintaining a preoperative plasma level equal to 2.9 g / L compared
           with placebo, reflecting a reduction in the number of RBC units transfused during the
           procedure.

        -  To determine the influence of fibrinogen administration on mortality and survival of
           liver graft evaluated one year after the procedure.

        -  To determine the safety of fibrinogen administration recording thrombotic complications
           evaluated during hospitalization or at least 30 days postoperatively.

      Methods: A multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. One hundred
      thirty two patients (132) will randomly be assigned to:

      Treatment group, Fibrinogen administration; doses of fibrinogen: 1 g for an increase in the
      plasmatic value of fibrinogen of 0.29 g / L to obtain a value of 2.9 g / L.

      Placebo group, to whom the same dose volume of saline will be administered.

      Determinations of haematocrit, electrolytes and kidney function tests and coagulation and
      haemostasis and thrombelastography test are made at all stages of the proceeding. A standard
      protocol for intraoperative management will be applied. Blood loss, administration of blood
      products, fluid therapy, presence of reperfusion syndrome, operative complications and
      mortality and survival will be registered. Patients will be followed for one year after
      transplantation.
