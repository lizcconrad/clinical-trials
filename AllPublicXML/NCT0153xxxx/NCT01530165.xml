  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Karachi-based Pakistan Diabetes Prevention Study aims to address key issues in the
      prevention of type 2 diabetes. Approximately 20,000 people From four communities will be
      screened for diabetes risk factors using a non-invasive diabetes risk-score system. Those
      found to be at increased risk will be given an oral glucose tolerance test. People who, after
      the oral glucose tolerance test, are identified as having prediabetes will have the
      opportunity to take part in the Pakistan Diabetes Prevention Study lifestyle intervention.
      This consists of culturally adjusted preventive strategies focusing on diet and physical
      activity in real-life settings. Another important aspect of this trial will be to assess the
      impact of urban planning on the prevalence of obesity and diabetes.

    <measure>The impact of city planning on prevalence of obesity and type 2 diabetes</measure>
    <time_frame>2 years</time_frame>
    <description>The communities will be divided according to number and accessibility of parks. The community with large number of parks will be compared with community with no parks and then change in incidence of diabetes and obesity after 2 years of lifestyle intervention will be assessed and compared between two communities. By this it would be feasible to convince local authorities to incorporate this into their agenda for future urban design.</description>
