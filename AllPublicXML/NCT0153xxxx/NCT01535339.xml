  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI), also known as concussion, occurs commonly in sport.
      Despite ongoing research, there is no highly sensitive clinical test for cognitive function.
      This makes the clinical diagnosis of concussion particularly difficult as the clinical
      presentation of concussion is highly variable with symptoms often evolving over time. Given
      the variability in concussion presentations, there is no single test that can diagnose a
      concussion. Current recommendations are that sports medicine providers apply a multifaceted
      concussion assessment battery that combines subjective symptoms, motor control and cognitive
      assessment.

      This investigation is designed to evaluate the clinical utility of ElMindA's BNA scores in
      detecting and managing concussive injuries. This study will establish the reliability of BNA™
      scores over clinically relevant assessment intervals and investigate the effect of SRC and
      sub-concussive head impacts on BNA scores.
