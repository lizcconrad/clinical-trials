  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sepsis remains a common entity in critical care patients with remarkable mortality. Pulmonary
      and abdominal infections (with subsequent sepsis) are the most common in the ICU. Despite
      extended research activities, no differences in patient outcome or organ dysfunction were
      revealed.

      Sepsis is a complex immune reaction phenomenon based on unbalanced activation and
      suppression. In addition to changes of cytokine levels and immune cell activity, underlying
      genetic reactions are present. For instance, expression of miRNA (as a potential important
      step of immune cell activation) is likely changed during systemic and local immune reactions.

      The aim of this study is to perform a detailed assay of immune cell activation, to
      investigate the levels of pro- and antiinflammatory cytokines and the various expression of
      miRNA depending on the origin of infection in the two most common sides. This means in ICU
      patients with early pulmonary or abdominal sepsis as well as in healthy controls.
      Additionally, clinical parameters of organ function, current infection markers as CRP and
      procalcitonin, cardiovascular function and heart rate variability will be assessed.
      Parameters of local tissue perfusion in a dynamic testing during forearm ischemia and plasma
      adenosine concentration will be measured.
