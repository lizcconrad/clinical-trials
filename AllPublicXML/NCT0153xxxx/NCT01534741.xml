    <textblock>
      Study design: Open, randomized, cross-over, monocentric, controlled, prospective Applied
      Medical Devices: FX CorDiax 60 (high-flux), FX 60 (high-flux) Patients: 30 adult chronic
      hemodialysis patients Treatment: Each patient will be treated by post-dilution online
      hemodiafiltration once with each dialyzer type.

      Study objectives: Intraindividual comparison of removal rate of urea, phosphate,
      ß2-microglobulin (ß2-m), myoglobin, prolactin, alpha1-microglobulin and
      alpha1-acidglycoprotein and of the albumin loss with different dialyzer membranes during
      post-dilution online hemodiafiltration.

      Primary variable: Removal rate of myoglobin Secondary variable: Removal rate of urea,
      phosphate, ß2-microglobulin (ß2-m), prolactin, alpha1-microglobulin and
      alpha1-acidglycoprotein Safety variable: Hematocrit, albumin loss Sample Size: 30 subjects
