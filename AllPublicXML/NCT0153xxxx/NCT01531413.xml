  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Oxygen has inherent bactericidal properties. The investigators are testing to see if they can
      reduce the incidence of postoperative abscesses following laparoscopic appendectomy by
      insufflating with oxygen at the end of the case.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Intra-abdominal abscess a well-known complication of both open and laparoscopic appendectomy,
      especially in the setting of perforated and gangrenous appendicitis. The reviewed literature
      cites an incidence of about 10%. Besides peri-operative antibiotic administration there have
      been few developments to reduce this inherent risk. Oxygen rich environments are potently
      bactericidal, and thus it is our hypothesis that establishing an oxygen rich ambience within
      the abdomen at the conclusion of laparoscopy could curtail bacterial growth and subsequent
      abscess formation.

      In the experimental arm, at the conclusion of all surgical dissection and manipulation, the
      carbon dioxide insufflate will be exchanged with oxygen to generate a high intra-abdominal
      concentration. Oxygen will be infused for 15 seconds as CO2 is allowed to escape through the
      open trocars. In the control arm Co2 will be allowed to escape through the open trocar ports
      without any oxygen flush. Patients will receive a standardized operation as well as standard
      post-operative care and follow up.
