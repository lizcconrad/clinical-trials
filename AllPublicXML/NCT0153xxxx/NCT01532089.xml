  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This randomized phase II trial studies how well erlotinib hydrochloride (Tarceva) with or
      without bevacizumab (Avastin) works in treating patients with stage IV non-small cell lung
      cancer (NSCLC) with epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutations. Erlotinib
      hydrochloride may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for
      cell growth. Monoclonal antibodies, such as bevacizumab, may block tumor growth in different
      ways by targeting certain cells. Bevacizumab may also stop the growth of NSCLC by blocking
      the growth of new blood vessels necessary for tumor growth. It is not yet known whether
      erlotinib hydrochloride is more effective when given alone or with bevacizumab in treating
      patients with NSCLC.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the progression-free survival of erlotinib (erlotinib hydrochloride) and
      bevacizumab versus that of erlotinib alone for the purpose of deciding if the combination arm
      is worth pursuing in a phase III trial.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To investigate the overall survival of erlotinib and bevacizumab versus erlotinib alone.

      II. To investigate the response rate of erlotinib and bevacizumab versus erlotinib alone.

      III. To investigate the progression-free survival in patients with exon deletion 19 or exon
      21 L858R point mutations.

      IV. To investigate the toxicity of erlotinib and bevacizumab versus erlotinib alone using
      Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4.0.

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To correlate EGFR mutations detected in plasma deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) with those
      detected in tumor DNA.

      II. To estimate the prevalence of EGFR T790M resistance mutations from pretreatment tumor
      biopsies using more sensitive mutation detection methods.

      III. To investigate progression free survival of EGFR mutant NSCLC patients with and without
      concurrent EGFR T790M detected from pre-treatment tumor specimen using allele specific
      quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR).

      IV. To prospectively evaluate the predictive value of plasma VEGF-A levels on progression
      free survival in patients treated with erlotinib alone or in combination with bevacizumab.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

      ARM A: Patients receive erlotinib hydrochloride orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-21.

      ARM B: Patients receive erlotinib hydrochloride as in Arm A and bevacizumab intravenously
      (IV) over 30-90 minutes on day 1.

      In both arms, courses repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3-6 months for 6 years.
