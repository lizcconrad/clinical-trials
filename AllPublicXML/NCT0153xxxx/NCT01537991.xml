  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The I-START trial is designed to determine the highest doses of radiotherapy that can safely
      be used in locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Patients with NSCLC who are
      expected to live longer than three months and are fit to receive radical radiotherapy
      (radiotherapy given with curative intent) will be eligible to participate. All trial
      participants will receive 20 doses (called fractions) of radiotherapy. Evidence is available
      that suggests increasing the dose of radiotherapy given per fraction may improve both local
      control of the cancer and survival in some patients. However, high dose radiotherapy can
      damage normal tissues as well as the tumour. The dose of radiotherapy that can be used to
      treat lung cancer is limited by the normal tissues close to the cancer. For most of these
      normal tissues (lung, spinal cord and heart) the maximum safe radiotherapy dose that can be
      given is known. The maximum safe dose of radiotherapy for the oesophagus (gullet) is not
      currently known.

      The trial will be split into two parts:

        1. For those participants where the oesophagus will receive a high dose of radiation due to
           it lying close to the cancer, the first part of the trial will establish the maximum
           safe dose of radiotherapy to the oesophagus. The first group of participants will
           receive a slightly higher dose than is currently used to treat lung cancer. If these
           participants do not have any significant side effects, a second group of participants
           will receive a slightly higher dose than the first group. This process will continue
           incrementally until side effects from the treatment become evident, thus demonstrating
           the maximum dose that can safely be given. Once the maximum safe dose to the oesophagus
           is known this will be classed as the recommended Phase II dose and all further patients
           entering the trial will receive no more than this dose to the oesophagus.

        2. For those participants where the cancer is a safe distance from their oesophagus, the
           highest dose of radiotherapy that does not exceed the known safe dose limits of the
           normal structures (lung, spinal cord and heart) will be used.

      The findings of both parts of this study will determine whether increasing the dose of
      radiotherapy for NSCLC patients is a tolerable, safe and effective treatment. If the results
      are positive then this new treatment may be compared against the best currently available
      standard treatments in a future larger randomised (Phase III) trial.
