  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The use of Event Related Potentials (ERP) and neurocognitive performance in patients
      following concussion has been examined previously in small cohorts and relatively long after
      concussion occurred. However, little is known about the immediate changes in brain activity
      in specific brain regions and connectivity across them associated with performance on
      specific neurocognitive tests following a concussion, and the subsequent changes over time.
      The proposed study will provide initial evidence for the feasibility of an ERP based
      biomarker for concussion reflecting temporal and spatial changes in brain activity as well as
      brain functional connectivity associated with concussion.

        Experimental subjects will include males and females with a recent sports-related
        concussion (less than 10 days post-concussion) recruited from approximately 50 high schools
        and colleges with UPMC-affiliated certified athletic trainers (ATC) on staff and from
        patients at the UPMC Sports Medicine Concussion Program.
