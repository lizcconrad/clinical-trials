  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      With current chemotherapy protocols, in 60-80% of patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML)
      the leukemic blasts in the bone marrow can be reduced to &lt; 5%. This is called &quot;complete
      remission (CR)&quot; and is the prerequisite for cure of the disease. During the last years,
      several genetic and biologic risk factors for the achievement of CR have been defined, and
      the remission rates vary considerably between patient groups with different risk profiles. On
      one hand, patients with certain chromosomal or molecular aberrations have very high CR rates
      of approximately 90%. Moreover, in some of these patients, molecularly targeted therapies for
      specific genetic aberrations are currently evaluated in clinical trials. However, these
      genetic aberrations account for only 50-60% of the overall patient population in AML. The
      remaining patients have a significantly inferior CR rate of only 50-60% with 30% resistant
      disease after two cycles of standard induction chemotherapy. In conclusion, there is need for
      improved induction regimens in a large number of adult patients with AML. An improved CR rate
      in this patient population will increase the number of patients eligible for intensive
      consolidation such as an allogeneic stem cell transplantation and might thereby be the basis
      for a better overall outcome. However, there is no clear evidence that this goal can be
      achieved with the currently available chemotherapy protocols. Clofarabine
      (2-chloro-2-fluoro-deoxy-9-D-arabinofuranosyladenine) is a nucleoside analogon which combines
      properties of fludarabine and cladribine. Due to the lack of neurological side effects,
      clofarabine could be explored in higher doses than other nucleoside analogues and has shown
      considerable antileukemic activity in patients with relapsed or refractory acute leukemias
      and elderly AML patients alone or in combination with cytarabine. In addition, the
      combination of clofarabine, cytarabine and idarubicin has produced promising results with
      acceptable toxicity in patients with relapsed or refractory AML. Based on these initial
      studies, there is need for a further optimization of the clofarabine dose in this
      combination. The aim of the AMLSG 17-10 study is therefore to evaluate the tolerability and
      safety of increasing doses of clofarabine in combination with idarubicin/cytarabine in
      patients with high risk AML defined by the genetic and molecular risk profile.
