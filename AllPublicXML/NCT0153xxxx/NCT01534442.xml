  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to investigate the role of transmission of vagal cholinerg for the
      GLP-1 potentiation of the glucose stimulated insulin secretion and the cephalic insulin
      response by using atropin administration.

      The hypothesis is that a great deal of the effects of GLP-1 is mediated via the nervous
      system and for this reason the investigators will research individuals with an intact nervous
      supply with and without atropin administration.

    <textblock>
      GLP-1 is a importent enterogastron and incretin hormone. Rapid degradation of GLP-1 by
      dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP-4) suggests that GLP-1 may act locally (through vagal afferents)
      before being degraded. We aimed to clarify the role of vagal innervation on the incretin
      effect.
