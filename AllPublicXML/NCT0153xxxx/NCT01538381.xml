  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The general objectives are to evaluate the pre-operative activity and the safety of afatinib
      in head and neck cancer and to explore the different downstream molecular pathways to
      identify tumor response and resistance mechanisms. The results from this study can be used to
      conduct a larger trial that would allow us to confirm or validate the hypotheses generated.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, multicenter early phase II trial exploring the pre-operative activity
      of afatinib vs. nontreatment. The study includes an early monitoring of the surgical
      co-morbidities for patients treated with afatinib and accrual may be stopped prematurely
      according to a pre-defined safety stopping rule.

      Patients will be randomized with a 5:1 ratio, between the two arms: afatinib and 'no
      treatment'. It is intended to include a total of 30 eligible patients out of which 25
      patients will be randomized into the afatinib arm.

      Patients allocated to the 'no treatment' arm will mainly serve as a reference to interpret
      the results of the translational research part of the study although no formal comparison
      between the afatinib arm and the 'no treatment' arm is intended.

      Patients will be first registered into the EORTC system after signing the informed consent
      form. The site will have to complete all the study related procedures within 4 weeks prior
      randomization and all eligibility criteria should be met before the patient can be randomized
      into the study.

      The registration of patients will proceed with slots for patients which will be opened or
      closed based on the randomization of patients into the afatinib arm. Starting with 3 free
      slots, an additional slot will become available for each patient randomized to the 'no
      treatment' arm.

      Registration will be paused after three completes the 4 week observation period after
      surgery. Similar action will be done after the next 3 patients have been entered into the
      afatinib arm.

      Once the first 6 patients in the afatinib arm have been observed for surgical toxicities of
      grade ≥ 3 for 4 weeks following surgery, the slot system will cease to operate.

          -  Women of childbearing potential (WOCBP) must be using an adequate method of
             contraception to avoid pregnancy throughout the study and 6 months beyond stop of
             treatment in such a manner that the risk of pregnancy is minimized. In general, the
             decision for appropriate methods to prevent pregnancy should be determined by
             discussions between the investigator and the study subject. WOCBP include any female
             who has experienced menarche and who has not undergone successful surgical
             sterilization (hysterectomy, bilateral tubal ligation, or bilateral oophorectomy) or

               -  Post menopause is defined as: amenorrhea ≥ 12 consecutive months without another
                  cause or for women with irregular menstrual periods and on hormone replacement
                  therapy (HRT), a documented serum follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) level &gt; 35

                  products such as an intrauterine device or barrier methods (diaphragm, condoms,
                  spermicide) to prevent pregnancy, or are practicing abstinence or where their
                  partner is sterile (e.g., vasectomy) should be considered to be of childbearing
                  potential.

               -  Women of child bearing potential must have a negative serum or urine pregnancy
                  test (minimum sensitivity 25 IU/L or equivalent units of HCG) within 72 hours
                  prior to the start of investigational product.

               -  Female patients within one year of entering the menopause must agree to use an
                  effective non-hormonal method of contraception during the treatment period and

             potentially hampering compliance with the study protocol and follow-up schedule; those

          -  Before patient registration, written informed consent must be given according to
             ICH/GCP, and national/local regulations

        Exclusion Criteria:
