    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare two different therapies for actinic keratoses in
      organ transplant recipients with regard to efficacy and tolerability. The investiagtors are
      planning to examine treatment with Imiquimod 5% cream versus treatment with
      Methyl-aminolaevulinate 16% cream and subsequent irradiation with red light, so-called
      photodynamic therapy, in this patients' group. A secondary objective of our study is to
      investigate the reduction in the field cancerisation after both treatments using fluorescence
      diagnostic method and digital imaging.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Organ transplant patients (OTP) require lifelong immunosuppressive therapy and consequently
      are prone to develop skin tumors, i.e skin cancer is the most frequent malignancy in organ
      transplant recipients. OTP frequently develop extensive areas of actinic damage, epidermal
      dysplasia, wich accounts for increased risk of aggressive skin cancer development in
      susceptible patients, and are referred to as &quot;field cancerisation&quot;. Therefore the whole area
      of field cancerisation has to be treated. In our study we will treat this areas with two
      different methods and not only the single visible lesions of actinic keratoses.In this open
      prospective randomized intraindividual study one half of the patients' scalp or face will be
      treated with Imiquimod 5% cream for 4 weeks, 3 times a week, and the other half with
      Methyl-aminolaevulinate 16% cream photodynamic therapy, two applications in two weeks
      interval. The pre- and post treatment extension of field cancerisation will be assessed by
      means of a highly sensitive digital fluorescence imaging system.

    <description>Methyl-aminolaevulinate 16% cream (Metvix 160mg/g cream) will be applied 1 mm thick on the treated area, which has a maximal diameter of 8 cm2, and will be covered with a semipermeable dressing (Suprasorb F, Lohmann &amp; Rauscher, Vienna, Austria)for 3 hours. Afterwards the cream leftovers will be removed by 0.9% NaCl solution. Following the treated area will be irradiated with heat-free visible red light at a peak wavelength of 630 nm with a single dose of 37 J/cm2 (Actilite model: CL128, PhotoCure, Norway). This treatment will be repeated in two weeks.</description>
