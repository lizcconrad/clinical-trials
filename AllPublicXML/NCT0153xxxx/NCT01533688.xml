  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Poor bowel preparation and patient intolerance of the procedure are the most important
      factors contributing to the limitation of colonoscopy. Inadequate bowel cleansing results in
      incomplete testing, increased potential to miss lesions, increased cost, and decreased
      patient satisfaction. The investigators hope to gain better insight into which bowel
      preparation works best in diabetic patients and hence would increase patient satisfaction,
      tolerability of the bowel preparation and decrease overall costs. The investigators will
      investigate which bowel preparation for colonoscopy will work optimally in diabetic patients
      using three different regimens.
