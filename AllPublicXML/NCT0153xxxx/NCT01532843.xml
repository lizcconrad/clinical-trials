  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Treatment with a nucleoside analogue and subsequent viral decline has shown to partially
      restore immune hyporesponsiveness in chronic hepatitis B patients. Recent pilot studies
      investigating whether the effect of lowering viral load with nucleoside analogue therapy
      prior to the initiation of peginterferon results in higher sustained off-treatment responses
      showed contradictory findings.

      The aim of this study is to investigate sustained off-treatment response to peginterferon
      alfa-2b in chronic HBeAg-positive hepatitis B patients who are pretreated with nucleos(t)ide
      analogues, thereby lowering viral load
