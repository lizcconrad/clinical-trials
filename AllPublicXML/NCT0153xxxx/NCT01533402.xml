    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate whether a 10 week Internet-delivered CBT is a
      feasible approach to treat children (age 8-12 years) with anxiety disorder (social phobia,
      panic disorder, specific phobia, generalized anxiety disorder or separation anxiety
      disorder). The program is directed toward both the parents and children. The patients work
      with the treatment is supported through on-line contact with a therapist. Approximately 128
      patients will be included in the study and randomized to either condition. All included
      patients are assessed before the treatment starts and after 10 weeks (post treatment).
      Follow-up assessments are conducted at 3 and 12 months after treatment.
