  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Obesity is a worldwide health problematic whose incidence is increasing especially in
      developed countries. The surgical management of this illness consists in different techniques
      such as Laparoscopic Sleeve Gastrectomy but this treatment could not be efficient enough. The
      causes of failure after Laparoscopic Sleeve Gastrectomy are not known but could include the
      residual gastric volume.

      The aim of the present study was to determine whether the residual gastric volume is involved
      in Laparoscopic Sleeve Gastrectomy's failure.

      This study can be done in three steps:

        1. From a prospective database, patients are selected if they were operated by Laparoscopic
           Sleeve gastrectomy at least two years before.

        2. these patients are convoked by their surgeon, who proposed them to participate at this
           study. During this consultation, the BAROS score is calculated by the surgeon and
           reported in the case report form of the patient.

        3. After checking the possible contraindication, a gastric computed tomography volumetry is
           done and the residual gastric volume is calculated by two independent radiologists.

    <description>the residual gastric volume is measured by gastric computed-tomography volumetry two years after Laparoscopic Sleeve Gastrectomy and is defined as the volume held between the gastro-oesophageal junction and the pylorus. Two radiologists interpreted the volumetry and conflicts between the 2 observers are resolved by consensus: the larger of each patient's two volume determinations was considered as being closest to the true residual gastric volume</description>

    <description>the operative technique consists in few steps:
position of 4 trocars and insertion of a nasogastric tube
dissection and mobilization of the greater curvature of the stomach
preparation of the stomach for division
gastric partition
extraction of the gastric remnant
postoperative surveillance</description>
