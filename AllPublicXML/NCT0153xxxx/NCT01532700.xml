  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase 2, open-label, single institution trial of combination of intravenous (IV)
      ofatumumab and oral GSK2110183 in patients with relapsed or refractory Chronic Lymphocytic
      Leukemia (CLL). Patients must have received at least one prior line of therapy containing
      fludarabine (single-agent or combination therapy). During the initial 6 months Treatment
      Phase, ofatumumab will be administered weekly for 8 doses, then once every 4 week cycle for
      an additional 4 doses (dose and schedule identical to the pivotal phase 2 trial) and
      GSK2110183 will be given daily PO (Treatment Phase). There will be an initial 10 day lead-in
      with GSK2110183 alone prior to initiation of ofatumumab to allow for evaluation of changes in
      cell surface expression due to GSK2110183 and for GSK2110183 pharmacokinetic studies (Lead-in
      Phase). The official Cycle 1 Day 1 will start on the date of first dose of ofatumumab. Cycle
      duration = 4 weeks. Patients will be assessed for safety, disease assessment, response, and
      survival on day 1 of each cycle during the Treatment Phase. A formal review of safety data by
      the Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) after the first 6 patients have completed cycle 1 of
      the Treatment Phase will be performed before continuing accrual. All patients achieving SD,
      PR or CR by the end of the Treatment Phase will proceed to the Maintenance Phase. Patients
      with PD at any time, including by the end of Treatment Phase, will be taken off study. During
      the Maintenance Phase, single-agent GSK2110183 will be administered daily for a maximum of 12
      months (12 cycles). Maximum duration on any study drug is 18 months (18 cycles). During the
      Follow-up Phase, patients will be assessed for safety, disease assessment, response, and
      survival every 3 months through month 36 (year 3), or until subsequent CLL therapy or death,
      whichever comes first. Key indications for study withdrawal are progressive disease,
      intolerable toxicity, or completion of therapy

                  therapy. Adequate contraception is defined as intrauterine device, double barrier
                  method or total abstinence. Oral contraceptives are not adequate due to potential
