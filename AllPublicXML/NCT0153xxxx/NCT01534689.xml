    <textblock>
      An infection of toenail fungus, or onychomycosis, occurs when fungi infect one or more nails.
      As the nail fungus spreads deeper into the nail, it may cause nail discoloration, thickening
      and the development of crumbling edges, all of which can lead to an unsightly and potentially
      painful problem. Onychomycosis is difficult to treat, and infections recur easily. Toenail
      fungus affects approximately 23 million people in the US - about 10% of all adults. Currently
      available treatments for toenail fungus are lacking. Even the most effective oral medications
      are successful only about half of the time. Topical medications are successful less than 10%
      of the time. Recently, research has found laser therapy to show promise as a novel
      alternative treatment for toenail onychomycosis. Unlike medication-driven treatments for
      toenail fungus which can have many side effects including serious ones such as liver
      toxicity, laser therapy presents minimal risk of side effects. Laser therapy is applied to
      toenail onychomycosis by shining a laser light through the toenail. The laser light vaporizes
      the fungus while leaving the skin and surrounding tissue unharmed.

    <measure>Proportion of Toenails Attaining 25 Percent (%) or More Increase in Clear Nail</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Millimeter (mm) of clear nail from the base of the lunula was measured from digital photographs of the toenail using a computer program. Change in mm of clear nail bed was calculated as the difference in mm of clear nail bed from baseline measurement to the measurement at 3 months post-procedure administration. The percent (%) of increase in clear nail from baseline was calculated from there. An increase in mm or percent of clear nail between the two measurement points indicates the toenail onychomycosis has improved and is positive for study success. A decrease in mm or percent of clear nail between the two measurement points indicates the toenail onychomycosis has worsened and is negative for study success.
Individual toenail success criteria was defined as 25 percent (%) or more increase in clear nail growth at 3 months post-procedure relative to baseline. Overall study success criteria was defined as 60% or more of treated toenails meeting the individual success criteria.</description>

        <title>Proportion of Toenails Attaining 25 Percent (%) or More Increase in Clear Nail</title>
        <description>Millimeter (mm) of clear nail from the base of the lunula was measured from digital photographs of the toenail using a computer program. Change in mm of clear nail bed was calculated as the difference in mm of clear nail bed from baseline measurement to the measurement at 3 months post-procedure administration. The percent (%) of increase in clear nail from baseline was calculated from there. An increase in mm or percent of clear nail between the two measurement points indicates the toenail onychomycosis has improved and is positive for study success. A decrease in mm or percent of clear nail between the two measurement points indicates the toenail onychomycosis has worsened and is negative for study success.
Individual toenail success criteria was defined as 25 percent (%) or more increase in clear nail growth at 3 months post-procedure relative to baseline. Overall study success criteria was defined as 60% or more of treated toenails meeting the individual success criteria.</description>

The the power reaching the surface of the skin is 1 mW. The Erchonia FX-405™ Laser is activated such that the laser light is directed at the great toenail at a distance of approximately 6 inches above the toenail. The dual wavelengths of 405 nm and 635 nm are activated simultaneously for 10 minutes of total treatment administration time.</description>
