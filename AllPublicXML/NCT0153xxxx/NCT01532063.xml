    <textblock>
      Difficult intubation is challenging in intensive care units. There are limited data regarding
      risk factors of difficult intubation in ICU. The primary purpose of the investigators study
      is to assess the risk factors of difficult airway in adults in ICU.

      PURPOSE: Intubation in ICU strongly differs from intubation in operative rooms. The results
      of studies about risk factors of difficult intubation performed in operative rooms cannot
      therefore be extrapolated directly to ICU.

      The primary purpose of this trial (cf Part &quot;Design&quot; of this registration) is &quot;other&quot; and more
      particularly &quot;Prognosis&quot; because it is is an assessment of risk factors of difficult airway
      in intensive care units.

      DESIGN AND METHODOLOGY: This is an open prospective multicentric study of intubation in ICU
      in more than 50 centres. Consecutive intubations will be included in each centre, in order to
      reach the sample size required (at least 1000 procedures intubations). The usual risk factors
      of difficult intubation in operative rooms, the demographic parameters and the complications
      of intubation will be assessed, as well as survival status at 28 days.
