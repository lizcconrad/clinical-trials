  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Based on the pre-clinical data the investigators hypothesize that G-CSF treatment in patients
      with multiple myeloma will generate a 'hostile' bone marrow microenvironment for myeloma
      cells, depriving them of key support signals and rendering them more sensitive to
      chemotherapy. The investigators therefore propose to do an initial pilot study 1) to explore
      the safety of the combination of G-CSF and bortezomib-, carfilzomib-, or IMID-based treatment
      regimens in patients with bortezomib-, carfilzomib-, or IMID-refractory myeloma and 2) to
      generate correlative data for a subsequent larger study looking at the combination.

Bortezomib will be given at the patient's current dose on Days 1, 4, 8, and 11 OR Carfilzomib will be given at the patient's current dose on Days 1, 2, 8, 9, 15, and 16 OR IMID will be given at the patient's current dose once daily on Days 1-21. Patients receiving an IMID (thalidomide, lenalidomide, or pomalidomide) as part of a bortezomib or carfilzomb regimen should continue the same scheduled as the current regimen.
Dexamethasone should be continued at the same dose and schedule as the patient's current regimen.
PO cyclophosphamide should be continued at the same dose and schedule as the patient's current regimen.</description>
