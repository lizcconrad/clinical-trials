             any uncontrolled serious chronic or progressive disease;

          -  Cervical cytology at screening that requires cryotherapy, biopsy or treatment (other
             than for infection). Women with Grade 1 cervical cytology findings can be enrolled
             upon completion of the initial phase of evaluation if no current treatment is
             indicated (based on local standard of care for management of abnormal cervical
             cytology);

          -  Any condition(s) that, in the opinion of the investigator, might put the participant
