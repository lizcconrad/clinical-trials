      Phase II study of neoadjuvant treatment with Gemcitabine, Tarceva and Oxaliplatin followed by
      chemotherapy with Tarceva and Gemcitabine in patients with pancreatic adenocarcinoma with
      borderline resectability. The primary objective is to determine the resectability rate of
      patients with pancreas adenocarcinoma with borderline resectability determined
      radiologically, treated with Gemcitabine, Tarceva and Oxaliplatin followed by radiotherapy
      with Gemcitabine and Tarceva.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with borderline resectable pancreatic adenocarcinoma are more likely to develop
      perioperative complications due to the complexity of surgery. In these patients there is also
      an increased risk of systemic relapse due to the advanced stage of the tumor as well as a
      higher possibility of having positive margins. Therefore, the treatment of these patients
      need to be decided based on a multidisciplinary strategy. Besides of that the use of systemic
      neoadjuvant chemotherapy as induction therapy, followed by sequential chemoradiotherapy is a
      very attractive therapeutic modality.

      The neoadjuvant treatment offers the potential advantages of reducing the tumor stage,
      increasing resectability and decreasing postoperative complications.

      The administration of chemotherapy and radiotherapy before surgery represent an strategy for
      early treatment of micrometastatic disease, present in most of these patients, and to
      identify patients with rapid progression of the disease.

      For all the reasons above, the investigators consider it's of great interest to design new
      studies that combine systemic neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by chemoradiotherapy with
      neoadjuvant intention in patients with pancreas cancer locally advanced.
