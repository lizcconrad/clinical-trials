  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic Allograft Nephropathy (CAN)/Interstitial fibrosis and Tubular Atrophy (IFTA) is
      responsible for most kidney transplant failures. CAN/IFTA on a 3 month kidney biopsy strongly
      predicts graft survival long term. CAN/IFTA remains a vexing problem for clinicians because
      current monitoring tools, namely the serum creatinine concentration, are not sensitive to
      early changes in glomerular filtration rate (GFR) or to histologic damage.

      Despite advances in prevention of acute rejection (AR), it is still a significant and
      potentially devastating complication of solid organ transplantation. One strategy to reduce
      the risk of rejection is to perform kidney biopsies to detect subclinical acute rejection
      (SCAR) and treat to prevent progression to rejection. There is evidence that treating SCAR
      can prevent further immune mediated injury to the kidney, a precursor to CAN/IFTA.

      Kidney biopsies provide better information but are limited due to safety concerns, patient
      preference and cost issues. Better, early and less invasive markers of CAN/IFTA will allow
      early intervention as well as improved graft and better patient outcomes.

      This study seeks to validate specific proteogenomic biomarker panels for AR and CAN/IFTA in a
      prospective blood, urine and kidney tissue monitoring study of kidney transplant recipients
      who will be scheduled for standard of care biopsies.

      This is a single-center sample study. A total number of 250 subjects will be consented and
      enrolled at Northwestern University Transplant clinic at the time of kidney biopsy. At our
      clinic, protocol biopsy may be performed at 3 months, 12 months , 24 months or any other time
      the doctor feels necessary post transplant in all kidney recipients. Kidney transplant
      recipients may also go under &quot;for cause&quot; biopsy procedure at any time point before/after or
      in between these protocol biopsy time points. Such causes of biopsy include increase in serum
      creatinine level, decrease in urine output, and/or pain at graft site.

      Full blood tube set, urine sample for proteomics and flow cytometry of urinary sediment, and
      an extra core kidney biopsy tissue for gene expression profiling will be collected from
      subjects at the time of any biopsies obtained during the study course. These specimen samples
      will be sent to Rules-Based Medicine (RBM) for proteomic analysis. Whole genome expression
      profiling will be done using Affymetrix GeneChips at The Scripps Research Institute.

      We estimate that we will find at least 50 subjects with diagnostic CAN/IFTA histology (Banff
      1-2) between the 3 months and 12 months post transplant protocol biopsies based on a 50%
      incidence in the literature and our own experience. We also estimate that there will be 10%
      (10 subjects) incidence of clinical rejection by the end of 12 months identified initially by
      an acute rise in the serum creatinine and confirmed by a biopsy. Lastly, we estimate a 10%
      (10 subjects) incidence of subclinical acute rejection with stable renal function detected by
      the protocol kidney biopsies.

    <description>The intention of our biomarker panel is to be broadly applicable to all patients with a kidney transplant with the assumption that there are common underlying molecular mechanisms of AR and CAN/IFTA that can be detected hopefully at early stages of disease. We therefore want to validate and test our biomarker panel in a broad collection of patient types. We chose not to include patients with dual organ transplants so that we could isolate the molecular signal we are studying.</description>

      Urine Collection: Approximately one cup of urine (200 mL) will be taken for research tests on
      the day of a routine care biopsy, if possible.

      Blood Draws: About 1.5 tablespoons of blood (20.5 mL) will be taken for research tests before
      the biopsy.

      Kidney Biopsy: A kidney biopsy is a procedure to remove and examine a small piece of kidney
      tissue. For this study, one biopsy will be taken from the new kidney and used specifically
      for research. The biopsy will be done at the same time as the biopsies done for routine care.
      If there are any complications during the routine care biopsies, the tissue for this research
      study will not be taken.
