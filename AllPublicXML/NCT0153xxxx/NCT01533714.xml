      Eligible subjects will enter the study after completing the Week 12 Visit of RA0083
      [NCT01463059] and will be allowed to continue in this open-label study until approval of the
      marketing application for the indication of Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) in the subject's
      country or region, or until further notice from UCB. All subjects will receive subcutaneous
      (sc) injections of CDP6038 120 mg every 2 weeks (q2w) throughout the study, regardless of
      their treatment assignment in RA0083 [NCT01463059].
