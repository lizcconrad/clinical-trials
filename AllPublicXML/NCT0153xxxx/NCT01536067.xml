  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well giving ofatumumab together with bortezomib works in
      treating patients with previously untreated Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia. Monoclonal
      antibodies, such as ofatumumab and bortezomib, can block cancer growth in different ways.
      Some block the ability of cancer cells to grow and spread. Others find cancer cells and help
      kill them or carry cancer-killing substances to them. Giving ofatumumab together with
      bortezomib may be a better way to block cancer growth

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine overall response rate (complete response [CR] + partial response [PR] + minor
      response [MR]) of ofatumumab in combination with bortezomib.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine complete remission (CR) rate, near (n)CR rate, very good partial response (VGPR)
      rate and PR rate per new criteria.

      II. Determine 5 year progression free survival (PFS). III. Determine time to progression and
      duration of response of ofatumumab in conjunction with bortezomib.

      IV. Determine safety of ofatumumab in combination with bortezomib. V. Conduct laboratory
      correlates.

      OUTLINE:

      INDUCTION PHASE: Patients receive ofatumumab intravenously (IV) on days 1, 8, and 15 and
      bortezomib subcutaneously (SC) on days 8 and 15. Beginning on course 2, patients receive
      ofatumumab IV on days 1 and 15 and bortezomib SC on days 1, 8, and 15. Treatment repeats
      every 28 days for up to 4 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity.

      MAINTENANCE PHASE: Beginning 8 weeks after course 4 of induction phase, patients receive
      ofatumumab IV on day 1 and bortezomib SC on days 1, 8, and 15. Treatment repeats every 28
      days for up to 8 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days, and then every 3
      months for 5 years.

               -  Systemic manifestations of Waldenstrom Macroglobulinemia (WM), such as
                  hyperviscosity symptoms (patients with symptoms of hyperviscosity syndrome must
                  be treated with plasmapheresis to control the syndrome prior to enrollment),
                  neuropathy, amyloidosis, cryoglobulinemia, B-symptoms, or recurrent bleeding

          -  Must have a measurable disease as defined by the monoclonal IgM level of 1 g/dL on
             serum protein electrophoresis (SPEP); if the level of IgM on SPEP is less than 1 g/dL
             in patients who meet any criteria in inclusion criteria 2, then the IgM level obtained
             from nephelometric measurement may be used to justify this criterion

          -  Have an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Performance Status of =&lt; 2

          -  Have a life expectancy of &gt;= 3 months

          -  Absolute neutrophil count &gt;= 1.0 x 10^9/L unless the result of disease infiltration of
             bone marrow

             must agree to use acceptable contraceptive methods (e.g. double barrier) during
             treatment

          -  Male subjects, even if surgically sterilized (i.e., status post vasectomy) must agree
             to one of the following:

               -  Practice effective barrier contraception during the entire study treatment period
                  and through a minimum of 30 days after the last dose of study drug

               -  Completely abstain from heterosexual intercourse

          -  Patient or legal representative must understand the investigational nature of this
             study and sign an Independent Ethics Committee/Institutional Review Board approved
             written informed consent prior to receiving any study related procedure

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Pregnant and nursing female patients

          -  Prior anti-neoplastic therapy for WM; the use of plasmapheresis to manage the symptoms
             of hyperviscosity and other IgM paraprotein mediated symptoms is allowed and does not
             disqualify a patient from the study; if a patient undergoes plasmapheresis within 8
             weeks of starting the study treatment then the IgM level prior to plasmapheresis
             should be used for response assessment; neoplastic use of glucocorticoids is
             prohibited during the screening and treatment period; patients with active
             hyperviscosity symptoms should not be enrolled in this study unless the symptoms
             resolve after plasmapheresis

          -  Unwilling or unable to follow protocol requirements

          -  Any condition which in the Investigator's opinion deems the patient an unsuitable
             candidate to receive study drug

          -  Received an investigational agent within 30 days prior to enrollment

          -  Known human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) positive

          -  Positive serology for hepatitis B (HB) defined as a positive test for hepatitis B
             surface antigen (HBsAg); in addition, if HBsAg is negative and hepatitis B core
             antibody (HBcAb) is positive, regardless of hepatitis B surface antibody (HBsAb)
             status, a HB deoxyribonucleic acid test will be performed and if HB DNA is positive
             the patient will be excluded; if a patient is HBsAg negative, HBcAb positive, and
             HBsAb positive, indicating past but not active infection, the patient will be included
             on the study

          -  Positive serology for hepatitis C (HC) defined as a positive test for Hep C by enzyme
             immunoassays (EIA), in which case reflexively perform a HC recombinant immunoblot
             assay (RIBA) on the same sample to confirm the result

          -  Diagnosis of a malignant disorder other than WM within 3 years of the study enrollment
             with the exception of completely resected non-melanoma skin cancer and successfully
             treated in-situ cancer

          -  Uncontrolled infection

          -  Hypersensitivity to bortezomib, boron, or mannitol

          -  Grade 2 or greater peripheral neuropathy; since WM is known to cause peripheral
             neuropathy (PN), if, in investigator's judgement, a patient has Grade 2 PN related to
             WM, then he/she can be enrolled onto the study; under no circumstances patient with
             greater than Grade 2 PN can be enrolled

          -  Myocardial infarction within 6 months of enrollment; New York Heart Association (NYHA)
             Class III or more heart failure, uncontrolled angina, severe uncontrolled ventricular
             arrhythmias; arrhythmias requiring active therapy other than chronic stable atrial
             fibrillation; if a patient has an implanted cardiac pacemaker and is otherwise well
             can be enrolled onto this study after demonstrating normal ejection fraction and
             clearance from a cardiologist; at the time of screening any electrocardiographic
             abnormality has to be documented as not medically relevant by the investigator before
             the patient proceeds to the enrollment phase

          -  Any serious medical or psychiatric illness that may interfere with participation in
             the study

          -  Patients with symptoms of hyperviscosity syndrome will not be enrolled on the study
             until they undergo plasmapheresis that results in resolution of symptoms and optimal
             control of the syndrome
