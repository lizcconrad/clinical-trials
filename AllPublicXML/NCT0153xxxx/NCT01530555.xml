  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To assess the tolerability and efficacy of rabbit antithymocyte globulin (ATG,
      Thymoglobuline®) with ciclosporin (CSA) in the first line treatment of patients with acquired
      severe aplastic anaemia (SAA), and patients with non-severe aplastic anaemia (NSAA) and who
      are transfusion dependent. To compare the response rate of the combination of rabbit ATG
      (Thymoglobuline® and CSA from this pilot study with the response rate observed in a series of
      matched AA patients; treated after 1994 with the combination of horse ATG (Lymphoglobuline®)
      and CSA; obtained from the EBMT database (comparative study).
