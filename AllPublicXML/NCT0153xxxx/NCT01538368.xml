    <textblock>
      The interpretation of Magnetic Resonance Cholangio-pancreatography (MRCP)-findings is
      primarily performed by radiologists who only in some cases have experience with the
      interpretation of endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP)-images. It is unclear
      if MRCP-interpretation by the radiologist is sufficient to decide which additional endoscopic
      procedures might be necessary in an individual case or if an additional MRCP-interpretation
      by the endoscopist renders any clinical impact.

        During 1/2007 until 12/2009 consecutive patients who were referred for dedicated endoscopic
        procedures regarding suspected alterations of the pancreato-biliary ductal system (nearly
        exclusively for EUS and/or ERCP) to our unit based on actual MRCP-findings were enrolled.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients aged 18 years or older who were referred for pancreato-biliary endoscopy to
             our unit based on actual MRCP-findings. In all cases MRCP should have been performed
             within 4 weeks prior admittance and a written radiological report as well as the
             digital images must be available.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients who had any endoscopic interventions in our institution before and also
             patients who underwent MRCP at our hospital were excluded.
