  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The prevalence of extended spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) producing bacteria found in urine
      sample cultures has been increasing over the past decades.

      The study hypothesis is to assess the clinical and microbiological outcome of pivmecillinam
      treatment of ESBL producing E. coli and K. Pneumoni, as well as to observe the clinical and
      microbiological outcome of the same group of bacteria treated with other antiinfectious
      agents.

      Samples are gathered in primary care setting.

        The study population will be selected from all patients ages 16 and over who are diagnosed
        with an urinary tract infection where an ESBL producing bacteria (E. coli) is found. The
        urinary tract infection must be diagnosed and treated in a primary care setting.
