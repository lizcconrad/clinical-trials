  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the ability of a patient, who has type 2 diabetes
      (T2DM) who is currently treated with basal/bolus insulin therapy, to use PaQ™ (a simple patch
      on insulin delivery device) to control his/her blood glucose.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a single center, open label, feasibility of use and performance evaluation of PaQ™
      (using insulin aspart) in patients with T2DM who are currently receiving basal/bolus insulin
      therapy with or without oral anti-diabetic drugs (OADs) for glycemic control. The patient's
      participation in the study is comprised of four phases: screening, baseline evaluation,
      transition to PaQ™ use, and PaQ™ treatment period. The use of these phases will allow an
      orderly transition to PaQ™ treatment as well as a reliable construct from which to interpret
      the final data.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Male/female patient's ≥ 30 ≤ 65 years of age.

          2. Clinical confirmation of T2DM diagnosis by history and medication usage or glucose
             tolerance test.

             use of OADs (metformin and/or glitazone).

          4. Currently on a stable insulin regimen &quot;as judged by the investigator&quot; (using an
             estimate of their basal dose of insulin does not fluctuate by more than ±10% every
             day) and if he/she is receiving a concurrent oral agent, the dose has remained
             unchanged for the last 30 days.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Uncontrolled hyperglycemia, HbA1c &gt; 9.0% requiring adjustment to his/her insulin
             regimen.

          2. Treated with premixed insulin, or neutral protamine hagedorn (NPH)/glargine/detemir

          5. Total daily dose (TDD) of insulin is &gt;100 units/day.

             at any given meal.

          7. Have existing dermal irritation on their abdomen or have known hypersensitivity to
             skin adhesives.

          8. Taking or has taken prednisone or cortisone medications in the previous 30 days.

          9. Pregnant or is planning to become pregnant during the study period.

         10. Has severe medical or psychological condition(s) or chronic conditions/infections that
             in the opinion of the Investigator would compromise the patient's safety or successful
             participation in the study.

         11. Unable to follow the study clinical investigational plan (CIP)
