  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators designed a randomised multicenter clinical trial for patients with advanced
      cancer who are admitted to the medical oncology ward or high-care hospice. On admission all
      patients with advanced cancer will be asked to participate in this study. Consenting patients
      will be submitted to delirium observation screening according to the DOS. Subsequently DOS
      screening will be performed twice weekly until discharge. Each patient who's score is &gt; 3
      (DOS positive) is showing significant symptoms of delirium and will be submitted to the
      revised Delirium Rating Scale (DRS-R-98) to confirm diagnosis. To test validity of the DOS
      scale for this particular population, each DOS positive score will be randomly matched with a
      patient with a DOS score &lt; 3 (DOSnegative) and this patient will also be submitted to
      DRS-R-98. When diagnosis of delirium is confirmed by DRS-98, patients will be randomised
      between treatment of delirium with olanzapine or haloperidol (usual care). Treatment in both
      groups will consist of identification and management of underlying aetiologies of delirium if
      possible and adding neuroleptic medication for symptom control. Patients who recover from
      their delirium episode as well as their caregivers will be asked to complete the Delirium
      Experience Questionnaire (DEQ) to assess recall of the delirium experience and the degree of
      distress related to the delirium episode.
