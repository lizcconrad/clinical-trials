    <textblock>
      Metachromatic leukodystrophy (MLD) is one of a group of genetic disorders called the
      leukodystrophies. These diseases impair the growth or development of the myelin sheath, the
      fatty covering that acts as an insulator around nerve fibers. Myelin, which lends its color
      to the white matter of the brain, is a complex substance made up of varying lipids (75%) and
      proteins (25%). The leukodystrophies are caused by genetic defects in myelin production or
      metabolization of the compounds of the myelin sheath. Each of the leukodystrophies is the
      result of a defect in the gene that controls one (and only one) of the enzymes responsible
      for creating or degrading a part of the myelin. MLD is caused by a deficiency of the enzyme
      arylsulfatase A. MLD is one of several lipid storage diseases, which results in the toxic
      build-up of fatty materials (lipids) in cells in the nervous system, liver, and kidneys.
      There are three forms of MLD: late infantile, juvenile, and adult. Onset of the late
      infantile form (the most common MLD) is typically between 12 and 20 months following birth.
      Affected children have difficulty walking after the first year of life. Symptoms include
      muscle wasting and weakness, muscle rigidity, developmental delays, progressive loss of
      vision leading to blindness, convulsions, impaired swallowing, paralysis, and dementia.
      Children may become comatose. Most children with this form of MLD die by age 5. The juvenile
      form of MLD (between 3-10 years of age) usually begins with impaired school performance,
      mental deterioration, and dementia and then develop symptoms similar to the infantile form
      but with slower progression. The adult form commonly begins after age 16 as a psychiatric
      disorder or progressive dementia. Symptoms include impaired concentration, ataxia, seizures,
      dementia, and tremor.

      New methods, like mass-spectrometry give a good chance to characterize specific metabolic
      alterations in the blood (plasma) of affected patients that allow to diagnose in the future
      the disease earlier, with a higher sensitivity and specificity. Therefore it is the goal of
      the study to develop new biochemical markers from the plasma of the affected patients helping
      to benefit other patients by an early diagnose and thereby with an earlier treatment.

      For the development of the new biomarkers using the technique of Mass-spectometry 10ml EDTA
      blood, sputum tube and a dry blood spot filter card are taken. To proof the correct diagnosis
      in those patients where up to the enrollment in the study no genetic testing has been done,
      sequencing will be done. The analyses are done in the Albrecht-Kossel-Institute for
      Neuroregeneration (AKos), POB 100 888, Gehlsheimer Str. 20, 18055 Rostock (Germany)
