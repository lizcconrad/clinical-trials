  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The FDA has recently approved Gardasil for the prevention of anal cancer in people aged 9-26.
      Men who have sex with men (MSM) have disproportionately high rates of anal cancer and could
      benefit greatly from vaccination. Vaccine uptake among young MSM (YMSM) is poor, and little
      is known about factors associated with vaccine acceptance in this population. With the risk
      of anal cancer among MSM higher than the risk of cervical cancer among women before routine
      cytological screening was introduced, acceptance of a prophylactic vaccine in this subgroup
      is the most cost-effective and attainable strategy to greatly reduce the prevalence of anal
      cancer. While the investigators can assume the human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine has many
      acceptable concepts among these men, there are multiple barriers which may potentially
      interfere with their likelihood of initiating the vaccine series. Vaccine catch-up rates
      among women of a similar age has been poor, and there is no reason to expect this to be
      higher among men. One potential strategy to increase vaccine uptake in this catch-up group is
      to implement a patient-driven program to promote vaccination among men.

      This project will contribute to the investigators understanding of how the investigators can
      utilize social networks to identify barriers to HPV vaccination among YMSM, and how to
      potentially influence a patient-driven vaccination effort to increase uptake among men in the
      catch-up age group. This research will inform future interventions to targeted populations
      that may be incorporated into online social networking websites to encourage HPV vaccination.

    <description>The primary outcome in this study is young men's intention to be vaccinated for human papillomavirus (HPV). This will be measured on a scale of 0-100, with a higher number indicating greater likelihood of future vaccination. No vaccine will be administered.</description>

        This study will be an internet-based, cross-sectional study targeting all US profiles of
        two separate online social/sexual networking communities of YMSM. A recruitment email will
        be sent internally to all active US profiles for men 18-26 years old.
