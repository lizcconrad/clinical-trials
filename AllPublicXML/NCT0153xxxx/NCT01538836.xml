  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether consuming additional protein during calorie
      restriction induced weight loss has beneficial or harmful effects on multi-organ (liver,
      muscle, adipose tissue) insulin sensitivity, colonocyte proliferation rates, the gut
      microbiome, muscle mass and function, and bone mineral density in obese, postmenopausal
      women.

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in insulin sensitivity</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and at 10% weight loss in calorie restriction groups and ~6 to 7 months in the weight maintenance group</time_frame>
    <description>Insulin sensitivity (glucose rate of disappearance [Rd] during a hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp procedure) will be evaluated in a subset of 10 participants per group because power analysis has determined that this number is sufficient to detect a 25% difference between groups assuming 80% power, an alpha value of 0.05 and an average baseline insulin-stimulated glucose Rd of 2,590 ± 492 µmol/min, the average ± SD insulin stimulated glucose Rd the investigators have measured during the past 20 y in obese subjects. In the investigators' experience (Kirk et al., 2009 and Magkos et al., 2016), the weight loss induced increase in insulin stimulated glucose Rd is ~50%.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline and at 5% weight loss in the calorie restriction groups and after ~3 months in the weight maintenance group</time_frame>
