    <textblock>
      This study will assess the effect of cimetidine on the pharmacokinetics (PK) of
      dexpramipexole in healthy volunteer and evaluate the safety and tolerability of
      dexpramipexole when given with or without cimetidine. Additionally, this study will explore
      the influence of genetic variation on the PK of dexpramipexole when given with or without
      cimetidine.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-center, open-label, randomized, two-period, crossover study in approximately
      14 healthy subjects. The goals of this study are as follows:

      To assess the effect of cimetidine on the pharmacokinetics (PK) of dexpramipexole in healthy
      volunteers.

      To evaluate the safety and tolerability of dexpramipexole when given with or without
      cimetidine.

      To explore the influence of genetic variation on the PK of dexpramipexole when given with or
      without cimetidine.
