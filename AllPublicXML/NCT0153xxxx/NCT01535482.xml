      The primary aim of the proposed study is to compare the efficacy of cognitive therapy (CT)
      with the efficacy of an enhanced usual care (EUC) intervention for reducing the rate of
      suicide ideation (SI) and the severity of depression and hopelessness among older men. The
      investigators expect that suicidal older men randomly assigned to the CT intervention
      condition will have a lower rate of SI during the follow-up period than participants assigned
      to the control condition.

      Older adult males have the highest suicide rate of any age group in the U.S. However, most
      research concerning treatments for suicide ideation and behavior has focused on adolescents
      and young adults. Very few treatments have been developed to reduce suicide ideation and
      behavior in men aged 50 and above. This study will assess the effectiveness of specialized
      cognitive therapy versus enhanced usual care in treating older men with suicide ideation.

      Participants in this five-year study will be randomly assigned to receive either cognitive
      therapy or enhanced usual care. Participants will be identified within the VA Medical Center
      and the University of Pennsylvania Health System (UPHS) as having experienced suicide
      ideation in the past month. Cognitive therapy will be provided by Ph.D.-level therapists and
      will be geared specifically toward older men with suicidal tendencies. The enhanced usual
      care condition will consist of the usual care that individuals receive for suicide
      prevention, plus assessment and referral services provided by independent evaluators and
      study case managers. In addition, patients in the enhanced usual care condition will receive
      weekly telephone calls from the study therapists. These phone calls will be approximately
      15-30 minutes in duration and their purpose will be to ensure patient safety and to provide
      some support. All participants will be assessed pre-treatment to attain baseline measures of
      suicide ideation, hopelessness, and depression. Study visits will occur at baseline and
      Months 1, 3, 6, 9, and 12 to assess suicide ideation. Self-report and clinician-administered
      measures will be used to assess participants' progress.
