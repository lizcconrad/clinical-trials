      This study evaluates a novel micrografting technique to determine how it will influence the
      healing and cosmetic result of selected post surgical wounds in 12 subjects. The Epidermal
      Expansion System (designed by MoMelan Technologies) will generate an array of small
      microblisters and transfer the micrografts to a sterile wound dressing for application to the
      subject's surgical area. The sponsor hypothesizes that applying expanded micrografts to
      wounds that otherwise would have healed by second intention alone will hasten healing and
      possibly reduce scarring.

    <description>The procurement of the epidermal micrograft involves the use of the MoMelan Technologies suction blister system which consists of a control box that creates the vacuum necessary to create the microblisters and a harvester. The device is applied to the subject's thigh to create blisters. The epidermal micrografts are then harvested and transferred to Tegadermâ„¢ and then placed on the surgical wound and the wound is bandaged.</description>
