      RATIONALE:

      Apatinib is a tyrosin-inhibitor agent targeting at vascular endothelial growth factor
      receptor (VEGFR), and it's anti-angiogenesis effect has been viewed in preclinical tests. The
      investigators' phase I study has shown that the drug's toxicity is manageable.

      PURPOSE:

        1. Studying how well Apatinib works in treating patients.

        2. Finding the efficacy and safety of 500 mg or 750mg Apatinib.

        3. Pharmacokinetics/Pharmacodynamics(PK/PD).

        4. Exploring new outcome measures of antiangiogenic drugs.
