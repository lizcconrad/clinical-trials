    <textblock>
      Sutures are an integral part of surgery and available materials are diverse, as are the
      options for post-procedure care. Both saline and hydrogen peroxide are commonly used
      cleansing agents. This study aims to compare the effect of saline and hydrogen peroxide on
      the tensile strength of 4-0 nylon sutures following removal from a cutaneous surgical wound.

    <measure>Tensile strength of 4-0 nylon sutures</measure>
    <time_frame>14 days</time_frame>
    <description>The tensile strength was defined as the force required to break the suture, with breaking strength as the maximum strength that a material can withstand when subjected to an applied load, without taking into consideration the cross sectional area. The strength of the sutures was measured using a tensometer.</description>
