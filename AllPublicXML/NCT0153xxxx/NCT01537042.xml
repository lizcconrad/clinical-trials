    <measure>Ratio From Baseline to the End of the 2-week Maintenance Period in Periodic Limb Movement Index (PLMI)</measure>
    <time_frame>From Baseline over the Up-Titration Period (up to 3 Weeks) to the end of the 2-Week Maintenance Period</time_frame>
    <description>The PLMI is defined as Periodic Limb Movements (PLMs)/ total time in bed in hours. PLMs are measured by Polysomnography (PSG).
The reduction of the PLMI is reflected in terms of the ratio from Baseline to the end of the Maintenance Period and was calculated as [PLMI at end of Maintenance Period (MP)] / [PLMI at Baseline].
A PLMI Ratio &lt;1 indicates an improvement from Baseline to the end of the 2-week MP.</description>

    <time_frame>From Baseline over the Up-Titration Period (up to 3 Weeks) to the end of the 2-Week Maintenance Period</time_frame>
    <description>The IRLS is a subject based scale that consists of 10 items to evaluate the severity of major RLS symptoms and the impact of the disease on subjects' functioning in daytime activities.

A sum score between 0 (no RLS symptoms present at all) and 40 (maximum severity in all symptoms) across all 10 items will be calculated.
A negative value in Change from Baseline indicates an improvement from Baseline in IRLS.</description>

    <time_frame>From Baseline over the Up-Titration Period (up to 3 Weeks) to the end of the 2-Week Maintenance Period</time_frame>
    <description>The SF-36 is a 36 item generic human research quality of life instrument that uses a recall period of 4 weeks. Items are grouped into 8 domains as follows: Physical Functioning (10 items), Role Physical (4 items), Bodily Pain (2 items), General Health (5 items), Vitality (4 items), Social Functioning (2 items), Role Emotional (3 items), Mental Health (5 items), and a further unscaled single item (question 2) for perceived stability or change in health (Health Transition) during the last year. The norm based scores (based on the US general population) were used for analysis. For the MCS, the lowest and highest possible scores are -9 and 82 (rounded).
The SF-36 domains (subscores) are scored so that a higher score indicates a better health state.</description>

Subjects start with a Rotigotine dose of 1 mg/24 h for 1 week. The dose can be increased weekly during Up-Titration Period until either the optimal or the maximal dose of 3 mg/24 h has been reached. Subjects will maintain the optimal/maximal dose during the 2-week Maintenance Period. Following the Maintenance Period, subjects will be de-escalated from their optimal dose by decreasing the dose by 1 mg/24 h every other day during Taper Period until complete withdrawal.</description>

      <recruitment_details>The recruitment for the SP0934 study began in April 2012. It concluded in October 2013. This was a multicenter study with subjects enrolled by 9 sites across Europe and 6 sites across the United States.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>The participant flow consists of the Randomized Set (RS), which is all subjects randomized into SP0934.</pre_assignment_details>

1 mg/24 h, 2 mg/24 h or 3 mg/24 h once daily depending on optimal dose; maximal dose is 3 mg/24 h.
Subjects start with a Rotigotine dose of 1 mg/24 h for 1 week. The dose can be increased weekly during Up-Titration Period until either the optimal or the maximal dose of 3 mg/24 h has been reached. Subjects will maintain the optimal/maximal dose during the 2-week Maintenance Period. Following the Maintenance Period, subjects will be de-escalated from their optimal dose by decreasing the dose by 1 mg/24 h every other day during Taper Period until complete withdrawal.</description>

A sum score between 0 (no RLS symptoms present at all) and 40 (maximum severity in all symptoms) across all 10 items will be calculated.

Scale 1 measures satisfaction with sleep during the last seven nights on an 11-point scale that ranges between 0 (completely satisfied) to 10 (completely dissatisfied). The ratings are given by the subjects.
A negative value in Change from Baseline indicates an improvement from Baseline.</description>

          <description>The RLS-6 consists of six scales of which four scales are designed to assess severity of RLS and two scales cover sleep and daytime tiredness.
Scale 5 measures the severity of RLS symptoms during the last seven days engaged in activities on an 11-point scale that ranges between 0 (none) to 10 (very severe). The ratings are given by the subjects.
A negative value in Change from Baseline indicates an improvement from Baseline.</description>

        <description>The SF-36 is a 36 item generic human research quality of life instrument that uses a recall period of 4 weeks. Items are grouped into 8 domains as follows: Physical Functioning (10 items), Role Physical (4 items), Bodily Pain (2 items), General Health (5 items), Vitality (4 items), Social Functioning (2 items), Role Emotional (3 items), Mental Health (5 items), and a further unscaled single item (question 2) for perceived stability or change in health (Health Transition) during the last year. The norm based scores (based on the US general population) were used for analysis. For the MCS, the lowest and highest possible scores are -9 and 82 (rounded).
The SF-36 domains (subscores) are scored so that a higher score indicates a better health state.</description>

          <title>Change From Baseline in the Short-Form-36 (SF-36) Item Questionnaire Physical Component Summary (PCS) to the End of the Maintenance Period</title>
          <description>The SF-36 is a 36 item generic human research quality of life instrument that uses a recall period of 4 weeks. Items are grouped into 8 domains as follows: Physical Functioning (10 items), Role Physical (4 items), Bodily Pain (2 items), General Health (5 items), Vitality (4 items), Social Functioning (2 items), Role Emotional (3 items), Mental Health (5 items), and a further unscaled single item (question 2) for perceived stability or change in health (Health Transition) during the last year. The norm-based scores (based on the US general population) were used for analysis. For the PCS, the lowest and highest possible scores are 1 and 81 (rounded).
The SF-36 domains (subscores) are scored so that a higher score indicates a better health state.</description>
