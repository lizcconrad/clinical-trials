      This study will evaluate the efficacy of Interpersonal Psychotherapy for Adolescents (IPT-A)
      for the treatment of depression and prevention of depression in maltreated and nonmaltreated
      girls between the ages of 13-15 years old.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Child maltreatment poses a serious public health problem and heightens the risk of
      psychopathology across the life course. Adolescence also represents a peak time for the
      emergence of depressive disorders particularly in girls. Effective interventions to prevent
      and treat depression in low income adolescent girls with or without histories of maltreatment
      are needed.

      Three groups will be recruited: Maltreated Depressive Symptoms (MDS), Nonmaltreated
      Depressive Symptoms (NDS), and a Nonmaltreated Nonsymptomatic Comparison (NNC), comparable in
      SES, race/ethnicity, and household composition. The MDS and NDS groups will be randomized
      into IPT-A or Enhanced Care (EC). Adolescent girls in these groups will receive 13 sessions
      of therapy. Girls in the NNC group will only complete research visits.

      Research assessments will be conducted at T1 (baseline/prior to intervention), T2 (6-weeks
      mid-intervention), T3 (end of intervention), T4 (1-year post) and T5 (18 months post). Girls
      and their mothers will participate in these research sessions. A multi-level-of-analysis
      approach, integrating genotyping, hormone assays, cognitive testing, adolescent- and
      maternal-report, mother-teen observation, and DHS and school records will be utilized to
      assess the effectiveness of the interventions.
