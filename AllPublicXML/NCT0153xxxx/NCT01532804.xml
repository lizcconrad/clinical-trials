    <textblock>
      This phase 2 trial aims to evaluate the continued use of bevacizumab with raltitrexed and
      oxaliplatin combination versus FOLFOX6 plus bevacizumab in patients with metastatic
      colorectal cancer whose disease has progressed after irinotecan-based chemotherapy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Eligible patients are randomly allocated to receive either bevacizumab with raltitrexed and
      oxaliplatin combination or bevacizumab with FOLFOX 6 combination. Random allocation schedule
      is performed using a minimization technique for the following stratification factors:

        -  Center

        -  Number of metastatic sites: 1 versus &gt; 1

        -  Bevacizumab-based first-line therapy: Yes versus No
