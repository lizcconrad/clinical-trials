      The main purpose of this study is to see if this tracer can be used to determine how well
      chemotherapy is working in patients with certain types of leukemia.

      Primary objectives

        1. To evaluate if FLT-PET uptake shows variation during the treatment course in subjects
           with MDS being treated with 5-azacitidine therapy

           Secondary objectives

        2. To assess FLT-PET uptake heterogeneity within given subjects being treated with
           5-azacitidine therapy

        3. To generate preliminary data regarding correlation between FLT-PET imaging parameters
           and clinical responses based on bone marrow aspirate/biopsy

    <description>This pilot study is intended to investigate the feasibility of FLT-PET for early assessment of treatment response in myelodysplastic syndrome and the use of a PET isotope, (18)F-FLT, in the imaging of bone marrow in subjects with MDS. The objectives will help gather initial information for a future, larger, more definitive study.</description>

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  All subjects with previously untreated, Intermediate-2 or High risk myelodysplastic
             syndrome are eligible. These patients have an international prognostic scoring system
             (IPSS) score of 1.5 to 3.5 based on bone marrow blast percentage, karyotype, and the
             number of cytopenias 26.

          -  Subjects will receive the standard FDA-approved dose and schedule of 5-azacitidine.
             This dose is 75mg/m2 SQ or IV daily for seven days with cycles repeated every 28 days

          -  The subject's treating physician must have an initial intent of treating with at least
             four cycles of therapy

          -  Subjects must have an ECOG performance status of 0, 1, or 2

          -  Subjects must not have been treated with chemotherapy or radiation for another
             malignancy within the preceding 6 months

          -  Subjects must be &gt; 18 years of age

          -  Subjects must have a serum creatinine &lt; 2.0 mg/dL and/or calculated GHF 50
             ml/min/1.73m (MRDR formula) or greater

          -  Subjects must have a serum direct bilirubin &lt; 2.0 mg/dL unless related to Gilbert's
             syndrome of hemolysis. Alkaline phosphatase, SGOT (AST), and SGPT (ALT) must be less
             than 4 x upper limit of normal

          -  Women must not be pregnant nor breastfeeding

          -  Women of childbearing potential and sexually active males are strongly advised to use
             an accepted and effective method of contraception

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects who are pregnant or breast feeding

          -  Subjects for whom a therapy other than 5-azacitidine is recommended as first line
             treatment.

               -  Allogeneic stem cell transplantation in patients with a suitable donor, lack of
                  comorbidities, and good performance status
