  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This retrospective observational study included patients (pts) with percutaneous coronary
      intervention (PCI) of a de novo coronary bifurcation lesion in one German center between
      January 2008 - August 2011. The investigators included all consecutive patients where the
      side branch was covered with a stent. Patients with ACS/cardiogenic shock were not excluded.

      Two different methods were compared: group A represents patients with a simple strategy
      without any treatment of the side branch (SB). Group B consisted of patients where the SB was
      treated (PCI and/or stenting).

      For the treatment of bifurcation lesions we used the concept of &quot;provisional stenting&quot;,
      indications for the treatment of the SB were residual stenosis &gt; 50 %, TIMI flow reduction &lt;
      2. Final-kissing PCI was intended in all patients of group B.

      MACE during follow-up was evaluated in all patients.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  All consecutive patients with a bifurcation lesion, where the side branch was covered
             with a stent placed inside the main branch.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with an in-stent-restenosis, patients with a therapy using a drug coated
             balloon during the procedure (inside the main branch and/or the side branch) and
             patients where the side branch was not covered by the stent inside the main branch.
