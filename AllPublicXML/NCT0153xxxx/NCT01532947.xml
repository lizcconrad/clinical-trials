      This in vivo study examined the contribution of remaining coronal dentin and placement of a
      prefabricated or customized fiber post to the six-year survival of endodontically treated
      premolars. A sample of 345 patients provided 6 groups of 60 premolars in need of endodontic
      treatment. Groups were classified according to the number of remaining coronal walls before
      abutment build-up. Within each group, teeth were allocated to three subgroups: A) no
      post-retention; B) LP; C) ES (N=20). All teeth were protected with a crown. Cox regression
      analysis was applied to assess whether the amount of residual coronal dentin and the type of
      endocanalar retention had a significant influence on failure risk of the restored teeth.
