  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators are inviting your child to participate in this research study because your
      child is having myringotomy (putting a tiny incision in the eardrum with or without tube
      insertion) under general anesthesia.

      The purpose of this study is to determine whether a single injection of Dexmedetomidine
      (study medication) decreases the frequency of awaking from anesthesia frightened or agitated
      in children having myringotomy surgery as compared to those children who receive placebo
      (sterile saltwater).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Emergence agitation (EA) is common in children, especially in the preschool age group who
      undergo general anesthesia. It has been described as a mental disturbance during the recovery
      from general anesthesia and can consist of hallucinations, delusions and confusion in the
      child. To the parent or caregivers this may be seen as moaning, restlessness, involuntary
      physical activity &amp; thrashing about in bed. Emergence agitation (EA) can result in the child
      losing their intravenous therapy (IV) access &amp; bodily injury. Some agitated children may
      retain vivid memories about their negative experience waking up from anesthesia. This can
      result in seeing new behaviors by the child such as anxiety, nighttime crying and temper
      tantrums. Dexmedetomidine given as an injection into the muscle of children is considered
      investigational, which means it hasn't been approved by the U.S. FDA for treatment of this
      problem in children.

      Immediately following surgery measurements of eye contact, purposeful actions, aware of
      surroundings, restless and crying are observed and recorded using the Pediatric Anesthesia
      Emergence Delirium (PAED) scale in PACU.

      Follow-up is made approximately 3 days after surgery by phone call or/and email with
      parent(s) to see if child has experienced any of the following: sleep disturbances, anxiety,
      eating disturbances, postoperative muscle pain or swelling at the injection site.

    <measure>Participant's Severity of Emergent Agitation (EA) using the Pediatric Anesthesia Emergence Delirium (PAED) scale in PACU (Post-Op Area).</measure>
    <time_frame>Participants will be followed for the duration of first PACU recovery step, an expected average visit of 30 minutes. Measurements will be observed immediately following subject's awakening from anesthesia.</time_frame>
    <description>The aim/measurement of the study is to determine wheather or not a single IM injection of Dexmedetomidine will reduce the severity of EA in children undergoing Bilateral Myringotomy with/without tubes under general anesthesia.
PAED scale measurements that will be observed/recorded are:
The child makes eye contact with the caregiver, purposeful actions, aware of surroundings, restless &amp; inconsolable.
These observations will be assessed 1 time during the child's worse episode of agitation &amp; given a score from 0-4. Scores will be added together to determine degree of ED in child.</description>

    <time_frame>Participants will be followed immediately following surgery, approximately 30 minutes. Measurements will be observed immediately following subject's awakening from anesthesia.</time_frame>
    <description>Duration of stay in the PACU (Post-Op Area) until discharge criteria are met based on modified PADSS score: level of consciousness, physical activity, hemodynamic stability, respiratory stability, oxygen saturation status, post-operative pain, and post-operative emetic symptoms. Duration of time will be measured in total mintues participate is in PACU until discharged.</description>

    <time_frame>Participants will be followed for the duration immediately following surgery, approximately 30 minutes. Measurements will be observed immediately following subject's awakening from anesthesia by Anesthesia staff.</time_frame>
    <description>Postoperative adverse respiratory events: moderate to severe coughing, oxygen desaturation (SPO2 &lt;90%), breath holding, bronchospasm, aspiration, stridor and/or laryngospasm during PACU duration to discharge. The adverse respiratory events and the adverse hemodynamic events will be documented by the anesthesia provider in the operating room and by the recovery room nurses in the PACU recovery room. All will be blinded to the drug administered. Measurement will be obtained by &quot;yes&quot;/&quot;no&quot; to each possible adverse respiratory event by anesthesia staff.</description>
