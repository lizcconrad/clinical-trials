      This phase II clinical trial studies how well two donors stem cell transplant work in
      treating patients with high-risk hematologic malignancies. After receiving radiation to help
      further treat the disease, patients receive a dose of donors' T cells. T cells can fight
      infection and react against cancer cells. Two days after donors' T cells are given, patients
      receive cyclophosphamide (CY) to help destroy the most active T cells that may cause tissue
      damage (called graft versus host disease or GVHD). Some of the less reactive T cells are not
      destroyed by CY and they remain in the patient to help fight infection. A few days after the
      CY is given, patients receive donors' stem cells to help their blood counts recover. Using
      two donors' stem cell transplant instead of one donor may be more effective in treating
      patients with high-risk disease and may prevent the disease from coming back.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess 1 year relapse free survival in patients undergoing hematopoietic stem cell
      transplant (HSCT) using the Thomas Jefferson University (TJU) 2 step approach using 2 donors.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the consistency and pace of engraftment. II. To assess the pace of T cell and B
      cell immune recovery in patients in each arm.

      III. To assess regimen related toxicity, graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) incidence and
      severity, and overall survival.

      IV. To assess the tolerance of the period of fever, diarrhea, and rash after the introduction
      of second donor and qualitatively compare it to prior patient groups or concurrent patient
      groups.

      V. To assess chimerism to ascertain whether one donor is emerging as dominant at regular
      intervals beginning at the time of engraftment.

      VI. If dominance is observed, to compare the donors with regard to degree of human leukocyte
      antigen (HLA) mismatch, killer Ig-like receptor (KIR) types, cluster of differentiation
      (CD)34+ cell doses, infusion order, donor age, and donor alloreactivity points in an effort
      to identify potential biologic factors that predict for dominance. To determine if trends
      toward dominance occur in T cell, natural killer (NK) cell, or other cellular subsets prior
      to emerging in the graft as a whole.

      VII. To assess if establishment of a dominant donor versus persistent chimerism of both
      donors is associated with a lower relapse rate.

      VIII. To collect leukemia samples prior to transplant and after relapse whenever possible. To
      assess the overall degree of HLA-class I and class II expression on these paired samples. To
      test for loss of one or both HLA haplotypes in the relapsed tumor specimens. When observed,
      to correlate loss of one HLA haplotype with: a) receipt of a transplant capable of targeting
      only that haplotype; b) establishment of dominance in a 2 haplotype transplant such that the
      lost haplotype would be the primary target of the dominant donor; c) being the target of the
      donor predicted to be more alloreactive in a 2 haplotype transplant.

      OUTLINE:

      CONDITIONING: Patients undergo total-body irradiation (TBI) twice daily (BID) on days -9 to
      -6, undergo donor lymphocyte infusion (DLI) on day -6, and receive cyclophosphamide
      intravenously (IV) over 2 hours on days -3 and -2.

      TRANSPLANTATION: Patients undergo CD34+ selected allogeneic HSCT on day 0.

      GVHD PROPHYLAXIS: Patients receive tacrolimus IV or orally (PO) beginning on day -1 with
      taper beginning on day 42 and mycophenolate mofetil IV or PO BID on days -1 to 28.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 1 year, and then
      periodically thereafter.

Survival will be estimated by the Kaplan-Meier method. All estimates of rates will be presented with corresponding confidence intervals. For 1 year RFS rates, the method of Atkinson and Brown will be used to allow for the two-stage design; otherwise the method of Conover.</description>
