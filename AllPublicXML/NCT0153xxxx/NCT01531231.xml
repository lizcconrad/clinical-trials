  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to examine the role of every day experiences as they relate to
      coronary artery disease (CAD).
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      CAD is the most common setting in which sudden cardiac death (SCD) occurs. SCD is the leading
      cause of death in the U.S.

      In this study we propose to test the following in patients with CAD:

        -  Determine whether experiences assessed randomly throughout the day are associated with
           changes in the blood supply to your heart muscle as measured by electrical recordings
           from your chest.

        -  Determine whether typical daily experiences are associated with changes in the recovery
           time portion of your heart beat cycle as measured by electrical recordings from your
           chest.

        -  Determine whether changes in the recovery time portion of your heart beat cycle
           associated with typical daily experiences occur exclusively with changes in the blood
           supply to your heart muscle.

        -  Determine whether typical daily experiences influences blood supply and recovery time
           based on the severity and presence of CAD (when comparing CAD patients to healthy
           subjects).

    <measure>To obtain behavioral and cardiovascular data including 4-days collection of data as study participant engages in their daily activities.</measure>
    <time_frame>4 days</time_frame>
    <description>To determine whether typical daily emotion is associated with myocardial ischemia and repolarization changes in patients with coronary artery disease, and then determine whether the association between repolarization changes and daily emotion is related to myocardial ischemia; whether daily emotion influences ischemia and repolarization differentially as a function of severity of coronary artery disease; whether the association between daily emotion and repolarization varies in healthy volunteers. Some of these outcomes are intertwined.</description>
