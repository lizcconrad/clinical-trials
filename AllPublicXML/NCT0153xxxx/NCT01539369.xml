  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this parallel design study is to assess the relative effects of two 12-week
      healthy eating dietary interventions: general healthy eating (Diet A) and general healthy
      eating combined with advice to increase fibre intake (Diet B) to at least 25g/day (with a
      large proportion of the fibre intake derived from cereal or wheat bran), in overweight
      low-fibre consuming premenopausal female adults on body weight change (kg). It is
      hypothesized that adding fibre to a healthy eating diet (Diet B) would lead to greater weight
      loss and/or weight loss maintenance than following a healthy eating diet alone (Diet A).

      In this randomised, single blind, parallel design study participants were randomly assigned
      to one of two 12-week healthy eating dietary interventions: Diet A: general healthy eating OR
      Diet B: general healthy eating combined with advice to increase fibre intake to at least
      25g/day (with a large proportion of the fibre intake derived from cereal or wheat bran.

    <time_frame>at screening and every 4 weeks at each subsequent visit, the last week of the intervention (week 12), at one month and one year after the intervention has finished</time_frame>
    <description>Body weight will be measured three times using ADP (BodPod, Concord, CA, USA); once during the inclusion phase (week -1), at the end of the intervention (week 12) and at follow up (one year later). Body weight will also be measured six times using bioimpedance (Tanita, Illinois, USA); once during the inclusion phase (week -1) and then again during weeks 4, 8, 12 of the intervention phase and at follow up (one month later and one year later)</description>

    <time_frame>7 day food diary the week before starting the intervention; 3 day food diaries at baseline (first week of the intervention), then baseline +4 weeks, baseline +8 weeks, baseline +12 weeks, baseline +12 months</time_frame>
    <description>A 7-day food intake diary (self-reported food intake using household measures) will be completed during the first week of the inclusion phase to allow an assessment of habitual daily energy, macronutrient and fibre intake. Three-day food intake diaries (self-reported food intake using household measures on 2 weekdays and 1 weekend day) will be completed during study weeks 1, 5, 9, 12 and at one year follow up</description>

    <time_frame>at baseline (first week of the intervention over a period of 3 days) and at baseline +12 weeks (last week of the intervention over a period of 3 days)</time_frame>
    <description>This will be assessed using continuous glucose monitoring (CGMS) in a subsample of participants N=24, with N=12 from each treatment arm. Fasting measures of insulin and glucose will be obtained to assess Homeostasis Model Assessment (HOMA) and diabetes risk before and at the end of the intervention</description>

    <measure>Biochemical measures</measure>
    <time_frame>at baseline (first week of the intervention) and then at baseline +12 weeks (last week of the intervention)</time_frame>
    <description>Fasting blood samples will be collected during the first week of the intervention and in the last week of the intervention (week 12) on the morning of a test meal challenge day. These fasting samples will be assayed for glucose, insulin, cholesterol, triglycerides and also leptin. These blood samples will be collected at the phlebotomy outpatient clinic at the Leeds General Infirmary. Further blood samples, which will be assayed for appetite hormones (Ghrelin, GLP-1, PYY and CCK), will be taken pre and post lunch on the test meal challenge days via a cannula fitted by a research nurse.</description>

    <measure>Subjective symptoms, wellbeing and Mood</measure>
    <time_frame>Wellbeing Diary Booklets (WDBs) will be completed each day from screening till the last week of the intervention (week 12)</time_frame>
    <description>Each day women will complete a symptom checklist which will ask them to rate a range of symptoms on a five point Likert Scale from 0 (none) to 4 (extreme). The checklist will comprise items relating to women's general wellbeing (e.g. digestive sensations, mood and wellbeing). Women will note down whether they are menstruating. Participants on Diet B will record the amount of fibre they have consumed using a points-based system, as a measure of compliance. Each day all women will be asked to complete the Bristol Stool Form Scale (BSFQ; O'Donnell et al., 1990)</description>

    <description>Participants were randomly assigned to one of two parallel arms:
Diet A:healthy eating without extra advice to increase fibre intake or Diet B: healthy eating with extra advice to increase fibre intake to a minimum of 25g/d. Healthy eating advice was based on the British Heart Foundation booklet: &quot;Food Should Be Fun And Healthy&quot;. Participants following Diet A were encouraged to eat breakfast cereals and were provided with complementary cereals and snacks low in fibre. Participants following Diet B were encouraged to eat high fibre breakfast cereals and to incorporate wheat bran fibre in other meals. Complementary high fibre cereals and snacks were provided.</description>
