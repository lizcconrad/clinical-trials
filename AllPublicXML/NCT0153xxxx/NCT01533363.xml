      The purpose of this study was to determine the influence on Patient comfort after Stapled
      Hemorrhoidopexy versus Milligan Morgan (two surgical procedures)in third degree circular
      hemorrhoids.

      There are well known advantages in the short-outcome, however, there are still some
      uncertainties about the long-term results and recurrence rates, and only a few data of
      randomized trials are available.

      In most studies the patient population was heterogeneous with a varied degree of treated
      hemorrhoids, and different surgical procedures were performed. Therefore we initiated this
      prospective randomized controlled study of a homogeneous patient population with only
      circular third-degree hemorrhoids and clearly defined operative procedures. All patients with
      symptomatic, reducible circular third-degree hemorrhoidal disease were randomly assigned to
      undergo either the Milligan-Morgan technique or the stapling procedure. Patients were
      excluded from the study if they had single third-degree hemorrhoids, acute incarcerated
      hemorrhoids, intercurrent acute anal fissure and/or acute anal fistula, or prior
      hemorrhoidectomy. The main end point parameter of this study was to compare both groups with
      respect to patient comfort and postoperative pain. Secondary end points included the
      long-term recurrence rate of hemorrhoidal disease after a minimum of 4 years.
