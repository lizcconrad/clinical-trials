  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research is examining whether an 8-week online nutritional programming based on a
      Mediterranean diet can achieve meaningful increase intake of a Mediterranean based diet and
      improvements in measures of body weight and laboratory measures of oxidative stress, a risk
      marker for cardiovascular disease. This study will also examine whether weekly short support
      and communication from a medical assistant (MA) in a primary care setting in addition to the
      online program will result in better program adherence and have a positive impact on health.

      Eligible participants will be identified by primary care providers or their staff at clinical
      outpatient site(s). Study is 3-arm randomized control trial where participants will be
      randomized to 1) Control group (CTL)-will not receive access to online program nor
      intervention for first 12 weeks; 2) GFFY-1-will receive access to online program without MA
      intervention 3) GFFY-2-will receive access to online program and MA intervention with weekly
      phone call. The core of the intervention is an 8-week Mediterranean diet and behavioral
      online program called &quot;Go! Foods for You (GFFY)&quot; which is offered on the Cleveland Clinic's
      360.5.com website. The research will last for 24 weeks. Questionnaire data and biometric
      measurements will be collected at pre and post intervention (0-8 weeks) and at followup (12
      and 24 weeks). Regardless of randomization, participants will be asked to provide their
      weight every week and an activity log at the end of each week of the program. A urine sample
      to measure F2-isoprostane will be collected at week 0 and 12 for GFFY-2 and CTL groups.

      A preparatory phase requiring the involvement of MAs to provide weekly support to
      participants is necessary to test process and communication with MAs. Enrollment of 10-20
      volunteers for the preparatory phase is desired. Data collected during this phase will not be
      part of study analysis. To test data collection process, we may ask a few participants to
      complete baseline questionnaire only.
