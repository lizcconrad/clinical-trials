    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to assess survival of patients with advanced cardiac AL amyloidosis
      treated with high cut-off hemodialysis (HCO-HD) combined with chemotherapy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This will be a single-center phase II open label trial. Subjects with advanced cardiac AL
      amyloidosis and end-stage renal disease will undergo HCO-HD while receiving chemotherapy for
      their plasma cell dyscrasia according to the current standards of care.

      After giving written informed consent, the patients will be evaluated for eligibility.
      Briefly, the subjects with a biopsy-proven diagnosis of AL amyloidosis who are cardiac stage
      3 based on NT-proBNP (&gt; 332 ng/L) and cTnI (&gt; 100 ng/L) and whose estimated glomerular
      filtration rate (eGFR) is &lt; 15 mL/min per 1.73 m2 will be eligible for the study. Patients
      with non-AL (e.g. familial and senile) amyloidosis will be excluded, as well as subjects who
      have less than 100 mg/L circulating amyloidogenic FLC. Sixteen patients will be enrolled.

      The study includes 3 periods: screening, treatment followed by the end-of-treatment
      evaluation and follow-up. During dialysis the patients will undergo the first cycle of
      chemotherapy according to the current standard of care for subjects with advanced cardiac AL
      amyloidosis. Measurements of FLC and cardiac biomarkers will be done before and after each
      dialysis session. High cutoff HD will be continued during the first chemotherapy cycle. After
      the first cycle the end-of-treatment evaluation will take place. Follow-up evaluations will
      be performed after the end of each subsequent chemotherapy cycle and every 2 months after
      chemotherapy discontinuation for 1 year or until disease progression occurs.
