  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Kidney transplantation is the best treatment for many patients with kidney failure. Sometimes
      a transplanted kidney is rejected by the patient's immune system. Many types of immune system
      cells, including B cells, are active in rejection. B cells produce antibodies against
      anything the body sees as non-self, like germs or a transplanted kidney. Most medicines that
      help prevent transplant rejection affect cells other than B cells. Belimumab is a medication
      used to treat a disease called lupus. Belimumab slows development of antibody-producing B
      cells. This study will test whether belimumab works on parts of the immune system that cause
      rejection. Twenty to thirty adults getting a kidney transplant will be in this study. Like
      flipping a coin, a computer will randomly assign half to be given belimumab and half to be
      given placebo (a fake medicine). Patients and doctors will not know which medicine was
      assigned until the study is over. A total of 7 doses of study medicine will be given through
      a vein. One dose will be given during transplant surgery, and the other 6 will be given 2, 4,
      8, 12, 16 and 20 weeks after transplant surgery. Usual transplant medicines will also be
      given. After all of the doses have been given, patients will be watched and tested at 24, 36,
      and 52 weeks after the transplant surgery. Blood samples will be tested to see what study
      medicines do to the immune system in transplant patients. If patients get a kidney biopsy,
      the samples will be tested to see if belimumab had any effect. Patients will be asked many
      questions to see if they are having any side effects. The study will be done at Addenbrooke's
      Hospital in Cambridge and Guys &amp;St Thomas Hospital in London, United Kingdom. A
      pharmaceutical company, GlaxoSmithKline, is funding the study.

    <measure>Change From Baseline in na誰ve B Cells From Baseline to Week 24</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>Naive B cell is cell that is not exposed to antigen. Na誰ve B cell count is CD20+CD27 concentration of cells (conc-cell)/cubic millimeter (cumm). Change from Baseline in na誰ve B cells was calculated as the value at Week 24 minus the value at Baseline. MITT Population consisted of all participants randomized to treatment, who have had taken at least one dose of study. Participants analyzed included those who had data at Week 24 for na誰ve B cells count (MITT Population). Baseline value used in the analysis was of Day 0 (Day of transplant). Adjusted mean differences (treatment-placebo) and 95% confidence intervals for differences were obtained from mixed-models repeated-measures (MMRM) model, with fixed categorical effects of treatment, visit, donor type and treatment-by-visit interaction and fixed continuous covariates of Baseline and Baseline-by-visit interaction. A compound symmetry variance structure was used to model the within-participant errors, shared across treatments.</description>

             transplantation will be performed

          -  Donor characteristics: Receiving a deceased donor kidney or a living donor kidney
             allograft

          -  Age &amp; Gender: Male or female between 18 and 75 years of age, inclusive, at the time of
             signing the informed consent

          -  Female Subjects: Not pregnant or nursing and at least one of the following conditions
             apply: a. Non-childbearing potential defined as pre-menopausal females with a
             documented tubal ligation or hysterectomy or postmenopausal defined as 12 months of
             spontaneous amenorrhea. In the absence of confirmatory laboratory assessments [(a
             blood sample with simultaneous follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) &gt; 40 million
             international units per milliliter (MIU/mL) and estradiol &lt; 40 picogram per milliliter
             (pg/mL) (&lt;147 picomole per liter [pmol/L])] in questionable cases, female subjects
             will be required to use one of the contraception methods as described by the
             investigator or designee, until confirmatory results become available; b. Questionable
             post-menopausal status and agrees to use one of the contraception methods as described
             by the investigator or designee, from Day 0 until 16 weeks after the last dose of
             investigational product or until postmenopausal status is confirmed with a blood
             sample with simultaneous follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) &gt; 40 MIU/mL and estradiol

        <description>Naive B cell is cell that is not exposed to antigen. Na誰ve B cell count is CD20+CD27 concentration of cells (conc-cell)/cubic millimeter (cumm). Change from Baseline in na誰ve B cells was calculated as the value at Week 24 minus the value at Baseline. MITT Population consisted of all participants randomized to treatment, who have had taken at least one dose of study. Participants analyzed included those who had data at Week 24 for na誰ve B cells count (MITT Population). Baseline value used in the analysis was of Day 0 (Day of transplant). Adjusted mean differences (treatment-placebo) and 95% confidence intervals for differences were obtained from mixed-models repeated-measures (MMRM) model, with fixed categorical effects of treatment, visit, donor type and treatment-by-visit interaction and fixed continuous covariates of Baseline and Baseline-by-visit interaction. A compound symmetry variance structure was used to model the within-participant errors, shared across treatments.</description>

Change from Baseline was calculated as the value on Week 24 and Week 52 minus the value at Baseline. Baseline value used in the analysis was of Day 0 (Day of transplant). Only those participants available at the specified time points were analyzed (represented by n=X, X in the category titles).</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Clinical Chemistry Parameter- Direct Bilirubin, Total Bilirubin and Creatinine at Week 24 and Week 52</title>
        <description>Clinical chemistry parameters included direct bilirubin (DB), total bilirubin (TB) and creatinine (C). Endpoint was assessed at Week 24 (at the end of therapy) and at Week 52 (at study end). Change from Baseline was calculated as the value on Week 24 and Week 52 minus the value at Baseline. Baseline value used in the analysis was of Day 0 (Day of transplant). Only those participants available at the specified time points were analyzed (represented by n=X, X in the category titles).</description>

        <description>Change from Baseline in GFR was assessed at Week 24 (at the end of therapy) and at Week 52 (at study end). Change from Baseline was calculated as the value on Week 24 and Week 52 minus the value at Baseline. Baseline value used in the analysis was of Day 0 (Day of transplant). Only those participants available at the specified time points were analyzed (represented by n=X, X in the category titles).</description>

        <title>Median Percent Change From Baseline in Memory B Cell Count at Week 24 and Week 52</title>
        <description>Memory B cells are B cell sub-type that are formed within germinal centres following primary infection and are important in generating an accelerated and more robust antibody-mediated immune response in the case of re-infection. Memory B cell count included CD20+CD27+ cells/mm^3. Baseline value used in the analysis was of Day 0 (Day of transplant). Endpoint was assessed at Week 24 (at the end of therapy) and at Week 52 (at study end). Percent change from Baseline in Memory B cell count was calculated as the value at Week 24 and Week 52 minus the value at Baseline multiplied by 100. Only those participants available at the specified time points were analyzed (represented by n=X, X in the category titles). Median Difference and 95% confidence interval of difference obtained using the Hodges-Lehmann method.</description>

        <description>Activated memory B cell-CD95% count is CD19+CD27+CD95 conc-cells/mL. Adjusted mean difference (treatment-placebo) and 95% confidence intervals for differences were obtained from MMRM model, with fixed categorical effects of treatment, visit, donor type and treatment-by-visit interaction and fixed continuous covariates of Baseline and Baseline-by-visit interaction. A compound symmetry variance structure was used to model the within-participant errors, shared across treatments. Only those participants available at the specified time points were analyzed (represented by n=X, X in the category titles).</description>

        <title>Activated T Cell Count at Week 24 and Week 52</title>
        <description>A T cell is a type of lymphocyte that plays a central role in cell-mediated immunity. Activated T cell count Codarri is CD4+ CD25hi CD45RA- IL 7Rhi (Conc-cells/mL). Adjusted mean difference (treatment-placebo) and 95% confidence intervals for differences were obtained from MMRM model, with fixed categorical effects of treatment, visit, donor type and treatment-by-visit interaction and fixed continuous covariates of Baseline and Baseline-by-visit interaction. A compound symmetry variance structure was used to model the within-participant errors, shared across treatments. Only those participants available at the specified time points were analyzed (represented by n=X, X in the category titles).</description>

        <description>Regulatory T cell (%CD4) = CD4+ CD25hi IL-7Rlo (% of CD4+). Adjusted mean difference (treatment-placebo) and 95% confidence intervals for differences were obtained from MMRM model, with fixed categorical effects of treatment, visit, donor type and treatment-by-visit interaction and fixed continuous covariates of Baseline and Baseline-by-visit interaction. A compound symmetry variance structure was used to model the within-participant errors, shared across treatments. Only those participants available at the specified time points were analyzed (represented by n=X, X in the category titles).</description>
