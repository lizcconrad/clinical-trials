  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to collect kinematic motion data from subjects with movement
      disorders such as Parkinson's disease (PD) and essential tremor (ET) to develop and validate
      algorithms for quantifying motor symptoms such as tremor, bradykinesia (slowed movements),
      dyskinesias (sudden, involuntary movements), gait, and balance during standardized tasks
      and/or activities of daily living.
