      Primary Objective:

      To determine and compare the pharmacokinetic (PK) profiles of 2 different SAR231893 (REGN668)
      drug products after administration of a single subcutaneous (SC) dose

      Secondary Objective:

      To determine and compare the safety and tolerability of the 2 SAR231893 (REGN668) drug
      products after administration of a single SC dose

      The duration of the study for each subject is 8-11 weeks broken down as follows:

        -  Screening: 2 to 21 days,

        -  Treatment: 1 day (2 overnight stays at the study site),

        -  Follow-up: up to 2 months after dosing.
