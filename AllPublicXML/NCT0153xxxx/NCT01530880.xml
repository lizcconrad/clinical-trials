    <textblock>
      Fever, defined as temperature higher than 38.3C (100.9 F), is common in patients with head
      injuries and is associated with poor recovery after injury. The current standard of care is
      to use oral acetaminophen (Tylenol) followed by a body cooling device. This method can
      effectively reduce fever but results in a high rate of shivering. Shivering is stressful to
      the heart and can further worsen brain injury. Methods to combat shivering have been
      developed and are successful in limiting the stress in the majority of patients that use a
      body cooling device. However, the drugs used to control shivering are sedating and may also
      interfere with brain recovery.

      The purpose of this study is to assess whether ibuprofen given intravenously is more
      effective in combating fever than the current standard of care. Should results from this
      study demonstrate that ibuprofen infusion is effective, a larger study will be conducted to
      determine whether this aggressive fever control regimen leads to improved recovery after
      brain injury.

      This is an open-label, investigator initiated single center, randomized, prospective study.
      Subjects meeting enrollment criteria will be randomly assigned 1:1 to one of two groups:

        1. Standard Care: Acetaminophen 650 mg via oral/nasogastric tube every 6 hours as needed
           for T&gt;=38.3 C (100.9 F) for up to post bleed day 14 or discharge from the Neuro ICU,
           whichever comes first.

        2. Ibuprofen 400 mg/100 mL NS IV over 30 minutes, followed by a continuous infusion of 2000
           mg/500 mL NS at 85 mg/hour (21 mL/hour) for up to post bleed day 14 or discharge from
           the Neuro ICU, whichever comes first.

      Patients/surrogates will be approached for consent and randomized upon admission. Therapy
      will only be initiated once a patient becomes febrile (&gt;=38.3 C, 100.9 F). The use of
      temperature modulating devices will be permitted as per institutionally approved guidelines
      in those patients continuing to demonstrate a fever (T&gt;38.3 C, 100.9 F) with either therapy.
