  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Agomelatine (AGO178) was developed for the treatment of depression. A new formulation is
      being tested in the present study: a tablet to be placed and dissolved under the tongue
      (sublingual tablet). The goal of this trial is to study the pharmacokinetics of agomelatine
      given as sublingual tablet in patients with liver impairment and to compare the results to
      those of healthy volunteers who receive the same treatment.

          -  Significant illness within the two weeks prior to the dosing

          -  Patients with Child-Pugh alterations due to a non-liver disease (e.g. cancer or
