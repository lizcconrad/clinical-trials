      Monitoring could secure management for patient but stay invasive. The purpose of this study
      was to compare,after cardiac surgery, the cardiac output measurement between transpulmonary
      thermodilution(reference method) and digital photoplethysmography (non invasive) for absolute
      value and dynamics changes before and after fluid expansion for patients with indication of
      fluid challenge.

      -  The time frame of the study period was included between the arrival at the ICU after
           cardiac surgery and before spontaneous breathing on mechanical ventilation

        -  Time-to-event outcome measures was period of time between the arrival at the ICU after
           cardiac surgery and before spontaneous breathing on mechanical ventilation. The event
           (hypotension) was defined as systolic arterial pressure under 90mmHg,less than 40mmHg,
           mean arterial pressure under 70mmHg, tachycardia upper 100 beats/min, presence of skin
           mottling, low cardiac output or previous blood loss.
