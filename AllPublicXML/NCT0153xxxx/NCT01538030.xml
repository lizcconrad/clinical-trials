    <textblock>
      Premature rupture of membranes is an important cause of neonatal morbidity and mortality,
      mainly because of the complications associated with this pathology (oligohydramnios, cord
      compression or prolapse, infection). When rupture of the membranes occur the risk of cord
      compression increases but there is little evidence regarding this complication and amniotic
      fluid volume. The investigator's focus are the perinatal outcomes according to amniotic fluid
      volume (&lt; 5 or &gt;5).
