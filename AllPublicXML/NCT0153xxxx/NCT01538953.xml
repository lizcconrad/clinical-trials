      This study is designed to evaluate the effect of different methods of drinking water
      treatment on the occurrence of diarrhea among children living in squatter settlements in
      Karachi, Pakistan, and the marginal benefit of adding handwashing to water treatment. 260
      households will receive a new product which combines flocculation with chlorination to
      produce clearer, less chemically contaminated drinking water. 260 households will receive
      dilute sodium hypochlorite, i.e. bleach to treat their water. 260 households will receive
      soap and encouraged to wash their hands regularly. 260 households will receive both soap and
      the combination flocculation/chlorination water treatment. 260 households will continue their
      standard water treatment and handwashing practices. The households will be visited each week
      for 9 months, and the episodes of diarrhea from each child in the household recorded. The
      rate of diarrhea between the groups will be compared. At the end of 9 months, households who
      were part of the standard habits and practice group will receive a water storage vessel and
      disinfectant.
