    <textblock>
      Ultrasound guided needling is becoming an accepted treatment for patients with shoulder pain
      due to calcifying tendinitis. However, evidence for this treatment is lacking. The
      investigators expect that patients treated with us guided needling with corticosteroid
      injection compared with patients treated with only corticosteroid injections in the
      subacromial bursa have better clinical outcome after one year follow-up.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Calcifying tendinitis of the shoulder is a common cause of shoulder pain with an incidence
      ranging from 2.7 % to 6.8 %. This disease of the rotator cuff tendons is characterised by
      calcifications in the tendons, most commonly in the supraspinatus tendon up to 82%. The
      aetiology remains unclear.

      Calcifying tendinitis is regarded as a self-healing condition with usually spontaneous
      resolution of the calcifications. But some patients have chronic or recurrent pain and
      disability of the shoulder which requires treatment. The treatment should be minimally
      invasive and effective in short and long term. Symptomatic treatment is indicated first using
      non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, therapeutic exercise and non ultrasound guided
      subacromial corticosteroids injection.

      The role of corticosteroid injections is unknown due to the lack of good studies. Family
      doctors and orthopaedic surgeons inject corticosteroids in the shoulder without the guidance
      of ultrasound; with this method accurate needle placement in the subacromial bursa is not
      possible. When this treatment fails other therapeutical methods can be used. Ultrasound
      guided needling is a percutaneous technique of fragmentation or extraction of calcifications
      in the rotator cuff tendon.

      Literature shows favourable results but only a few randomized controlled trials were
      executed. Randomised controlled trials are needed to give more insight in the effectiveness
      of us guided needling. Comparing two groups of patients treated with us guided corticosteroid
      injection and one group combined with us guided needling can provide information of the
      usefulness of us guided needling.

    <description>Us guided needling is a therapeutical technique treating calcifying tendinitis of the shoulder. Calcifications in the rotator cuff tendon are visualised with ultrasound. Under ultrasound guidance a 20 gauge needle is inserted in the calcification. Lidocaine 1% in a 1cc syringe is injected in the calcification and aspirated. The calcification is flushed until the fluid is clear. Sometimes it is not possible to flush the calcification. In this case the calcification will be fragmented.
After flushing or fragmentation of the calcification, 20 mg triamcinolone with 1cc lidocaine 1% will be injected in de subacromial bursa under us guidance.</description>
