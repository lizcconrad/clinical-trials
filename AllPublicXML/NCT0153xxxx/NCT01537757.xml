  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will assess the pharmacokinetics of MK-8931, a ß-secretase inhibitor, in
      participants with renal insufficiency. In Part 1 of the study, pharmacokinetics of MK-8931 in
      participants with severe renal disease and in healthy matched control participants will be
      studied. If data from Part 1 confirms that severe renal impairment does not alter the
      pharmacokinetics of MK-8931 to the extent requiring dosage adjustment, then no further study
      will be required and Part 2 will be optional. If the data does not support this conclusion,
      then Part 2 will be conducted to study the pharmacokinetics of MK-8931 in participants with
      moderate and mild renal impairment compared to healthy matched controls.
