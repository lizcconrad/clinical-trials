    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well giving rituximab together with combination chemotherapy
      works in treating patients with previously untreated high- or high-intermediate-risk diffuse
      large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). Monoclonal antibodies, such as rituximab, can block cancer
      growth in different ways. Some block the ability of cancer to grow and spread. Others find
      cancer cells and help kill them or carry cancer-killing substances to them. Drugs used in
      chemotherapy, such as cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin hydrochloride, vincristine sulfate, and
      prednisone (CHOP), work in different ways to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by
      killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Giving more than one drug, combination
      chemotherapy, may kill more cancer cells. Giving rituximab together with combination
      chemotherapy together may be an effective treatment for DLBCL

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate 1 year progression-free survival (PFS) following treatment with rituximab
      intense dosing and CHOP-21 (RID-CHOP) in previously untreated patients with high risk
      (International Prognostic Index [IPI] 3-5) DLBCL.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate, in previously untreated patients with high risk (IPI 3-5) DLBCL treated with
      rituximab intense dosing and CHOP-21: Complete response (CR) rate, (as defined by
      International Harmonization Project criteria using 18-fluorodeoxyglucose [FDG] -positron
      emission tomography [PET]/computed tomography [CT]).

      II. Overall survival.

      III. Toxicity profile.

      IV. Rituximab pharmacokinetics for this dose and schedule.

      V. Effect of immunophenotype of DLBCL on outcome.

      VI. Effect of Fc-Gamma Receptor III (FcyRIII) polymorphism genotype on outcome. OUTLINE:
      Patients receive rituximab intravenously (IV) on days 0, 1, 4, 8, and 15 of course 1; days 1,
      8, and 15 of course 2; and day 1 of all subsequent courses. Patients also receive CHOP
      chemotherapy comprising cyclophosphamide IV, doxorubicin hydrochloride IV, and vincristine
      sulfate IV on day 1, and prednisone orally (PO) on days 1-5. Treatment repeats every 21 days
      for 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. After
      completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 2-3 months for 2 years, every 6
      months for 3 years, annually for up to 10 years.
