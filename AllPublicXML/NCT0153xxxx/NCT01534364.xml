  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to assess the effect of a diet prior to cardiac surgery on the
      common postoperative decline of renal function. Until now, there is no known drug or
      procedure to preserve the kidneys from this impairment. Patients with a known kidney disease
      are especially at risk. A potential beneficial effect of a diet prior to surgery has been
      shown in investigations in mammals, therefore this study will investigate if a preoperative
      diet in patients with known kidney disease and scheduled heart surgery can attenuate or
      prevent a postoperative loss of kidney function.

      Patients with cardiothoracic surgery are at risk for postoperative acute renal failure which
      is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. There is no drug or procedure known
      to prevent this loss of renal function. Experimental data suggests, that a preoperative
      caloric restriction might provide kidney protection in this context. This clinical trial
      investigates if this phenomenon is also applicable in humans. Patients with a increased risk
      for a postoperative renal failure due to known chronic kidney disease are randomized in 2
      groups. Patients of the diet group receive a calorie restriction to 60% of the calculated
      daily energy rate from day -7 until day -1 (included) pre-surgery (day 0 corresponds to day
      of surgery). Patients of the control group receive alimentation ad libitum.

      Primary objective is the increase of serum creatinine in mg/dl 24 h after induction of
      ischemia (&quot;cross clamping&quot;) in comparison to baseline value obtained in the morning of the
      day of surgery (day 0) in order to analyse if a preoperative calorie restriction as a
      preventive strategy leads to a attenuation of postoperative kidney injury. Hypothesis: A
      seven day calorie restriction reduces the increase of serum creatinine after cardiac surgery
      in patients with known chronic kidney disease.
