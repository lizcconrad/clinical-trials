  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This protocol is a phase I study. Patients may be eligible for an infusion of Multi-virus
      Cytotoxic T Lymphocytes (CTL) if they received a T-cell depleted (TCD) transplant from a
      related family member or an unrelated donor. Recipients of these types of transplants are
      severely immune compromised during the early post-transplant period and are more susceptible
      to certain viruses. The investigators hypothesize that the adoptive transfer of Cytotoxic T
      Lymphocytes (CTL) against certain viruses: Adenovirus, Cytomegalovirus and Epstein Barr Virus
      (Ad, CMV, and EBV) will be safe with regard to producing graft versus host disease (GVHD) or
      other infusion related toxicities.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Within this clinical trial, the investigators will test the hypotheses that the
      administration of CTLs for prophylaxis against Ad, CMV and EBV in recipients of TCD-HPCT will
      be safe and well tolerated. Graded doses of Multi-Virus CTL will be administered to
      recipients of genotypically haploidentical or mismatched unrelated TCD grafts.

    <description>Patients will be studied in cohorts of 3. Eligible patients will receive a single Multi-Virus CTL line infusion 28-100 days after their transplant. The dose will start at dose level 1 (2.0 x 106/kg). After each cohort of 3 patients has been treated at each of the dose levels, decisions will be made if the next high or lower dose level should be used.</description>
