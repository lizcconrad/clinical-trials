  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A comparison of two skin barriers on healthy volunteers with a colostomy, ileostomy or
      urostomy.

      Endpoints of comparison include the ability to maintain a secure fit around the stoma, skin
      protection, wear-time, ease of use, ease of teaching, and comfort.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Study to include 60 subjects, three centers, total of 4 weeks, 2 weeks in each product.
      Subjects recruited from a population of persons who have had an existing fecal or urinary
      stoma for a duration of at least three months. There is no restriction on primary diagnosis
      for ostomy surgery. Subjects must be of legal consenting age, must currently be managing
      their own stoma with a two piece pouching system, either a pre-cut, cut to fit, moldable or
      stretch-to-fit, any manufacturer. Subjects may not require convexity and be willing to not to
      use any accessory products during the study.
