  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Innovative advances in rehabilitation technology have created a split-belt treadmill capable
      of providing a much needed intervention aimed at limiting mobility disability. When
      desynchronized, the split-belt treadmill imposes demands on each leg such that the central
      nervous system must adapt to the challenge. Based on preliminary data from our lab utilizing
      the split-belt treadmill, the investigators hypothesize this intervention can challenge the
      locomotor processes required for safe, efficient gait while concurrently providing an aerobic
      stimulus will produce favorable changes in physical function in older adults at risk for
      mobility disability.

      For this pilot study the investigators will enroll 20 sedentary older adults at risk for
      disability (usual gait speed ≤ 1.0 m/s). Participants will be assigned to one of two 12-week
      interventions. Therefore the final training pool will consist of 10 split-belt participants
      and 10 traditional treadmill participants. Aim 1 will test the hypothesis that compared with
      a traditional treadmill intervention a split-belt treadmill intervention will result in
      improved mobility, as measure by 400 meter walk time, as well self reported physical
      function/disability as measured by the Pepper Assessment Tool for Disability. Aim 2 will test
      the hypothesis that compared with a traditional treadmill intervention a split-belt treadmill
      intervention will results in improved gait variability. To date, no experimental study has
      evaluated these propositions in a controlled trial testing the effects of split-belt training
      in older adults at risk for disability.

    <time_frame>Participants will be evaluated within 1-week prior to begining the intervention and within 1-week following completion of the 12-week intervention</time_frame>
    <description>Participants will be asked to walk at their usual pace, without over exerting. They can stop for up to 1 min for fatigue or other symptoms. A time limit of 15 minutes to perform the test has been established based on the following considerations.</description>

    <measure>Change in gait variability from pre to post 12-week intervention</measure>
    <time_frame>Participants will be evaluated within 1-week prior to begining the intervention and within 1-week following completion of the 12-week intervention</time_frame>
    <description>We will test this working hypothesis by examining changes in spatial and temporal characteristics of gait that occur following 12-weeks of split-belt versus traditional treadmill training. Measures of interest will include variability in stance time, step length, stride length, stride time, swing time, and double limb support time directly from the GAITRite.</description>
