      This is a global pregnancy registry to evaluate the outcomes of pregnancy in women with
      multiple sclerosis who have been exposed to prolonged-release fampridine since the first day
      of their last menstrual period prior to conception or at any time during pregnancy.

      There are no mandatory physician visits. The registry will collect pregnancy outcome data
      from the participants health care provider during the prenatal follow up (6-7 months
      gestation), pregnancy outcome (4 weeks after estimated delivery date) and finally the
      pediatric follow up (at 4 weeks and 12 weeks post birth).

        The study population will be pregnant female participants with multiple sclerosis who have
        been exposed to prolonged release fampridine since the first day of the last menstrual
        period or at any time during pregnancy. This information will be from ongoing fampridine
        clinical studies or the post-marketing setting. The outcome of the pregnancy must not be
        known at the time of report.
