  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Use of human unacylated ghrelin (UAG, also called des-octanoyl ghrelin) to study physiology
      in healthy subjects. The proposed research is an investigator-initiated study funded by the
      National Institutes of Health designed to examine the effect of physiologic levels of UAG on
      the regulation of glucose homeostasis as well as beta cell function.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>acute insulin release (AIRg)</measure>
    <time_frame>one year</time_frame>
    <description>The primary outcome measure will be AIRg. This is calculated as the incremental insulin release,following IV glucose administration. (For the first ten minutes of the study visit.)</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Insulin sensitivity</measure>
    <time_frame>one year</time_frame>
    <description>1. Insulin sensitivity is quantified as the insulin sensitivity index (SI) using Bergman's minimal model of glucose kinetics from the glucose and insulin results obtained from a FSIGT.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Disposition index</measure>
    <time_frame>one year</time_frame>
    <description>2. The disposition index (DI) is a measure of β-cell function. It accounts for the modulating effect of insulin sensitivity on β-cell responses. It is calculated as the product of the SI and AIRg</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>glucose tolerance</measure>
    <time_frame>one year</time_frame>
    <description>3. Glucose tolerance is measured by glucose disappearance constant. This is calculated as the slope of the natural log of glucose during the study visit, during a set time frame.</description>
