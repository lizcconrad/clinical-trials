      Obesity and Overweight had become the number 1 health concern of the modern world. Over 1
      Billion people worldwide are overweight or obese. Those who suffer from overweight or obesity
      are exposed to other severe illnesses such as: diabetes, cardiovascular disease and cancer.

      Only few drugs and surgeries are currently available as approved treatments for those who
      wish to reduce weight.

      The purpose of this study is to determine whether the SD unique medical device, is effective
      in treatment of overweight and obesity.

    <description>The participants in the study receive basic nutrition guidance by MD and clinical dietician and make daily use of the device under study (called SD). During the 13 weeks study period, the participants get to meet clinical dietician/MD once in every 2 weeks for guidance and supervision and for on -going monitoring of physical parameters such as body weight and waist circumference.
The use of the SD device is done by study participants during the day every day throughout the study period. The device under study can be easily used by the participants themselves in their regular environment and does not require professional assistance.
The device under study is expected to affects the satiety, energy homeostasis and metabolic control centers in the brain and by that to reduce food intake and lead to weight loss.
The device under study is a device- not a medication and not a surgical procedure, and it does not involve any of such elements.</description>
