  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Studies showed that infusion or injection of drugs and fluids results in introduction of
      microparticles into the bloodstream. These microparticles may cause organ damage and
      stimulate the immune system thus aggravating the underlying disease. Given that critically
      ill patients are characteristically suffering from a high disease severity and receive large
      amounts of fluids and drugs, they may be at particular risk of harm by these microparticles.
      In-line microfilters have been shown to clear microparticles from intravenous drugs and
      solutions. The investigators hypothesize that use of in-line microfilters reduce the days
      with the systemic inflammatory response syndrome in adult critically ill patients.
