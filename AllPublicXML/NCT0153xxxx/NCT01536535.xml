  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multi-center, open-label study to determine the safety and effectiveness (how well
      it works) of two standardized treatments called &quot;mesalamine&quot; (Pentasa®) and &quot;prednisone&quot; in
      children with newly diagnosed UC. Standardized treatments are types of treatments agreed upon
      and used by many qualified doctors. The medications being used in this study are considered
      &quot;standard of care&quot;. Currently the ways in which these medicines are used (doses, frequency of
      dosing) may vary from site to site. This study will determine response to a standardized way
      of giving these medicines.

      This study will also identify biomarkers for ulcerative colitis. Biomarkers are things that
      doctors can find in blood, stool, or bowel tissue that indicate how much inflammation there
      is in the bowel, how the inflammation is produced, and whether the inflammation is responding
      to treatment. Collecting response and remission (free of symptoms) information on these
      standardized treatments and the &quot;biomarkers&quot; can possibly help doctors create a model, or
      plan to know which children with UC may respond quickly, or which children may develop
      complications.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Ulcerative Colitis (UC) denotes a phenotype of chronic inflammatory bowel disease (IBD),
      where inflammation is localized to the colonic mucosa, and extends from the rectum proximally
      in varying extents. The disorder is thought to result from an inappropriate activation of the
      mucosal immune system by antigens derived from both the host epithelium and the enteric
      flora, in genetically susceptible individuals. UC is strikingly heterogeneous with respect to
      age of onset, anatomical extent and disease course, with some experiencing chronically active
      severe disease, while others have intermittent periods of clinical remission and disease
      exacerbation. Patients' therapeutic responses vary. The reasons underlying such variability
      are not well understood. Although it has been widely hypothesized that several genes may
      influence the development of UC, and modify its phenotypic expression and severity, to date
      there are few confirmed examples of such relationships.

      It has been postulated that the 5-aminosalicylate drugs exert their anti-inflammatory effect
      locally at the intestinal mucosa. Mechanisms likely include inhibition of 5-lipoxygenase
      resulting in decreased production of leukotriene B4, scavenging of reactive oxygen
      metabolites, prevention of up-regulation of leukocyte adhesion molecules, and inhibition of
      IL-1 synthesis. Though multiple studies have shown the efficacy of aminosalicylates in
      inducing and maintaining remission in adults with UC, there are few data in children.

      Corticosteroids have been the mainstay of treatment of severe UC since efficacy was first
      demonstrated in the 1955 randomized controlled trial by Truelove and Witts. Recent practice
      guidelines developed in adults support their use because of rapid onset of action and
      significant efficacy though CS dependency is noted. Though no controlled data on their use
      have been reported in children they are frequently used in this population. A recent report
      from investigators leading the prospective Pediatric IBD Collaborative Research Group
      Registry described 97 subjects with a diagnosis of UC and a minimum of 1 year follow-up; 79%
      received CS. At diagnosis 81% of CS treated patients had moderate/severe disease, and 81% had
      pancolitis. Clinically inactive disease, determined by physician global assessment, was noted
      in 60% at 3 months following CS therapy, but by one year 45% were considered CS dependent
      despite the frequent use of IM. Among those children with initially moderate to severe
      disease in clinical remission at 3 months, about two-thirds had stopped the CS by one year.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Age ≥ 4years and ≤17 years at initiation of therapy (achieved 4th birthday, not yet
             18th)

          -  Weight ≥15 kg

          -  New diagnosis of ulcerative colitis established by standard clinical, endoscopic, and
             histologic features at the PROTECT study site

          -  Colitis extending beyond the rectosigmoid (Paris classification E2, E3, or E4)[144].
             If a patient is seriously ill and the clinician does not advance the colonoscope
             beyond the sigmoid colon but the clinical condition of the patient highly suggests
             more extensive disease then that patient is eligible for study.

          -  Disease activity by PUCAI of ≥10 at diagnosis

          -  No therapy previously initiated to treat the newly diagnosed ulcerative colitis

          -  Stool culture negative for routine enteric pathogens (Salmonella, Shigella,
             Campylobacter, E. coli 0157:H7) and Clostridium difficile toxin. Recent successful
             treatment for Clostridium difficile does not exclude a patient if toxin now absent.
             However, the patient must be a minimum of 5 weeks from the time treatment was started
             at the time toxin is absent.

          -  Stool study negative for enteric parasites (ova and parasites)

          -  Parent/guardian consent and patient assent

          -  Ability to remain in follow-up for a minimum of one year from diagnosis

          -  Female patients of child bearing age must have a negative urine pregnancy test and
             practice acceptable contraception (e.g., abstinence, intramuscular or hormonal
             contraception, two barrier methods (e.g., condom, diaphragm, or spermicide),
             intrauterine device, verbal report of the partner with history of vasectomy, or be
             surgically sterile). All female patients of childbearing potential (post-menarche)
             will undergo urine pregnancy testing at screening and must not be lactating.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Clinical, endoscopic, radiologic, or histologic evidence suggesting CD consistent with
             Paris and NASPGHAN criteria[144, 145]

          -  A previous diagnosis of inflammatory bowel disease for which treatment was given

          -  Evidence of any active enteric infection at the time of study entryUse of any oral CS
             for non-gastrointestinal indication within the past 4 weeks (e.g., asthma). Use of
             inhaled CS does not exclude a patient.

          -  History of use of IM or anti-TNFα agent for other medical conditions (e.g., juvenile
             rheumatoid arthritis) within the past 6 months

          -  Use of Accutane within the past 4 weeks

          -  Use of any investigational drug within the past four weeks

          -  Use of any 5-aminosalicylate within the past 4 weeks

          -  Pregnancy

          -  Subjects with poorly controlled medical conditions (e.g. diabetes, congestive heart
             failure)

          -  Proctitis or proctosigmoiditis only (Paris classification E1) on colonoscopic
             evaluation

          -  Chronic renal disease (BUN and serum creatinine &gt;1.5 times the upper normal limit)

          -  Hepatic disease (AST or ALP greater than 3 times the upper normal limit in the absence
             of concomitant liver disease associated with IBD following full evaluation)

          -  History of allergy or hypersensitivity to salicylates, aminosalicylates, or any
             component of the Pentasa capsule.

          -  History of coexisting chronic illness or evidence of significant organic or
             psychiatric disease on medical history or physical examination, which, in the
             Investigator's opinion, would prevent participation in the study

          -  History or presence of any condition causing malabsorption or an effect on
             gastrointestinal (GI) motility, or history of extensive small bowel resection (greater
             than half the length of the small intestine).

          -  The finding of Helicobacter pylori at the time of evaluation does not exclude the
             patient from the study. Whether to treat this patient for Helicobacter pylori and when
             will be left to the discretion of the site.
