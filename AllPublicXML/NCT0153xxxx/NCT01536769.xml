  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The cause of Parkinson's disease (PD) is unknown and a reliable biomarker to identify PD
      patients as early as possible is urgently needed. Nerve cells near the nose and in the gut
      become first affected in PD and patients frequently suffer from loss of smell and
      constipation. The nose and gut harbor very high amounts of bacteria that influence our body
      functions in many ways, even in the brain. The investigators are examining a possible role of
      bacteria of the nose and gut in the pathogenesis of PD. This may lead to a better
      understanding of what PD causes and may open new possibilities for diagnosis and treatment.

      The investigators will recruit 100 PD patients and 100 control subjects. The investigators
      will characterize all subjects carefully with respect to clinical symptoms. The investigators
      will collect bacterial samples from the nose, mouth and stool of these subjects. Using modern
      genomic techniques the investigators will read out the genetic code of all bacteria contained
      in these samples and will be able to identify which species of bacteria are present in the
      samples. Using complex cluster computing the investigators will compare the pattern of
      bacterial species between PD patients and controls and look for specific abnormalities in PD
      patients.

      If the investigators can detect specific differences of bacterial communities between PD
      patients and controls this may point to a role of bacteria as a cause of PD. Since there are
      many ways to influence bacterial communities pharmacologically (antibiotics, probiotics) it
      will be possible to investigate whether these therapies could alleviate or even reverse PD
      symptoms. Furthermore, the investigators would be able to use these differences as a
      biomarker which would enable us to develop a quick screening test for bacterial samples that
      may reveal whether a person has PD or not.

      By doing this study the investigators will learn whether bacteria play a role in the
      development of PD and whether the investigators can use them as a biomarker or therapeutic
      target. So hopefully the investigators will be able in the future to better understand what
      causes PD, how the investigators can diagnose it as early as possible and how to cure
      patients from PD.
