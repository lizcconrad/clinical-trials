  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with axillary osmidrosis are treated with minimally invasive procedure combined
      tumescent liposuction with Subcutaneous Pruning. Effectiveness of this modified method in
      reducing odor is to be determined.

      Patients with excessive malodor are recruited. They are surgically treated with minimally
      invasive procedure combined tumescent liposuction with Subcutaneous Pruning and followed up
      for 6-24 months to evaluate effectiveness sand side effect.
