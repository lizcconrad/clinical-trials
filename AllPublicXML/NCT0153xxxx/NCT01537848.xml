  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a retrospective study of a single center on endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) guided
      transmural drainage of post-operative collections during a 9 years period.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      All patients who underwent a EUS guided drainage of post-operative collection between 2002
      and 2011 in the endoscopy unit of Erasme hospital will be included for analysis. The study
      will focus on retrospective analysis of prospectively collected data. The technique is the
      same as the one used for pancreatic pseudocysts drainage. The technical success is defined as
      the ability to access and drain the collection by placement of transmural drain and/or
      stents. Treatment success (regression of collection) is defined as the resolution of the
      collection as shown on abdominal imaging (CT or MRI) in association with clinical resolution
      of symptoms at 8 weeks of follow-up.

    <description>Puncture of the collection is done under EUS guidance using a linear echoendoscope (FG-3830UT, Pentax or Olympus GF-UCT140/180 or forward viewing scope (Olympus)) with a 19G echoTip needle or a cystotome (Cook Medical Inc.). Then a 0.035 guidewire is inserted in the collection and the hole is enlarged with a cystotome (Cook Medical) or a 6.5F diathermic sleeve (Endoflex) and sometimes if needed a 6-8mm CRE balloon (Boston Scientific) before stenting with one or two double pigtail plastic stents (Cook Endoscopy, Endoflex). A nasocystic drain was also put whenever needed. If only a single stent could be placed in the first attempt, a subsequent procedure is scheduled for insertion of additional stents after dilation of the tract. There isn't any specific drug given during the procedure.</description>
