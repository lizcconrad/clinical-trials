  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to evaluate whether the use of prochlorperazine and ketorolac in
      combination lead in a larger reduction in pain score compared to prochlorperazine alone when
      treating pediatric migraine in the Emergency Department (ED). Our hypothesis is that this
      combination of medications treats not only the pain but also the associated gastrointestinal
      symptoms of migraine. The main outcome of this study is the reduction in the patient's pain
      score at 60 minutes from administration of the study medications. Secondary outcomes include
      the number of patients achieving complete resolution of the headache while in the ED, the
      number of patients requiring additional treatment interventions by the treating physician,
      the number of patients with resolution of the associated symptoms like nausea, vomiting,
      photophobia and phonophobia, the recurrence of headache in the 48-72 hours after discharge,
      and side effects of the medications.
