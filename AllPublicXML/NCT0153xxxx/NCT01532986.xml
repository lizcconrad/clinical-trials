  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Health care benefits and services are received through the Veterans Health Administration
      (VHA), a component of the United States Department of Veterans Affairs. Over 40,000 Veterans
      across the Veterans Health Administration are diagnosed with Parkinson's disease (PD), a
      chronic condition that affects motor function as well as cognition, mood, sleep, and
      autonomic function. There are not enough subspecialists to manage every Veteran with
      Parkinson's disease. However, a care model of nurse care managers as catalysts and advocates
      using needs assessments, evidence-based protocols, and VHA and community access coordination
      mechanisms to optimize Parkinson's disease care may improve quality of Parkinson's disease
      care and patient-centered outcomes. If efficacious, this model may be practical to
      disseminate via an existing VHA national consortium network for Parkinson's disease.

      Objectives are (1) to implement then analyze via a randomized controlled trial whether a
      nurse-led, coordinated care management intervention, Care Coordination for Health Promotion
      and Activities in Parkinson's Disease (CHAPS), compared to usual care will improve adherence
      to evidence-based practice guidelines and improve health outcomes in Veterans with
      Parkinson's disease in a region of the southwest United States, and (2) to analyze extent of
      implementation of the CHAPS intervention and its costs to determine how the intervention can
      be made sustainable and disseminated throughout Veterans Affairs Medical Centers if
      efficacious.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In a 5-year randomized controlled trial, we enrolled 345 Veterans with PD that were then
      randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive up to 24 months of a PD care management program, &quot;Care
      Coordination for Health Promotion and Activities in Parkinson's Disease&quot; (CHAPS), or continue
      with usual care. Eligible participants across 5 sites of the Southwest Parkinson's Disease
      Research, Education and Clinical Center (SW PADRECC): Greater Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Loma
      Linda, Long Beach and San Diego VISN 22 (VA Desert Pacific Healthcare Network) facilities
      were identified through administrative data and vetted by physicians. The multi-faceted
      nurse-led intervention, CHAPS, incorporated PD quality improvement (QI) tools to enhance
      proactive Veteran-centered care delivery. PDQI tools included: (1) a structured telephone
      assessment administered by a nurse care manager (NCM) to proactively identify medical
      problems and unmet needs; (2) problem-specific evidence-based interventions organized into
      treatment plans including follow-up/monitoring protocols with VA and community linkages; (3)
      the Siebens Domain Management ModelTM, a structural approach to improve collection and
      organization of health information and enrich communication among providers; (4) Siebens
      Health Care Notebooks prepared with Veteran self-management materials; (5) a Microsoft Access
      care management database, containing the CHAPS Assessment and algorithms for problem
      identification based on Veteran data; and (6) decision-support meetings of NCMs with movement
      disorder specialists. Research interviewers administer a structured telephone survey at
      baseline, 6, 12, 18, and 24 months. Participants were provided $25 per survey. Medical
      records were abstracted.

      Ongoing analyses (1) measure PD quality indicator adherence, health outcomes, and health
      service utilization; (2) evaluate qualitative and quantitative data to summarize the extent
      of intervention implementation and barriers and facilitators to potential dissemination; and
      (3) examine costs of CHAPS care and cost offset between randomization arms to provide new
      knowledge to aid in future dissemination of the CHAPS Program in a &quot;National Rollout&quot;
      according to the VA Quality Enhancement Research Initiative QUERI process.

    <time_frame>18 months</time_frame>
    <description>Guidelines for Parkinson's disease (PD) care are measureable, evidence-based indicators of PD care offered/delivered to patients. Guideline adherence is expressed as the mean across the study participant group of the per-patient percentage of applicable guideline measures for which there was adherence. (An applicable PD guideline is one for which a participant is eligible).</description>

    <measure>Health Utilities Index (HUI)</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months, 12 months and 18 months</time_frame>
    <description>The Health Utilities Index (HUI) has been used in many clinical studies covering a wide range of health problems. HUI questionnaires are effective tools used to measure health status, report health-related quality of life (HRQL), and produce utility scores (ranging from 0=death to 1= perfect health) that can be used in formal cost-effectiveness analyses. The HUI provides comprehensive, reliable and valid measures of health status and HRQL.</description>

    <description>General Self-Efficacy Scale (GSES) The GSES is a 10-item scale that assesses perceived self-efficacy (i.e. the belief that one's actions are responsible for successful outcomes) regarding coping and adaptation abilities in both daily activities and isolated stressful events. The scaled score for each question ranges from 1 to 4. Higher scores indicate that the patient demonstrates a stronger belief in self efficacy. The GSES has been tested in a wide age range and among various chronic disease populations such as Parkinson's.</description>

    <description>The PHQ-9 is the nine item depression scale of the Patient Health Questionnaire which measures depressive symptoms over the previous 2 weeks. The PHQ-9 incorporates DSM-IV depression diagnostic criteria with other major depressive symptoms into a brief self report tool. There are two components of the PHQ-9; assessing symptoms and functional impairment to make an initial depression diagnosis and obtaining a severity score to help select and monitor treatment. The PHQ-9 performed comparably to the Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS) in identifying depression among primary care elderly.</description>

    <description>The Consumer Assessment of Health Plans (CAHPS) is a standardized survey that asks consumers and patients to report on and evaluate their experiences with health care. The survey covers topics that are important to consumers, such as the communication skills of providers and the accessibility of services. A subset and adaptation of items from this survey will be used to determine if health care experiences change throughout the intervention.</description>

    <description>The Patient Assessment of Care for Chronic Conditions (PACIC) is a 20-item survey that measures specific actions or qualities of care that patients report they have experienced in health care delivery. The tool provides a consumer assessment of important aspects of care for chronic illness patients. The survey is divided into five subscales: patient activation, delivery system design/decision support, goal setting, problem solving/contextual counseling and follow-up/coordination. The overall PACIC is scored by averaging scores across all 20 items.</description>
