  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of two different
      interventions aimed at improving health outcomes among patients with chronic kidney disease
      (CKD), who are at high risk of CKD progression. Specifically, this study will examine how
      best to implement a provider-level intervention (access to a CKD-registry) and a
      patient-oriented intervention (automated telephone self-management (ATSM) + health coach) on
      patient health outcomes, with a 2x2 factorial design.

    <description>Primary care providers (PCPs) will have access to a Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) registry for patient care. The registry will:
identify patients with CKD
notify PCPs of a patients' CKD status
provide PCP outreach with NKDEP guidelines and patient educational materials</description>

    <description>Patients with CKD will participate in an Automated Telephone Self Management (ATSM) program, which blends automated phone calls with live targeted call-backs from a health coach. Patients will receive bi-weekly automated calls for 52 weeks in their native language, consisting of pre-recorded queries pertaining to CKD management, preventive services, and lifestyle changes. Patients will interact with the system using a touch-tone keypad; Out-of-range values or invalid responses will prompt a live call-back within 24-48 hours by a health coach.</description>
