  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This prospective observational study will evaluate the efficacy and safety of Tarceva
      (erlotinib) in elderly patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) after
      failure of at least one prior chemotherapy regimen. Data of patients treated with Tarceva in
      routine clinical practice will be collected for 1 year.

    <description>Overall survival was defined as the time from the date of first medication to the date of death from any cause. If death was not observed during the study, survival time was censored at the last day of observation (latest at the end of study after one year). Overall percentage of participants who were alive 1 year after study treatment and those based on the factor of age (65-69, 70-74, 75-79, ≥ 80 years) were reported.</description>

    <description>Response rate was observed during the treatment period according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST). It consisted of CR, PR, SD and progressive disease (PD). Participants with CR, PR and SD were reported. CR: disappearance of all target lesions (TLs) and non-TLs, with any pathological lymph nodes (whether target or non-target) having a reduction in short axis to less than 10 millimeters (mm). PR: at least a 30 percent (%) decrease in the sum of diameters of TLs, taking as reference the baseline (BL) sum diameters. SD was defined as neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR, nor sufficient increase to qualify for PD, taking as reference the smallest sum diameters while on study. PD: at least 20% increase in the sum of diameters of TLs, taking as a reference the smallest sum on study (this included the BL sum if that was the smallest on study). In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum also demonstrated an absolute increase of at least 5 mm.</description>

        <description>Response rate was observed during the treatment period according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST). It consisted of CR, PR, SD and progressive disease (PD). Participants with CR, PR and SD were reported. CR: disappearance of all target lesions (TLs) and non-TLs, with any pathological lymph nodes (whether target or non-target) having a reduction in short axis to less than 10 millimeters (mm). PR: at least a 30 percent (%) decrease in the sum of diameters of TLs, taking as reference the baseline (BL) sum diameters. SD was defined as neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR, nor sufficient increase to qualify for PD, taking as reference the smallest sum diameters while on study. PD: at least 20% increase in the sum of diameters of TLs, taking as a reference the smallest sum on study (this included the BL sum if that was the smallest on study). In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum also demonstrated an absolute increase of at least 5 mm.</description>

          <title>Median Progression Free Survival: Best Response to Prior Chemotherapy</title>
          <description>Progression-free survival time was defined as the time from the date of first medication to the date of disease progression or death from any cause. If neither progression nor death was observed during the study, PFS time was censored at the last day of observation. PD was at least a 20% increase in the sum of diameters of TLs, taking as a reference the smallest sum on study (this included the BL sum if that was the smallest on study). In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum must also have demonstrated an absolute increase of at least 5 mm.</description>
