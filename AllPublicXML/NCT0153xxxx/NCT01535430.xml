      Purpose of the study:

      AIM 1 Prospectively collect pre-operative (fMRI, DTI, MEG) and intra-operative mapping data
      in patients with intra-axial brain tumors to assess how well each modality predicts the
      location of eloquent brain function. In addition, each modality will be compared with the
      other.

      AIM 2 Assess reorganization of eloquent brain function and plasticity in patients with
      intra-axial brain tumors. This will be accomplished by prospectively collecting
      post-operative mapping studies and neuropsychological tests to compare them to prior mapping
      studies as stated above.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Any patient with a primary or metastatic brain tumor in or near an eloquent area would be
      eligible for participation in the study assuming no contraindications to any of the studies
      or operative procedure.

      Pre-operative:

      Evaluation will include clinical evaluation, neuropsychological testing, MRI brain with and
      without contrast, fMRI, DTI tractograms, and MEG studies as well as standard pre-operative
      work-up.

      Intra-operative:

      All non-invasive pre-operative mapping data will be incorporated into the operative procedure
      with the imaging tools that we routinely use during neurosurgical procedures. Patients will
      have awake mapping performed. Our usual standards of care will be followed during craniotomy,
      mapping, and tumor resection or biopsy.

      Post-operative:

      Patients will have routine post-operative care and assessment consisting of clinical
      examinations and imaging obtained within 24 hours post resection. They will have routine
      follow-up outpatient appointments after surgery which will include neurologic assessment and
      follow-up imaging (MRI with and without contrast) for their tumors as appropriate. The
      experimental portion of the protocol is incorporating repeat neuropsychological testing and
      mapping studies (fMRI, DTI, MEG) studies at 2 and 6 months post-surgery into their routine
      follow-up.

    <description>The location of the eloquent function of interest (motor, sensory, speech) will be assessed pre-operatively and intra-operatively. These will be compared. Then, at 2 and 6 months post-operatively, repeat non-invasive mapping studies will be performed to compare to the subjects' prior studies. This will allow for assessment of reorganization and plasticity of function.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients 19 years and older.

          2. Brain tumor in or near eloquent brain regions that is appropriate for attempted
             resection.

          3. Appropriate body habitus and mental status/capacity to participate with non-invasive
             or invasive mapping.

          4. Benign or malignant intra-axial brain tumor.

          5. Primary or metastatic intra-axial brain tumor.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Any patient with a contraindication to MRI (i.e. implanted devices)

          2. Inappropriate body habitus or mental status/capacity to participate with non-invasive
             or invasive mapping in a safe and reliable manner.

          3. Patient declines to participate.

          4. Patient that does not have the capacity to understand the study or consent for
             themselves.

          5. Neurologic status which precludes them from testing (poor function- not testable).

          6. Positive pregnancy test in females.

          7. Any patient with end stage renal disease or severe renal dysfunction.
