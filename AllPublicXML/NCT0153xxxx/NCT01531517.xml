      Clinical Trial Phase III-b

      Study Sponsor:

      European Egyptian Pharmaceutical Industries

      Sample Size:

      120 patients (60 per arm)

      Study Population:

      Patients with Diabetic foot ulcer of any stage after proper surgical treatment - if needed.
      Those patients will be recruited from patients attending the Diabetic foot Center at Faculty
      of Medicine - Alexandria University and the outpatient clinic at Faculty of Medicine, Cairo
      University.

      Recruitment Period: 9 months

      Dose application: thick layer of 2-3 mm applied to the dressing then dressing applied to the
      ulcer.

      Endpoints: Complete healing of the ulcer OR 5 months of application of the ointment whichever
      comes first

      Study Design:

      This is an open label randomized non-placebo study in which 120 subjects will be randomly
      allocated to treatment with PedyPhar ointment or Panthenol ointment for their diabetic foot
      ulcer. Treatment with the ointment will be preceded by appropriate surgical treatment to
      remove necrotic tissue as indicated by a surgeon for foot ulcer Wagner stages 3-5. Also,
      diabetic status will be controlled as part of the study. Ointment in either arm will be
      applied to the ulcer for a maximum of 5 months or till complete healing whichever happens
      first.

      Patients will visit study center every 2 weeks where assessment of the ulcer will be done and
      patient will be given the ointment for the dressing enough for 2 weeks.

      Blood flow in the affected leg will be assessed besides kidney functions complete blood
      picture besides kidney functions. Diabetic status will be monitored every months and
      glycosylated hemoglobin will be done every 3 months

      Study Duration: 12 months

      Study Agent/Intervention Description: PEDYPHAR速 is a new patented local ointment composed of
      natural (Royal Jelly) and (Dexpanthenol) in an innovated, enriched alkaline ointment base.

      Dose application: thick layer of 2-3 mm applied to the dressing then dressing applied to the
      ulcer.
