  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pulmonary hypertension (PH) can be the result of various clinical conditions. It may be
      idiopathic or associated with various cardiovascular and lung disorders. Currently there is
      no test that can non-invasively detect abnormalities of the pulmonary circulation. There is a
      growing need for a non-invasive method to detect PH. There currently exists only ne agent
      approved in Canada for clinical imaging of the pulmonary circulation, 99mTc-labeled
      macroaggregates. This agent is exclusively used for the diagnosis of physical defects of the
      circulation due to pulmonary embolus. This agent is larger than small pulmonary vessels,
      limiting its sensitivity to detect small vascular defects, as well as potential infectious
      risks since albumin macroaggregates are derived from human albumin. There is need then for
      new lung tracers that could provide a greater safety profile while enabling functional as
      well as anatomical imaging of the pulmonary circulation. DFH-12 (PulmoBind) is a peptide
      derived from human adrenomedullin (hAMI-52). Hence the development of this novel AM
      derivative, PulmoBind, for molecular imaging of the pulmonary circulation. PulmoBind is
      labeled with 99mTc, the most commonly used imaging isotope in nuclear medicine.

    <description>To determine the optimal dose of Pulmobind by evaluating the safety and efficacy in three groups of subjects with 3 different doses of study drug; 5mCi, 10mCi, and 15 mCi.For safety evaluation we will provide pharmacokinetic and biodistribution data following injections of the 3 doses mentioned. Vital signs, hematology and biochemistry will also be captured for each of the doses up to 24 and 48 hours after injections of PulmoBind. Furthermore local and systemic reactions 24 hours and 48 hours after injections of PulmoBind will also be captured.</description>

    <description>DFH-12 (PulmoBind) is a peptide derived from human adrenomedullin (hAMI-52). Adrenomedullin (AM) is a 52-amino acid peptide produced by many tissues in the body, including the vascular endothelium. 3 radiolabeled doses of PulmoBind will be used in this study (5mCi, 10mCi and 15mCi) 5 healthy subjects per dose for the 5 mci and the 10 mci groups but 10 subjects will be used for the 15 mci group.</description>
