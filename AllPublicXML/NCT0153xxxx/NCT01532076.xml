  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Failure rates of up to 30% are reported after proximal humeral fractures despite
      angular-stable devices. This may devastate not only the functional outcome but also the
      independence of elderly patients.

      To increase bone mineral density and thereby holding-strength augmentation is an option.
      Autologous bone-graft, as current gold-standard, though is questionable in osteoporosis since
      osteoprogenitors are dysfunctional and the harvesting-morbidity considerable. Adipose tissue
      seems an alternative cell-source even in presence of osteoporosis.

      Stromal vascular fraction (SVF) cells isolated from lipoaspirates display osteogenic and
      vasculogenic potential and can be harvested in high numbers. Expansion associated with costly
      good-manufacturers-practice facilities is avoidable, so are repeated interventions. These
      cells have been successfully used to generate osteogenic composite grafts with intrinsic
      vascularity in preclinical models.

      For translation into clinical practice after a 20 patient external pilot a prospective
      randomized controlled trial with 270 patients is planned. For the trial lipoaspiration
      precedes open reduction and internal fixation in individuals over 60 years presenting with a
      proximal humeral fracture after low-energy trauma. Cells are isolated (Cellution®800/CRS) and
      wrapped around hydroxyapatite microgranules after embedding in a fibrin-gel for augmentation
      of the typical bone-void. Clinical/radiological follow-up is at 6 and 12 weeks for immediate
      complications and after 6, 9 and 12 months. Functional assessment is performed after 6 weeks,
      6 and 12 months using the Quick-Dash- and Constant-Score.

      The primary outcome is a reduction in secondary dislocation by 50% during the first
      postoperative year. Secondary dislocation is diagnosed on plain radiographs by an independent
      board certified radiologist specialised in musculoskeletal imaging if one or more of the
      following criteria are met:

        -  More than 20° varus collapse of the humeral head fragment in relation to the humeral
           shaft

        -  Screw penetration through the humeral head
