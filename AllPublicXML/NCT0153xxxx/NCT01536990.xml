      The purpose of this study was to investigate the reliability, construct validity, and
      sensitivity to change of the Lower Extremity Functional Scale (LEFS) in individuals affected
      by stroke. Patients were measured with the LEFS at the beginning and end of physical therapy
      treatment, or at 8 weeks of physical therapy treatment.
