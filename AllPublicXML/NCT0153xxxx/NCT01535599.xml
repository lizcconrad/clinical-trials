      The purpose of this study was to demonstrate the superiority of AL-60371, 0.3% Otic
      Suspension relative to AL-60371 Vehicle based on clinical cures at test-of-cure (TOC) for the
      treatment of acute otitis externa (AOE).

      Patients were evaluated for safety and efficacy during the visits conducted at Day 3
      (on-therapy), Day 8 (end-of-therapy), and Day 11 (TOC). Patients or parents/legal guardians
      completed a telephone diary twice daily to record assessments of ear pain, ear pain
      medication use, and the impact of ear pain on sleep and other daily activities.

    <measure>Proportion of Patients With Clinical Cures at the Day 11 (TOC) Visit</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 11</time_frame>
    <description>An otoscopic exam was conducted by the physician. Clinical cure was considered attained if the sum of the numerical scores of the 3 signs and symptoms of AOE (tenderness, erythema, and edema) was 0 at Day 11. In this analysis, the clinical cure outcome at Day 11 (TOC) was considered a failure for all pathogen positive patients who did not complete the study (for any reason). Proportion of patients is reported as a percentage.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Proportion of Patients With Microbiological Successes at the Day 11 (TOC) Visit</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 11</time_frame>
    <description>Microbiological success was considered attained if all pretherapy bacteria were absent from the exit otic specimen. The presence of fungi and/or yeast was not considered in the determination of microbiological success. In this analysis, the microbiological success value at Day 11 (TOC) was considered a failure for all pathogen positive patients who did not complete the study (for any reason). Proportion of patients is reported as a percentage.</description>

    <measure>Median Time to Cessation of Ear Pain as Reported by the Patient or Parent/Legal Guardian Via the Telephone Diary</measure>
    <time_frame>Time to event, up to Day 11</time_frame>
    <description>Cessation of ear pain was defined as occurring on the first time point that ear pain was absent (morning or evening) and did not return in any subsequent diary entries. Day 1 was the starting point for this time-to-event analysis. For this analysis, all patients who did not complete the study and ear pain never ceased had their ear pain considered as being present throughout the planned duration of the study.</description>

        <description>An otoscopic exam was conducted by the physician. Clinical cure was considered attained if the sum of the numerical scores of the 3 signs and symptoms of AOE (tenderness, erythema, and edema) was 0 at Day 11. In this analysis, the clinical cure outcome at Day 11 (TOC) was considered a failure for all pathogen positive patients who did not complete the study (for any reason). Proportion of patients is reported as a percentage.</description>
