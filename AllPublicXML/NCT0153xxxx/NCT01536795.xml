  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This Phase 2 study is to determine whether WR279396 with occlusion (a polyurethane dressing)
      is more effective than WR279396 without occlusion for once daily treatment.

      Extensive objective and subjective local tolerance data will also be captured during this
      trial, as well as surrogate markers (parasite loads and aminoglycosides concentration in the
      deep dermis) that may help to determine the optimal number and duration of treatments.

      The results from this study will help determine the most practical treatment schedule and
      will answer questions that are crucial to improve the present treatment regimen with WR279396
      which is twice a day for 20 days.

      Forty-eight patients (48) with Old World cutaneous leishmaniasis will be randomly allocated
      to WR279396 treatment once a day for 20 days with an optimized polyurethane dressing
      (occlusion) (24 patients), or without occlusion (24 patients). All patients will be rescued
      with the standard of care accepted in Tunisia, if the patient is not cured. The active
      ingredients of WR279396 are two aminoglycosides - paromomycin sulphate (15%) and gentamicin
      sulphate (0.5%) - in a base (AQIC).

      Each subject will be followed for clinical cure for 90 days after the initiation of
      treatment. Cure is defined as 100% reepithelialization without relapse by 3 months.

      Tolerance will be evaluated by local adverse reactions and by laboratory signs of systemic
      events.

      In addition to the clinical evaluation of the CL lesions, the following parameters/clinical
      healing surrogates will be investigated:

        1. parasite load will be determined in superficial and deep lesional dermis samples at D0
           and D10. The mean parasite reduction ratio (parasite load at D10/parasite load at D0) in
           each group will be compared;

        2. aminoglycoside concentrations in superficial and deep infiltrated dermis in each group
           will be compared.

    <description>Efficacy will be evaluated in terms of the number of lesions cured at D50 (D1 is the first day of treatment) with no relapse by Day 90. Complete clinical respoonse is defined as 100% re-epithelialization of the index lesion by Day 50 or a &gt; 50% re-epithelialization by Day 50 followed by complete re-epithelialization on or before Day 90, with no relapse ever having occurred from Day 50 through Day 90.</description>
