  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The effects of Lacosamide, an antiepileptic drug, on sleep have not been formally evaluated.
      The present study is being conducted to assess the effects of Lacosamide on sleep quality in
      healthy subjects.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In some patients with Epilepsy, seizure activity is associated with specific phases of
      sleep/wake cycle, and sleep deprivation is known to precipitate seizure activity. Inadequate
      or disturbed sleep and excessive daytime drowsiness is often reported by patients with
      Epilepsy due to the effects of seizures as well as antiepileptic drugs. Thus, the use of
      healthy subjects improves the certainty that any changes in sleep are related to the study
      drug and not other factors.

    <description>Lacosamide will be given orally in 50 mg tablets twice a day for 7 days. The dose will increase weekly by 100 mg per day to a target dose of 300 mg per day. Once the target dose of 300 mg per day has been achieved for 9 days, a 2-day tapering of Lacosamide will occur by 100 mg per day.</description>
