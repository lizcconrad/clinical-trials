  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Obesity is associated with reduced growth hormone (GH) secretion. GH secretion is regulated
      by nutritional stimuli including fasting, insulin, glucose and free fatty acids. However, the
      role of micronutrients, such as vitamins, on GH secretion has not been investigated in much
      detail. Vitamin C levels are also reduced in obesity, and the investigators recently
      demonstrated a possible role for dietary vitamin C intake in the regulation of GH secretion
      in two preliminary retrospective studies. The investigators therefore propose a more detailed
      prospective physiological study to examine the effects of increasing dietary vitamin C intake
      on GH secretion in a physiologic, intervention study. The investigators hypothesize that
      increasing vitamin C concentrations in obese subjects with sub-optimal plasma vitamin C
      levels and reduced GH secretion will increase GH secretion.
