    <measure>Change from baseline on ratings of the Modified Fatigue Impact Scale at post measure, 3, 6 &amp; 12 months follow up.</measure>
    <time_frame>5 time points at 0, 8, 20, 32 &amp; 60 weeks.</time_frame>
    <description>The Modified Fatigue Impact Scale (MFIS) consists of 21 items selected from the Fatigue Impact Scale (FIS; Fisk, Ritvo, Ross, Haase, Murray, &amp; Schlech, 1994), a multidimensional scale developed to assess the perceived impact of fatigue on a variety of daily activities. The items of the MFIS can be combined into three subscales (Physical, Cognitive, and Psychosocial), as well as into a total MFIS score. All items are scaled so that higher scores indicate a greater impact of fatigue on a patient's activities. Measures will be taken at 5 time points to assess change over time.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from baseline on the 36-Item Short Form Survey Instrument at post measure, 3, 6 and 12 months follow up.</measure>
    <time_frame>5 time points at 0, 8, 20, 32 &amp; 60 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>36-Item Short Form Survey Instrument (SF 36, Ware et al.1993) consists of 36 questions measuring functional health and well-being from the patient's point of view. Scores are split into two summary measures (physical health and mental health) and within the two summary measures there are eight scales which include. The eight scales are made up of; physical functioning, role limitations due to physical functioning, bodily pain, general health, vitality, social functioning, role limitations due to emotional functioning and mental health.</description>

    <measure>Change from baseline on the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale at post measure, 3, 6 and 12 months follow up.</measure>

  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from baseline on the Self-Efficacy for managing chronic Disease 6 Item Scale at post measure, 3, 6 and 12 months follow up.</measure>
    <time_frame>5 time points at 0, 8, 20, 32 &amp; 60 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Is a 6-item scale which is adapted from the original 33 item scale (Lorig et al. 1996). The 6-item scale was developed so it would be less burdensome for patients. The 6- item scale covers areas of symptom control, role function, emotional functioning and communicating with physicians.</description>
