  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to determine whether supplementation of glutamine and fish oil can
      improve peripheral skeletal muscle function and metabolism in patients with heart failure.
      The investigators propose a randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled study comparing the
      combined supplementation of fish oil and glutamine with placebo in patients with stable heart
      failure. 30 patients with heart failure will be randomized to either receiving 6.5 g fish
      oil/d and 8 g glutamine/d (n=15) or placebo (n=15) for 90 days. The primary outcome in this
      study is the change in muscle functional capacity measured as changes in maximum muscle
      strength and fatigability, peak VO2 and exercise time after supplementation. A secondary
      outcome is the measurement of systemic and local markers of inflammation.
