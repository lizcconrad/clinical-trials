    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to:

      -Determine the incidence of adverse events, preventable adverse events, and ameliorable
      adverse events, and the timeliness of post-discharge ambulatory appointments, affecting urban
      and rural patients approximately 3-4 weeks after discharge from a hospitalist-run medical
      service of a large community hospital to home.

      H1: The incidence of post-discharge adverse events will be higher in rural patients compared
      with urban patients discharged from a hospitalist-run medical service of a large community
      hospital.

      -Identify and classify the types of post-discharge adverse events (e.g., adverse drug events,
      procedure-related events, hospital acquired (nosocomial) infections, falls, and other)
      affecting urban and rural patients approximately 3-4 weeks after discharge from a
      hospitalist-run medical service of a large community hospital to home.

      H2: All patients will be at higher risk for adverse drug events than other types of adverse
      events.

      -Examine the relationships between the population at risk, characteristics of the health care
      delivery system, and the utilization of post-discharge health services, and how these
      relationships help us understand the incidence of post-discharge adverse events.

      H3: Several factors will be independently associated with the incidence of post-discharge
      adverse events in rural and urban patients, including patient comorbidity, severity of acute
      illness, presence of a primary care physician prior to hospitalization, and a scheduled
      timely post-discharge ambulatory follow-up appointment.

      This 24-month prospective cohort study will examine the frequency and types of adverse events
      experienced by patients 3-4 weeks after discharge from the Tallahassee Memorial Hospital
      (TMH), the timeliness of post-discharge ambulatory appointments, and identify the
      associations, if any, of readily available patient, system, and patient care factors with the
      occurrence of these post-discharge adverse events. Data collection will involve telephone
      interviews with patients, and review of inpatient and outpatient health records for services
      received, as necessary, within 3-4 weeks after discharge from the hospital. These data
      sources will allow study physicians to implicitly (with some explicit guidance) determine
      whether an adverse event has occurred, distinguish preventable from ameliorable adverse
      events, and determine the types of adverse events. In addition, the study will determine the
      timeliness of post-discharge ambulatory appointments by conducting post-discharge telephone
      interviews with patients and reviewing health records.

    <description>Patients are contacted 3-6 weeks after discharge for a phone interview. They are questioned about potential adverse events following their discharge from the hospital. Interviewers/nurses conduct a review of systems to determine if the patient experienced an adverse event. Potential cases are flagged on the basis of unexpected health care utilization, new/exacerbated symptoms and/or abnormal lab test results. Cases are reviewed by two independent physician reviewers to determine whether the adverse event was preventable, using their implicit judgment.</description>

        Our study population includes patients 21 and older living in Florida, who are discharged
        home from the TMH hospitalist service. Patients must have a phone number where they can be
        reached. They must also speak English or Spanish. Surrogates are permitted to complete an
        interview in the event that a patient is unable to complete it.

        Rural patients are those who live in counties where the population density is 100 people
        per square mile or less. Patients with diminished mental capacity are at increased risk of
        adverse events. These patients (or their surrogates) are included in the sample.
