      Objectives: This study compared the efficacy of eScreen in a two-armed randomized controlled
      design, measuring outcomes in terms of changes in problematic drug use up to one year after
      study recruitment. The eScreen brief Internet intervention for problematic alcohol and drug
      use offers self-screening, in-depth self-reporting, personalized feedback and treatment
      recommendations as well as an electronic diary. Progress over time is shown in diagrams
      detailing consumption levels.

      Method: Participants with only problematic drug use according to the Drug Use Disorders
      Identification Test (DUDIT),(DUDIT &gt;0 for both men and women) or both problematic alcohol use
      according to the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT), (AUDIT &gt;7 for men and
      AUDIT &gt;5 for women) and drug use were randomized to T1 (n=101) or the control group (n=101).
      Outcomes on alcohol and/or drug use as well as health-related symptoms were assessed after 3,
      6 and 12 months.

      Hypotheses that were tested in this study are 1) that both groups would reduce their drug
      consumption and drug-related problems at follow-ups compared to the baseline level and 2)
      that participants in the eScreen group would reduce their drug consumption and drug-related
      problems to a higher extent than participants in the control group (no intervention) at
      follow-ups.

      Background: The aim of this study is to investigate the effects of an Internet-based
      screening and brief intervention (SBI) site for problematic alcohol and drug use among
      illicit drug users.

      Method: Individuals searching for information about alcohol or drugs online who scored over 0
      on the Drug Use Disorders Identiﬁcation Test (DUDIT) and were 15 years or older were
      recruited for this trial and randomized into one group receiving Internet-based screening and
      brief intervention via eScreen.se(n = 101) or one assessment-only control group (n = 101).
      Both groups were screened at baseline and followed up at 3 and 6 months. The primary outcome
      measure was the DUDIT-C score and secondary outcome measures were DUDIT, AUDIT-C (Alcohol Use
      Disorders Identiﬁcation Test-C) and AUDIT scores.Additional outcomes included the proportion
      of drug abstainers and those who made a clinically signiﬁcant change in their alcohol and
      drug use. Four statistical models of analysis were used to conservatively assess results.

      Results: A signiﬁcant decrease in DUDIT-C scores at the 3-month follow-up occurred in both
      groups. Three out of four statistical models showed a larger decrease in the DUDIT score in
      the intervention group than in the control group (p = 0.006; p = 0.046; p = 0.001). Two
      models showed a continued decrease in AUDIT-Cand AUDIT scores also at the 6-month follow-up
      in the intervention group but not in the control group.No additional differences occurred.

      Conclusions: The results are inconclusive but provide some evidence that SBI sites such as
      eScreen.se could be effective for short-term reductions of problematic substance use.
