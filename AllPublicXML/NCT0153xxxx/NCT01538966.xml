  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study the investigators will evaluate whether combination low dose somatostatin
      receptor ligand (SRL) and weekly or daily Pegvisomant will attain equivalent control of serum
      IGF-1 levels, compared to combination high dose SRL and weekly Pegvisomant. Lower doses of
      therapy will greatly reduce cost of acromegaly therapy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will begin when the combination of Sandostatin LAR or Somatuline and pegvisomant is
      first administered. Study visits will occur every 4 weeks from the start of the study.
      However, for subjects who cannot make every study visit due to distance, the study team will
      facilitate monthly blood draws at their local Quest laboratory facility.

      After the 24 weeks of combination therapy, subjects with a controlled IGF-1 will then start
      Pegvisomant monotherapy at the same dose that they attained normalization in combination
      therapy. IGF-1 levels, liver function test, and blood glucose will be performed monthly. An
      MRI will be performed at the conclusion of the 48 week treatment period.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Newly diagnosed patients with acromegaly who have not had surgery or medical therapy

          -  Acromegaly patients who are at least 3 months post surgery, who are/are not receiving
             adjuvant medical therapy

          -  Acromegaly patients on SRL monotherapy with normal or elevated IGF-1 levels

          -  Acromegaly patients on Pegvisomant monotherapy with normal or elevated IGF-1 levels.

          -  Acromegaly patients who have received SRL and dopamine agonist therapy, after a 6 week
             washout period of the dopamine agonist.

          -  Acromegaly patients on combination therapy with maximum doses of SRL and Pegvisomant

             aminotransferase (AST) and/or alanine aminotransferase (ALT) above 3 times the upper
             limit of normal at the baseline visit.

          -  The patient had pituitary surgery within 3 months prior to study entry
