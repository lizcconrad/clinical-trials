  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Over half of all Americans take dietary supplements (vitamins, minerals, herbal products)
      along with their prescription medications. With the economic downturn, dietary supplement
      sales have surged, perhaps as a result of people attempting to stave off or delay medical
      care. Supplements are generally thought to be harmless, but some can potentially interact
      with prescription medications, cause liver or kidney damage, and even adversely affect
      surgical outcomes. Those substituting dietary supplements for prescription medications also
      may suffer significant adverse consequences. The United States Food and Drug Administration
      and the Institute of Medicine recommend that patients considering dietary supplement use
      consult their providers. Unfortunately, patients fail to disclose dietary supplement use in
      up to two-thirds of outpatient office visits. To improve discussions, it is important to
      understand what prompts physicians and patients to communicate about dietary supplements.

      The overall objectives of this application are to understand how, when and why physicians and
      patients communicate about dietary supplements, and to assess how patients respond to these
      discussions. An ethnically diverse group of patients and their physicians will be surveyed
      and their office visits will be audio recorded. Audio recordings of the visits will be used
      to assess the relationship of patient and physician attitudes and values, and the
      physician-patient relationship on dietary supplement discussions. A subset of these patients
      and physicians will be interviewed to explore how they made decisions to initiate or forgo
      discussions about supplements. They also will be asked questions concerning the necessity of
      and responsibility for initiating dietary supplement conversations. Patient responses and
      reactions to actual discussions also will be explored. Data from observed and reported
      interactions will be compared to provide a deeper understanding of factors related to
      disclosure. This project aims to provide a broad understanding of the content of
      physician-patient discussions about dietary supplements, and to describe how and why
      physician and patient attitudes and opinions affect these discussions. Identification of
      mutable factors can result in interventions to increase communication about dietary
      supplements, help maintain patient safety, and promote appropriate use of supplements
      concurrent with prescription medications.
