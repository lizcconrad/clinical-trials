      -  Open-label, single-arm, phase II study of bevacizumab (AvastinTM) in combination with
           alternating Xeliri and Xelox as first-line treatment of patients with metastatic
           colorectal cancer.

        -  Primary objective: PFS, To assess overall resectability in patients with metastatic
           colorectal cancer, postoperative morbidity and outcomes after resection.

        -  Secondary objectives: To assess response rates according to RECIST criteria, failure
           free survival (TTF) and overall survival (OS), Quality of life according to 15D
           questionnaire, To radiologically assess tumour density and morphology, and assess
           alternative radiologic response evaluation in comparison with RECIST response criteria,
           Biomarker evaluation to measure plasma biomarkers, tumour blocks and DNA polymorphisms
           that may predict drug effects, safety, resectability and clinical behaviour of the
           tumour

             contraception up to at least 6 months after last treatment completion or the last drug
             dose, whatever happens first
