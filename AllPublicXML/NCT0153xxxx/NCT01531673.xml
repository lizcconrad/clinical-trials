  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety, efficacy, pharmacokinetics (PK), and
      pharmacodynamics (PD) effects of VX-661 alone and when coadministered with ivacaftor in
      participants with cystic fibrosis (CF) who are homozygous or heterozygous for the
      F508del-CFTR mutation.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 2, randomized, multicenter, double-blinded, placebo-controlled, study of
      VX-661 monotherapy, and VX-661/ivacaftor co-therapy in participants with CF who are
      homozygous or heterozygous for the F508del CFTR mutation.

      This study is separated into seven groups: Group 1-7, respectively. Approximately 180
      participants were randomized in a ratio of 4:1; active drug to matching placebo in each
      group.

    <measure>Safety as Determined by Adverse Events (AEs)</measure>
    <time_frame>Start of study drug through the Follow-up Visit (Up to Day 56)</time_frame>
    <description>An AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a participant during the study; the event does not necessarily have a causal relationship with the treatment. This includes any newly occurring event or previous condition that has increased in severity or frequency after the Informed Consent Form is signed. AE includes serious as well as non-serious AEs. Serious Adverse Event (SAE) is any AE that results in any of the following: death; life-threatening condition; inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization; persistent or significant disability or incapacity; congenital anomaly or birth defect; or other important medical event. Treatment-emergent adverse events are defined as adverse events that were reported or worsened on or after start of study drug through the Follow-up Visit (28 days after last dose of study drug) or premature discontinuation.</description>

        <title>Safety as Determined by Adverse Events (AEs)</title>
        <description>An AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a participant during the study; the event does not necessarily have a causal relationship with the treatment. This includes any newly occurring event or previous condition that has increased in severity or frequency after the Informed Consent Form is signed. AE includes serious as well as non-serious AEs. Serious Adverse Event (SAE) is any AE that results in any of the following: death; life-threatening condition; inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization; persistent or significant disability or incapacity; congenital anomaly or birth defect; or other important medical event. Treatment-emergent adverse events are defined as adverse events that were reported or worsened on or after start of study drug through the Follow-up Visit (28 days after last dose of study drug) or premature discontinuation.</description>

        <population>Analysis was done using safety set which included all participants who received at least 1 dose of study drug.</population>

          <title>Safety as Determined by Adverse Events (AEs)</title>
          <description>An AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a participant during the study; the event does not necessarily have a causal relationship with the treatment. This includes any newly occurring event or previous condition that has increased in severity or frequency after the Informed Consent Form is signed. AE includes serious as well as non-serious AEs. Serious Adverse Event (SAE) is any AE that results in any of the following: death; life-threatening condition; inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization; persistent or significant disability or incapacity; congenital anomaly or birth defect; or other important medical event. Treatment-emergent adverse events are defined as adverse events that were reported or worsened on or after start of study drug through the Follow-up Visit (28 days after last dose of study drug) or premature discontinuation.</description>
          <population>Analysis was done using safety set which included all participants who received at least 1 dose of study drug.</population>

Respiratory domain assessed respiratory symptoms (for example, coughing, congestion, wheezing), score range: 0-100; higher scores indicating fewer symptoms and better health-related quality of life.</description>

          <title>Change in Cystic Fibrosis Questionnaire-Revised (CFQ-R) Respiratory Domain Score From Baseline to Each Visit and From Baseline Through Study Day 28 for Group 7</title>
          <description>The CFQ-R is a validated participant-reported outcome measuring health-related quality of life for participants with cystic fibrosis. Respiratory domain assessed respiratory symptoms (for example, coughing, congestion, wheezing), score range: 0-100; higher scores indicating fewer symptoms and better health-related quality of life.</description>
          <population>The analysis was done using FAS which included all randomized participants who received at least 1 dose of study drug. Here, 'Number Analyzed' = those participants who were evaluable at the specified time points for each group, respectively.</population>
