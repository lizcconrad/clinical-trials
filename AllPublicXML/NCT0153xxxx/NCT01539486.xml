    <textblock>
      The intent for this study is to do a retrospective chart review of all patients who have
      undergone minimally invasive parathyroidectomy for primary hyperthyroidism. All data
      collected will be recorded under assigned identification numbers that will have no
      association with medical record or hospital numbers. Identifying characteristics will include
      age and sex. Anonymity will be upheld. The patient/family will not be contacted directly. All
      information will be obtained from the medical chart. Demographics, location, preoperative PTH
      levels and intraoperative Ex-Vivo gamma counts, co-morbid conditions, and the outcome based
      on the hospital notes will be obtained from patients' charts and will be transferred to a
      secure database. It is our hypothesis that there is a linear relationship between immediate
      preoperative parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels and Ex-Vivo gamma counts and the aim of this
      study is to better describe this relationship.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients must be between the ages of 18 and 90 years old who have documented primary

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients who have not had both intraoperative parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels and
             Gamma counts during their parathyroidectomy

          -  Patients who have parathyroidectomies for reasons other than primary
             hyperparathyroidism.
