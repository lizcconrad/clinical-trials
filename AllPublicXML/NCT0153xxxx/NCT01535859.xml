  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether cabergoline is effective in reducing the
      incidence and severity of Ovarian Hyperstimulation Syndrome (OHSS), especially for severe
      cases; and to derive biomarkers for the risk of developing OHSS.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Severe ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS) occurs in up to 2% of in-vitro fertilisation
      (IVF) cycles, resulting in accumulation of fluid in peritoneal, pleural and pericardial
      cavities, haemo-concentration with resultant venous thromboembolic phenomena, reduced
      perfusion of vital organs, renal failure, acute respiratory failure, and even death.

      The long term aim is to develop a comprehensive strategy in reducing the incidence and
      severity of OHSS in in-vitro fertilisation (IVF) cycles. Our short term aim (2-3 years) is to
      test the ability of the dopamine receptor agonist cabergoline in reducing the incidence and
      severity of OHSS in high risk women undergoing controlled ovarian hyperstimulation (COH) in
      fresh IVF cycles through a reduction in vasoactive cytokine levels, specifically in serum
      vascular-endothelial growth factor (VEGF).

      Specifically we will:

        1. Conduct a randomised double-blind placebo-controlled trial in women at high risk of
           developing OHSS during a fresh COH-IVF cycle

        2. Investigate the serum and follicular fluid levels for potential biomarkers of OHSS.
