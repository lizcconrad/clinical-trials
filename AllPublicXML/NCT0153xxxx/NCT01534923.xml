  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to learn more about doctor-patient communication about colon
      cancer screening. This study will also look to see if there are differences in those who get
      colon cancer screening based on the discussion the doctor had with the patient.

          -  Due for colorectal cancer screening at the time of the visit, ascertained through
             patient self-report (e.g., no colonoscopy within the past 10 years, no flexible
