  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background: Photodynamic therapy (PDT) is a method of microbial reduction which can benefit
      periodontal treatment in areas of difficult access, such as deep pockets and furcations. The
      aim of this randomized controlled clinical trial was to evaluate the effects of PDT as an
      adjunct to full-mouth ultrasonic debridement in the treatment of severe chronic
      periodontitis.

      Methods: Twenty-two patients with at least one pocket with probing depth (PD) ≥ 7 mm and one
      pocket with PD ≥ 5 mm and bleeding on probing (BOP) on each side of the mouth were included,
      characterizing a split mouth design. The control group underwent full-mouth ultrasonic
      debridement and test group received the same treatment associated with PDT. The following
      clinical parameters were evaluated: plaque index, gingival index, BOP, gingival recession
      (GR), PD, and clinical attachment level (CAL). All parameters were collected before, 1, 3 and
      6 months after treatment.

      The present study was a randomized, blinded, controlled clinical trial, which used a
      split-mouth design. Prior to commencement, the study design was approved by the Ethics
      Committee of Bahiana School of Medicine and Public Health (12/2008). All patients were
      informed individually about the nature of the proposed treatment, and informed consent forms
      were signed.

After 6 months, PD decreased from 5.11 ± 0.56 mm to 2.83 ± 0.47 mm in test group (p&lt;0.05) and from 5.15 ± 0.46 mm to 2.83 ± 0.40 mm in control group (p&lt;0.05). The CAL changed, after 6 months, from 5.49 ± 0.76 mm to 3.41 ± 0.84 mm in th test group (p&lt;0.05) and from 5.53 ± 0.54 to 3.39 ± 0.51 mm in control group (p&lt;0.05).</description>

    <description>After random allocation, all patients received full-mouth ultrasonic debridement using an ultrasonic scaler (Profi III Bios, Dabi Atlante, Ribeirão Preto, São Paulo, Brazil) for 1 hour. Specific tips were used (Perio sub, Dabi Atlante, Ribeirão Preto, São Paulo, Brazi). PDT was performed on only one side of the mouth and the initial step was subgingival irrigation with 0.005% methylene blue dye. To avoid contamination of the control sites with the dye, the methylene blue was applied only inside the periodontal pockets and a high-powered suction device controlled the flow. Two minutes after applying the photosensitizer, the low power laser - AsGaAl (Photon Laser III - PL7336, DMC, São Carlos -São Paulo, Brazil) was applied (660 nm, 100 mW, 9 J, 90 seconds per site, 320 J/cm2).</description>

    <description>At least two teeth (one with PD ≥ 7 mm and another with PS ≥ 5 mm) were randomly assigned (by coin toss) to one of the treatments: with (test group) or without PDT (control group).
