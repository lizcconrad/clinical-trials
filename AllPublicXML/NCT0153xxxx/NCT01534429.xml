  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Increasing experience has identified post-herniorraphy chronic pain as an under-recognized
      and important complication. Nerve entrapment and injury are recognized as causes of such
      pain. Operative treatment for selected patients with this condition includes surgical
      exploration of the affected groin, identification and removal of involved nerves, and removal
      of meshoma. This procedure has been highly effective in treatment of chronic pain. This study
      will attempt to subjectively and objectively evaluate the patient's chronic groin pain using
      quantitative sensory testing (QST) and validated pain scales and questionnaires. Quantitative
      sensory testing is a method used to assess damage to the small and large nerve fibers. It is
      used to diagnose and assess the severity of nerve damage, and can also help to determine if a
      neuropathy is responding to treatment. QST uses a computer testing system to measure how
      nerves react to vibration and changes in temperature. The procedure is non-invasive and the
      patient will feel minimal to no discomfort during testing. The hypothesis is that any
      decrease in subjective pain scores would be accompanied by improved QST results.

      Background: Chronic postherniorrhaphy inguinal pain is a complex, major health problem. In
      the absence of recurrence or meshoma, laparoscopic retroperitoneal triple neurectomy has
      emerged as an effective surgical treatment of postherniorrhaphy inguinal pain. Methods: This
      prospective pilot study evaluated the neurophysiological and clinical effects of laparoscopic
      retroperitoneal triple neurectomy. Ten consecutive adult with chronic postherniorrhaphy
      inguinal pain and unilateral predominantly neuropathic inguinodynia underwent three
      comprehensive quantitative sensory testing assessments (preoperative, immediate
      postoperative, and late postoperative). Pain severity, health-related function, and sleep
      quality were assessed over the course of a 6-month follow-up period.
