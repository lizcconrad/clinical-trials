  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) is a cardiac neurohormone which rapidly released by the
      ventricle in response to myocardial stretch. BNP has been used as a biomarker of sepsis
      related cardiac dysfunction and volume overload in critical ill patients. It is also a marker
      associated with prognosis in patients with severe sepsis and septic shock. However, the
      clinical utility of BNP level in management of early severe sepsis and septic shock over the
      first 48 hours is not clear. Besides, Lactate represents as a maker of tissue hypoperfusion,
      which has been used as a guide therapy for sepsis patients and high serum lactate level is
      independently associated with mortality in severe sepsis. Today, in management of early
      severe sepsis and septic shock, current guideline emphasize the early goal-directed therapy
      (EGDT) with achieving the central venous pressure (CVP) level 8-12 mmHg by fluid support
      first, then targeting the next goal to maintain mean airway pressure (MAP) at least 65 mmHg
      by vasopressor agent (ie, Norepinephrine) and finally keeping central venous oxyhemoglobin
      saturation (ScvO2) &gt; 70% via optimal Hct &gt; 30% and dobutamine usage within first 6 hours of
      emergency department admission. However, the role of BNP and lactate in patients with severe
      sepsis and septic shock with or without myocardial dysfunction under EGDT management are not
      clear.

      The investigators will conduct a prospective observational study to investigate the change of
      BNP and Lactate within 48 hours in early severe sepsis and septic shock under EGDT
      management, their association of cardiac dysfunction and their role in predicting various
      clinical outcome. The investigators also want to see if BNP and lactate could be useful tools
      to guide the adjustment of optimal fluid supply and the timing of inotropic agent
      intervention.
