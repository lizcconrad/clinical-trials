  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective for this trial is to determine the biological ability of apricoxib to
      decrease T reg cells in the peripheral blood and tumor infiltrating lymphocytes in subjects
      compared to those who have not in subjects with early stage Non-small Cell Lung Cancer
      (NSCLC). The secondary objectives are to determine the efficacy of apricoxib to inhibit
      CD4+CD25+ T reg and FOXP3 function and exploration of COX-2 dependent biomarkers of apoptosis
      resistance, angiogenesis, invasion, and immunity.

    <measure>Compare Level of CD4+CD25high T Lymphocyte Regulatory Cells in Peripheral Blood Lymphocytes and Tumor Infiltrating Lymphocytes From Surgical Resection Specimens of Subjects With Early Stage NSCLC Who Have Received Apricoxib to Those Who Have Not</measure>
    <time_frame>7 days</time_frame>
    <description>As part of the trial, forty eligible subjects will be randomly assigned to receive Apricoxib 400 mg orally once daily or no drug intervention for a 7 day period (Days 0-6) prior to surgical resection of the lung tumor but between the two surgeries. Peripheral blood and urine will be obtained on Days 0 and 7 from both groups (prior to surgical incision). Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) and lymph node tissue will be obtained on Days 0 and 7. TIL will be obtained from surgical resection specimens of the primary lung tumor only on Day 7</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Effect of Apricoxib on Levels of CD4+CD25+ T Regulatory Cells in Peripheral Blood.Also,Biomarkers of Apoptosis Resistance,Angiogenesis,Invasion and Immunity Will be Tested in the Lab to Check How Effective Apricoxib is in Inhibiting These Proteins.</measure>
    <time_frame>7 days</time_frame>
    <description>Peripheral blood from patients with NSCLC has been reported to have an increase in the percentages of CD4+CD25+ T reg cells.In contrast &lt;10% of the PBLs of normal donors have this phenotype. As such, CD4+CD25+ cells will be assessed in addition to FOXP3 levels in PBL. In addition, exploration of COX-2 dependent biomarkers of apoptosis resistance, angiogenesis, invasion, and immunity will be studied. COX-2, FOXP3, IL-10, IL-12, MDC, CXCR4 and survivin will be analyzed in plasma.</description>

        <title>Compare Level of CD4+CD25high T Lymphocyte Regulatory Cells in Peripheral Blood Lymphocytes and Tumor Infiltrating Lymphocytes From Surgical Resection Specimens of Subjects With Early Stage NSCLC Who Have Received Apricoxib to Those Who Have Not</title>
        <description>As part of the trial, forty eligible subjects will be randomly assigned to receive Apricoxib 400 mg orally once daily or no drug intervention for a 7 day period (Days 0-6) prior to surgical resection of the lung tumor but between the two surgeries. Peripheral blood and urine will be obtained on Days 0 and 7 from both groups (prior to surgical incision). Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) and lymph node tissue will be obtained on Days 0 and 7. TIL will be obtained from surgical resection specimens of the primary lung tumor only on Day 7</description>

        <title>Effect of Apricoxib on Levels of CD4+CD25+ T Regulatory Cells in Peripheral Blood.Also,Biomarkers of Apoptosis Resistance,Angiogenesis,Invasion and Immunity Will be Tested in the Lab to Check How Effective Apricoxib is in Inhibiting These Proteins.</title>
        <description>Peripheral blood from patients with NSCLC has been reported to have an increase in the percentages of CD4+CD25+ T reg cells.In contrast &lt;10% of the PBLs of normal donors have this phenotype. As such, CD4+CD25+ cells will be assessed in addition to FOXP3 levels in PBL. In addition, exploration of COX-2 dependent biomarkers of apoptosis resistance, angiogenesis, invasion, and immunity will be studied. COX-2, FOXP3, IL-10, IL-12, MDC, CXCR4 and survivin will be analyzed in plasma.</description>
