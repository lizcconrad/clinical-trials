    <textblock>
      The study &quot;Reveal Chagas: Clinical Evidence of the Implantable Cardiac Monitor in Patients
      with Chagas Disease&quot; is a prospective, multicenter, randomized study that is being conducted
      at several centers in Latin America with commercially available products.

      The primary study hypothesis is that patients with implantable cardiac monitors will have a
      shorter time to the decision to treat for electrical or arrhythmic disorders during the
      follow-up period.

      The geography includes Argentina and Colombia.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose is to study the possible benefit of a superior treatment decision rate for
      cardiac arrhythmias (brady- and or/ tachyarrhythmias) using an implantable cardiac monitor
      (ICM) in patients with Chagas Disease diagnosed by serology, who are asymptomatic and/or
      minimally symptomatic. Patients that meet inclusion criteria of the study will be randomized
      to standard care or standard care plus ICM.

      Approximately half of the patients will receive an ICM. All patients will be followed for 36
      months. It is expected that the enrollment phase will last 1 year, and that the total study
      duration will be 4 years. The study is expected to end in 2017. One hundred and two patients
      are needed for 95% confidence level and 80% statistical power to be randomized into the
      study, at approximately 5 centers in Latin America. Patients will be considered enrolled once
      they have signed the Informed Consent. The following additional parameters will also be
      collected:

        -  Recorded arrhythmic events stored within the ICM (bradyarrhythmia and tachyarrhythmia)

        -  Time duration spent in arrhythmia and incidence of symptomatic arrhythmias in patients
           with an ICM.

        -  Clinical data on subject outcomes and changes in heart failure as assessed by heart
           failure hospitalizations, New York Heart Association class and mortality.
