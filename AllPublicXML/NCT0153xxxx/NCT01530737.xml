    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is:

      1. To evaluate the use of Antithrombin (AT) concentrate in infants less than one year of age
      undergoing cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) for cardiac surgery

      The secondary objectives of this study are:

        1. To determine if the administration of AT concentrate prior to heparinization will
           decrease the amount of heparin required to achieve optimal anticoagulation (as defined
           by anti-Xa levels) during CPB

        2. To determine if a decrease in activation and consumption of coagulation proteins,
           platelets and subsequent fibrinolysis will result in improved haemostasis following CPB

        3. To determine if there will be a reduction in postoperative bleeding and associated
           clinical complications
