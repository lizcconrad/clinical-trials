  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Bariatric surgery of morbid obesity was first located at Førde Central Hospital, but it is
      now an established treatment at several other hospitals in the health region (Voss Hospital
      (Helse Bergen), Haugesund Hospital (Helse Fonna) Stavanger University Hospital ((SUS) Helse
      Stavanger). Surgical methods vary between hospitals: Voss: sleeve gastrectomy, Haugesund:
      gastric bypass (Roux-en Y),SUS: gastric bypass (Roux-en Y); Førde: biliopancreatic diversion
      with duodenal switch (BPD / DS) and sleeve gastrectomy . The investigators have then in
      Helse-Vest a unique opportunity to examine the various clinical and metabolic effects from
      different surgical methods.

      This project is part of the regional strategic research initiative in the Helse Vest

      Primary endpoints for the study are weight loss and self-reported quality of life (QoL)
      evaluated by Short Form (SF)-36 and Impact of Weight Wed Quality of Life-Lite (IWQOL-Lite))
      Our hypothesis is that patients operated with RYGBP (Roux A-Y Gastric Bypass) and BPD / DS
      (biliopancreatic diversion with duodenal switch) have the same weight and same QoL after 5
      years of follow-up as patients treated with gastric sleeve (laparoscopic gastric sleeve
      (LSG)) We will also compare the groups with respect to a number of secondary endpoints

      400 patients (approximately 100 patients / institution) will be included in the main study.
      Some of the programs that run on secondary endpoints will be conducted separately under study
      at each hospital. These studies will be reported in separate articles.
