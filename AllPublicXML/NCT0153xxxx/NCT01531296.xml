      Determining the investigators ability to accurately assess rotational malalignment clinically
      compared to imaging.

      The objectives of this study are 1) to assess the inter/intra-observer reliability of
      rotational measurements on axial MRI images and 2) determine the correlation between clinical
      and MRI measures of femoral version and tibial torsion.

      The investigators will use previously obtained MRI images to retrospectively calculate the
      inter-observer and intra-observer reliability of our measurements. Participating physicians
      will undergo training to standardize measurement technique. Five orthopaedic surgeons and one
      radiologist will perform the measurement to calculate inter-observer reliability. To asses
      intra-observer reliability, repeat measurements will be performed by the same physicians at a
      later date (at least 2 weeks). The physicians will be blinded to previous results when
      performing the second set of measurements. A standardized rotational profile will be
      performed on all patients presenting to the investigators with patellofemoral complaints or
      rotational abnormalities warranting intervention. Internal and external hip rotation will be
      measured in the prone and supine positions. Tibial torsion will be assessed with the
      thigh-foot axis in the prone and sitting positions. Investigators will participate in a
      formal training session prior to data collection to normalize measurements. Each study
      participant will undergo MRI imaging of the femur and tibia.

        The study is aiming to recruit all patients with complaints of patellofemoral
        pain/instability associated with rotational malalignment. The two types of rotational
        malalignment, fibial version and tibial torsion are most common among the pediatric
        population.

        Inclusion Criteria: Retrospective:

          -  Prior study MRI images available in the University PACS system

          -  Prior study MRI images obtained at PCMC and uploaded into the OsiriX software (OsiriX
             is a software program compatible with multiple imaging formats that has easily
             adaptable measurement tools)

          -  We will search our imaging database from 2009 to current. Included will be all gun
             site MRI studies obtained at PCMC or the UOC for evaluation of rotational profile. We
             will exclude any study in which images are not sufficient to obtain all of the
             required measurements needed for our study. A preliminary review of the imaging
             database has identified 42 potential studies. Our power analysis calls for 15 patients
             to be included to obtain a 95% confidence interval.

        Inclusion Criteria: Prospective:

          -  All patients of the investigating physicians, male and female, between the ages of 8
             and 30 presenting with complaints of patellofemoral pain/instability or rotational
             abnormality

          -  All patients with neuromuscular disease, including cerebral palsy

        Exclusion Criteria: Retrospective:

          -  Any patients with imaging studies insufficient to provide all of the required
             measurements and any patient previously surgically treated for rotational malalignment

        Exclusion Criteria: Prospective:

          -  Any patient that has undergone previous surgical treatments for rotational
             malalignment.

          -  Any patients with implantable devices not compatible with MRI
