    <textblock>
      This phase I/II trial studies the safety, best dose and effectiveness of targeted gene
      therapy combined with isolated limb infusion (ILI) of melphalan and dactinomycin for treating
      patients with advanced extremity melanoma that cannot be removed by surgery. Adding gene
      therapy to a standard chemotherapy regimen in the isolated limb may enhance anti-cancer
      effects by inducing a systemic immune response against the tumor cells.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patient must have histologically or cytologically confirmed diagnosis of melanoma with
             advanced, unresectable primary or in transit metastasis

          -  Patient must have measurable disease defined as lesions that can be accurately
             measured in at least one dimension (longest diameter to be recorded) as &gt;= 10 mm with
             caliper measurement for superficial lesions or computed tomography (CT) scan for
             deeper lesions; additionally, patients must have no evidence of disease beyond the
             affected extremity on positron emission tomography (PET)/CT scan

          -  Patients may have undergone any previous systemic chemotherapy with a treatment free
             period of &gt; 4 weeks prior to enrolling on this clinical trial

          -  Patient must be &gt; 18 years of age.-Patient must have an Eastern Cooperative Oncology
             Group (ECOG) performance status =&lt; 2, Karnofsky &gt;= 60%

          -  Leukocytes &gt;= 3,000/mcL

          -  Absolute neutrophil count &gt;= 1,500/mcL

             [SGOT])/alanine aminotransferase (ALT) (serum glutamate pyruvate transaminase [SGPT])

          -  Creatinine within normal institutional limits

          -  OR creatinine clearance &gt;= 60 mL/min/1.73 m^2 for patients with creatinine levels
             above institutional normal

             (hormonal or barrier method of birth control, abstinence) prior to study entry and for
             the duration of study participation; should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is
             pregnant while participating in this study, she must inform her treating physician
             immediately

          -  Patient (or legally authorized representative if applicable) must be able to

             similar chemical or biologic composition to melphalan or dactinomycin or other agents
             used in the study

          -  Patient must not have an uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited
             to, ongoing or active infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina
             pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would
             limit compliance with study requirements

          -  Patient must not be pregnant and/or breastfeeding

          -  Patient must not be known to be human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-positive or
             otherwise immunocompromised (i.e., patient has undergone organ/bone marrow transplant
             on immunosuppression, patient is or has recently undergone treatment with toxic
             chemotherapy for another malignancy, etc.) as there is a risk of complications in the
             use of adenovirus therapy in these patients
