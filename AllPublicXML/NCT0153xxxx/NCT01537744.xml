      romidepsin cancer are effective in the treatment of advanced solid tumors.

    <textblock>
      This is a two part, single-institution, open-label, Phase I dose-escalation study of oral
      5-azacitidine in combination with intravenous (IV) romidepsin. Part 1 of the study is a
      traditional 3 + 3 dose escalation study designed to evaluate the maximum tolerated dose
      (MTD), dose limiting toxicities (DLTs), safety, pharmacokinetic (PK) profiles, and
      pharmacodynamic profiles of increasing doses of orally administered 5-azacitidine in
      combination with a constant dose of IV romidepsin. Part 2 is an expansion cohort study for
      the preliminary evaluation of efficacy in the treatment of virally mediated cancers and
      liposarcoma once the MTD has been determined. PK and PD data will also be collected for these
      subjects.

        -  Plasma samples will be obtained, prior and during treatment, to assess the methylation
           status of free tumor DNA circulating in the blood

        -  Archival tissue will be obtained on all participants for future correlative studies,
           such as baseline gene expression, methylation patterns.

        -  Participants with accessible, biopsiable tumors will also undergo pre-treatment and
           post-treatment (~cycle 2D1) biopsies for correlative studies in the expansion cohort.

Table 1: Dose Escalation Schedule Dose Level Dose and Schedule a, c 5-Azacitidine (PO) Romidepsin (IV)
Level -1b 100mg daily days 1-14 8mg/m2 days 8 and 15
Level 1 200mg daily days 1-14 8mg/m2 days 8 and 15
Level 2 300mg daily days 1-14 8mg/m2 days 8 and 15
Level 3 300mg daily days 1-21 8mg/m2 days 8 and 15
Level 4d MTD 8mg/m2 days 8, 15, and 22
Each cycle will last 28 days.
Subjects will be enrolled in Level -1 if the MTD is reached in the subjects enrolled in Level 1.
On days when both agents are administered, oral 5-azacitidine should be administered at the start of the romidepsin infusion.
Level 4 is optional and decisions whether to initiate this level will be based on discussions between the study investigator and Celgene.</description>
