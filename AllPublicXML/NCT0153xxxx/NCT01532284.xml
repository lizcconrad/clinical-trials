  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A pragmatic, multicentre, randomized double-blind controlled trial with an intention-to-treat
      analysis, of the use of preimplantation genetic screening (PGS) for aneuploidy by means of
      microarray comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) for the chromosomal analysis of the polar
      bodies (PB) of oocytes collected after ovarian stimulation for in vitro fertilization (IVF),
      and with the intention to assess the genetic competence of oocytes of advanced biological
      age, and the effect of this technique on reproductive outcome.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  infertility as an indication for IVF or ICSI;

          -  patients between their 36th and 41st birthdays (at time of signing ICF i.e. max
             40years and 364days at the day of signing the informed consent);

          -  BMI range 18 to 30 kgs per m2;

          -  patients prepared to accept transfer of up to two embryos;

          -  absence of any type of genetic abnormality in the patient's personal and family
             history;

          -  normal karyotype (optional)

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  treatment involving donor oocytes (donor sperm is allowed subject to local practice
             and regulations and provided karyotype of the sperm donor is available and normal);

          -  menstrual irregularity (&lt;24 and &gt;35 days);

          -  three or more previous failed IVF or ICSI cycles, with the present partner.
             (Definition of a failed cycle: 'absence of a clinical pregnancy relating to a
             treatment with embryo transfer resulting from oocyte retrieval for the current
             intended pregnancy and with the current partner; the transfers include transfers of
             fresh and frozen within this treatment; clinical pregnancy is defined as the presence
             of a gestational sac at the earliest ultrasound and includes early clinical
             miscarriage, late miscarriage and clinically confirmed extrauterine pregnancy, and
             excludes preclinical miscarriage (biochemical pregnancy); -

          -  three or more clinical miscarriages;

          -  poor response in any previous cycle;

          -  low ovarian reserve (At least one of the following two features must be present: (1) a
             previous poor ovarian response (≤ 3 oocytes with a conventional stimulation 119
             protocol); (2) an abnormal ovarian reserve test (i.e. AFC &lt; 5 follicles or AMH &lt; 0,5
             ng/mL)* (adapted from Ferraretti et al., 2011);

          -  cycles requiring surgical sperm recovery procedures;

          -  total asthenozoospermia and/or globozoospermia.

          -  any type of genetic abnormality or family history of genetic abnormality in subject or
             partner
