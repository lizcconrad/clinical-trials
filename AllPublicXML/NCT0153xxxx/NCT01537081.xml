  <brief_title>Safety and Efficacy of Mucinex and IR Guaifenesin the Treatment of Symptoms of Acute Upper Respiratory Tract Infections</brief_title>

  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is designed to meet regulatory requirement outside the US. The dosing regimen and
      assessments timepoints were dictated by immediate release (IR) guaifenesin (GGE) and do not
      match approved Mucinex labeling in the U.S. The purpose of this study is to determine whether
      Mucinex is effective and non-inferior as compared to placebo and immediate release
      guaifenesin in the treatment of symptoms of acute upper respiratory infections. This design
      was required based on EU regulatory guidance.

    <measure>Summary Scores on the SUM8 Daily Cough and Phlegm Diary Card On the Morning of Day 4</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 4</time_frame>
    <description>Participants completed diary cards twice a day that asked questions about their cough and phlegm status. The Daily Cough and Phlegm Diary Card consisted of eleven questions, eight core questions plus three questions that were answered dependent upon the response to core questions. The SUM8 consisted of the sum of the answers to the eight core questions. Each question was answered on a scale of 0-4, with 4 representing the greatest severity of symptoms. The SUM8 thus had a scale range of 0-32 with 0 representing best possible symptoms, and 32 representing greatest severity of symptoms.</description>

    <description>The study is designed to meet regulatory requirement outside the US. The dosing regimen and assessments timepoints were dictated by IR GGE and do not match approved Mucinex labeling. Participants were instructed to take 2 Mucinex 600 mg tablets and 1 placebo tablet matching the 200 mg IR guaifenesin tablet by mouth, every 12 hours for 7 days. To ensure complete blinding, on Hours 6 and 18, this treatment group took 2 matching Mucinex placebo tablets combined with 1 IR guaifenesin placebo tablet.</description>

The dosing regimen and assessments timepoints were dictated by IR GGE and do not match approved Mucinex labeling.

        <title>Summary Scores on the SUM8 Daily Cough and Phlegm Diary Card On the Morning of Day 4</title>
        <description>Participants completed diary cards twice a day that asked questions about their cough and phlegm status. The Daily Cough and Phlegm Diary Card consisted of eleven questions, eight core questions plus three questions that were answered dependent upon the response to core questions. The SUM8 consisted of the sum of the answers to the eight core questions. Each question was answered on a scale of 0-4, with 4 representing the greatest severity of symptoms. The SUM8 thus had a scale range of 0-32 with 0 representing best possible symptoms, and 32 representing greatest severity of symptoms.</description>

            <description>The study is designed to meet regulatory requirement outside the US. The dosing regimen and assessments timepoints were dictated by IR GGE and do not match approved Mucinex labeling. Participants were instructed to take 2 Mucinex 600-mg tablets and 1 placebo tablet matching the 200 mg IR guaifenesin tablet by mouth, every 12 hours for 7 days. To ensure complete blinding, on Hours 6 and 18, this treatment group took 2 matching Mucinex placebo tablets combined with 1 IR guaifenesin placebo tablet.</description>
