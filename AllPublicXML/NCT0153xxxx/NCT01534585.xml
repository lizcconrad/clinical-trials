  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) is a prevalent disease in southeast of China. Radiation
      therapy with or without chemotherapy is a standard therapy for nasopharyngeal cancer.
      Cytotoxic chemotherapy plays an important role in the curative treatment of advanced NPC.
      However, concurrent chemoradiotherapy increased significantly local and systemic toxic
      effects, which may preclude many patients from proceeding with combined therapy. The
      epidermal growth factor receptor(EGFR) gene is amplified in 40% and EGFR protein is
      overexpressed in over 80% of NPC. EGFR overexpression is also associated with shorter
      survival following chemoradiotherapy in locoregionally advanced NPC. And some basic
      researches have proved that EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors(TKIs) could increase the
      radiosensitivity and reduce the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in NPC cell line.
      Moreover, distant metastases has been the major cause of treatment failure in NPC. Icotinib
      hydrochloride is a novel oral EGFR TKIs with low mammalian toxicity(made in China). But base
      on toxic effects of Icotinib, it may increase toxic effects about skin and mucosa in
      combination therapy with Icotinib and Intensity-modulated Radiotherapy (IMRT). The
      prospective study will assess the tolerability and efficacy of Icotinib combined with IMRT in
      patients with NPC. This regimen is of great interest and it has potential to alleviate the
      adverse effects, improve patient compliance and better therapeutic ratio.

    <description>Oral Icotinib begins on day 1 and continues until completion of radiotherapy. Phase I:The initial plan is to accrue 6 patients to each dose level (125mg, qd and bid and tid) in each cohort. If one or none of six patients have dose limiting toxicity (DLT), then escalation will proceed. If DLT occurs in two or more patients at a dose level, then escalation will be stopped. The dose level below that at which two of six patients experience a DLT is defined as the maximum-tolerated dose. A minimum of 4 weeks of observation is required after completion of radiation within each Icotinib dose level before accrual to the next level.
Phase II:According to the maximum tolerated dose, 50 patients will been recruited.</description>

    <description>The nasopharyngeal regions and upper neck with IMRT plans will be generated and approved for each patient, whereas the low-neck and supraclavicular regions will be used with a conventional anterior field. A total of 70-76Gy at 2.12-2.3Gy/fraction/d will be given to the GTVnx, the GTVnd will receive 66-70Gy at 2.0-2.12Gy/fraction/d, the CTV1 will receive 60-66Gy at 1.8-2.0Gy/fraction/d, and the CTV2 received 56-60Gy at 1.7-1.8Gy/fraction/d with IMRT. The low-neck and supraclavicular regions will receive 50-60Gy at 2.0Gy/fraction/d with conventional radiotherapy. Target prescription dose and critical structures limit dose are planned according to the RTOG0225 trial.</description>
