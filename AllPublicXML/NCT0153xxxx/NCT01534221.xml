    <textblock>
      The superiority of a percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) by one stent over another in
      terms of clinical outcome is usually documented in large randomized controlled trials (RCT).
      Although generated from selected study populations these data form the basis for evidence
      based practice (EBP) in the entire population of patients considered for coronary
      intervention. An inherent limitation of this approach is that study populations differ
      significantly from all comers in terms of patient characteristics and prognosis undermining
      the foundation for extrapolation of trial results to all comers. Furthermore, other trials
      are based on a &quot;one-fits-all&quot; concept, while the benefits of an &quot;individual-tailored&quot;
      approach that might be superior, is not investigated.

      The Purpose of the current study is to

        -  Compare clinical outcome between several CE marked drug eluting stents

        -  Compare clinical outcome between several CE marked bare metal stents

        -  Compare clinical outcome in all comers with that of the selected study population of
           RCT's

        -  Evolve methods to compare clinical outcomes between the generalized &quot;one-fits-all&quot;
           versus the individualized or &quot;individual-tailored&quot; stent selection approaches

      The Method employed is

        -  All comer PCI registry - single centre

        -  Randomisation of all eligible patients within the registry to one of several study stent

        -  Quality assurance in non-randomized population within the registry by periodical
           alternating the institutional standard stent

        -  Continuous follow up of all patients included the registry by means of systematic event
           detection and classification by an independent safety and end point committee

        -  Assessment of effects on quality of life by heart and health questionnaires

      Outcome Measures

      Primary endpoints:

        -  Composite of cardiac death, acute myocardial infraction and target vessel
           revascularisation

        -  Stent thrombosis

        -  A specifically developed Treatment Failure Rate classification

      Secondary outcome measures include each of the above, target lesion revascularisation and
      total death analyzed in a hierarchical fashion at 2, 3, 4 and 5 years.

      Tertiary outcome measure is self reported quality of life based on health questionnaires on
      general health and cardiac symptoms.

      Power Calculations An event rate of 20% within 5 years, a relative difference of 25% (an
      absolute difference of 5%), P&lt; 5%, Power &gt; 80% =&gt; 900 patients in each of two treatment arms.

      Prespecified Analysis include

        1. The MACE rates between stent types

        2. The Stent thrombosis rates between stent types

        3. The Treatment failure rates between stent types

        4. The randomized population versus non-randomized population

        5. The individualized versus the generalized Population

        6. QOL between stent types

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      All MACE and stent thromboses are adjudicated by an independent end point and safety
      committee chaired by Jørgen Jeppesen known from the very same task he executed in the SORT
      OUT II.

      Further question may be answered by the four key investigators:

      Steen Carstensen, Anders Galløe, Ole Havndrup, Lars Kjøller-Hansen
