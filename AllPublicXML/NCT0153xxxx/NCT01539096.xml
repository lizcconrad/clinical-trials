      The purpose of this study is to investigate whether benefits of training the affected hand in
      patients with stroke can be improved by combining training with a painless, noninvasive
      technique called Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (TDCS). TDCS will be applied over
      the part of the brain responsible for movements of the affected hand. Also, the investigators
      will study the changes in the brain that favor recovery of hand function following
      combination of training and tDCS.

      The overall goal of this study is to develop a novel rehabilitative method, in chronic
      stroke, which minimizes residual deficits by maximally utilizing the potential for cortical
      plasticity.

      Despite extensive rehabilitation, approximately 60-80% of patients with stroke experience
      residual dysfunction of the upper limb. Deficits are believed to linger due to
      neurophysiologic imbalance between the ipsilesional (stroke-affected) and contralesional
      (intact) motor cortices. Specifically, the ipsilesional motor cortex loses its normal
      inhibitory control over the contralesional areas, which, in return, intensify their
      inhibitory influence upon the former. Constraint-Induced Movement Therapy (CIMT) represents a
      family of techniques that alleviates residual deficits by rectifying these neurophysiologic
      imbalances. By reinforcing use of the paretic upper limb in daily life during restraint of
      the non-paretic limb, CIMT initiates use-dependent neuroplastic reorganization implicating
      the ipsilesional motor areas, which demonstrate return-of-activity and regain territory in
      the surviving regions, mitigating the exaggerated inhibitory influence exerted by the
      contralesional areas.

      Despite promising evidence, however, clinical utility of CIMT is limited due to its
      labor-intensive protocols and inadequate gains. Our objective is to address gaps in existing
      clinical rehabilitative research. The investigators propose to 1) combine CIMT with targeted
      stimulation of the ipsilesional motor cortices, 2) Use a novel, noninvasive method of
      stimulation, called transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), 3) Use multimodal imaging
      to determine comprehensive mechanisms of recovery in patients. Our central hypotheses are 1)
      ipsilesional motor cortices would be an ideal site for delivering stimulation during CIMT, 2)
      tDCS will be easy, safe and inexpensive to apply and will target multiple maps concurrently
      during rehabilitation as demonstrated in our elemental research. 3) structural and functional
      imaging methods will demonstrate complementary cortical, corticospinal and cortico-muscular
      markers of recovery.

    <description>Subjects in this group will be trained on Constraint induced movement therapy (CIMT) for the hand while concurrently receiving placebo noninvasive brain stimulation (tDCS). They will be receiving Sham tDCS: placebo noninvasive brain stimulation. They will be provided treatment for 3 days a week for 5 weeks for 1 hr each day at the Cleveland Clinic. They would be asked to use affected hand in daily activities for 5 hrs everyday at home while wearing a mitt on their unaffected hand.</description>

    <intervention_name>tDCS: noninvasive brain stimulation</intervention_name>
    <description>TDCS is a method of noninvasive stimulation of the brain. Using electrodes placed in saline-soaked sponges, low level of direct current (1mA) is delivered over the scalp. This intervention is considered safe and noninvasive because it does not involve implantation or injection or any skin penetration. In the present study, tDCS will be delivered for 1 hr each day for 3 days a week for 5 weeks in conjunction with constraint-induced movement therapy for the affected hand.</description>

    <description>Placebo set-up for noninvasive brain stimulation will be similar to that for the active tDCS; sponge electrodes would be placed on the scalp and connected to a batter-operated device. Patients will not receive the effective level of direct current as would delivered in active tDCS intervention. But patients will not be able to decipher whether they are receiving active or placebo tDCS.</description>
