  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare two common methods of providing respiratory support:
      nasal continuous airway pressure and high flow nasal cannula to see what effect it has on
      babies breathing. The investigators also will compare the effects of slightly changing the
      level of support these two different types of therapy on how easily your baby is breathing.
      Changes in the level of support and between these two respiratory support modalities are
      frequently done and are part of the routine care in the neonatal intensive care unit.

    <description>Infants who are currently on NCPAP will have pulmonary function testing (PFTs)and esophageal pressure performed while on 2 different settings of NCPAP. These infants will then be transitioned HFNC and will undergo PFTs and esophageal pressure while on different HFNC settings.
