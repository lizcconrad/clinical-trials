      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy, safety, and pharmacokinetics of TA-650
      in patients with Behcet's disease ( BD ) with special lesions after the administration of
      TA-650 at a dosage of 5 mg/kg in weeks 0, 2, and 6, then every 8 weeks after week 14 up to
      week 46.

    <description>We defined the patient who met the following criteria as the complete responders.
The criteria of complete responders are that clinical symptoms associated with each BD have disappeared and morphological characteristics (ex. ulcers area, Computed tomography (CT) or Positron emission tomography/Computed tomography (PET/CT) findings etc) at the lesion site and inflammatory markers (ex. cerebrospinal fluid and serum inflammatory markers) are improved compared to Week 0.</description>

The criteria of complete responders are that clinical symptoms associated with each BD have disappeared and morphological characteristics (ex. ulcers area, Computed tomography (CT) or Positron emission tomography/Computed tomography (PET/CT) findings etc) at the lesion site and inflammatory markers (ex. cerebrospinal fluid and serum inflammatory markers) are improved compared to Week 0.</description>
