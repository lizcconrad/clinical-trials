  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed to evaluate a novel tool to aid in the diagnosis of intestinal
      perforation in infants who are at high risk. Analysis of perforation rates of all infants in
      the three largest participating sites shows that the majority of infants with perforation
      will do so prior to day of life 21. This study will target the group of infants at highest
      risk for IP, those with birth weight less than 1000 grams, within the time frame most likely
      to capture the perforation. Hypothesis: An IRT value exists that can adequately differentiate
      premature infants with and without intestinal perforation in the first 3 weeks of life.

      At least 300 infants age 1-16 days will be enrolled. IRT values will be obtained daily
      through day of life 21, if the infant is already having labs drawn that day. The primary
      outcomes will be intestinal perforation and/or death on or before day of life 21. Each
      patient will be followed until death or discharge. Discharge will be defined as the release
      of the infant to home. Infants who are transferred to another NICU may be followed if the
      receiving NICU is one of the investigational sites. Transfer includes the release of the
      infant to outside units or other units within the same hospital. The purpose of this follow
      up is to obtain serial IRT values through day of life 21.
