    <description>Time to worsening of disease related symptoms (LCS) Time to worsening of disease-related symptoms based on FACT-L LCS was defined as the interval from the date of enrollment to the first visit response of 'worsened' without a subsequent response of 'improved' or 'no change' within 21 days (or to the last assessment), death due to any cause, or early discontinuation from the study. Time to worsening was censored at the last non-missing assessment visit if the worsening was not observed.</description>
