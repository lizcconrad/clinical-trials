      The purpose of this study is to determine the safety, tolerability and efficacy of the
      topical application of AP611074 5% gel during 6 weeks on ano-genital warts caused by human
      papillomavirus (HPV).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Genital warts (GW; also called condylomas or condylomata acuminata) are lesions caused by
      infection of Human papillomavirus (HPV)(specifically HPV-6 or HPV-11 types, found in &gt; 95% of
      lesions). GW are sexually transmitted and affect about 1% of the sexually active population.
      GW represent a distressful condition for social and sexual life, especially in the cases of
      external condylomas. No HPV-specific antiviral treatment exists to date, and all existing
      therapies (either surgical or drug) have limited efficacy, with a significant level of GW
      recurrences and are associated with local skin reactions. AP611074 is a synthetic new
      chemical entity that is a potent and selective inhibitor of the interaction between two viral
      proteins from HPV6 and HPV11, an interaction that is a necessary step for HPV DNA replication
      and thus viral production. AP611074 is the &quot;first in class&quot; specific HPV antiviral described
      to treat condyloma caused by HPV infection.

        Main Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Male or female patient aged between 18 and 55 years.

          -  External condylomas, 1-15 lesions, non-confluent and individually isolated.

          -  Lesions must not be internal (ie, they must not penetrate the urethral meatus, vagina
             or anal canal); their visualization must be complete by patients and investigators
             without major facilitation maneuvers and easily documented by digital pictures.

          -  Lesions should have a total surface smaller than 5 cm2, and an individual surface
             smaller than 1 cm2; lesions should be easily measured using a &quot;French Catheter Scale&quot;.

          -  Lesions to be treated should have appeared between 1-6 months before screening and
             patients should not have received any previous condyloma treatment since their
             appearance.

          -  For patients having previous episodes of condyloma lesions, they shouldn't have
             received any condyloma treatment for at least 12 months before screening.

        Main Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with any history or presence of cardiovascular, pulmonary, gastro-intestinal,
             hepatic, renal, metabolic, hematological, neurologic, psychiatric, systemic or
             infectious disease that, in the Investigator's judgment, prevents the patients from
             participating to the study.

          -  Patients with VIN or PIN (intraepithelial neoplasia of vulva or penis; ie, Bowenoid
             papulosis), or genital disease (ie, lichen sclerosus, lichen planus, lichen simplex
             chronicus, dermatitis, psoriasis, bullous diseases, systemic diseases with genital
             manifestations) requiring treatment.

          -  Patients with fibroepithelial polyps or scaly non-viral papillomas, seborrheic
             keratosis, follicular papules, syringoma, or circumscribed lymphangiomas.

          -  Patients whose skin condition or coloration would interfere with the observation and
             the follow-up of the lesions during the study.

          -  Patients for whom a proper follow-up of the lesions during the study will not be
             possible, because of hair growth in the treatment area.
