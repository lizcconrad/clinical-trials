      Test Day 1 (about 4 hours)

        -  This is a fasting visit (nothing besides water 12 hours prior to visit)

        -  Your child will be offered one of two breakfasts (egg breakfast or bagel breakfast)

           . He/she will be asked to eat all the food that is provided.

        -  He/she will be asked to rate the taste of the meal.

        -  He/she will be offered a pasta lunch.

      Test Day 2 (about 4 hours)

        -  This will be scheduled 1 week after Test Day 1

        -  This is a fasting visit (nothing besides water 12 hours prior to visit)

        -  The procedures for this visit are the same as for Test Day 1. Your child will be offered
           the breakfast that he/she did not receive at the last visit.

      The sequence of the 2 breakfasts will be randomly assigned to each child.

    <measure>Visual Analog Scale Ratings</measure>
    <time_frame>1 day</time_frame>
    <description>They will be asked to rate their feelings of hunger and fullness periodically using visual analog scales. The Egg Breakfast is expected to increase satiety scores, decrease hunger and the lunch time food intake, compared to the Bagel Breakfast.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Blood appetite hormone</measure>
    <time_frame>1 day</time_frame>
    <description>We expect that Peptide YY (PYY) and Glucagon-like Peptide-1 (GLP1) levels will rise higher and remain elevated after the Egg Breakfast, and the acylated ghrelin levels will rise higher between the Bagle Breakfast and lunch time.</description>
