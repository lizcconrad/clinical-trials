  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The present research intends to focus clinically on selecting the right type of patient for
      mandibular advancement devices (MAD) therapy using screening tools such as advanced imaging
      and computational methods based on CT-Scan images as well as drug-induced sleep nasendoscopy
      techniques with simulation of the mandibular repositioning. The core of the research project
      relies on known and established methods accepted in several neighboring fields, but aims at
      the transfer of this knowledge by integrating it into this new domain. Doing so, the proposed
      biomedical research is directed towards clinical applications that incorporate innovative
      developments on the level of the diagnosis and therapy of a specific disease, being
      obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS). Furthermore, this study aims at registering
      objective compliance during MAD therapy.
