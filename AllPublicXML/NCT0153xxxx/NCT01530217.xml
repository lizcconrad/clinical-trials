    <textblock>
      Ibuprofen has been recognized as anti-inflammatory and analgesic. The purpose of this study
      is to determine the effect of ibuprofen 400 mg on tooth sensitivity (TS) caused by in-office
      bleaching.

      Methods: 30 health adults who received either placebo or ibuprofen. The drugs were
      administered 1 hour prior to the bleaching and will be prescribed 5 doses every 8 hours
      during 48 hours. For bleaching will be used 35% hydrogen peroxide gel. The tooth sensitivity
      will be recorded for up and lower arc on two scales: VAS (visual analogic scale) and 0-4. The
      shade evaluation will be performed before and 30 days after bleaching with visual shade guide
      and spectrophotometer.

      Background: Ibuprofen has been recognized as anti-inflammatory and analgesic. The purpose of
      this study was to determine the effect of ibuprofen 400 mg on tooth sensitivity (TS) caused
      by in-office bleaching.

      Methods: A triple-blind, parallel design, randomized clinical trial will be conducted on 30
      health adults who received either placebo or ibuprofen. The drugs will be administered 1 hour
      prior to the bleaching and a every eight hours during 48 hours. For bleaching used 35%
      hydrogen peroxide gel. The TS will be recorded for up and lower arc on two scales: VAS and
      0-4. The shade evaluation will be performed before and 30 days after bleaching with visual
      shade guide and spectrophotometer. The % of patients that reported TS at least once during
      treatment and the TS intensity will be evaluated by Fisher`s and Mann-Whitney tests,
      respectively. The color changes will be evaluated by repeated measures ANOVA.

    <time_frame>Sensitivity during the treatment and until 48 hours after bleaching. The tooth sensitivity will be evaluated only this period because the literature appoint dates in this time.</time_frame>
    <description>Patients will be distributed in two groups: Group 1 - Control Group will receive placebo. Group 2 - Ibuprofen will receive not selective anti-inflammatory (Ibuprofen 400 mg). All of the drugs will be administered one hour before the bleaching treatment. Evaluation of Dental Sensitivity Level: the effect of the product will be evaluated up to 1 Hour, 24 and 48 hours after the tooth bleaching, using a verbal scale of 5 points and a Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) will be used.</description>

    <description>Shade evaluation was recorded using two methods: the subjective evaluation using a shade guide (Vita Lumin, Vita Zahnfabrik, Bad Säckingen, Germany) and an objective evaluation using the spectrophotometer (Easyshade, Vident, Brea, CA, USA).</description>

    <description>Ibuprofen Group will be receive a dose of non-steroidal antiinflammatory drug ibuprofen 400 mg. All the participants will be watched to ensure that they took the drugs 1 hour prior to treatment. A second dose of ibuprofen (400 mg), will be administered a every 8 hours after the first dose during 48 hours.</description>
