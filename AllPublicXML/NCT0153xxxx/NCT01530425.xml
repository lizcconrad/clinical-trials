  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Two wheelchair types available for children in Kenya are compared for energy costs, utility,
      and complications. This study will arrive at a protocol for comparing wheelchairs in
      low-income settings, and in the process, provide wheelchair makers and providers with
      specific feedback. It also serves as a means to increase the skills of local health
      professionals working with the children in this study, while providing them with appropriate
      wheelchairs to use.
