      -  A population-based prospective study to evaluate clinical behaviour, resectability and
           survival in 1st line metastatic colorectal cancer (CRC) patients in Finland

        -  Primary objective: To assess clinical behaviour of metastatic colorectal cancer and
           overall resectability, postoperative morbidity and outcomes after resection

        -  Secondary objectives: To assess treatments for mCRC; To assess efficacy of chemotherapy
           and targeted drugs with overall response rates (ORR), failure free survival (FFS),
           progression free survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS); To radiologically assess
           tumour density and morphology, and assess alternative radiologic response evaluation in
           comparison with RECIST response criteria; To evaluate whole blood, plasma, serum and
           tumour block biomarkers and DNA polymorphisms that may predict drug effects,
           resectability and clinical behaviour of the tumour

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients with histologically confirmed CRC, who are scheduled to start or are getting
             first line chemotherapy for metastatic disease

          2. Age &gt; 18

          3. Metastatic disease (including locally advanced disease not amenable with surgery
             and/or (chemo)radiotherapy)

          4. Signed written informed consent according to ICH/GCP and the local regulations
             (approved by the Independent Ethics Committee [IEC]) will be obtained prior to study

          5. No informed consent will be obtained from patients participating in the data
             collection study obtaining data from hospital charts. No blood sampling, nor
             contacting of patients will be performed.
