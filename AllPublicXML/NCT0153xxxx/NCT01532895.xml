  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of this study is to evaluate the usefulness of hydromorphone to treat
      cancer pain in patients who have not been treated with a strong opioid.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, prospective, open-label (all people know the identity of the
      intervention) and observational study. Patients selected for the proposed study are patients
      complaining of cancer pain who visit or are hospitalized at the research centers during the
      study, who are not being treated with strong continuous opioid (narcotic medication used
      against the pain), and who require cancer pain control with hydromorphone, at the
      investigator's discretion. The study will evaluate the changes in pain relief, level of sleep
      deprivation, and the patients' quality of life before and after administration of
      hydromorphone.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>The ratio of patients with % PID (Pain Intensity Difference) over 30% of patients from the first evaluation date until the third evaluation date, following the administration of hydromorphone HCI to cancer pain patients</measure>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes in the Karnofsky Performance Rating Scale (KPRS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, and at approximately Days 29 and 57</time_frame>
    <description>The KPRS measures the physical functions of cancer patients, and indicates the feasibility of daily life by 10% units from 0% (death) to 100% (normal status in which patients can do activities to the level before disease without limitations).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in pain relief (%)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, and at approximately Days 29 and 57</time_frame>
    <description>How much pain was relieved by the pain therapy or medication for the last 24 hours, using %: 0%= nothing reduced and 100%= completely reduced.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Frequency of awakening</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, and at approximately Days 29 and 57</time_frame>
    <description>Check whether patients experienced awakening during sleep caused by pain for the last 1 week or not, and measure the frequency (1 = once, 2 = twice, 3 = 3 times, 4 = more than 4 times, 5 = not woken, 6 = never slept).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Level of sleep inconvenience</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, and at approximately Days 29 and 57</time_frame>
    <description>Measure the level of sleep inconvenience that patients experienced due to pain for the last 1 week using the Numeric Rating Scale (NRS); 0 = not causing inconvenience, 10 = completely causing inconvenience.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Satisfaction with sleep</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, and at approximately Days 29 and 57</time_frame>
    <description>Indicate the overall satisfaction with sleep by improving sleep disturbance caused by pain for the last 1 week using the Numeric Rating Scale (0 &quot;never satisfied&quot; on the left end; 10 &quot;very satisfied&quot; on the right end).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Quality of life assessment measured by the EORTC QLQ-C15 PAL</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, and at approximately Days 29 and 57</time_frame>
    <description>The EORTC (European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer) QLQ-C15 (Quality of Life Questionnaire Core 15) is a commonly used questionnaire to assess the quality of life of cancer patients taking paliative medicine. This questionnaire consists of questions measuring physical, role, emotional, cognitive and social functions, and answers are given based on a 4-point scale, from 1 (not at all) to 4 (very much so).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Investigator's Global Assessment</measure>
    <time_frame>At approximately Days 29 and 57</time_frame>
    <description>The investigator's global assessment is used to assess how effective the study drug was for the patients after administration of the study drug since the last evaluation date. It is measured by the investigator from the investigator's point of view as 1 = not effective, 2 = normal l, 3 = effective, 4 very effective, and 5 = extremely effective.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Patient's Global Assessment</measure>
    <time_frame>At approximately Days 29 and 57</time_frame>
    <description>The patient's global assessment is used to assess how effective the study drug was for the patients after administration of the study drug since the last evaluation date. It is measured by the patient from the patient's point of view as 1 = not effective, 2 = normal, 3 = effective, 4 = very effective, and 5 = extremely effective.</description>
