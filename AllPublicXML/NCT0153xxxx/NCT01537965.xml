    <textblock>
      The non-invasive assessment of liver fibrosis in chronic viral hepatitis B and C is now
      entering clinical practice. It is based on blood tests, especially FibroMetre® and Fibrotest®
      and on elastography with the Fibroscan®. Despite the overall satisfactory diagnostic
      performance for all of these tests (AUROC ranging from 0.80 to 0.90 depending on the study)
      for the discrimination of F≤1 versus F≥2, the positive and negative predictive values ,
      however, are far from be perfect in a given patient. With these technique, failures are also
      possible and the measures do not meet quality standards that increase the risk of
      misclassification. It would be particularly useful to have new generation techniques with a
      better diagnostic performance.

      In this project, in response to the problems presented above, we propose to evaluate the
      diagnostic performance of five innovative ultrasonic techniques for the non-invasive
      diagnosis of fibrosis.
