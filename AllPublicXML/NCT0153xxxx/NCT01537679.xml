      This is an 8-week study to determine if meditation or listening to a relaxation CD will be
      effective in reducing depressive symptoms and stress, and in improving memory and cognition
      of caregivers who perform a daily meditation for 12 minutes a day for 8 weeks compared to
      caregivers listening to a relaxation CD for 12 minutes a day for 8 weeks. A second purpose of
      this study is to examine the role of genetic and inflammatory markers in response to
      listening to a relaxation CD and meditation.

             the care-recipient (i.e., spouse or adult child). This criteria will ensure that the
             caregivers had been affected by substantial chronic stress, and they will also meet

             and converse with study personnel.

          3. Caregivers enrolled in the trial could meet the DSM-IVR criteria for minor depression
             or depression not otherwise specified (NOS), but not for other diagnosis of unipolar

             excluded.

          2. Medically unstable, delirious, or terminally ill (e.g. medical illness requiring
             hospitalization or intense outpatient management, such as heart disease; heart attack
             in the past 6 months; Congestive Heart failure; severe heart arrythmias; unstable
             hypertension; poorly controlled diabetes; recent head trauma with loss of
             consciousness; recent stroke with residual neurological symptoms; recent cancer with
             ongoing treatment, or any other medical conditions requiring weekly visits to PCP or
             pending surgery).

          3. Level of suicidal risk precludes safe treatment on an outpatient basis with Hamilton
             Depression rating scale item number 3 rated as = 3.

          4. Subjects reporting daily use of alcohol will be excluded.

          5. Diagnosis of amnestic MCI by the analyses of delayed verbal recall on the California
             Verbal Learning Scale that will be 1.5 SD below the age/education adjusted norms for
             the general population.
