      The purpose of this study is to test if an 8-week mindfulness meditation training (vs a
      wait-list control condition) program reduces neurobehavioral reactivity and improves affect
      regulation in a sample of older adults, as measured by functional magnetic resonance imaging.
      Additionally, we will examine if mindfulness meditation training reduces loneliness and
      markers of chronic inflammation.

    <textblock>
      It is well established that mindfulness meditation interventions improve a wide-range of
      mental and physical health outcomes in stressed patient populations, although the underlying
      mechanisms are currently unknown. It has been suggested that mindfulness training may reduce
      reactivity to stimuli and improve regulation, although these mechanisms have not been
      examined (using functional neuroimaging). Additionally, it is well-established that
      loneliness and inflammation are major risk factors for morbidity and mortality in older
      adults, although it is currently unknown whether mindfulness meditation training may reduce
      these risk factors. The purpose of the proposed study is to test if mindfulness meditation
      training (vs a wait-list control condition) reduces neurobehavioral reactivity and improves
      affect regulation in a sample of healthy older adults, as measured by functional magnetic
      resonance imaging. Additionally, we will examine whether mindfulness meditation training
      reduces loneliness and markers of inflammation.

      Participants will be recruited in the Los Angeles area and randomly assigned to the 8-week
      Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) intervention or to a wait-list. All participants
      will provide a blood sample and complete a psychosocial survey before and after the
      intervention, and complete a 60-minute neuroimaging assessment before and after the MBSR
      program. All participants who are randomly assigned to the wait-list will be offered the MBSR
      intervention after the 8-week intervention period and then complete an additional post-test
      assessment after completing the MBSR program (which will include a blood sample, psychosocial
      survey, and a neuroimaging assessment). Participants will complete neuroimaging tasks (where
      they will be presented with words, pictures, and sounds) before and after receiving the MBSR
      intervention, which will assess neural activity and regulation responses before and after
      mindfulness meditation training.
