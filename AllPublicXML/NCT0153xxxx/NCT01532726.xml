  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, non-interventional, prospective study. The observation period
      comprises at least 6 months, from the initiation of ESL add-on therapy in adult patients with
      partial-onset epilepsy not sufficiently controlled with one AED, until the first visit that
      occurs between 6 and 9 months of follow-up. The observation period will end after 9 months of
      follow-up even if the final assessment is not performed.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      To ensure non-interventional status, the neurologist's decision that it is in the patient's
      best interest to be prescribed with adjunctive ESL has to be made before and independently of
      his/her decision to include the patient in the study. At all circumstances during the study
      the patients will be treated and followed according to routine clinical practice. ESL and
      concomitant medication should be managed by the neurologist according to the respective
      Summary of Product Characteristics (SPC).In order to reflect real-life practice and to ensure
      the observational nature of this study, no fixed time-points for study assessment were
      defined. Intermediate follow-up data will be collected whenever a patient attends to the
      study's neurologist consultation.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Male or female outpatient, 18 years or older;

          -  The patient has an established diagnosis of epilepsy and has experienced at least one
             partial-onset seizure, with or without secondary generalization, within four weeks
             prior to initiation of adjunctive ESL;

          -  The patient is not sufficiently controlled on a current antiepileptic monotherapy and,
             in the neurologist clinical judgment, it is in the patient's best interest to be
             prescribed with adjunctive ESL;

          -  The neurologist's decision to prescribe ESL has been made before and independently of
             his/her decision to include the patient in this study;

          -  The patient's treatment is in accordance with the SPC of ESL;

          -  Written informed consent from the patient (or legally acceptable representative, if
             the subject is unable to provide informed consent).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Known hypersensitivity to the active substance, carboxamide derivatives (e.g.
             oxcarbazepine or carbamazepine) or to any of its excipients;

          -  Patient with 2nd or 3rd degree atrioventricular block;

          -  Patient treated with an experimental drug within four weeks prior to the introduction
             of ESL;
