  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the current report is to investigate the feasibility of transferring the free
      dorsal digital flap, including both dorsal branches of the proper digital nerves (PDNs), to
      reconstruct the volar soft tissue defect of digits. Sensory restoration of the reconstructed
      digit was evaluated via static two-point discrimination (2PD). The range of motion (ROM) of
      the donor middle and ring fingers was measured.

      Sensory restoration of the reconstructed digit was evaluated via static two-point
      discrimination (2PD). The range of motion (ROM) of the donor middle and ring fingers was
      measured. The data were compared with those of the contralateral, uninjured hand.

    <description>The test points were at the centers of the radial and ulnar portions of the digital pulp and the donor sites separately. Each area was tested 3 times with a Dellon-Mackinnon discriminator. Two out of 3 correct answers were considered proof of perception before proceeding to another lower value.</description>

    <description>The dorsal digital flap, including both dorsal branches of the proper digital nerves, was designed on the dorsum of the donor finger between the distal third of the proximal phalanx and the distal interphalangeal joint.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. soft tissue defects in the fingertip, pulp, or volar surface of the digits;

          2. a defect &gt; 2 cm in length;

          3. unavailability of the homodigital and heterodigital island flaps because of
             concomitant injuries to donor fingers; and

          4. the patient refuses to use tissues from the toe.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. soft tissue defects in the dorsum of the digits;

          2. a defect &lt; 2 cm in length;

          3. homodigital and heterodigital island flaps are available.
