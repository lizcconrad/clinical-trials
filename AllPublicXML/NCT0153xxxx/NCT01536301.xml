    <textblock>
      The main objective is to demonstrate that postoperative analgesia by IV oxycodone (compared
      to morphine IV) reduces opioid-related adverse events (nausea, vomiting, pruritus,
      respiratory depression, urinary retention, allergies, hallucination) by 50% in adult patients
      operated on for prosthetic hip surgery.
