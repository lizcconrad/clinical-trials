  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether there is a clinically relevant difference
      in time to tracheal intubation when using fiberoptic bronchoscope as a guide to intubate
      through the Ambu Aura-i or air-Q ILA.

    <textblock>
      The goal of this prospective randomized study is to compare the Ambu Aura-i and air-Q ILA in
      children with normal airway anatomy, in order to evaluate the effectiveness of fiberoptic
      tracheal intubation through these two devices. The ease of placement, fiberoptic grade of
      laryngeal view, time to tracheal intubation, time for device removal after intubation, and
      peri-operative complications will also be assessed.

    <time_frame>participants will be followed for the duration of anesthesia and after surgery, an expected average of 12 hours</time_frame>
    <description>removal will be done with the use of a removal stylet. Should inadvertent extubation occur during removal of the device, the intubation will be deemed a failure.</description>
