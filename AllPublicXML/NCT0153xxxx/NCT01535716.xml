  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Goal-directed hemodynamic and fluid optimizations are shown to be a key factor of the medical
      care during anesthesia.According to medical literature, goal-directed fluid and hemodynamic
      optimizations are more efficient when based on the dynamic parameters than when based on the
      statics ones, and the major dynamic criteria is the cardiac output. Unfortunately,
      transpulmonary thermodilution, the device considered as &quot;The gold standard&quot; to evaluate
      cardiac output is associated with many complications.Furthermore, devices commercialized in
      the past decade were not able to replace the transpulmonary thermodilution.

      As all monitoring devices aren't reliable enough to be widely used in practice they are left
      aside in benefits of the clinical evaluation. Even though, hemodynamic optimization based on
      the analysis of several clinical parameters seems to guarantee good cares thanks to a
      favorable benefits/risks balance, it could be improved by new plug and play mini-invasive
      systems.

      In the investigators opinion, the ECOM system seems able to provide a monitoring tool which
      responds to all the expectations of a modern hemodynamic monitoring device. It uses a well
      known technique, the bioimpedance. The investigators suppose this device should be more
      efficient than the one that has been used before. Indeed, as the system is build on the
      endotracheal tube, it comes closer to the aorta, where all the measures are made, and the
      recorded signal should be less affected by the passage through the surrounding tissues.

      This randomized and controlled trial will study Patients scheduled for elective coronary
      surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass.

      The purpose of this trial is to evaluate the benefits of an intraoperative goal-directed
      hemodynamic therapy based on the ECOM cardiac output measure on mortality and major
      postoperative cardiac morbidity after coronary surgery, when compared with a standard
      management strategy.

      Patients will be allocated into control and ECOM groups, of 50 peoples each. The standard
      management strategy, applied to the control group, will be set and led by the attending
      anesthetist, based on the analysis of further clinical parameters. The ECOM Group will face
      the hemodynamic optimization strategy led by the ECOM evaluation of cardiac output and stroke
      volume variation.

      The main hypothesis is that the hemodynamic strategy led by the ECOM cardiac output measure
      will reduce mortality and morbidity after cardiac surgery.
