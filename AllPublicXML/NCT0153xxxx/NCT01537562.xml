      Today a large proportion of early abortions are medical, in accordance to the woman's choice.
      The main objective of the present study was to compare, in a randomised fashion, initiation
      of intrauterine contraception (IUC) at about 1 week versus 3 to 4 weeks post medical abortion
      with regard to expulsions and safety.
