  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is determine the incidence of metabolic syndrome (MetS) in people
      of high risk, of 40 or more years and attended in the Primary Care. Evaluating the
      association between anxiety, depression, quality of life and the vital stressful events, and
      the development of the metabolic syndrome in general population.

      Our hypothesis is that population of the cohort with bigger degree of stress will develop
      earlier the metabolic syndrome.

      If our hypothesis about the metabolic syndrome are demonstrated, it would allow establishing
      in a future interventions on these factors of risk to prevent or to decrease the incidence of
      this syndrome in the Primary Care.
