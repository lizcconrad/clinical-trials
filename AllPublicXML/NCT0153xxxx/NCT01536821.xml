  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The PROGENI Family Study is part of a larger consortium that is studying a gene shown to be
      important in Parkinson's disease, called LRRK2. People who have a defect in the LRRK2 gene
      will often develop Parkinson's disease. Eligible participants will be asked to complete a
      single Study Visit at an affiliated research facility closest to their home.

      Participants will be asked to complete a family history questionnaire, which will gather
      information about their family history of Parkinson's disease and related disorders. They
      will be asked to complete a single Study Visit, during which they will be asked to do some or
      all of the following:

        1. Complete questionnaires regarding Parkinson's disease symptoms, medical history, mood,
           sleep, mental status, and activity level.

        2. Be given a brief standard neurological examination.

        3. Be given a scratch and sniff smell identification test.

        4. Be asked to give a sample of approximately 2 tablespoons of blood.

        5. Be asked to give a urine sample of approximately 1 tablespoon of urine.
