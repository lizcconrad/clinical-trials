  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single center, prospective, open label, single arm, investigator initiated pilot
      study investigating the effect of alitretinoin on severe lichen planus with mucosal
      manifestations. The target population comprises patients with MLP for at least 3 months, with
      or without LP lesions on other areas of the skin, who are refractory to topical therapy and
      standard skin care, and who are otherwise in good health. Patients will be recruited at the
      outpatient clinic of the dermatology department, University hospital Zurich.The planned
      duration of the study is 2 years. A total of 20 patients will be included. Patients who meet
      enrolment criteria will receive 30mg alitretinoin, given orally as gelatin capsules, once
      daily for 24 weeks. Dose interruptions are permitted in response to adverse effects,
      consistent with use of retinoids and the product label.

      Most clinical evaluations will be performed every 4 weeks. A safety follow-up visit is
      planned 4 weeks after the end of treatment. Further follow-up visits will be conducted 16 and
      24 weeks after end of treatment in those patients meeting the primary endpoint

    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The primary objective is to determine the efficacy of alitretinoin (Toctino®) in reducing signs and symptoms of severe mucosal lichen planus with respect to the proportion of responders based on the, Escudier score of oral lesions at baseline and after 24 weeks of treatment or at the latest assessment for patients who withdrew prematurely (Last Observation Carried Forward, LOCF). Response is defined as a 50 % reduction in the total Escudier score compared to the baseline values.</description>
