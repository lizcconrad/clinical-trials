  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The field of psychiatric rehabilitation focuses on creating a personal narrative and
      developing coping strategies and environmental supports. The concept of recovery is
      person-centered and emphasizes the person's ability to change and to live meaningful life.
      The strengths approach has a central role in the recovery concept, emphasizing the person's
      abilities and potential. A preserved cognitive ability can be a significant strength in the
      recovery process.

      Research had shown growing support for the use of cognitive-behavioral approaches as the most
      effective therapy for people with borderline personality disorder, using structured
      interventions. A central focus in cognitive therapy is the change of maladaptive schemes. The
      dynamic-cognitive intervention (DCI) is based on the understanding of structural cognitive
      modifiability and suggests the use of mediated learning in order to enhance sense of
      competence and develop better psychological coping skills.

      The present study will focus on women diagnosed with borderline personality disorder, with
      normative cognitive ability seen as a strength as opposed to their emotional ability. This
      study will examine the effects of a Dynamic Cognitive Intervention on recovery measures and
      on symptoms severity.

      The study will include 30 women aged 18-45 years. Participants will be randomly assigned to
      an intervention group and a control group. All participants will be assessed before and after
      intervention using Recovery Assessment Scale, Hope Scale and The Brief Symptom Inventory.

      The intervention designed for this study is based on the principles of the Dynamic Cognitive
      Intervention. The intervention tools that will be used include: a. Instrumental Enrichment
      tools. b. life events analysis. c. Stories, lyrics and movie clips. d. Worksheets. The
      intervention encompasses 12 sessions of 1.5 hours, with a routine structure.

      The results are expected to contribute to the understanding of the impact of a dynamic
      cognitive intervention in women diagnosed with borderline personality disorder.
