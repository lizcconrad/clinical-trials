  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Breast cancer patients who smoke, are at greater risk for treatment complications. The
      purpose of this study is to see if the researchers can find ways to help patients who have
      breast cancer quit smoking. They will compare two ways to help people quit smoking. Some
      patients will receive varenicline, a prescription medicine also known as Chantix,Â®. Other
      patients will receive a placebo drug. A placebo is an inactive substance that contains no
      medicine. All patients will receive smoking cessation counseling provided by our tobacco
      treatment specialists. They hope that what the researchers learn from this study will help us
      improve our smoking cessation treatment program for breast cancer patients.

    <description>To conduct a double-blind, randomized clinical trial to obtain pilot data on the the effectiveness of Intervention (varenicline and behavioral smoking cessation counseling) and Control (placebo and behavioral smoking cessation counseling) with regard to tobacco (smoking) cessation outcomes (point abstinence, continuous abstinence) in tobaccodependent breast cancer patients.</description>

We will primarily use descriptive statistics to summarize the rates of surgical complications among tobacco dependent breast cancer patients, as indicated by the prevalence of surgical complications (i.e., occurrence of infection, skin flap necrosis, reconstructive flap failure, seroma, and hematoma) documented in the patient's medical record.</description>

    <description>Pts will receive the standard 12-week dosing regimen consisting of 1 mg po of study drug twice daily for 11 weeks,along with smoking cessation counseling, for 11 weeks with an initial dose titration to full strength during the 1st week as follows: 0.5 mg po once daily for 3 days titrated to 0.5mg po twice daily for 4 days. 154 pills will be supplied for the 12 week tx. In order to compensate for any accidentally dropped or lost pills during the study duration, a total of 175 pills will be given to the patient. Along with smoking cessation counseling, for 11 weeks. Pts will receive their medication from the MSK Pharmacy &amp; equivalent dosing &amp; side effect education from our Tobacco Cessation Nurse Practitioner. Tx with the study drug will begin after the initial counseling session. Physicians &amp; tobacco cessation nurses will be blinded regarding pts' assignment to medication or placebo tx arm. Likewise, pts will not be informed as to which medication condition they have been assigned.</description>
