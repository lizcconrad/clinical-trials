  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a null hypothesis study. The investigators hypothesize that there will be no
      difference in changes in dynamic compliance when measured at 15, 30, 45 and 60 minute
      intervals after administration of either surfactant and there will be no differences in the
      number of doses needed between the two surfactants in premature infants admitted to our NICU.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Premature newborn infants may have impaired lung function as a result of their prematurity.
      When this occurs, the newborns show poor oxygen and carbon dioxide exchange and difficulty in
      breathing. The reason for these symptoms is due in part to the lack of special chemicals in
      the lungs, called phospholipids or surfactant. The lack of these special chemicals causes the
      babies lung to be difficult to ventilate. Treatment of this condition can require placing an
      artificial airway (endotracheal tube) into the babies windpipe (intubation) and use of a
      breathing machine (ventilator). In addition, physicians frequently give these special
      chemicals (phospholipid) through the childs airway. There are several different types of
      phospholipids available for this treatment in newborns but very limited amount of studies
      have been done to examine differences in the ability to ventilate between the various types
      of surfactant. The investigators propose to examine immediate changes in ability to ventilate
      (dynamic compliance) at specific time intervals after administration of either type of
      surfactant; Curosurf or Survanta.
