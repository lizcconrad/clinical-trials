      The purpose of this research is to determine what supplemental doses of vitamin D may be
      necessary to raise serum levels to optimal levels and how vitamin D supplementation and
      changes in vitamin D status impact cardiovascular risk factors in schoolchildren.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Research suggests that vitamin D, known mainly for its role in bone health, may have other
      roles in the body and that vitamin D deficiency may contribute to certain chronic diseases,
      such as cardiovascular disease. Recently, vitamin D has received growing attention due to the
      increased awareness of possible deficiencies among certain populations at risk of vitamin D
      deficiency. Most circulating 25-hydroxyvitamin D comes from exposure to UVB rays in natural
      sunlight. In 2010, the Institute of Medicine issued new recommendations that daily vitamin D
      intakes should be increased to 600 IU/day for children ages 1-18. However, even with these
      recommendations in place, roughly 20% of all children are below the recommended 20 ng/mL.
      Moreover, more than two-thirds of all children have levels below 30 ng/mL, including 80% of
      Hispanic children and 92% of non-Hispanic black children. Therefore, it is imperative to gain
      an understanding of: 1) what supplemental doses may be necessary for schoolchildren who are
      already at a disadvantage in achieving optimal levels of 25(OH)D due to factors such as
      living at a northern latitude, having high obesity rates, and where a large proportion of the
      population are Latino or African American; and 2) whether serum concentrations of 25(OH)D
      over 30 ng/mL in children prevent health risks.
