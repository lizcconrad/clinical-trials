  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this trial is to determine if wounds with elevated protease activity (EPA)
      treated with targeted interventions such as protease modulating therapies can improve
      clinical and economic outcomes.

      It is hypothesized that protease modulating dressings may provide significantly better
      clinical outcomes on EPA wounds over current standard of care.
