  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a diagnostic validation study for a combined Syphilis/HIV test made by MBio
      Diagnostics, Inc (MBio, Boulder, CO, USA). Although the MBio Syphilis/HIV diagnostic platform
      is designed for use at point of care (POC), it is made to provide similar performance as
      reference standards. Diagnosing HIV and syphilis accurately with a single POC test will save
      time for clinic health workers and technicians, reduce loss-to follow-up caused by lengthy
      delays for lab-based tests, and save costs by eliminating the need for multiple tests. For
      this study, the sensitivity and specificity of the MBio HIV/Syphilis Serology System
      point-of-care diagnostic test will be determined using reference tests performed under
      controlled laboratory conditions. For this, clients receiving routine care in the ANCs at the
      New Nyanza Provincial General Hospital (NNPGH) and Kisumu District Hospital (KDH) will be
      consented to provide blood for the proposed study. Study volunteers will receive HIV and
      syphilis rapid tests provided as part of routine care, and will donate an additional blood
      for evaluating the MBio test against the reference tests in a laboratory setting. This study
      is an investigational prototype, not for product registration. The results from this study
      will be used to inform product development of a second iteration of the MBio device design.
      At the time that the device is ready to be registered, it will undergo another field
      evaluation at which time it will be submitted to the appropriate regulatory body. Because the
      MBIO device is an HIV test, the device would be submitted to National AIDS &amp; STI Control
      Program (NASCOP), which is the appropriate regulatory body for HIV tests in Kenya.
