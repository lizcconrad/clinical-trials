  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objectives of the study were:

        -  To assess the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of YF476 in healthy volunteers.

        -  To select a dose or doses of YF476 for detailed pharmacodynamic studies in healthy
           volunteers.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      YF476 is clearly a potent and selective gastrin/CCK-B antagonist and should inhibit basal and
      meal-stimulated gastric acid secretion and enhance gastric emptying of a liquid meal in man.
      Therefore YF476 might benefit patients with reflux oesophagitis. The compound has been
      remarkably well tolerated in animal toxicity studies at doses well in excess of the projected
      therapeutic dose in patients, and merits first administration to healthy volunteers. That
      study using the oral route of administration is described here. Extrapolation from data
      obtained with pentagastrin in animals suggest that single doses of less than 1mg of YF476
      should be active in man. However, extrapolation from data obtained in comparative studies
      with the H2-antagonists and with omeprazole in animals suggest that the therapeutic dose in
      patients with reflux oesophagitis will be larger, in the region of 10mg. A range of single
      doses will be used in this study. The maximum dose will be 10 times more than the expected
      therapeutic dose.

    <description>Two groups of six subjects received single rising oral doses of YF476 capsules or matching placebo. Each subject received 2 doses of YF476 and 1 dose of placebo. 4 subjects received active and 2 placebo at each dose level, as follows:
Group A YF476 0.5, 25 and 100mg by mouth Group B YF476 5.0, 50 and 100mg by mouth
Groups A &amp; B were dosed alternately, at weekly intervals</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Male and aged 18-45 years.

          -  No clinically relevant abnormal findings in the clinical history or physical
             examination at the screening assessment which could interfere with the objectives of
             the study or make the subject's participation hazardous.

          -  No clinically relevant abnormal laboratory values at the screening evaluation
             (Attachment 2).

          -  A normal ECG at the screening examination.

          -  A body mass index (Quetelet index) in the range 19-30:

          -  Body Mass Index = weight [kg]_ height [m]2

          -  Normal blood pressure and heart rate at the screening examination, i.e. BP 90-150mmHg
             systolic, 40-95mmHg diastolic; heart rate 40-100 beats/min in seated position.

          -  Subjects must be of sufficient intelligence to understand the nature of the study and
             any hazards of their participation in it. They must be able to communicate
             satisfactorily with the Investigator and to participate in, and comply with the
             requirements of, the entire study.
