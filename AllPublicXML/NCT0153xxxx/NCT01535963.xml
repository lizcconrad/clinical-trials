    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to measure the overall level of satisfaction in
      patients after cutaneous surgery in 4 different categories, including the surgeon, facility,
      procedure and recovery and outcome.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Secondary objectives are to identify factors associated with patient satisfaction level and
      determine the correlation between patient satisfaction and surgeon clinical perception.

    <time_frame>at time of visit</time_frame>
    <description>Subjects will rate their satisfaction after cutaneous surgery in 4 different categories using 0-10 visual analog scales. The scale will be ~100 millimeters in length and each response will be given a value in millimeters. In addition, patients will answer an open-ended question about their level of satisfaction. Data will also be compared to previous data from patients after cutaneous surgery in the literature.</description>

    <measure>Patient ranking</measure>
    <time_frame>at time of visit</time_frame>
    <description>Subjects will rank the factors determining satisfaction in order of importance using a ranking system for each aspect of care. In addition, the surgeon will rate their satisfaction level and give their perception on patient satisfaction and communication level using 0-10 visual analog scales</description>
