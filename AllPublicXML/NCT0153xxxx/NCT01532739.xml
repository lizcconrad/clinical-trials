    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the feasibility and effectiveness of a cognitive
      training group in individuals with Mild Cognitive Impairment, using a new paradigm that will
      optimize ecological validity by (1) focusing on everyday memory problems, (2) supplementing
      traditional memory training with the teaching of an empirically-supported problem-solving
      approach, and (3) employing a clinically representative sample of individuals with MCI (e.g.,
      not excluding those with mild affective symptoms).

    <description>The cognitive training consists of 10 weekly 2-hour sessions. It is run with groups of MCI participants and their study partners (who help with reinforcing the strategies in everyday activities). The program provides information about memory and lifestyle factors in the first two weeks, followed by training and practice over the next eight weeks on empirically-supported cognitive strategies known to be effective at supporting day-to-day remembering in MCI. Participants learn to apply a core set of strategies (spaced retrieval, memory book logging) across a variety of common memory problems (e.g., remembering names, appointments, etc). To enhance the likelihood that these strategies will transfer to other settings beyond training, participants are also taught a memory problem solving approach that will cue them to recognize situations in which they need to: (1) stop and remember something, (2) select and apply an appropriate memory strategy, and (3) monitor that it is working.</description>
