  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Recent advances in understanding the biology and genetics of renal cell carcinoma (RCC) have
      led to major therapeutic implications. Von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) gene inactivation, present in
      the majority of sporadic forms of RCC, leads to a defective VHL protein, followed by an
      active transcription of hypoxia-inducible genes, including vascular endothelial growth factor
      (VEGF), platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), c-kit, and others. However, the concept of VHL
      inactivation in RCC and the subsequent malignant phenotype is almost exclusively seen in
      patients with clear cell histology.

      The data about efficacy of VEGF receptor inhibitors for non-clear cell RCC (NCRCC) is rare
      until now. Recently, however, sunitinib and sorafenib showed its worth for NCRCC in extended
      access programs.1-3 Although it is not certain, the underlying mechanism of their action
      might lie in that papillary, chromophobe, and sarcomatoid type overexpress c-kit, which is
      also a target of both drugs and could therefore provide a therapeutic target for non-clear
      cell subtypes.4-7 Pazopanib is also a potent and selective, orally available, small molecule
      inhibitor of VEGFR-1,-2, and -3, PDGF-α, PDGF-β, and c-kit tyrosine kinases. It has been
      validated and licensed for advanced clear cell RCC (CCRCC).8 However, there is very few data
      about its efficacy for NCRCC.

      In this study, we try to evaluate the efficacy of pazopanib in metastatic NCRCC.
