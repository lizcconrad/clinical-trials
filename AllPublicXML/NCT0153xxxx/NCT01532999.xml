  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Currently, veterans with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) are typically treated with
      antidepressants which have limited efficacy and yield extremely low remission rates. New and
      improved treatments are sorely needed, especially in light of the inadequate evidence to
      support the efficacy of most pharmacologic and most psychotherapy treatments for PTSD.
      Complementary and Alternative Medicine practices, such as meditation, may fill this void.
      Several other illnesses often found in association with PTSD, such as chronic pain, anxiety,
      and depression, have shown positive response to meditation, specifically Mindfulness Based
      Stress Reduction (MBSR). MBSR is manualized program involving 8 weekly classes and a single
      6-hour silent retreat session based on a systematic procedure to develop enhanced
      non-reactive awareness of the moment-to-moment experience of perceptible mental processes.
      MBSR is well tolerated, already well disseminated. MBSR has been shown to be effective in
      reducing conditions that are commonly associated with PTSD, including pain, depression,
      anxiety and panic, and insomnia. The investigators are conducting a multisite study of
      Mindfulness Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) compared to Present Centered Group Therapy (PCGT)
      for the treatment of PTSD. The primary aim of this study will be to determine how well the
      MBSR form of meditation, i.e. MBSR, works to treat symptoms of PTSD in veterans compared to
      PCGT. The investigators will evaluate the effects of treatment on levels of mindfulness,
      depression, PTSD symptom clusters, and response rates. The investigators will evaluate
      veterans' satisfaction and acceptability of the MBSR intervention. Additionally, biomarkers
      will be utilized to aid in our understanding of the pathophysiology of meditation and explore
      the relationship between treatment outcome and neuroimmune response.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is a prospective, randomized (1:1), controlled multisite study of MBSR in 180
      veterans with PTSD. The investigators will compare the clinical outcomes of MBSR to a
      credible group therapy control condition called Present Centered Group Therapy (PCGT). The
      investigators will to evaluate the efficacy of MBSR in the treatment of PTSD, as defined by
      the Clinician Administered PTSD Scale (CAPS), a gold standard measure that is clinically
      relevant to PTSD. The CAPS will be rated by a trained assessor who is blind to the whether or
      not the participant receives the MBSR or PCGT intervention. Secondarily, the investigators
      will evaluate the effects of MBSR on mindfulness, depression, PTSD symptom clusters, rates of
      response and evaluate the safety and tolerability of MBRS. The investigators will also
      explore the subjects' acceptance of and satisfaction with MBSR, whether or not the subjects'
      treatment preference influences outcome; the stress-immunological-biomarkers as they relate
      to treatment outcome; and the durability of therapeutic effects of MBSR in the treatment of
      PTSD.

      Study Design Overview: Male and female subjects from Active Duty, Reserves, National Guard
      and/or Veterans with a diagnosis of PTSD will be prospectively randomized 1:1 to receive
      either MBSR Group therapy or Present Centered Therapy (PCGT) Group (control) for 8 weeks. A
      cluster of at least 12 participants will be randomized individually to either MBRS or PCGT
      group therapies, which results in at least 6 participants in each intervention group. A total
      of 30 groups (15 MBSR Groups and 15 PCGT Groups) are anticipated across three clinical
      research sites involving at least three different MBSR and three different PCGT
      instructors/therapists. Outcome assessments (single-blind CAPS and self-report measures) will
      be obtained at baseline, week 3, week 6, and week 9 (primary endpoint). These assessments
      will be repeated post-acute treatment at week 16 as an exploratory measure of short-term
      durability effects.

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Clinician Administered PTSD Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to week 9</time_frame>
    <description>Clinician Administered PTSD Scale (CAPS) is a 17-item standard rating scale that measures PTSD severity with scores ranging from 0-136 (higher score = more severe). Scores of frequency and intensity are summed for the 17-items to yield the total CAPS score.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in PTSD Checklist (PCL)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to week 9</time_frame>
    <description>PTSD Checklist (PCL) is a 17-item self-report scale intended to measure PTSD symptom severity. The PCL has demonstrated excellent internal consistency (alpha = .94-.97), and test-retest reliability over 2 to 3 days was .96 for Vietnam veterans. Respondents rate each item from 1 (&quot;not at all&quot;) to 5 (&quot;extremely&quot;) to indicate the degree to which they have been bothered by that particular symptom over the past month. Thus, total possible scores (items summed) range from 17 to 85 (higher score is more severe). A cut-off score of 50 indicates a probable diagnosis of PTSD.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Five Facet Mindfulness Questionnaire (FFMQ)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to week 9</time_frame>
    <description>Five Facet Mindfulness Questionnaire (FFMQ) is used to evaluate the effects of MBSR vs. PCGT on mindfulness (S1). The FFMQ is a 39-item self-report instrument that assesses the general tendency to be mindful in daily life through 5 facets: observing, describing, acting with awareness, non-judging of inner experience, non-reactivity to inner experience. Increases in FFMQ mediate improvements in well being in observational studies of MBSR. Each item is rated 1 to 5 (&quot;never or very rarely true&quot; to &quot;very often or always true&quot;). Some of the items are reverse scored (R). Scoring Information: Observe items:1, 6, 11, 15, 20, 26, 31, 36; Describe items: 2, 7, 12R, 16R, 22R, 27, 32, 37; Act with Awareness items: 5R, 8R, 13R, 18R, 23R, 28R, 34R, 38R; Nonjudge items: 3R, 10R, 14R, 17R, 25R, 30R, 35R, 39R; Nonreact items: 4, 9, 19, 21, 24, 29, 33. Total all subscales for score (higher score = greater degree of mindfulness). Score range 39-195 with higher=more mindfulness.</description>

The PCL has demonstrated excellent internal consistency (alpha = .94-.97), and test-retest reliability over 2 to 3 days was .96 for Vietnam veterans. Respondents rate each item from 1 (&quot;not at all&quot;) to 5 (&quot;extremely&quot;) to indicate the degree to which they have been bothered by that particular symptom over the past month. Thus, total possible scores (items summed) range from 17 to 85 (higher score is more severe). A cut-off score of 50 indicates a probable diagnosis of PTSD.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Five Facet Mindfulness Questionnaire (FFMQ)</title>
        <description>Five Facet Mindfulness Questionnaire (FFMQ) is used to evaluate the effects of MBSR vs. PCGT on mindfulness (S1). The FFMQ is a 39-item self-report instrument that assesses the general tendency to be mindful in daily life through 5 facets: observing, describing, acting with awareness, non-judging of inner experience, non-reactivity to inner experience. Increases in FFMQ mediate improvements in well being in observational studies of MBSR. Each item is rated 1 to 5 (&quot;never or very rarely true&quot; to &quot;very often or always true&quot;). Some of the items are reverse scored (R). Scoring Information: Observe items:1, 6, 11, 15, 20, 26, 31, 36; Describe items: 2, 7, 12R, 16R, 22R, 27, 32, 37; Act with Awareness items: 5R, 8R, 13R, 18R, 23R, 28R, 34R, 38R; Nonjudge items: 3R, 10R, 14R, 17R, 25R, 30R, 35R, 39R; Nonreact items: 4, 9, 19, 21, 24, 29, 33. Total all subscales for score (higher score = greater degree of mindfulness). Score range 39-195 with higher=more mindfulness.</description>
