  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label (both the physician and healthy volunteer know which medication will be
      administered), single-dose, 5-dosing period study to characterize the pharmacokinetics
      (process by which oxycodone is absorbed, distributed, metabolized, and eliminated by the
      body) and the effects of food on the pharmacokinetics of oxycodone. The study will take place
      over approximately two and a half months and will consist of three phases: a screening visit
      to determine eligibility for the study, a 5-dosing period treatment phase, and an
      end-of-study visit.
