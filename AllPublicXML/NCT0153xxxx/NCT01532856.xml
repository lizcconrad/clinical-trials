  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This protocol is an international, multicenter, comparative, open and randomized study
      designed to compare the safety and efficacy (in terms of response rate) from three induction
      chemotherapy schemes -Thalidomide/Cyclophosphamide/Dexamethasone versus
      Thalidomide/Dexamethasone versus Thalidomide/Melphalan/Prednisone. Finally, this study is
      also designed to compare the safety and efficacy (in terms of duration of response) of two
      maintenance chemotherapy regimens - Thalidomide/Prednisone versus Thalidomide. Each treatment
      arm will include 100 patients and assessments and scheduled visits will be conducted in three
      periods: Pre-treatment, treatment and monitoring. Security will be evaluated by monitoring
      all adverse events, physical examination, vital signs and biochemical studies. Response to
      treatment will be evaluated according to the EBMT21 criteria and will be assessed on day 1 of
      each cycle of induction, at the end of nine cycles of induction therapy and monthly during
      the first year of maintenance therapy and every 3 months thereafter.
