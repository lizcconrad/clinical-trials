  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hypercapnia derives increase of cerebral blood flow and cardiac output. It means that the
      rate of propofol elimination from the brain and the blood will be increased and the patient
      will awake more quickly. There has been no study about the effects of hypercapnia. The
      investigators will evaluate hypercapnia's effects on the recovery time from propofol
      anesthesia.

    <description>After stopping propofol infusion, every 30 seconds, the investigator (caregiver) will command the patient, &quot;Open your eyes&quot;. When the patient opens eyes, the time will be recorded. The patients will be followed for an expected average of 10 minutes.</description>

    <time_frame>From cessation of propofol infusion to patient's spontaneous breathing (sec)</time_frame>
    <description>The time from cessation of propofol infusion to patient's spontaneous breaths will be recorded. The patients will be followed for an expected average of 10 minutes.</description>

    <measure>Change of bispectral index (BIS)</measure>
    <time_frame>From the cessation of propofol infusion to extubation, BIS and time (seconds) will be recorded.</time_frame>
    <description>After stopping propofol infusion, the BIS and time (seconds) will be recorded and reviewed. These will be recorded for an expected average of 15 minutes.</description>

    <measure>Time to open mouth under investigator's command</measure>
    <time_frame>From cessation of propofol infusion to patient's mouth opening (seconds)</time_frame>
    <description>After the patient opens the eyes, every 10 seconds, the investigator command the patient, &quot;Open your mouth.&quot;. When the patient opens mouth, the time will be recorded. The patients will be followed for an expected average of 12 minutes.</description>

    <measure>Time to extubation</measure>
    <time_frame>From cessation of propofol infusion to extubation (sec)</time_frame>
    <description>After stopping propofol infusion, When the patient breaths spontaneously with adequate tidal volume and respiratory rates, the trachea will be extubated and the time will be recorded. The patients will be followed for an expected average of 15 minutes.</description>
