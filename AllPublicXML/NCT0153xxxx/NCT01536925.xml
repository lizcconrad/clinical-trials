  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research deals with behaviors that are part of opioid dependence. The purpose is to
      study the extent to which stress and other factors, including money and amount of work
      effort, affect opioid choice. Specifically, the investigators will examine the effects of
      three issues/factors. The first is how hard participants are willing to work to obtain an
      opioid drug; the second is how much opioid drug would participants choose instead of money;
      and the third factor is how much participant's opioid drug choices are influenced after they
      are administered the drugs yohimbine and hydrocortisone, both of which could produce
      stress-like symptoms.

      Phase 1: Participants will first be an outpatient and must come to the Tolan Park Medical
      Building daily to receive buprenorphine doses. This phase will last at least 10 days or
      longer. Three times per week during the first two weeks (i.e., on 6 different days),
      participants will be asked to provide urine samples and to complete questionnaires that ask
      about opiate withdrawal symptoms.

      Phase 2: Participants will then live on an inpatient research unit (located in Detroit
      Michigan) for at least 16 consecutive nights and possibly up to 18 consecutive nights.
      Participants will continue on the same dose of buprenorphine as in phase 1.

      During this stay they will participate in a total of 11 experimental sessions. Participants
      will take part in multiple trials in which they have the opportunity to choose drug,
      hydromorphone, or money. Hydromorphone is a heroin-like opioid. During the first two test
      sessions, participants will receive a sample of the drug doses that can be chosen. Before
      each of the final 9 test sessions begin, participants will be given a capsule containing
      either different doses of the drug yohimbine or a placebo (blank). Yohimbine is a drug that
      has been shown to produce a &quot;stress&quot;-like response in humans. Then participants will be given
      a capsule that contains either different doses of the drug hydrocortisone or a placebo
      (blank). Hydrocortisone is also a drug that can produce a &quot;stress&quot;-like response in humans.
      Then participants will have the opportunity to choose either drug or money by using a
      computer to earn choices. Respiration rate, oxygen saturation, heart rate, and blood pressure
      will be monitored throughout choice trials. Self-report questionnaires will be completed at
      different times during the study.

      Phase 3: After participants have completed the experimental procedures, they will again come
      to the Tolan Park Medical Building daily to receive buprenorphine doses. The dose of
      buprenorphine will be gradually decreased so that they will eventually be free from
      medication. This will take three weeks. We will administer questionnaires and collect urine
      samples three times each week.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Opioid dependent, as determined by structured clinical interview for DSM-IV (SCID) and
             Addiction Severity Index (ASI)

          -  Positive urine test for opiates

          -  Willing to use an adequate form of contraception for the duration of the study.

          -  Reads and writes English

          -  Participants must be in generally good health to be eligible. All candidates will
             receive a routine medical exam (history and physical) with standard laboratory tests
             (including blood and urine samples, EKG, mandatory TB testing, and voluntary HIV
             testing).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  No candidate who has a current DSM-IV Axis I disorder other than Drug Dependence or a
             history of serious psychiatric problems (e.g. psychosis, bipolar or major depression)
             will be allowed to participate.

          -  Candidates meeting criteria for opioid or nicotine dependence will not be excluded,
             but those with other Substance Dependence disorders will be excluded. Those with Abuse
             of Alcohol, Cannabis, Cocaine, or Benzodiazepines will not be excluded, but
             participants must provide an alcohol free breath specimen, and a benzodiazepine free
             urine sample.

          -  No candidate with medical (neurological, cardiovascular, pulmonary or systemic)
             disorders will be allowed to participate. This will be determined with history and
             physical exam, standard laboratory testing (blood and urine), EKG, and TB tests (to
             avoid transmitting this communicable disease on the residential unit or in the
             laboratory).

          -  Candidates with evidence of cognitive impairment (based on reading ability and
             comprehension, will be excluded.

          -  Female candidates who are pregnant (urine pregnancy test), lactating, or not using
             adequate birth control methods (self-report) will be excluded.

          -  Candidates with injection phobia, or seeking treatment for opioid dependence will be
             excluded.
