    <textblock>
      Low income mothers of young children represent a disadvantaged group who are at exceptional
      risk for depressive syndromes and who have increasingly limited access to mental health
      services. The proposed project is designed to evaluate Mom-Net, an internet-facilitated
      cognitive-behavioral(CBT) intervention for depression, adapted from Lewinsohn's Coping with
      Depression Course, and tailored to mothers of young children. Mom-Net, which was developed
      and piloted in an recently completed NIMH-funded investigation (MH070426), was designed to
      overcome the substantial barriers to treatment participation that exist for mothers
      experiencing economic hardship and those in rural communities. Though the pilot trial
      demonstrated that the program was very effective in reducing depressive symptoms and related
      difficulties, it was conducted under the 'idealized' conditions typical of initial
      intervention tests (e.g., computers and internet connections were supplied to all
      participants; access to the internet was provided by a single browser; coaches who provided
      weekly phone support were research staff, and initial recruitment and motivational interviews
      sessions were conducted via home visits to participants). These conditions likely facilitated
      recruitment and retention of participants, as well as ease and fidelity of treatment
      delivery. Thus one goal of the current project is to evaluate the intervention under
      conditions that are closer to those of real-world service providers and recipients. The
      current project is also intended to provide a more rigorous test of the intervention than did
      the pilot in a number of ways. Participants in the pilot trial will be 300 mothers of 3-5
      year old children recruited through Head Start classrooms and prescreened for the presence of
      elevated depressive symptoms.Subsequent to the pre-intervention assessment, participants will
      be randomized to either the intervention or facilitated usual care (FUC) condition. The
      evaluation of the intervention will focus on maternal depressive symptoms, parenting
      behavior, and child adjustment. Two follow-up assessments (at 12-month and 24-month
      intervals) will enable us to examine maintenance of effects. Overall, the investigation will
      contribute to the evidentiary base regarding the dissemination potential of this
      empirically-supported intervention, adaptations to which have the potential to enable a
      greater proportion of the population to access and benefit from it.

    <description>Participants in the randomized trial will be 300 mothers of 3-5 year old children recruited through Head Start (HS) classrooms and screened for the presence of major or minor depression. Subsequent to the pre-intervention assessment, participants will be randomized, with an allocation ratio of 1:1, to either the Mom-Net (MN) intervention or facilitated usual care (FUC) condition. Participants in the MN condition will receive the Mom-Net intervention. The Mom-Net program is an internet-facilitated cognitive-behavioral intervention for depression, adapted from the CWDC, and tailored to mothers of young children. Participants in both conditions will receive Booster calls during the follow-up period.</description>

    <description>Participants in the FUC condition will receive assistance in accessing mental health interventions through community providers that serve low-income individuals. In order to control for the supportive attention provided to mothers in the MN condition by the weekly coach calls, mothers in the FUC condition will receive weekly check-in calls from research staff during the intervention period. Participants in both conditions will receive Booster calls during the follow-up period.</description>

    <description>The Mom-Net intervention is an internet-facilitated cognitive-behavioral intervention for depression, adapted from the CWDC, and tailored to mothers of young children. Mom-Net has several core components: 1. A guided course for self-regulated learning of CBT skills. 2. A system of professional support in which coaches provide weekly 15-20 min phone check-ins (coach calls) in order to encourage and facilitate progress through the intervention and respond rapidly to participant queries and emergencies. In this regard, coaches benefited from: a) a 'behind the scenes&quot; administration page on the website that enabled them to track participants' progress through the intervention and use this information to tailor coaching sessions; and b) an automated system for alerting coaches/supervisors when participants were in crisis. 3. A coach-moderated bulletin board that approximated the social support provided by group administration.</description>
