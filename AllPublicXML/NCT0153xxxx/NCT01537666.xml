      The study is carried out to evaluate the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of
      AeroVanc inhalation powder in healthy volunteers, and in patients with cystic fibrosis.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study has three main objectives:

        -  To evaluate the safety, and tolerability of AeroVanc inhalation powder in healthy
           volunteers, and in patients with CF.

        -  To determine the systemic bioavailability of vancomycin in healthy volunteers following
           single dose pulmonary administration of 16 mg, 32 mg, and 80 mg doses of AeroVanc in
           comparison with a 250 mg dose of vancomycin administered intravenously.

        -  To estimate the lung sputum concentrations of vancomycin in patients with cystic
           fibrosis (CF) following single dose pulmonary administration of 32 mg and 80 mg doses of
           AeroVanc.

    <measure>Safety and Tolerability - Number of Participants With Treatment Emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs = Adverse Events That Started During or After the First Dose of Study Drug)</measure>
    <time_frame>Healthy volunteers = 2 weeks; CF Patients = 1 week</time_frame>
    <description>Each participant was monitored regularly for Adverse Events (AEs) throughout the study. The Investigator or designee enquired about AEs by asking participants non-leading questions such as: &quot;How do you feel?&quot; or &quot;Have you had any (other) medical problems since your last visit/assessment?&quot; Additionally, several safety procedures (physical examinations, vital signs, safety laboratory tests, 12-lead ECGs, and spirometry) were conducted on participants at regular intervals. All AEs reported spontaneously by participants or in response to questioning or observation by the Investigator, including those related to safety procedures, were recorded. For each AE, the Investigator recorded the following assessments: seriousness, severity (Mild, Moderate, or Severe), and relationship to study drug (Not Related, Remote, Possible, Probable, or Highly Probable). AEs were considered drug-related if given a relationship of Possible, Probable, or Highly Probable.</description>

        <title>Safety and Tolerability - Number of Participants With Treatment Emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs = Adverse Events That Started During or After the First Dose of Study Drug)</title>
        <description>Each participant was monitored regularly for Adverse Events (AEs) throughout the study. The Investigator or designee enquired about AEs by asking participants non-leading questions such as: “How do you feel?” or “Have you had any (other) medical problems since your last visit/assessment?” Additionally, several safety procedures (physical examinations, vital signs, safety laboratory tests, 12-lead ECGs, and spirometry) were conducted on participants at regular intervals. All AEs reported spontaneously by participants or in response to questioning or observation by the Investigator, including those related to safety procedures, were recorded. For each AE, the Investigator recorded the following assessments: seriousness, severity (Mild, Moderate, or Severe), and relationship to study drug (Not Related, Remote, Possible, Probable, or Highly Probable). AEs were considered drug-related if given a relationship of Possible, Probable, or Highly Probable.</description>
