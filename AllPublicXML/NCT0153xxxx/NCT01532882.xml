  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Diosmin has a well established use status in improvement of the symptoms of venolymphatic
      insufficiency: heavy legs, pain, primo-decubitus restlessness and as complement treatment of
      capillary fragility.

      Nevertheless, diosmin 600 mg did not benefit from a rigorous clinical study versus placebo,
      to establish its efficacy in the pain relief in Chronic Venous Disease (CVD).

      The aim of this project led by Dr. Guex is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of diosmin 600
      mg - DIOVENOR® on the painful symptoms of CVD of the lower limbs, in a multicentre,
      controlled, randomised, double blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study.

          3. Patient presenting a painful venous symptomatology in the lower limbs for at least 15
             days.

          4. Patient suffering from venous symptomatology in one leg with a painful symptom
             intensity higher or equal to 30 mm (VAS= 100mm)

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Patient treated by venotonic treatments or vascular protectants or assimilated dietary
             supplements or homeopathic treatments or diuretics within 15 days prior inclusion,

             converting enzyme inhibitors and/or vasodilators and/or vasoconstrictors within 28
             days prior inclusion (for patients already taking this type of treatments, dosage
             should not have been changed in the 28 days prior inclusion and should not be planned
             to change in the course of the study),

          8. Patient whose activity in the 4 following weeks (that is to say during the study)
             would be different from his/her usual activities (before the study),

          9. Patient suffering from a pathology generating other pains than venous pains in the

         10. Patient with a history of lower limbs trauma responsible for sequel pains,

         11. Patient with a known deep venous reflux,

         12. Patient with a history of venous thromboses or thrombo-embolic diseases within the
             last 6 months before inclusion,

         13. Patient treated with analgesics or anti-inflammatory treatments used as analgesics
             within 4 weeks prior inclusion
