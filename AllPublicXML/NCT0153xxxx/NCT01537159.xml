  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate if a type of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)
      scan of the bone marrow before the start of standard chemotherapy can predict complete
      remission of leukemia patients after the therapy. This type of MRI scan, called dynamic
      contrast-enhanced MRI (DCE-MRI), measures bone marrow blood flow. For those patients who do
      not achieve complete remission status after initial therapy and will be treated with
      additional therapy, the investigators are also interested in determining if the second MRI
      exam before the additional therapy can predict complete remission. If successfully tested,
      the MRI exam may be used in the future to help with early identification of patients who are
      unlikely to respond to standard chemotherapy. This will allow for a personalized therapeutic
      plan to be developed for these patients at an early stage and prevent them from being exposed
      to toxic and ineffective therapies.

    <description>Each MR scanning session will include the pre-contrast multi-slice T2-weighted MRI with fat-saturation and T1-weighted MRI which are regularly acquired in clinical protocols. Following these acquisitions, high-spatial and temporal-resolution DCE-MRI will be performed. The total duration of a research MR session is expected to be less than 45 min.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Newly diagnosed or relapsed AML patients, who are scheduled to receive standard
