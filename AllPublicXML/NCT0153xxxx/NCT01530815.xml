      The investigators are testing to see if infusion of bupivicaine between the mesh and
      abdominal wall can reduce postoperative pain and decrease use of narcotics in the
      postoperative setting.

      The primary objective of this study is to test different methods for pain management
      following laparoscopic ventral hernia repair. We hypothesize that local analgesic injection
      between the abdominal wall and mesh intraoperatively during laparoscopic ventral hernia
      repair will result in a 20% decrease in the use of post-surgery pain medication in the first
      four hours after surgery.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Patient must be scheduled for a laparoscopic ventral hernia repair at SBCH. If any
             additional procedure is performed, the subject will be excluded from the study

          2. Age 18 or older

          3. Patient must agree to complete pain journal postoperatively

          4. Informed consent signed and dated by patient. Consenting through a legally authorized
             guardian will not be accepted due to the necessity of completing a subjective pain
             journal

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Any surgical procedure occurring besides the study procedure

          2. Any allergy or sensitivity to bupivicaine or its derivatives

          3. Less than 18 years of age

          4. Patient unable to self report in pain journal due to cognitive disabilities

          5. Discharged less than 4 hours post-surgery
