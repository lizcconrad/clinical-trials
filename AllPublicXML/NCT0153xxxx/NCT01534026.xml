  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Heart failure (cardiomyopathy) is a chronic condition in which the heart fails to function as
      a pump to move blood around the body. Aspirin has been traditionally used in heart failure
      because a tendency towards blood clots (including stroke and heart attack, clots in the legs
      and in the lungs) has been observed in this group and aspirin's mechanism of action is to
      prevent blood clots. This is important because two-thirds of cases of heart failure are
      caused by a blood clot in the coronary artery resulting in a heart attack, and aspirin is
      given to reduce the chances of further heart attacks.

      However aspirin was introduced before clinical trials as the investigators know them now were
      run. Systematic review of the trials of aspirin in heart failure has shown that its use does
      not increase survival, and there is no evidence to recommend its routine use. Another
      important finding was that use of aspirin may reduce the beneficial effects of ACE inhibitors
      which do have a mortality benefit, and that aspirin was associated with an increase in
      hospitalisation for heart failure compared to other drugs which prevent clots or placebo.

      The investigators propose that the use of aspirin in heart failure that is not caused by
      heart attacks (&quot;non-ischaemic cardiomyopathy&quot;) is unnecessary and could be stopped. The
      importance of finding evidence to cease unproven medications in heart failure cannot be
      understated. Patients with heart failure take an average of six prescription medications each
      day. Each medication has side effects and the interactions of all the drugs together are
      unknown. Aspirin itself is a drug which frequently has side effects of increased risk of
      bleeding, gastrointestinal ulceration, as well as kidney impairment.

      In this study, the investigators plan to withdraw aspirin from patients with stable
      non-ischaemic heart failure in a closely monitored environment and watch for the effect of
      this on heart failure.
