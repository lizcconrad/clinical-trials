    <textblock>
      The study hypothesis is that the new drug EndoTAG-1 will improve tumor volume reduction as
      measured by Magnetic Resonance Imaging when added to a standard chemotherapy regimen of
      weekly paclitaxel. This is a prospective single-center study that will investigate the
      activity of EndoTAG-1 + paclitaxel combination therapy in patients with HER2-negative breast
      cancer that are candidate for receiving chemotherapy before surgery (neoadjuvant
      chemotherapy).

      This is a prospective, single-center, open-label phase II clinical trial investigating the
      activity of EndoTAG-1 + paclitaxel combination therapy in patients with HER2-negative BC
      candidate for neoadjuvant chemotherapy, as measured by the decrease in MRI-estimated tumour
      volume at the end of EndoTAG-1 + paclitaxel administration. Patients will be stratified by
      hormone receptor status.

      A total of 20 female patients with non-metastatic HER2-negative breast cancer candidate for
      neoadjuvant chemotherapy and meeting all study eligibility criteria will receive 12 weekly
      infusions of EndoTAG-1 (22 mg/m2 liposomal paclitaxel) in combination with paclitaxel (70
      mg/m2) followed by 3 cycles of FEC (Fluorouracil 500mg/m2, Epirubicin 100mg/m2,
      Cyclophosphamide 500mg/m2) every 3 weeks (experimental group) The study hypothesis is that
      EndoTAG-1 will improve MRI- estimated volume reduction when added to weekly paclitaxel. The
      null hypothesis is that combination has no or a negligible effect on volume reduction
      (defined as lower or equal to a 50% decrease) versus the alternative hypothesis that the
      combination yields at least a 80% average decrease in MRI- estimated volume at the end of
      weekly paclitaxel and EndoTAG-1 administration from baseline
