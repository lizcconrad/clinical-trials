  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sleep disturbances are cardinal features of Veterans with post traumatic stress disorder
      (PTSD). In particular, obstructive sleep apnea is reported to occur more frequently in
      patients with PTSD compared to those without PTSD and contribute to worsening cognitive and
      behavioral functions. Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) is considered the treatment
      of choice for OSA but adherence to CPAP in Veterans with PTSD is poor compared to the general
      population. The proposed study aims at comparing the efficacy, tolerability, and adherence of
      mandibular advancing devices-an alternative therapy to OSA- to CPAP. The study is
      instrumental in identifying the optimal OSA therapy for Veterans with PTSD and the OSA
      phenotype that would predict MAD response.
