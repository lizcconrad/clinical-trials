      The study will examine the safety and performance of a new surgical smoke clearance system
      which has been developed to maintain a visually clear operative field during laparoscopic
      surgery by using electrostatic precipitation to clear, from the surgical field, smoke and
      plume produced by energy based surgical instruments e.g. electrocautery, laser tissue
      ablation and ultrasonic scalpel tissue dissection.
