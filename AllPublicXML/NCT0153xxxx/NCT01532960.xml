  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Despite advances in surgical, radiation and medical therapies of early stage breast cancer,
      some patients will experience disease recurrence. Because recurrence may not happen for years
      after definitive treatment, there is a period of time between resection and relapse when
      micrometastatic disease may be amenable to immune eradication or modulation. While the
      ultimate goal of any cancer treatment is clinical efficacy, the immediate urgency in breast
      immunotherapy is to define treatments that have immunologic efficacy. In this study, the
      investigators will determine whether a vaccine consisting of nine-class I breast specific
      peptides plus a class II tetanus toxoid helper peptide is immunogenic when administered with
      poly-ICLC to participants with stage IB to IIIA breast cancer in the adjuvant setting.

      The study is a single arm, open label, pilot study of safety and immune efficacy of peptide
      vaccination with poly-ICLC in patients with stage IB-IIIA resected breast cancer.
      Participants will be patients who have completed their last dose/treatment of any single
      treatment or combination of adjuvant surgery, radiation, chemotherapy or trastuzumab therapy
      between 45 days and 6 months (180 days) prior to enrollment.

      Each vaccination will be administered on days 1, 8, 15, 36, 57, and 78. All participants will
      receive 9 class I MHC-restricted synthetic peptides (restricted by HLA-A1, -A2, -A3, or -A31)
      and a class II MHC-restricted tetanus helper peptide mixed with 1mg poly-ICLC and
      administered in sterile water. The vaccine will be administered intramuscular (IM) (1 ml) and
      intradermally (ID) (1 ml) at vaccination sites in the arm and leg. (Each vaccine given IM and
      ID at one site; site to alternate between arm site opposite the breast cancer and an anterior
      thigh site.) Participants will be screened for HLA type and must be HLA-A1, -A2, -A3, or -A31
      (80% of the Virginia population in prior studies1).

      Annual follow-up for progression and survival for 3 years after study withdrawal/completion.
