      This is a 4-week non-randomized, partially blinded, single-arm monocentre study in subjects
      with COPD GOLD class II or III with the aim to demonstrate that inhaled therapy with
      salmeterol reduces sympathetic activity as evaluated by microneurography. A maximum of 32
      subjects is planned to be enrolled.

      During a complex data registration period comprising the continuous recording of muscle
      sympathetic nerve activity (MSNA) and respiration and of various other measurements at Visit
      1, placebo and 50 μg of salmeterol via Diskus™ inhaler will be administered in a sequential
      design. Following Visit 1, the subjects will be treated with salmeterol 50 μg twice daily via
      Diskus inhaler for 4 weeks. At the Final Visit (Visit 2) the data registration period of
      Visit 1 will be repeated with the only difference that no placebo will be administered.

      Further endpoints, besides the evaluation of MSNA, include heart rate variability (HRV),
      spontaneous baroreflex sensitivity and lung function parameters.

      Study enrolment will be stopped when valid MSNA data on the immediate effect of inhalation
      (manoeuvres at Visit 1) are available for 24 subjects.

    <measure>Change in Muscle Sympathetic Nerve Activity (MSNA) at 2 Hours (Week 0)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 2 hours (Week 0)</time_frame>
    <description>Human MSNA is composed of vasoconstrictor impulses grouped in pulse synchronous bursts that usually occur in sequences, preferentially during transient reductions of blood pressure. Sympathetic activity was measured using microneurographic recordings of efferent in the peroneal nerve. MSNA reflects sympathetic discharge to the vascular bed of the skeletal muscle. The change in MSNA (bursts per 100 heart beats [bursts/100 heart beats]) was calculated as the difference in MSNA change from Baseline to after the inhalation of salmeterol (2 hours, Week 0, Visit 1) minus the MSNA change from Baseline to after the inhalation of placebo (1 hour, Week 0, Visit 1).</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline, 2 hours (Week 0), and Week 4</time_frame>
    <description>Oxygen saturation measures the capacity of blood to transport oxygen to other parts of the body. Oxygen binds to hemoglobin in red blood cells when moving through the lungs. A pulse oximeter uses two frequencies of light (red and infrared) to determine the percentage of hemoglobin in the blood that is saturated with oxygen. The percentage is called blood oxygen saturation, or SpO2. Change in SpO2 after salmeterol inhalation is expressed in terms of percent. Change from Baseline was calculated as the value at 2 hours (Week 0 [Visit 1, after salmeterol inhalation]) and the value at Week 4 (Visit 2, after salmeterol inhalation) minus the value at Baseline (Week 0, before any inhalation).</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline, 2 hours (Week 0), and Week 4</time_frame>
    <description>Transcutaneous carbon dioxide monitoring is a noninvasive way of continuously measuring the tension of these gases in the skin. This methodology provides a continuous noninvasive estimation of the arterial CO2 value. Change in tCO2 after salmeterol inhalation is expressed in terms of millimeters of mercury (mmHg). Change from Baseline was calculated as the value at 2 hours (Week 0 [Visit 1, after salmeterol inhalation]) and the value at Week 4 (Visit 2, after salmeterol inhalation) minus the value at Baseline (Week 0, before any inhalation).</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 4</time_frame>
    <description>FVC is defined as the volume of air that can be forcibly blown out from the lungs after a full inspiration. FRC is defined as the volume of air present in the lungs, specifically the parenchyma tissues, at the end of a passive expiration. TLC is defined as the maximum volume to which the lungs can be expanded with the greatest possible inspiratory effort; it is equal to VC plus the RV and is approximately 5800 milliliters. RV is defined as the amount of gas remaining in the lungs at the end of a maximal exhalation. All parameters describing lung function are expressed in terms of liters (L). Lung function (FVC, FRC [body and helium], TLC, and RV) was evaluated at Baseline (Week 0, [Visit 1, before any inhalation]) and at Week 4 (Visit 2, after salmeterol inhalation).</description>

    <measure>Number of Participants With Diastolic Dysfunction on Echocardiography at Baseline (Week 0) and at Week 4</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 4</time_frame>
    <description>Diastolic dysfunction refers to the decline in performance of one (usually the left ventricle) or both (left and right) ventricles during diastole. The number of participants with diastolic dysfunction on echocardiography was evaluated at Baseline (Week 0, [Visit 1, before any inhalation]) and at Week 4 (Visit 2, after salmeterol inhalation).</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 4</time_frame>
    <description>Arterial stiffness occurs as a consequence of age and arteriosclerosis. Carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity (PWV), a measure of arterial stiffness, is determined from the time taken for the arterial pulse to propagate from the carotid to the femoral artery. PWV was evaluated in terms of meters per second (m/s). PWV after salmeterol inhalation at Baseline (Week 0, [Visit 1, before any inhalation]) and at Week 4 (Visit 2, after inhalation of salmeterol) was assessed.</description>

        <title>Change in Muscle Sympathetic Nerve Activity (MSNA) at 2 Hours (Week 0)</title>
        <description>Human MSNA is composed of vasoconstrictor impulses grouped in pulse synchronous bursts that usually occur in sequences, preferentially during transient reductions of blood pressure. Sympathetic activity was measured using microneurographic recordings of efferent in the peroneal nerve. MSNA reflects sympathetic discharge to the vascular bed of the skeletal muscle. The change in MSNA (bursts per 100 heart beats [bursts/100 heart beats]) was calculated as the difference in MSNA change from Baseline to after the inhalation of salmeterol (2 hours, Week 0, Visit 1) minus the MSNA change from Baseline to after the inhalation of placebo (1 hour, Week 0, Visit 1).</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in MSNA (Evaluated by Microneurography as Bursts/Minute) at 2 Hours (Week 0)</title>
        <description>Human MSNA is composed of vasoconstrictor impulses grouped in pulse synchronous bursts that usually occur in sequences, preferentially during transient reductions of blood pressure. Sympathetic activity was measured using microneurographic recordings of efferent in the peroneal nerve. MSNA reflects sympathetic discharge to the vascular bed of the skeletal muscle. The change in MSNA (bursts per minute [bursts/minute]) was calculated as the difference in MSNA change from Baseline to after the inhalation of salmeterol (2 hours, Week 0, Visit 1) minus the MSNA change from Baseline to after the inhalation of placebo (1 hour, Week 0, Visit 1).</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Heart Rate Variability (HRV): Standard Deviation of NN Intervals (SDNN) at 2 Hours (Week 0) and at Week 4 (ITT Population)</title>
        <description>Heart rate variability (HRV) refers to the complex beat-to-beat (NN) variation in heart rate produced by the interplay of sympathetic and parasympathetic neural activity at the sinus node of the heart. SDNN reflects all the cyclic components responsible for variability in the period of recording; therefore, it represents total variability. Change in HRV (SDNN) after salmeterol inhalation is expressed in terms of milliseconds (ms). Change from Baseline was calculated as the value at 2 hours (Week 0 [Visit 1, after salmeterol inhalation]) and the value at Week 4 (Visit 2, after salmeterol inhalation) minus the value at Baseline (Week 0, before any inhalation).</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Heart Rate Variability (HRV): Absolute Low Frequency (LF) Power at 2 Hours (Week 0) and at Week 4 (ITT Population)</title>
        <description>HRV refers to the complex beat-to-beat (NN) variation in heart rate produced by the interplay of sympathetic and parasympathetic neural activity at the sinus node of the heart. HRV frequencies can be analyzed with frequency domain methods: the LF component of the HRV spectrum reflects sympathetic activity. Change in HRV (absolute LF) after salmeterol inhalation is expressed in terms of milliseconds squared (ms^2). Change from Baseline were calculated as the value at 2 hours (Week 0 [Visit 1, after salmeterol inhalation]) and the value at Week 4 (Visit 2, after salmeterol inhalation) minus the value at Baseline (Week 0, before any inhalation).</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Spontaneous Baroreflex Sensitivity (BRS) at 2 Hours (Week 0) and at Week 4 (ITT-MSNA Population)</title>
        <description>BRS is an important characteristic of baroreflex control and is often noninvasively assessed by relating heart rate (HR) fluctuations to blood pressure (BP) fluctuations. Change in BRS after salmeterol inhalation is expressed in terms of milliseconds per millimeters of mercury (ms/mmHg). Change from Baseline was calculated as the value at 2 hours (Week 0 [Visit 1, after salmeterol inhalation]) and the value at Week 4 (Visit 2, after salmeterol inhalation) minus the value at Baseline (Week 0 before any inhalation).</description>

        <description>Oxygen saturation measures the capacity of blood to transport oxygen to other parts of the body. Oxygen binds to hemoglobin in red blood cells when moving through the lungs. A pulse oximeter uses two frequencies of light (red and infrared) to determine the percentage of hemoglobin in the blood that is saturated with oxygen. The percentage is called blood oxygen saturation, or SpO2. Change in SpO2 after salmeterol inhalation is expressed in terms of percent. Change from Baseline was calculated as the value at 2 hours (Week 0 [Visit 1, after salmeterol inhalation]) and the value at Week 4 (Visit 2, after salmeterol inhalation) minus the value at Baseline (Week 0, before any inhalation).</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Transcutaneous Carbon Dioxide (tCO2) at 2 Hours (Week 0) and at Week 4</title>
        <description>Transcutaneous carbon dioxide monitoring is a noninvasive way of continuously measuring the tension of these gases in the skin. This methodology provides a continuous noninvasive estimation of the arterial CO2 value. Change in tCO2 after salmeterol inhalation is expressed in terms of millimeters of mercury (mmHg). Change from Baseline was calculated as the value at 2 hours (Week 0 [Visit 1, after salmeterol inhalation]) and the value at Week 4 (Visit 2, after salmeterol inhalation) minus the value at Baseline (Week 0, before any inhalation).</description>

        <description>FVC is defined as the volume of air that can be forcibly blown out from the lungs after a full inspiration. FRC is defined as the volume of air present in the lungs, specifically the parenchyma tissues, at the end of a passive expiration. TLC is defined as the maximum volume to which the lungs can be expanded with the greatest possible inspiratory effort; it is equal to VC plus the RV and is approximately 5800 milliliters. RV is defined as the amount of gas remaining in the lungs at the end of a maximal exhalation. All parameters describing lung function are expressed in terms of liters (L). Lung function (FVC, FRC [body and helium], TLC, and RV) was evaluated at Baseline (Week 0, [Visit 1, before any inhalation]) and at Week 4 (Visit 2, after salmeterol inhalation).</description>
