    <textblock>
      Stellate ganglion block (SGB) is known to increase blood flow to the innervation area of the
      stellate ganglion. Near infrared spectroscopy reflects changes of blood volume and allows
      continuous, non-invasive, and bedside monitoring of regional cerebral oxygen saturation
      (rSO2). Previous studies have shown the increment of the rSO2 on the block side from the
      baseline and the decrement of the rSO2 on the non-block side after SGB. Patients with
      cerebral vascular disease undergoing SGB might be at risk a decrease in cerebral blood flow
      in the non-block side. The investigators researched the effect of oxygen administration on
      rSO2 in the non-block side using a near infrared spectroscopy after SGB. 5 L/min oxygen was
      supplied via nasal cannula from 15 minutes after SGB. The rSO2 in the non-block side were
      measured before SGB and 5, 10, 15, 20, 25 and 30 minutes after SGB.

      The present study suggests that oxygen administration can increase the rSO2 of non-block
      side. In conclusion, it is our belief that oxygen supplement is helpful to the patient with
      cerebral vascular disease during SGB.
