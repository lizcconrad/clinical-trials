  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of this study is to determine the highest dose of ON 01910.Na that can be
      safely given as an intravenous infusion over 24 hours once a week in a 3-week cycle to
      patients with advanced solid tumors.

      This is an open-label, dose-escalating Phase I study of ON 01910.Na in patients with advanced
      cancers, who have satisfied the inclusion/exclusion criteria enumerated in this protocol.
      Patients will receive ON 01910.Na intravenously by 24 hour continuous infusion once every
      week (3 weeks per cycle), until evidence of disease progression, intolerable adverse events,
      or withdrawal of patient consent. Safety monitoring will be done for at least 3 weeks before
      escalation to the next dose level. As of Amendment 7, up to 6 patients with gynecological
      malignancies will be enrolled at the 2400 mg/m2 dose level to determine the appropriateness
      of this dose as the Recommended Phase Two Dose (RPTD).

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Must have histologically confirmed solid tumor (leukemias and lymphomas excluded)
             malignancy that is incurable and for which standard (FDA approved or established
             standard clinical practice), curative, or palliative measures do not exist or are no
             longer effective.

          -  Patients with disease amenable to sequential biopsies will be requested to undergo two
             tumor biopsies and two normal skin biopsies, but patients may decline and still be
             eligible for enrollment during this escalation stage.

             radiotherapy, hormonal treatments, bone marrow transplantation, or immunotherapy.

          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to ongoing or active
             infection, bleeding, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris,
