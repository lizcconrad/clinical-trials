  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators scientific aims are to determine the benefits associated with the use of
      robotic assisted laparoscopic sacrocolpopexy surgery on women with prolapse, to define how
      the benefits impact the patient, physician and the institution, and to determine the
      complications associated with the use of the robot. This will be a prospective cohort
      following 100 patients for a 24 month period.

      The investigators scientific aims are to determine the benefits associated with the use of
      robotic assisted laparoscopic sacrocolpopexy surgery on women with prolapse, to define how
      the benefits impact the patient, physician and the institution, and to determine the
      complications associated with the use of the robot. This will be a prospective cohort
      following 100 patients for a 24 month period.

      The investigators primary outcomes will be:

        -  Surgical time: Key portion of procedure will be assessed along with total time for
           completion

        -  Learning curve: Will be assessed using surgical times, VAS of camera skills, surgical
           skills involving tissue handling and movements and overall performance by surgeon,
           assistant and blind reviewer

        -  Length of hospitalization: measured by days in hopsital

      The investigators secondary outcomes will be:

        -  Pre-operative and postoperative Pelvic Organ Prolapse-Quantification (POP-Q) at 6 week,
           6, 12, and 24 months.

        -  Pelvic Floor Distress Inventory-Short Form 20 Questionnaire (PFDI-20)

        -  Mesh erosion,

        -  Estimated blood loss,

        -  Complications (bowel or bladder injury) and,

        -  Wound infection,

        -  Patient Global Impressions of Improvement

        -  Pelvic Organ Prolapse/Urinary Incontinence Sexual Questionnaire (PISQ-12).
