    <textblock>
      This is a longitudinal, randomized, controlled interventional multi centric study on the
      effects of lower leg strengthening exercise on quadriceps force during walking in people with
      knee osteoarthritis. At each study centre twenty subjects will be included, for a total of 40
      participants. Subjects will be randomized equally (1:1) into 1 active arm and 1 control arm.

      The objective of the study is to evaluate the effect of twelve weeks of quadriceps
      strengthening on the mechanical output of the quadriceps during locomotion. A secondary
      purpose is to explore the relationship between quadriceps strengthening and compressive knee
      loadings. The hypothesis is that quadriceps strength training will not change quadriceps
      force, power, and work in locomotion in people with knee osteoarthritis.

      Primary outcome is quadriceps force during walking, secondary outputs are quadriceps power
      and work and knee compressive loads during walking. Explorative measures are isometric and
      concentric isokinetic leg muscle strength, radiographic score of the knee (Kellgren and
      Lawrence), a one-leg rise from chair test (maximum number of reps) and a lateral step-up test
      (maximum number of reps).

    <description>The exercises will be performed in standard strength training equipment. Prior to each of the strengthening exercise sessions, a warm up phase is performed by 5-10 minutes of ergometer cycling at a moderate intensity. Muscle strengthening exercises will be performed according to the standard progressive resistance and overload principle. The exercise programme consists of three exercises performed with three sets of 10 repetitions at 60%-85% of patient's 10RM. Training load will be progressed by means of bi-weekly estimates of muscle strength to ensure a constant load of 60%-85% RM. Exercises are: 1. Leg extension, 2. Leg press, and 3. Forward lunges.</description>
