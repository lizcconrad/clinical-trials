  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Adverse drug events (ADEs) are the most clinically significant and costly medication-related
      problems in nursing homes (NH) and are associated with an estimated 93,000 deaths a year and
      as much as $4 billion of excess healthcare expenditures. Current ADE detection and management
      strategies that rely on pharmacist retrospective chart reviews (i.e., usual care) are
      inadequate. Active medication monitoring systems are recommended by many safety organizations
      as an alternative to detect and manage ADEs. These systems have been shown to be less
      expensive, faster, and identify ADEs not normally detected by clinicians in the hospital
      setting. The investigators developed and pilot-tested an active medication monitoring system
      for use in a single NH, where it was shown to detect ADEs with a high degree of accuracy and
      at a rate of nearly 2.5 times that of usual care. The long-term objective of our proposed
      research is to improve patient safety with respect to medications in NHs. The short-term
      objectives or specific aims of our proposed research are to determine if NH patients managed
      by physicians who receive active medication monitoring alerts have more ADEs detected, have a
      faster ADE management response time, and can result in more cost-savings from a societal
      perspective compared to usual care.

      To accomplish the aims outlined in our brief summary above, the investigators will conduct a
      cluster randomized controlled trial among up to 86 NH physicians working in one of 4 UPMC
      Health System nursing homes (NHs) in Southwestern Pennsylvania for a period of 12 months. Our
      hypotheses are that NH patients managed by physicians who receive active medication
      monitoring alerts will have more ADEs detected, will have a faster ADE management response
      time, and will result in cost-savings from a societal perspective compared to usual care.
      This application by an early stage investigator is responsive to PA-09-070 AHRQ Health
      Services Research Projects and several of its research portfolio priority areas (health
      information technology, patient safety, and value) by addressing how medication management
      systems can be used to improve the quality and safety of medication management, as well as
      improve healthcare decision making. This study represents the first large, well-controlled,
      comprehensive examination of an active medication monitoring system in the NH.
