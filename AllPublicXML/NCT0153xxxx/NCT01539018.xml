  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      -  Unlike the Asian and western regions, The vast majority of the Egyptian/Arabic
           Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC) patients are hepatitis C virus (HCV) associated.

        -  According to the SHARP study subgroup analysis, it seems that HCV associated HCC
           patients derive the max benefit of Sorafenib, the absolute gain between the Sorafenib
           arm &amp; the placebo in m OS = 7 months, HR=0.58 (95% CI: 0.37-0.91).

        -  In spite of improvement in terms of overall survival (OS) and time to progression (TTP),
           in all studies where Sorafenib was compared to placebo, the Sorafenib arm was not
           accompanied by a significant volumetric reduction, and this may explains the lack of any
           symptomatic improvement (time to symptomatic progression (TTSP) almost identical)

        -  Reviewing the chemotherapy outcome, although there is no convincing evidence in survival
           benefit to patients with advanced HCC, however true shrinkage (reduction in tumor size),
           has been consistently reported although the magnitude of response is lacking
           consistency.

      This indicates the need for coupling Sorafenib to a chemotherapeutic agent but:

        -  For patients with Hepatocellular Carcinoma, the toxicity profile of any chemotherapeutic
           agent of choice to be added to Sorafenib should be take in consideration

        -  The agent to be added to Sorafenib should be effective in terms of Tumor Shrinkage &amp;
           with minimal toxicity regarding:

        -  Cardio-toxicity

        -  HFSR

        -  Diarrhea

        -  Hepato-toxicity

        -  Bone marrow suppression (although not relevant to the toxicity profile of Sorafenib, yet
           the HCC patients may have HCV related thrombocytopenia and variable degree of
           hypersplenism related pancytopenia)

      Circulatory Overload (Hypertension) Why Tegafur-uracil (UFT)?

        -  Efficacy: For UFT, although the efficacy data in HCC are not as extensive as
           Doxorubicin, however in one phase II study UFT could improve survival when compared with
           conservative management.

        -  UFT Toxicity Profile:

      In a phase III trial to asses the compare Efficacy &amp; Safety of UFT with that of 5 FU in
      treatment of m CRC, Hematological toxicities were minimal (0% Grade ¾ leukopenia,
      neutropenia, febrile neutropenia, thrombocytopenia &amp; was 3% for anemia), while the most
      commonly seen SE was grade I &amp; II Diarrhea

      •Accordingly UFT may be considered as a potential partner to Sorafenib in patients with
      advanced HCC.
