      This study evaluates the effectiveness of a motivational interviewing intervention with
      families with young children ages 0-5 where smoking is happening in the home to adopt a
      smoke-free home plan and reduce child's second-hand smoke exposure.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Involuntary secondhand smoke (SHS) exposure in homes is an entirely preventable public health
      threat that disproportionately burdens young children in communities of low socioeconomic
      position. Breathe Free For Kids is a community-based participatory research (CBPR) initiative
      to evaluate the effectiveness of Ml compared with usual best practices (UBP) by having
      parents voluntarily adopt smoke-free home policies to protect children from SHS. The
      Motivational Interviewing intervention protocol was developed in conjunction with community
      partners, integrated into a health department-sponsored home visiting program for high-risk
      children and other community-based agencies serving children, and delivered by trained
      community health workers.
