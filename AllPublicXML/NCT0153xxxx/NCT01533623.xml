    <textblock>
      The investigators will perform a 1-year clinical trial measuring objective compliance during
      mandibular advancement device (MAD) treatment.

      The investigators will enroll 50 patients that received treatment with a titratable, duobloc
      MAD (RespiDent Butterfly®, RespiDent, Nijlen, Belgium) and participated in the original study
      &quot;Objective versus subjective compliance with oral appliance therapy for obstructive sleep
      apnea hypopnea syndrome&quot;, registered at Clinical Trials.gov (NCT01284881).

      Active microsensors (TheraMon®,Handelsagentur Gschladt, Hargelsberg, Austria) are provided by
      the Handelsagentur Gschladt without any costs. The sampling interval of the recording will be
      done at a rate of 1 measurement per 15 minutes (every 900 seconds). Using this sample
      interval, the capacity of the active microsensor allows for data acquisition during a 100 day
      period.

      A follow-up appointment is scheduled +/- 265 days after the start of the original study. A
      second follow-up visit is scheduled again 1 year after the start of the original study.

      The objective measurement of MAD wear time (total hours of wear time and the mean hours of
      wear per night over the respective period) will be based on the assumption that the MAD has
      been worn when the chip records a temperature intraorally.

    <description>To assess the safety and feasibility of measuring objective mean wearing time as a measure of objective oral appliance wear. The objective mean wearing time will be assessed using a microsensor thermometer. Regular follow-up visits will be performed, and patients will be questioned regarding side-effects of the microsensor.</description>
