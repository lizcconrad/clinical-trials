  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to assess efficacy and safety of a single treatment of Capsaicin
      8% transdermal delivery system in reducing pain from damaged nerves (neuropathic pain) caused
      by diabetes.

    <textblock>
      Participants were divided into 2 groups of approximately equal size. In the first group,
      participants received a Capsaicin 8% patch applied for 30 minutes to the feet; in the second
      group, participants received a placebo patch applied for 30 minutes to the feet. Participants
      were involved in the study for approximately 12 weeks and have visited the clinic
      approximately 6 times.

    <description>Percent change in average sleep interference was measured by Question 9F of the Brief Pain Inventory-Diabetic Neuropathy (BPI DN) and was used to assess pain and sleep interference index. Daily sleep interference rating scale consists of an 11-point numerical scale with which the patient describes how pain related to diabetes has interfered with their sleep during the past 24 hours. On a scale 0 identifies &quot;pain does not interfere with sleep&quot; and 10 identifies &quot;pain completely interferes with sleep&quot;.

        <description>Change from Baseline in the European Quality Of Life (QOL) questionnaire in 5 dimensions (EQ-5D) with Visual Analog Scale (VAS) to Weeks 2, 8 and 12. EQ-5D self-reported questionnaire is used to measure health-related quality of life by measuring 5 dimensions of health: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression. The EQ-5D questionnaire includes a visual analog scale (VAS) which records participants self-rated health status on a graduated (0–100) scale with higher scores indicating higher Health-Related Quality of Life (HRQoL).</description>

        <description>The Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) is a self-report scale developed for the assessment of anxiety and depression, that contain 14 items rated on a 4-point Likert-type scale. There are 2 subscales,one assessing depression and the other anxiety. The 7-item depression and anxiety subscales yield scores of 0 to 21 that are interpreted with the following cut-off points: 0 to 7, normal; 8 to 10, mild mood disturbance; 11 to 14, moderate mood disturbance; and 15 to 21, severe mood disturbance.</description>

        <description>Percent change in average sleep interference was measured by Question 9F of the Brief Pain Inventory-Diabetic Neuropathy (BPI DN) and was used to assess pain and sleep interference index. Daily sleep interference rating scale consists of an 11-point numerical scale with which the patient describes how pain related to diabetes has interfered with their sleep during the past 24 hours. On a scale 0 identifies “pain does not interfere with sleep” and 10 identifies “pain completely interferes with sleep&quot;.
