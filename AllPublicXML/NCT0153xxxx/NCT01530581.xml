        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Recipient must

               1. Be between the ages of 16 and 65 years old

               2. Have one of the following hematologic malignancies:

                    -  Acute myeloid leukemia (de novo, secondary or therapy related) in untreated
                       1st relapse or in remission or with evidence of molecular relapse but blasts
                       less than 5%

                    -  Chronic myeloid leukemia in chronic or accelerated phase (de novo or therapy
                       related)

                    -  Myelodysplasia (de novo or therapy related)

                    -  Other hematologic malignancy (de novo or therapy related) including but not
                       limited to: ALL (CR 1, CR2 or CR3), CLL, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, Hodgkin's
                       lymphoma

               3. Must be receiving a myeloablative conditioning regimen of busulfan and
                  cyclophosphamide or TBI and cyclophosphamide or other myeloablative regimen
                  approved by the Clinical Study Chair. (Regimens containing ATG are not allowed.)

               4. Have an HLA-identical sibling donor

               5. Meet the transplant centre's criteria for myeloablative allogeneic
                  transplantation*

               6. Have an ECOG performance status of 0, 1 or 2

               7. Have given signed informed consent

        Donor must

          1. Be 18 years of age or older. (Upper age limit is at the discretion of the transplant
             physician at the collection centre.)

          2. Be able to undergo general anesthesia and BM harvest or peripheral blood collection as
             per assessment by a transplant physician. (If an anesthetist assesses a donor after
             randomization and determines the donor should not undergo general anesthesia, then the
             donor and recipient will be withdrawn from the study.)

          3. Be a sibling of the recipient

          4. Be a 6/6 HLA match of the recipient. HLA typing is by serologic or DNA methodology for
             A and B and by DNA methodology for A and B and by DNA methodology for DRB1
             (intermediate resolution)

          5. Have given signed informed consent

        Exclusion Criteria

        Recipient

        1. The recipient is HIV antibody positive

        Donor

          1. The donor is unable to undergo general anesthesia, bone marrow harvest or peripheral
             blood collection

          2. The donor is pregnant or breastfeeding at the time of progenitor cell collection

          3. The donor has a history of malignant disease within the last 5 years or current
             malignancy other than non-melanomatous in situ skin carcinoma or cervical carcinoma in
             situ

          4. The donor is HIV antibody positive

          5. The donor has a known sensitivity to E. coli-derived products

          6. The donor and recipient are identical twins
