  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to determine optimal management of isolated fast breathing in young
      infants in a trial design conducted in primary care settings.

      The investigators hypothesized that proportion of infants who fail therapy will be 4% in each
      group. A 6% or less difference in failure rate will be considered equivalent.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The management of isolated fast breathing is therefore unknown and our experience suggests
      that these infants could perhaps be managed without antibiotics. Widespread application of
      the WHO clinical algorithm could therefore result in the referral of as many as 13.7% (135.7
      per 1000 live births) of all infants for isolated fast breathing, the vast majority of these
      unnecessarily, and exposing infants to a high risk of nosocomial sepsis and hospital
      mortality in addition to over-burdening health resources.
