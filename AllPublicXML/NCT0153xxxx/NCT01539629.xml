  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      ELEVATE 3.0 is an acute, prospective, multicenter feasibility study which is randomized
      within a patient test sequence and pulse width. The study is designed to characterize the
      performance of LVAT (Left Ventricular Authothreshold) feature.
