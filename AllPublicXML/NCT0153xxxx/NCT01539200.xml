  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Malnutrition and lack of regular exercise are often found in older adults and have been
      identified as important risk factors for independence loss and nursing home admission in
      older community-dwelling adults.

      Existing evidence suggests that high protein nutritional supplements can increase skeletal
      muscle protein synthesis following exercise in older individuals. However, increase of muscle
      strength by resistance training does not decrease the rate of falls and is not necessarily
      linked to an improvement of physical function. In contrast to resistance training, T'ai Chi,
      dance and eurhythmics have been shown to decrease fall incidence and improve mobility and
      physical function in older adults. The investigators will examine the combination of
      eurhythmics and high protein nutritional supplements.

      The aim of the study is to investigate whether there is an increase in normal walking
      velocity due to the nutritional supplement on top of once weekly Jacques-Delacroze
      Eurhythmics training.

    <description>The primary objective is to demonstrate in older adults receiving a once weekly Jacques-Delacroze Eurhythmics (JDR) training for six months, that a once daily nutritional supplementation increases normal walking velocity compared with placebo. The primary endpoint of this study is normal walking velocity (NW velocity, in cm/s) six months after the onset of the treatment.</description>
