      This is an investigator sponsored double-blinded, multinational, multi center, randomized
      (2:1 active:placebo), placebo-controlled, phase IIa trial in severe pneumonia patients with
      severe sepsis or septic shock, investigating the safety and efficacy of co-administration of
      Iloprost and escalating doses of Eptifibatide for continuous intravenous infusion in totally
      36 patients.
