  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is investigating if the oral beta antagonist propranolol can induce regression of
      retinal neovascularization associated with proliferative diabetic retinopathy.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Oral propranolol 120mg daily will be given to 10 patients with proliferative diabetic
      retinopathy over a 12 week period to evaluate the effect on retinal neovascularization.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Age &gt;=18 years

          -  Eyes with proliferative diabetic retinopathy and neovascularization

          -  Eyes with a history of panretinal photocoagulation treatment and persistent
             neovascularization deemed by the investigator to be a potential threat to visual
             acuity either by causing a vitreous hemorrhage or tractional retinal detachment.
             (Group 1 - maximum 5 eyes enrolled with these characteristics)

          -  Eyes without a history of panretinal photocoagulation treatment, but that do not have
             high-risk proliferative diabetic retinopathy characteristics (i.e. these are eyes that
             have early proliferative diabetic retinopathy that are not yet at a high-risk for
             vitreous hemorrhage and tractional retinal detachment such that panretinal
             photocoagulation laser may be deferred). (Group 2 - maximum 5 eyes enrolled with these
             characteristics)

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Either panretinal photocoagulation laser or focal/grid laser into study eye within 3
             months of study enrollment

          -  Anti-Vascular endothelial growth factor injection into study eye within 3 months of
             study enrollment

          -  Contraindications to beta-blockers such as: allergy, previous intolerance, abnormally
             slow heart rates, asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, use of medications
             that have an effect on certain drug metabolic pathways that may cause interactions.

          -  Known coronary arterial disease or left ventricular dysfunction, or known peripheral
             vascular disease

          -  Resting heart rate &lt;60 or systolic blood pressure &lt;90 and/or diastolic blood pressure
             &lt;50

          -  Pregnancy

          -  All patients will either be post-menopausal, have adequate birth control and, if of
             childbearing age, will have a urinary pregnancy test performed

          -  Allergy to fluorescein dye

          -  Media opacity obscuring adequate determination of neovascularization including dense
             cataract or dense vitreous hemorrhage

          -  Patient is already taking an oral beta-blocker

          -  Vulnerable populations such as prisoners and minors will also be excluded
