  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has declared that AIDS is a &quot;state of
      emergency&quot; in the US for African Americans - young African American men are especially
      vulnerable in this epidemic. Thus, the development of effective interventions tailored to
      this population is a national priority. The investigators previous preliminary studies
      suggest that a brief, clinic-initiated, home-based, self-guided condom use program may
      effectively promote the acceptance of condom use and increase the quality and consistency of
      condom-protected sexual behaviors. This pilot study will (1) develop and test the feasibility
      of this program (Homework Intervention Strategy, HIS) for young African American men
      attending an urban STD clinic and (2) identify variables that may mediate the efficacy of the
      program. The HIS has the potential to be readily translated into widespread practice, while
      requiring only minimal resources. Unlike previously tested interventions, the HIS can be
      applied to all men who use condoms, regardless of the sex of their partners or their HIV/STI
      status. To develop the HIS to meet the needs of these high-risk men, the proposed study will
      include a formative phase during which the basic intervention &quot;instructions&quot; which will be
      delivered by DVD will be refined and tailored for this population.

      One hundred young African American men recruited from an urban STD clinic will be randomized
      to each of two groups (HIS vs. &quot;standard of care&quot;) in a randomized 2-arm trial with 5
      assessment periods over the course of 6 months. Assessments will compare the groups on
      frequency of unprotected sex, quality of the condom use experience, experience of condom use
      errors and problems, attitudes regarding condom use, condom use acceptability, and condom use
      self-efficacy and confidence.
