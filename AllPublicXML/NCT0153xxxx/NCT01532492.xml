  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Arthroscopic rotator cuff repair is described as being a successful procedure. These results
      are often derived from clinical general shoulder examinations, which are then classified as
      'excellent', 'good', 'fair' or 'poor'. However, the cut-off points for these classifications
      vary and sometimes modified scores are used.

      Arthroscopic rotator cuff repair is performed to improve quality of life. Therefore, disease
      specific health-related quality of life patient-administered questionnaires are needed. The
      WORC is a quality of life questionnaire designed for patients with disorders of the rotator
      cuff. The score is validated for rotator cuff disease, but not for rotator cuff repair
      specifically.

      The aim of this study is to investigate reliability, validity and responsiveness of WORC in
      patients undergoing arthroscopic rotator cuff repair.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      An approved translation of the WORC into Dutch is used. In this prospective study three
      groups of patients are used: 1.Arthroscopic rotator cuff repair; 2.Disorders of the rotator
      cuff without rupture; 3.Shoulder instability.

      The WORC, SF-36 and the Constant Score are obtained twice before therapy is started to
      measure reliability and validity. Responsiveness is tested by obtaining the same tests after
      therapy.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Reliability of the WORC</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Reliability of the WORC is tested by comparing the results at T0 with T1. T1 is planned 2-3 weeks after T0, because we expect that the symptoms do not change between these two moments and the time span is large enough to forget initial responses to the questions. In order to signal change in severity of the symptoms, at both moments patients are asked to rate their shoulder hindrance. To determine test-retest reliability, intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC) are used.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Criterion validity of the WORC</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Criterion validity is measured by comparing WORC with a general quality of life questionnaire (SF-36) and a commonly used clinical shoulder score (Constant Score) both at T0 and T1. Bland Altman plots will be used to estimate 95% boundaries of concurrence.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Responsiveness of the WORC</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Responsiveness will be determined by calculating the standardized response means and effect sizes on T0 and T2 scores on WORC, SF-36 and Constant scores for the subgroups.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Differentiation between patient groups</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>A comparison of WORC scores between the three distinct groups is made, to see whether WORC scores can differentiate between them. WORC scores will be compared with SF-36 to investigate whether the noted differences correlate with notable clinical differences and can be expressed as MCID's (minimal clinical important differences).</description>

        1. Patients undergoing arthroscopic rotator cuff repair. These patients have a clinical
             suspicion of a symptomatic rotator cuff tear and a partial or full thickness lesion
             seen on MRI or Ultrasound and confirmed during the arthroscopic repair procedure.

          2. Patients diagnosed as having non-Ruptured DRC. They have a clinical suspicion of DRC
             and no rupture of the rotator cuff on MRI or Ultrasound.

          3. Patients will be diagnosed with shoulder instability
