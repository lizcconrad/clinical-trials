        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Patient has histologically proven DLBCL, which may represent de novo DLBCL or DLBCL
             arising from transformed follicular lymphoma or chronic lymphocytic leukemia.

          2. Patient has relapsed or refractory CD20-positive disease following previous first-line
             systemic chemotherapy. Patients who have failed to achieve complete remission with
             previous chemotherapy are defined as refractory, and those who relapsed after an
             initial complete remission are classified as having relapsed. A biopsy must be
             performed to confirm diagnosis of relapsed disease. Tumor tissue within 6 months of
             Day 1 of Cycle 1 of study treatment will be used for the central review.

          3. Patient has at least 1 measurable tumor mass (greater than 1.5 cm in the longest
             dimension, or 1.1 to 1.5 cm in the longest dimension, and greater than 1.0 cm in the
             shortest axis) that has not previously been irradiated or has grown since previous
             irradiation

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Patient has allergies or hypersensitivity to murine, chimeric, human, or humanized
             proteins.

          2. Patient has had prior allogeneic or ASCT.

          3. Patient has received any other anticancer therapy within 28 days before Day 1 of Cycle
             1 of study treatment and more than 1 prior line of chemotherapy, with the exception of
             having received the last dose of rituximab within 6 months before Day 1 of Cycle 1 of
             study treatment if they have undergone prior treatment with rituximab.
