      This clinical trial is a single-site, 30 patient study for participants who have early stage
      retinitis pigmentosa, or Usher syndrome (type 2 or 3). Funding Source - FDA OOPD and
      Foundation Fighting Blindness.

    <textblock>
      This clinical trial is a prospective, randomized, double-masked, sham-controlled trial of 30
      study participants who have early-stage retinitis pigmentosa, or Usher syndrome (type 2 or
      3). The trial will be conducted at the University of California, San Francisco. Individuals
      with these diseases experience gradually worsening vision that ultimately may lead to
      blindness due to a genetic condition in which specialized cells in the eye's retina called
      photoreceptor cells cease functioning and/or die. The study is intended to use a relatively
      new, non-invasive technology called AOSLO (adaptive optics scanning laser ophthalmoscopy) in
      combination with a routine standard of care measurement called sdOCT (Spectral Domain Optical
      Coherence Tomography) to demonstrate that when a device that secretes an investigational drug
      called CNTF (Ciliary Neurotrophic Factor) is surgically placed in the patient's eye, one type
      of photoreceptor called &quot;cone photoreceptors&quot; is preserved such that the gradual loss of
      vision is halted.

          1. Participant must be between 18 and 55 years of age.

          2. Participant must have a diagnosis of retinitis pigmentosa or Usher Syndrome type 2 or
             3 (without profound deafness or cochlear implants).

          3. Participant must understand and sign the protocol informed consent. If the
             participant's vision is impaired to the point where he/she cannot read the informed
             consent document, the document will be read to the participant in its entirety.

          4. Best-corrected visual acuity must be no worse than 20/63 (at least 59 letters).
