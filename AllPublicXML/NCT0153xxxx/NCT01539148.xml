  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigator is looking for patients who have been diagnosed with stage 1-4 cancer to
      enroll in a five year Quality of Life clinical trial study in which the participant has
      previously elected to use Insulin Potentiation Targeted Low Dose (IPTLD) as a means to treat
      their illness. This study is a quality of life study and not a treatment study. Participants
      participating in the study will be asked to complete quality of life questionnaires. The
      questionnaires completed by the patients will measure mood, energy level, ability to
      function, level of pain, and other measures that indicate how a patient feels about the
      quality of their daily living.

  <detailed_description>

      Patients will complete surveys once per month during their participation in the quality of
      life study, and then a series of follow-up surveys: every two months the second year; every
      three (3) months the third year and every six months the fourth and fifth year.

        The study population will be from patients who have been diagnosed with stage 1-4 cancer
        that have chosen to use IPTLD and nutritional therapy and have been referred by a
        physician, word of mouth or through internet website inquiries.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Only patients in active treatment with IPTLD are eligible i.e. patients have consented
             to treatment with IPTLD.

          -  Women who are pregnant, or could become pregnant, may not participate in the study.

          -  Patients 18 years of age or older

          -  Patients have to be able and willing to complete the various QoL instruments, which
             will be given upon enrollment and at designated follow-up intervals.

          -  Patients must have either had the benefits of standard, appropriate therapy and have
             had that fail, or refuse to receive these therapies after having been informed of the
             standard of care for their particular stage and diagnosis. This criteria is included
             for ethical, not clinical reasons.

          -  In addition, other criteria may be developed that more specifically address: The type,
             stage, location of the cancer/metastasis. The length of time since diagnosis. Previous
             treatments attempted and their outcome, Length of time since last treatment and
             concurrent conventional treatments. Nutritional approaches, other cam treatments,
             factors that may confound the study results.

          -  Ability, commitment of patient to follow IPTLD protocol

          -  Best Answer for Cancer Foundation and Kotsanis Institute do intend to draw subjects
             only from within the pool of patients who have elected to undergo IPTLD and nutrition
             therapy as their treatment of choice; limiting the universe of subjects to IPTLD
             patients removes the confounding effects of patient treatment choice and possible
             consideration of other treatment arms from the design.

          -  The focus is simple: it is to follow IPTLD patients and determine longitudinal impacts
             of treatment on quality of life experienced by IPTLD patients as a treatment group.

          -  It is to allow comparison with well-documented QoL results from conventional
             chemotherapy. This is the original intent, and recruitment efforts for participants
             will remain within those who are IPTLD patients.

          -  The initial, baseline QoL testing of IPTLD patients who choose to be in the study will
             include some questions designed to elicit the reasons the patient decided on IPTLD and
             nutrition therapy. Documenting these choices can serve two purposes; correlations
             between reasons, and the attitudes they reveal about factors known to impact QoL, such
             a positive sense of controlling one's health choices, can be drawn. Further, once
             these factors are accounted for, some inferences about the extent to which IPTLD and
             nutrition therapy are responsible for impacts on QoL can be derived.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  The Medical Director/Principal Investigator will consider excluding specific cancers,
             for ethical reasons, that are intractable and known to have a rapid course, or which
             are known to be unresponsive to IPTLD.
