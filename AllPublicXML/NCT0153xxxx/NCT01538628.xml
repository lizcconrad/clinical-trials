    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety of the SpaceOAR System when the hydrogel
      is injected between the rectum and prostate in men undergoing radiation therapy (IG-IMRT) and
      to evaluate whether use of the SpaceOAR hydrogel results in a reduction of radiation exposure
      to the anterior rectum.
