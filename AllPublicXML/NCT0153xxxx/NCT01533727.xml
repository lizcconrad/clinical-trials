  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Non - small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) accounts for more than 80% of lung cancer. The main
      treatment for early stage patients is surgical resection, but about 30% -70% patients will
      relapse. Postoperative chemotherapy is the major systemic treatment for surgical resection
      NSCLC patients. However, data show only 5-10% improvement in overall survival with systemic
      adjuvant chemotherapy. It is necessary to further improve the survival time of patients with
      lung cancer. Biological treatment is becoming a new treatment modality for Cancer following
      with surgery, radiotherapy and chemotherapy, and has been confirmed as an effective adjuvant
      treatment in comprehensive cancer treatment. Cytokine induced killer cells ( CIK)
      characterized as fast amplification, strong anti-cancer activity and broad anti-tumor
      spectrum is most widely used and thought to be the first choice for the new generation of
      anti-tumor adoptive immunotherapy. This Phase II study is investigating the efficacy of
      Autologous Cytokine-Induced Killer Cell Transfusion plus Chemotherapy as adjuvant therapy for
      stage IB-IIIA NSCLC.

  <why_stopped>
    Few patients would like to participate ,since CIK cell transfusion was a new treatment and its
    efficacy was doubted.
