  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label randomized phase II study. Patients are randomized so as to achieve
      uniform patient cohorts treated on each regimen. Twenty-seven patients will be required per
      treatment arm, and a total of 54 prostate cancer patients will be required to complete this
      study. The study will assess for clinical activity by Prostate Specific Antigen (PSA)
      response, of both single agent ipilimumab and the combination of GM-CSF and ipilimumab in
      chemotherapy-naïve patients with metastatic castrate resistant prostate cancer.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Ipilimumab is an antibody (proteins that can find and destroy foreign molecules such as those
      on bacteria and viruses) against CTLA-4 (a molecule that controls a part of the immune system
      by shutting it down). It is approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to treat
      patients with late-stage melanoma, skin cancer. The use of ipilimumab in patients with CRPC
      has not been approved by the FDA.

      Some patients in this study will receive GM-CSF along with ipilimumab. In clinical trials,
      GM-CSF has been safely given to prostate cancer patients in combination with ipilimumab.
      GM-CSF is not approved by the FDA for use as treatment for prostate cancer. Studies in
      patients with prostate cancer suggest that GM-CSF may activate the immune system. Since
      ipilimumab can help keep the immune system from turning off and allow an immune reaction to
      occur, and GM-CSF can increase the activity of the immune system, it is possible that they
      may work together to increase the immune response to cancer. The use of ipilimumab in
      combination with GM-CSF in patients with CRPC has not been approved by the FDA.

      It is theorized that if antigen presentation could be improved, the immunostimulatory effects
      of CTLA-4 blockade could be augmented with improvements in clinical response. To that end,
      UCSF conducted a phase I clinical trial of ipilimumab in combination with GM-CSF, a cytokine
      that has been demonstrated to enhance the functional activities of effector cells, including
      dendritic cells (DC), neutrophils, and monocytes, in chemotherapy-naïve men with CRPC
      (Protocol 6032).32 Exposure to GM-CSF increases class II MHC expression on dendritic cells
      and is thought to lead to increased antigen presentation to T cells, stimulating T cell
      responses, although this mechanism has not been confirmed. We have extensively studied the
      effects of treatment demonstrating a dose-response relationship in the activation of CD4 and
      CD8 T cells. Moreover, the expansion of activated (CD25+CD69+) CD4 and CD8 T cells seen with
      this GM-CSF/ipilimumab combination trial was higher than that seen with GM-CSF or ipilimumab
      monotherapy seen in our other trials in prostate cancer patients.

      We are proposing to conduct a non-comparative randomized phase II study of repetitive dosing
      of ipilimumab either alone or in combination with GM-CSF in patients with metastatic CRPC.
      The dosing interval for ipilimumab is based on the prior study which demonstrated drug levels
      ≥ 10 mg/mL (a minimum level required for CTLA-4 blockade in pre-clinical models) for greater
      than 28 days. Six doses of ipilimumab were chosen because six doses have been given safely in
      other trials. Maintenance dosing every three months is empirical, but this dosing frequency
      is based on discussions with Medarex, Inc. and Bristol-Meyers Squibb and is based on reports
      indicating the safety and potential efficacy of this maintenance regimen.

      This study will use ipilimumab given every 28 days for six cycles (induction) followed by
      administration once every three months for patients who are not progressing (maintenance). A
      dosage of 10 mg/kg has been chosen based on the results to date of the phase I study. GM-CSF
      250 mcg/m2 SQ will be administered on days 1-14 in Cycles 1-6 and then every 3 months for 14
      days beginning on the day of ipilimumab administration during the maintenance therapy phase.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Histologically confirmed, metastatic prostate cancer (positive bone scan and/or
             measurable disease on CT scan and/or MRI of the abdomen and pelvis).

          2. Progressive disease after androgen deprivation, as defined by PSA Working Group 237
             and/or RECIST criteria.38 Patients must have disease progression by one or both of the
             following:

               -  For patients with measurable disease, progression is defined as at least a 20%
                  increase in the sum of the longest diameter (LD) of target lesions or the
                  appearance of one or more new lesions, as per RECIST criteria version 1.1

               -  For patients with no measurable disease, a positive bone scan and elevated PSA
                  will be required. PSA evidence for progressive prostate cancer consists of a PSA
                  level of at least 2 ng/ml, which has risen on at least 2 successive occasions, at
                  least 1 week apart. If the confirmatory PSA (#3) value is not greater (i.e., #3b)
                  than the screening PSA (#2) value, then an additional test for rising PSA (#4)
                  will be required to document progression

               -  If no prior orchiectomy has been performed, patients must remain on LHRH agonist
                  or antagonist therapy. Patients who are receiving an antiandrogen as part of
                  primary androgen ablation must demonstrate disease progression following
                  discontinuation of the antiandrogen, defined as two consecutive rising PSA
                  values, obtained at least two weeks apart, or documented osseous or soft tissue
                  progression. At least one of the PSA values must be obtained at least four weeks
                  (flutamide) or six weeks (bicalutamide or nilutamide) after discontinuation

          3. Laboratory requirements:

               -  Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≥ 1500/μL

               -  Bilirubin &lt; 1.5 x ULN

             &gt; 12 weeks.

          5. At least 18 years of age or older.

          6. Patients receiving any other hormonal therapy, including any dose of megestrol acetate
             (Megace), Proscar (finasteride), any herbal product known to decrease PSA levels (e.g.
             Saw Palmetto, PC-SPES), or any systemic corticosteroid, must discontinue the agent for
             at least four weeks prior to study treatment. Progressive disease as defined above
             must be documented after discontinuation of any hormonal therapy (with the exception
             of a LHRH agonist or antagonist).

          7. Prior radiation therapy must be completed &gt; 4 weeks prior to enrollment and the
             patient must be recovered from all toxicity. Prior radiopharmaceuticals (strontium,
             samarium) must be completed ≥ 8 weeks prior to enrollment.

          8. Because of the unknown potential risk to a gamete and/or developing embryo from this
             investigational therapy, patients must agree to use adequate contraception (barrier
             method for males) for the duration of study participation, and for three months after
             discontinuing therapy.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Prior chemotherapy for prostate cancer, with the exception of neoadjuvant
             chemotherapy, because of the potential effect of chemotherapy on the immune system.

          2. Prior investigational immunotherapy. Prior sipuleucel-T treatment is allowed but must
             be completed at least 4 weeks prior to initiating treatment on this protocol.
