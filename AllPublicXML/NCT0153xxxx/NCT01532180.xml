    <description>The aura6000 device is an implanted hypoglossal nerve stimulator designed to maintain wakeful muscle tone of the tongue during sleep. It is implanted through a short surgical procedure. The implant is programmed to provide the optimal stimulation parameters for the patient. The therapy is controlled by a hand-held remote control allowing the patient to start, stop, and pause the therapy during times of sleep.</description>
