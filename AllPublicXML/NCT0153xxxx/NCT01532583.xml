      The aim of our study is to report the subjective and objective outcome of outside-in
      transobturator technique (TOT) (MonarcÂ®) in long-term follow-up.

      This is a follow-up study concerning 191 patients operated on in Turku University Hospital
      between May 2003 and December 2004 by using TOT. SUI was diagnosed with a positive stress
      test, the Urinary Incontinence Severity Score (UISS) and the Detrusor Instability Score
      (DIS). After a mean of 6.5 years evaluation included a gynecological examination and a supine
      stress test. Subjective outcome was evaluated with UISS, DIS, a visual analogue scale (VAS),
      a questionnaire of subjective evaluation of continence, EuroQoL-5D, EQ-5D VAS and short
      versions of IIQ-7 and UDI-6. Objective cure was defined as negative stress test and an
      absence of reoperation for SUI during the follow-up period.
