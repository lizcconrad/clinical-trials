    <textblock>
      This is a randomized phase III trial of CC-5013 (lenalidomide, NSC-703813) and low dose
      dexamethasone (LLD) versus bortezomib (PS-341, NSC-681239), lenalidomide and low dose
      dexamethasone (BLLD) for induction, in patients with previously untreated multiple myeloma
      without an intent for immediate autologous stem cell transplant.
