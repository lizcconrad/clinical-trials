  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This open-label, single-arm, multicentre phase II trial will be performed in patients with
      intermediate HER2-positive, metastatic breast cancer (MBC)pretreated with anthracyclines and
      one first-line therapy in the metastatic setting.

      The main objective of the trial is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of BIBW 2992 in
      combination with vinorelbine in patients with intermediate HER2-positive MBC. If this trial
      shows promising results, further studies to evaluate the benefit of BIBW 2992 in combination
      with chemotherapy in this subgroup of intermediate HER2-positive patients with MBC are
      warranted.

      Patients will be followed until progression. After progression, for the purpose of analysing
      overall survival, information on vital status and subsequent treatment will be collected.

      The primary objective is to determine the 6-month progression free survival rate of BIBW 2992
      and vinorelbine i.v. in patients with metastatic, HER2 IHC 2+, HER2 FISH-negative breast
      cancer.

      BIBW 2992 in combination with vinorelbine will provide a suitable combination to test the
      hypothesis that patients with metastatic breast cancer whose tumours are HER2 2+ by
      immunohistochemistry, but negative by fluorescence in-situ hybridisation (FISH) will benefit
      from a combination of a cytotoxic agent, i.e. vinorelbine, plus the dual irreversible
      EGFR/HER2-tyrosine kinase inhibitor BIBW 2992.
