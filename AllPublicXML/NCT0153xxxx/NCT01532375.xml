    <textblock>
      With the epidemic of obesity and diabetes growing around the world, Kochujang (KCJ) may be
      potentially effective in preventing and treating obesity and cardiovascular risks if proven
      in humans. However, human trial still have not been reported with KCJ supplementation. In the
      present study, we investigated the hypothesis that KCJ supplementation can be decrease the
      body fat and improve blood lipid profiles in overweight adults.

      The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of KCJ supplementation on anthropometric
      parameters, visceral fat/subcutaneous fat, and blood lipid profiles in overweight subjects.

      Sixty overweight subjects with BMI &gt;25 kg/m2 and waist-hip-ratio (WHR) ≥ 0.90 for men and ≥
      0.85 for women were randomly assigned to either KCJ supplement (n=30, 32 g/day) or placebo
      (n=30, 32 g/day) group for 12 weeks.
