  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The present pilot study is aimed to obtain preliminary data on the effect of three ascending
      oral dose levels of nepadutant on the relief of symptoms associated with feeding intolerance.
      In addition, the assessment of drug exposure (PK assessment) will provide additional
      information on the dose-effect relationship, thus supporting the dose selection and dosing
      schedule in the future studies.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Feeding intolerance is a transient neuro-developmental phenomenon affecting 25% to 40% of
      infant and toddler, with a peak at 6 weeks of age. Feeding problems include mainly vomiting,
      slow feeding, refusal to eat and colic.

      Current non pharmacological interventions (e.g. message, restriction in maternal diet in
      breast-feeding infants) and pharmacological treatments (simethicone, antimuscarinic drugs and
      antiacids) are largely unsatisfactory.

      Nepadutant is postulated to have a therapeutic effect in infant colic since it reverts
      exaggerated intestinal motility and sensitivity induced by different stimuli through the
      activation of neurokinin-2 receptors, without interferring on the on physiological
      gastrointestinal transit.

      This phase IIa study is designed to test in each participant infant two out of three oral
      doses of nepadutant in order to measure its blood levels, safety and efficacy with each dose
      level to be given for 7 concecutive days.

      The experimental clinical phase encompasses the following periods:

        -  Screening period (no study medication), lasting approximately 7 days prior to
           randomization

        -  Treatment period, lasting fourteen days (7 days fore each dose)with once daily
           administration

        -  A safety follow-up visit, approximately four weeks after start of treatment.
