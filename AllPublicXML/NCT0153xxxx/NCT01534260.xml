  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research is being done because treatment options are very limited and usually
      unsuccessful for Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) in older individuals, or younger people with
      disease that has relapsed and/or proven resistant to standard therapy. Subjects are invited
      to participate in this study that will examine the use of three drugs called Sorafenib
      (Nexavar), Vorinostat (Zolinza) and Bortezomib (Velcade) for treating acute myeloid leukemia.

    <description>Escalating dose cohorts of sorafenib, vorinostat and bortezomib. The first cohort will receive sorafenib from day 1 to 14, vorinostat will be given on days 1-4 and 8-12, and bortezomib will be given on days 1 and 8. This will be followed by 7 days of rest. Therefore each cycle will be 21 days.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  A confirmed baseline diagnosis of AML by the revised guidelines of the International
             Working Group for AML including newly diagnosed, relapsed or refractory disease.

          -  Poor-risk or complex cytogenetics profile, or deletion of chromosome 5, or deletion of
             chromosome 7, or positive FLT3-ITD mutation.

          -  The patient must have discontinued all previous therapies for acute leukemia for at
             least 14 days and recovered from the acute non-hematologic side effects of the
             therapy.

          -  Hydroxyurea to control peripheral blood blast count must be discontinued within 24
             hours prior to the initiation of treatment.

          -  Patients must have an ECOG (Zubrod) performance status of 0-2

          -  Patients must have adequate hepatic and renal function according to the protocol
             within one week prior to treatment.

          -  Female patients must be postmenopausal, surgically sterile or agree to use effective
             methods of contraception throughout the study.

             contraception throughout the study.

          -  Patients must be able to swallow and tolerate oral medications.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Known central nervous system (CNS) leukemia.

          -  Diagnosis of acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL).

          -  Grade &gt;/= 2 peripheral neuropathy.

             onset angina or myocardial infarction within the past 6 months, cardiac ventricular
             arrhythmias requiring anti-arrhythmic therapy, thrombotic or embolic events such as a
             cerebrovascular accident including transient ischemic attacks within past 3 months.
             Serious medical or psychiatric illness/social situations that in the opinion of the
             investigator would limit compliance with study requirements.

          -  Diagnosed or treated for another malignancy within 3 years of enrollment, with the
             exception of complete resection of basal cell carcinoma or squamous cell carcinoma of
             the skin, an in situ malignancy, or low-risk prostate cancer after curative therapy.

          -  Active corneal erosions or history of abnormal corneal sensitivity test.

          -  Known or suspected history of severe hypersensitivity reaction to tyrosine kinase
             inhibitors, histone deacetylase inhibitors, proteosome inhibitors, boron, or mannitol.

             hours of initiation of treatment, or a positive urine pregnancy test on Day 1 before
             first dose of study drug.

          -  Concurrent use of other histone deacetylase inhibitors (e.g. valproic acid) are
             prohibited except for HDAC inhibitors or HDAC-inhibitor like agents used for
             non-cancer treatment (e.g. epilepsy), where a 14 day washout is allowed.
