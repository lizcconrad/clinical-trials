  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to develop, implement and evaluate an intervention focused to
      change feeding practices and patterns of physical activity of preschool children through
      providing motivational counseling to the mother. The aim is to prevent obesity in children
      aged 2 to 4 years 11 months with risk of overweight or with overweight.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Obesity has a multi-causal origin in which participate, in a similar way, the individual
      behavior and family and community contexts and the social environment.

      Participation of primary care services is key to solve the problem. These services have the
      possibility to detect timely children with high body mass index, and to promote behavior to
      improve feeding practices and physical activity in both, the child and his family.

      The study is divided in two stages:

        1. Design of the intervention. The researchers will use qualitative methods to evaluate
           feeding practices, physical activity and the environment in which such behaviors are
           generated. In a similar way the care provided by health professionals to overweight and
           obese children it will be evaluated; this includes the perception that health providers
           have about this problem. The information will allow identifying risk behavior and
           healthy behavior, facilitators and obstacles to receive care. The results will serve to
           define the contents of the intervention.

        2. Intervention: The study will take place in four family medicine clinics belonging to the
           Mexican Institute of Social Security. Two clinics will receive the intervention and two
           will serve as control. In each clinic, fifty children and their mothers will be
           recruited. At the intervention clinics, the group of mothers will participate in seven
           weekly sessions and in two individual sessions at 3 and 6 months after the group
           sessions finish. During the sessions, the researchers will motivate the mothers to
           change feeding practices and encourage physical exercise of the children and family,
           this will improve the chance for their children for healthy growing. The control group
           will receive the usual care that consists only in the recommendations that the family
           doctor provides.

      The evaluation of the study comprise feasibility and acceptability of the intervention and
      its effect in the behavior of the mothers in terms of changing feeding practices and
      practicing physical exercise.

    <measure>Change in Children´s Consumption of Foods From Baseline to 3 Months by Intervention Assignment</measure>
    <time_frame>0, 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>We asked parents about the average number of servings in the week or month the child consumed each food. We constructed grouped diet variables corresponding to food categories : sweet snacks (sugar-sweetened dairy, sugary cereal, cookies, sweet bread, cake, packaged pastries ], caramel pops, candies and chocolates); fast food (hamburgers, pizza, hot dogs, quesadillas, fried tacos, French fries); savory snacks (packaged snack foods, corn or potato chips); fruit (orange, mango, papaya, watermelon, grapes, apple, banana); vegetables (chard, broccoli, jitomate [tomato], nopales [cactus], chayote [squash], spinach, lettuce, zucchini, carrot); sugar-sweetened beverages (soda, flavored milk, homemade [agua fresca] and packaged fruit drinks); and added sugar in beverages (teaspoons sugar or sweet flavoring added to milk, coffee, tea, or fruit juice).</description>

    <measure>Change in Children´s Time of Physical Activity From Baseline to 3 Months by Intervention Assignment</measure>
    <time_frame>0, 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>Staff assisted parents in reporting the average time the participating child spent in pre-specified active and sedentary activities during the week and on weekends. For each of the pre-specified activities parents reported time spent in open-ended response format. From these responses we derived total hours/week of physical activity composed of active play (e.g. running, jumping, walking, playing ball, playing in the park, biking, swimming, dancing), as well as total hours/week of screen time, composed of television, DVD/video, and video and computer games.</description>

    <measure>Change in Score z of Body Mass Index From Baseline to 3 Months by Intervention Assignment</measure>

    <description>In order to calculate children's BMI and age and sex specific BMI z-scores at baseline and 3 month follow-up, study staff assessed child's height in meters and weight in kilograms. BMI was calculated as weight in kilograms divided by the square of height in meters.</description>

    <description>Participants randomized to intervention received a 6 week curriculum focused on obesity awareness and prevention. A trained nutritionist led diet, healthy growth and physical activity workshops, while a health educator led workshops on instilling healthy habits and routines in childhood. The nurse provided child care and developed relevant games and activities for children while parents attended the workshops.</description>

We gave the parents the height and weight results from the measurement of their child and recommended they share results with their physician in their next medical consultation.</description>

        <title>Change in Children´s Consumption of Foods From Baseline to 3 Months by Intervention Assignment</title>
        <description>We asked parents about the average number of servings in the week or month the child consumed each food. We constructed grouped diet variables corresponding to food categories : sweet snacks (sugar-sweetened dairy, sugary cereal, cookies, sweet bread, cake, packaged pastries ], caramel pops, candies and chocolates); fast food (hamburgers, pizza, hot dogs, quesadillas, fried tacos, French fries); savory snacks (packaged snack foods, corn or potato chips); fruit (orange, mango, papaya, watermelon, grapes, apple, banana); vegetables (chard, broccoli, jitomate [tomato], nopales [cactus], chayote [squash], spinach, lettuce, zucchini, carrot); sugar-sweetened beverages (soda, flavored milk, homemade [agua fresca] and packaged fruit drinks); and added sugar in beverages (teaspoons sugar or sweet flavoring added to milk, coffee, tea, or fruit juice).</description>

            <description>Eating and physical activity counseling : The parents of overweight children will be invited to attend a total of 6 group sessions (the group will be comprised of 6 children with their parents) on a weekly basis, in which 5 aspects will be dealt with 1) Dietary culture, risk-benefit practices, 2) The process of feeding (acquisition/preparation/service Eating behaviors), 3) Physical activity habits, 4) Importance of weighing/measuring oneself and its meaning, 5) feedback and evaluations. These aspects and contents will be distributed throughout the 6 sessions.
There will be two more individual session, at 3 and 6 months respectively, for the reinforcement of recommendations provided for the modification of dietary behaviors and physical activity.</description>

            <description>According to the existing clinical practice guide within IMSS, obese children may be referred to a nutritionist if the physician considers it necessary, given general dietary advice by the attending physician, or, if necessary, sent for laboratory analyses of blood lipids and glucose. We gave the parents the height and weight results from the measurement of their child and recommended they share results with their physician in their next medical consultation.</description>

      <pi_employee>All Principal Investigators ARE employed by the organization sponsoring the study.</pi_employee>
      <restrictive_agreement>There is NOT an agreement between Principal Investigators and the Sponsor (or its agents) that restricts the PI's rights to discuss or publish trial results after the trial is completed. </restrictive_agreement>

    <limitations_and_caveats>35% of families did not complete follow-up at 3 months, our primary endpoint. To address the resulting bias from missing data we performed multiple imputation of missing information on covariates and behavioral and BMI outcomes.</limitations_and_caveats>
