      Segment 1- this segment will include two main steps:

      Step 1-Calibration: During this step we plan to collect paired measurements of capillary
      blood glucose using reference method and data generated by the non invasive study device.
      Samples will be obtained at specific time points during 4 hours: at fasting, and after
      consuming standard liquid meal at 60, 120, 180 and 240 minutes. At each time point capillary
      blood glucose will be measured using the invasive reference method. The paired reference and
      study device data will be analyzed using multivariate regression model to formulate a
      calibration algorithm model. This model will convert the acetone values measured by study
      device to blood glucose values.

      step 2-Validation: During this segment the second step of this segment we plan to evaluate
      the validity and reliability of the non-invasive breath-based glucometer compared to standard
      invasive reference glucometer. Results will be compared using a Clark error grid.

      Segment 2- During this segment we plan to collect paired measurements of capillary blood
      glucose beta Hydroxybutyrate using reference method and acetone values generated by the non
      invasive breath based study device. Samples will be obtained at specific time points during 4
      hours after overnight fasting, while basal insulin will be suspended, which is accepted to
      produce ketosis.

    <description>The Clarke Error Gride breaks down a scatter plot of a reference glucose meter and an evaluated glucose meter into five regions:
values within 20% of the reference meter, values outside of 20% but would not lead to inappropriate treatment,points leading to unnecessary treatment,points indicating a potentially dangerous failure to detect hypoglycemia or hyperglycemia and points that would confuse treatment of hypoglycemia for hyperglycemia and vice-versa.</description>
