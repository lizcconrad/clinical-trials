  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A CVC is a sterile flexible tube that allows a drug to flow from a bottle or bag directly
      into a patient's bloodstream. CVCs may cause infections when bacteria gets into the catheter
      and enters the bloodstream. They also have a risk of becoming clogged. When this occurs, the
      CVC usually needs to be replaced.

      The goal of this clinical research study is to learn if an antimicrobial catheter lock
      solution can make it possible for the CVC to stay in place while treating an infection with
      antibiotics. The safety of the solution will also be tested.

      Your outcome will be compared to the outcome of patients who had the same type of infection
      but had their CVC removed.

      The antimicrobial catheter lock solution is made up of 3 chemicals:

      Minocycline and ethanol are designed to disinfect the CVC. Disodium
      ethylenediaminetetraacetate is designed to prevent the CVC from clogging.

      Study Drug Administration (Lock Solution):

      If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, the infection will be treated
      with antibiotics according to the standard of care. You will also receive the antimicrobial
      catheter lock solution through the CVC 2 hours per day for at least 5 days within the first
      week. In addition, you will receive the lock therapy for 2 additional days that could either
      be given on the following next 2 days or within the next 2 weeks. After locking the catheter
      for 2 hours, the HEAL lock will be cleared out, and the catheter will be flushed with normal
      saline and then locked with heparin or normal saline until the next time it needs to be used.

      Study Visits:

      On the first day after you receive the antimicrobial catheter lock solution, you will be
      checked for side effects such as pain, burning, discomfort, drowsiness, headache, facial
      redness, shortness of breath, and/or irregular heartbeat . After the last dose of receiving
      the catheter lock solution, you will be asked if you have experienced any side effects after
      receiving the catheter lock solution.

      One (1) time each day while you are in the hospital, you will be checked for signs of
      infection and your vital signs (heart rate, breathing rate, blood pressure, and temperature)
      will be measured.

      Every 2 days, blood (about 2 tablespoons) will be drawn to check for infection. This will
      continue until the blood draws no longer show signs of infection.

      Every week, blood (about one teaspoon) will be drawn to check that your liver is function
      well.

      Length of Study Participation:

      You may receive the antimicrobial catheter lock solution for up to 7 days (over the course of
      3 weeks). You will no longer be able to receive it if intolerable side effects occur or the
      infection does not go away after 7 days.

      End of Treatment Visit:

        -  You will need to return to MD Anderson for your end of treatment visit within 7 days
           (+/- 3 days) after your last dose of study drug.

        -  At this visit, you will be asked about any symptoms or illnesses that you may have had
           since your last visit. You will be checked for signs of infection and your vital signs
           will be measured.

        -  Blood (about 2 tablespoons) will be drawn to check for infection. You will be asked
           about any antimicrobial drugs or therapies that you may be taking until the end of your
           treatment.

      Follow-Up Visit:

      You will have a follow-up visit about 1 month after receiving the last dose of antimicrobial
      catheter lock solution. At this visit, you will be checked for signs of infection and your
      vital signs will be measured. If the doctor thinks it is needed, blood (about 2 tablespoons)
      will be drawn to check for infection. You will be asked about any antimicrobial drugs that
      you may be taking until the end of your treatment.

      This is an investigational study. The study lock solution is made up of minocycline, disodium
      ethylenediaminetetraacetate, and ethanol. Each of these are commercially available and FDA
      approved for other uses:

        -  Minocycline - for the treatment of cellulitis, acne, respiratory and urinary tract
           infections, gonococcal, chlamydial or ureaplasma urealyticum infections, cutaneous
           nocardiosis, and syphilis.

        -  Disodium ethylenediaminetetraacetate - for the treatment of lead poisoning

        -  Ethanol - for cleaning your hands

      It is investigational to give minocycline, disodium ethylenediaminetetraacetate, and ethanol
      in combination as an antimicrobial lock solution.

      Up to 30 patients will take part in this study. All will be enrolled at MD Anderson.

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients aged 18 years or older

          2. Patients with indwelling CVC that have been in place for at least 14 days with
             documented CLABSI as defined by CDC [62]. In neutropenic patients (defined as an
             absolute neutrophil count (ANC) &lt; 500 cells/mm3) with CLABSI, to confirm that CVC is
             the source of the bacteremia, we will use the definitions of catheter-related
             bloodstream infection (CRBSI) based on the mgmt guidelines of intravascular catheter
             related infections published by IDSA [10]. This includes the evidence that points to
             the CVC as the culprit: a) Paired quantitative blood cultures (QBC), whereby QBC are
             drawn through the CVC and peripheral vein and the blood cultures from the CVC reveal
             3-fold greater number of colonies than the peripherally drawn QBC. b) Differential
             time to positivity, where blood cultures simultaneously drawn from the CVC and
             peripheral vein are positive for the same organism, and the catheter-drawn blood
             culture turns positive at least 2 hours earlier than the peripherally drawn blood
             culture.

          3. Female patients must be non-lactating and at no risk for pregnancy for one of the
             following reasons: a) Postmenopausal for at least one year b) Post-hysterectomy and/or
             post-bilateral ovariectomy and/or other surgical sterilization c) If of childbearing
             potential, having a negative urine or serum human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG)
             pregnancy test within 5 days prior to study enrollment and be using a highly effective
             method of birth control throughout the course of the study. Reliable sexual abstinence
             throughout the course of the study is acceptable as a highly effective method of birth
             control for the purposes of this study.

          4. Patients with short term non-tunneled catheters will be enrolled only if CVC cannot be
             removed or exchanged (patient refuses to have CVC removed, CVC needed and no other
             vascular access available, patient is thrombocytopenic (platelet count below 20,000)
             that will prohibit inserting a new CVC at a different site).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients allergic to tetracycline antibiotics or calcium EDTA

          2. Patients on disulfiram or disulfiram like drugs

          3. Patients with severe sepsis, septic shock, hypotension or who are considered otherwise
             unstable

          4. Presence of prosthetic valve

          5. Presence of signs of metastatic deep-seated infection such as osteomyelitis or septic
             pulmonary infarcts or endocarditis (as evidenced by vegetations on an echocardiogram),
             or septic thrombosis

          6. Patients with tunnel or catheter exit site infection or infusion port pocket abscess
             as manifested by purulence at the exit site or inflammation with erythema or
             induration of &gt;1 cm in diameter.

          7. Patients with Candida line infection

          8. Patients who have been previously entered on the study
