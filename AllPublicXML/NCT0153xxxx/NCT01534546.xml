  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Peri-operative treatment of locally advanced gastric cancer (LAGC) has always been argued by
      eastern and western scholars. For patients with clinical stage of cT4b/N+M0, or cT4aN+M0, the
      prognosis is rather poor, and the primary lesions might not be resectable at the time of
      diagnosis. MAGIC study has showed that pre-and post-operative chemotherapy with 3 cycles of
      ECF has increased 13% on 5yOS compared with surgery alone; However, eastern studies such as
      ACTS GC or CLASSIC showed that TS-1 monotherapy or XELOX (oxaliplatin/capecitabine)
      combination given as adjuvant chemotherapy for stage II or III patients after D2 surgery
      could achieve the significant survival benefit. So whether perioperative or post operative
      therapy is more beneficial for LAGC patients lacks of data supported by prospective study.

      So in this prospective randomized phase III study, the investigators aim to compare the
      survival benefit as well as the safety for SOX (oxaliplatin/TS-1) as perioperative therapy
      versus SOX or XELOX as postoperative therapy after D2 dissection.
