      -  Primary objectives: To develop peritoneal carcinomatosis index (PCI) for ovarian cancer,
           tubal cancer and primary peritoneal cancer that can represent perioperative
           intraperitoneal tumor burden objectively

        -  Secondary objectives: To establish the relationship and find out clinical significance
           between PCI, tumor location and tumor characteristics

      Patients with primary ovarian cancer

        -  Informed consent

        -  Digital photography &amp; Checking PCI (tumor size, number, and Characteristics)

        -  Postoperative surveillance(tumor marker, image and physical examination)

             1. Developing the best fitting PCI model to reflect recurrence-free survival and
                overall survival

                  -  Selection of items

                  -  Weighting by items and tumor characteristics

             2. Analysis of prognostic impact of PCI compared to conventional staging system (FIGO
                stage) for ovarian cancer
