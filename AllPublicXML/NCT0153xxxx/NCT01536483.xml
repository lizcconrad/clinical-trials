  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Clinical management of very low birth weight newborns (VLBW &lt;1250g) consists in several
      challenges to adapt immature physiological systems to extrauterine life. Advances in neonatal
      medicine for pulmonary and/or neurological and/or cardiovascular diseases have significantly
      improved outcomes of these children. However, the gastro-intestinal (GI) tract remains a
      major cause of morbidity due to

        1. the immaturity of GI functions (prolonged ileus, bacterial overgrowth and
           translocation),

        2. the complication of GI tract immaturity: intestinal perforation and enterocolitis
           necrotizing)

        3. the need of a prolonged parenteral nutrition and its complications (central venous
           catheter infections, sepsis, electrolyte disturbances) but without generate a high proof
           level on this targeted population (&lt;1250g).

      The GI functions are progressively acquired during development and are largely sensitive to
      the environment, especially the intestinal luminal content. Indeed, probiotics and prebiotics
      have shown beneficial effects upon GI functions of newborns. One of the metabolite of the gut
      flora potentially involved is the butyrate. Butyrate is a short chain fatty acid produced in
      the colon by the microbiota (carbo-hydrates degradation). The colonic amount of butyrate
      increases gradually after birth. The beneficial effects of butyrate are related to its
      properties upon the epithelial barrier (anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, barrier repair) and
      upon the enteric nervous system (network of neurons and glial cells) that regulate GI
      functions and in particular colonic motility.

      To date, there is no clinical consensus to manage digestive disorders of VLBW. Several
      clinical studies have assessed the effects of prokinetic drugs, dietary supplements
      (probiotics, prebiotics) but without generate a high proof level on this targeted population.
      In this context, a recent study of our Research Unit (INSERM-CIC Mère-Enfant 004) has shown
      benefit effects of oral probiotics supplementation in children with birth weight greater than
      1000g but not in extreme preterms with birth weight less than 1000g.

      The main hypothesis to explain theses results lies in the intensive use of antibiotic and
      feeding interruption frequency in this targeted population which induce disturbances in the
      composition of the gut lumen (in particular the flora).

      Colonic enemas assessed in various observational studies concerning VLBW seem to demonstrate
      a clinical efficiency upon the colonic transit, underlying by mechanical and osmotic
      mechanisms.

      Here, the investigators propose to evaluate the clinical efficiency of butyrate enemas by a
      prospective randomized clinical trial blinded design.

      The purpose of NEOTRANS study is to demonstrate that butyrate enemas may improve the
      nutritional management of extreme preterm less than 1250 grams, by facilitating the
      development of colic motility and clinical nutrition tolerance.

    <description>The primary outcome of NEOTRANS study consists in the evaluation of the effects of colonic butyrate enemas upon the digestive maturation of preterms.
This endpoint is based on a clinical criteria that is the delay of weaning of the parenteral nutrition support. An increase of 25% (50 vs 75%) will be considered clinically significant.
Parenteral nutrition weaning is defined as the day where enteral caloric intake reach 80% of total calories.</description>

    <description>Seven enemas
Possibility to delay from 24 to 48 hours the procedure in case of clinical poor tolerance(maximum two enemas postponed and delayed at PND12 and PND13)
The study remains blinded for the investigation team through the intervention of a clinical research nurse
According to the procedure previously described by Nakaoka et al. (2009), a lubricated Foley catheter Ch 6 will be introduced into the rectum, the balloon will be inflated with 1 ml water for injections. Butyrate solution will be placed in a bag placed 50 cm above the child. Therefore, treatment administration will be performed at a controlled pressure of 50 cm H2O without any manual intervention
Installation time and retention is setted at 15 minutes
Treatment units will be directly placed in the incubator 30 min before the procedure to warm the enema to +36°C
Per-treatment clinical monitoring of the tolerance will be performed by a neonatologist</description>
