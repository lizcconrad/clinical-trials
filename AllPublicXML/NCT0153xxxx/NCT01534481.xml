    <textblock>
      The Milk Trial seeks to determine the effect on neurodevelopmental outcomes at age 22-26
      months of donor human milk as compared to preterm infant formula as the in-hospital diet for
      infants whose mothers choose not to provide breast milk or are able to provide only a minimal
      amount. Infants will be randomized to receive donor breast milk or formula during their
      hospital stay. Infant's will be followed until they reach 22-26 months of age.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There is strong evidence that maternal breast milk feedings in infancy confer multiple health
      benefits in the extremely preterm population (extremely low birth weight, ELBW, &lt;1000 g).
      Studies suggest an IQ advantage of up to 8 points conferred by maternal milk feeding in this
      population. Rates of sepsis and necrotizing enterocolitis are also lower in human milk fed
      ELBW infants, and they experience shorter hospital stays and fewer re-hospitalizations in the
      first year of life. When mothers choose not to or are unable to provide milk, preterm formula
      is usually used. Recently, pasteurized donor human milk is available in some NICUs in the US
      as an alternative to preterm formula. Donor milk has not been well studied with regard to its
      safety and efficacy. It is unknown if donor human milk confers the same benefits as maternal
      milk with regard to neurodevelopmental and health outcomes. The proposed study will be the
      first US multicenter randomized trial of the health and developmental effects of donor milk
      as compared to preterm formula in ELBW infants receiving little or no maternal milk. Our
      long-term goal is to optimize neurodevelopmental and health outcomes for ELBW infants,
      maximizing their quality of life and societal functionality throughout their lives. If donor
      human milk has similar effects to maternal milk, the public health benefit of donor milk
      feedings in ELBW infants unable to receive maternal milk would be considerable.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Gestational age less than 29 weeks.

          -  Admitted to the NICU at less than or equal to 72 hours of life

          -  Survived at least 12 hours

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Chromosomal anomalies

          -  Cyanotic congenital heart disease

          -  Diagnosed intrauterine infection

          -  Other congenital disorders known to impair neurodevelopment

          -  NEC or IP prior to seeking consent

          -  Decision documented to limit intensive care therapies

          -  Congenital disorders that may affect feeding

        Feeding Group Eligibility:

          -  Sole Diet Group: Infants will be eligible for the sole diet feeding protocol if the
             mother declines to provide breast milk for the baby.

          -  Supplemental Diet (minimal maternal milk) Group: Infants whose mothers initially
             choose to provide breast milk and begin pumping will be re-screened for eligibility at
             least weekly until the infant is 21 days old. If the mother stops expressing milk at
             any point prior to the infant's 21st day of life, her infant will be eligible for
             randomization. In addition, those whose mothers are providing less than 20% of the
             infant's dietary needs (averaged over past 5 days) when the infant reaches 21 days of
             age will be eligible for randomization at this point. No infant will be randomized
             after reaching 21 days.
