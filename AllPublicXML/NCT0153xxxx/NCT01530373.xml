  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hot flashes present a considerable problem for many breast cancer patients; these symptoms
      may be intensified by hormonal therapies, such as aromatase inhibitors or tamoxifen. This
      study examines the value of solifenacin (a muscarinic acetylcholine receptor antagonist) in
      reducing hot flashes, compared with clonidine (a medication often used for treating hot
      flashes).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There has been considerable interest in developing new treatment strategies for managing hot
      flashes among women with breast cancer, in view of the limitations associated with currently
      available treatments. This randomized study evaluates the safety and efficacy of 3 weeks of
      solifenacin compared to 3 weeks of clonidine, for women receiving adjuvant hormonal therapy
      (aromatase inhibitors or tamoxifen) for breast cancer.
