  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Plasma free fatty acids (FFAs) are thought to play a role in the generation of organ
      dysfunction. The investigators hypothesize that plasma FFA levels are a marker of poor
      prognosis in patients with sepsis. The present study will examine the relation between plasma
      FFA levels and severity of illness in patients with sepsis presenting to the Emergency
      Department. It will also examine the relation between plasma FFA levels and the risk of
      developing late morbidity, multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS) and/or mortality during
      initial hospitalization and over a 30-day follow-up period.

      The long term objective of this study is to investigate the mechanism by which plasma free
      fatty acids (FFAs) contribute to the progression of sepsis severity in infectious patients
      presenting to the Emergency Department. In the present study, pilot data will be generated to
      validate our hypothesis that elevated free fatty acids are related to outcome in sepsis.

      We will examine our hypotheses with the following specific aims:

        1. To determine if plasma FFA levels are related to severity of illness in patients with
           sepsis presenting to the Emergency Department.

        2. To study the prognostic value of plasma FFA levels at predicting future morbidity and
           mortality in patients with sepsis presenting to the Emergency Department.

      Blood samples (10 cc. total) are to be collected in non-heparinized tubes upon initial
      presentation to the ED as well as 3-6hours and 24(+/-3) hours after the initial blood draw.
      The 3-6hour and 24-hour blood draw will be optional depending on patient location and the
      availability of study personnel. The plasma samples will be aliquoted and frozen at -70°C for
      later assays. These samples will be assayed for plasma FFA, plasma glucose, plasma insulin,
      and future cytokines including IL-1 and TNF.
