  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed to compare safety and efficacy of monotherapy finasteride to
      combination therapy (finasteride and tamsulosin) in Asian men with benign prostatic
      hyperplasia (BPH) who are at least 50 years of age or older. The primary hypotheses are that
      concomitantly-dosed finasteride 5 mg and tamsulosin 0.2 mg will be superior with respect to
      BPH symptoms compared to monotherapy with finasteride 5 mg as measured by change from
      baseline on the International Prostate Symptoms Score (IPSS) and will be superior with
      respect to prostate volume reduction compared to montherapy with tamsulosin 0.2 mg as
      measured by percent change from baseline in prostate volume.

    <description>The IPSS is a self-administered questionnaire used to measure the severity of lower urinary tract symptoms among men suspected of having symptomatic Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia (BPH). The IPSS consists of 8 questions (7 urinary symptom questions + 1 quality of life question). The 7 symptom questions inquire about frequency, nocturia, weak urinary stream, hesitancy, intermittence, incomplete emptying and urgency. Each of the 7 questions has an ordered categorical response frame scored from 0 (not at all) to 5 (almost all the time). The total score is the sum of the 7 items and therefore has a range of 0 to 35. Higher scores indicate higher symptom severity. The quality of life question is a single global question rated on a scale of 0 (delighted) to 6 (terrible) asking the participant to rate how they feel about their current urinary symptom status. The IPSS-QoL question is not used in the calculation of the total symptom score.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS)</title>
        <description>The IPSS is a self-administered questionnaire used to measure the severity of lower urinary tract symptoms among men suspected of having symptomatic Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia (BPH). The IPSS consists of 8 questions (7 urinary symptom questions + 1 quality of life question). The 7 symptom questions inquire about frequency, nocturia, weak urinary stream, hesitancy, intermittence, incomplete emptying and urgency. Each of the 7 questions has an ordered categorical response frame scored from 0 (not at all) to 5 (almost all the time). The total score is the sum of the 7 items and therefore has a range of 0 to 35. Higher scores indicate higher symptom severity. The quality of life question is a single global question rated on a scale of 0 (delighted) to 6 (terrible) asking the participant to rate how they feel about their current urinary symptom status. The IPSS-QoL question is not used in the calculation of the total symptom score.</description>

        <population>Full Analysis Set (FAS) - population consists of all randomized participants who received at least one dose of study treatment, at least one post-randomization observation for the analysis endpoint, and baseline data for those analyses that require baseline data. As only one participant was randomized in the study, no analyses were performed.</population>
