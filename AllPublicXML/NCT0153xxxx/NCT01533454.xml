  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test the extent to which incentives, when combined with an
      existing evidence-based weight loss program, improve weight loss and weight loss maintenance.
      It will also compare the cost-effectiveness of the incentive-based weight loss programs to
      the basic program without incentives.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Globally, the rise in obesity rates has reached epidemic proportions, and in Singapore 53% of
      adults have a body mass index (BMI) great than 23.0 kg/m2, a level that increases risk for
      chronic disease among Asians. This study aims to test the extent to which traditional or
      behavioural economic incentives, when combined with an existing evidence-based weight loss
      program, improve weight loss and weight loss maintenance. Data will be collected through a
      two-arm (basic weight loss program, basic program plus traditional or behavioural economic
      incentives) randomized controlled trial (RCT) where key outcome variables are defined as
      weight loss (kilograms) at 8 months when the incentive program concludes, and at 12 months,
      after a 4 month period in which no additional incentives are provided. We hypothesize that at
      both 8 and 12 months, weight loss will be greater in the incentive arm than in the arm
      without incentives. The growing obesity epidemic, the high costs of obesity to employers,
      insurers and governments across Asia, and the fact that the incentive program is designed to
      be close to cost neutral, suggest that this research has high potential to have a significant
      public health impact, both in Singapore and the region.
