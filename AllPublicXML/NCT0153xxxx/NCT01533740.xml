      Aim of the present study is to investigate whether baseline or early post-treatment (one
      month after treatment commencement) frequency of peripheral T regulatory lymphocytes (Tregs
      OR CD4+/CD25high/FOXP3+ T cells), known to suppress antitumor immune response, may influence
      long-term clinical outcome (i.e. radiological response, progression-free survival or overall
      survival) in metastatic colorectal cancer patients treated with a standard first-line
      chemotherapy including fluorouracil, irinotecan and bevacizumab
