      PROJECT OVERVIEW

      This research is a collaboration between the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
      (CDC), the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA), and six university-affiliated
      HIV clinics in the United States.

      Study title: Intervention Trials to Retain HIV Patients in Medical Care

      Study sites: The study will be performed at six HIV clinics affiliated with academic medical
      centers.

      Objectives: Using HIV patients' clinical data (without personal identifiers) routinely
      archived in electronic databases at the six participating clinics do the following:

      â€¢ To examine the extent to which a client-centered intervention delivered by trained
      interventionists (Phase 2 trial of the project) improves patient attendance for HIV primary
      care over and above the effect of the clinic-wide intervention. Phase 2 is a three-arm
      randomized controlled trial conducted at each of the participating six clinics. 300 patients
      will be enrolled in the Phase 2 trial at each clinic. One hundred will be new patients and
      200 will be patients with inconsistent attendance for HIV primary care at the clinic in the
      prior 12 months. Patients will be randomized to: (1) an enhanced contact plus behavioral
      skills arm or (2) an enhanced contact-only arm in which patients will receive a longer or a
      shorter client-centered intervention from two trained interventionists, or (3) the standard
      of care arm in which patients will receive the clinic-wide intervention and routine HIV
      clinical care only.

      Design: Phase 1 uses a pre-post comparison of clinic attendance rates before and during a
      clinic-wide intervention. Phase 2 uses a randomized controlled trial experimental design.

      Target population: Adults in primary medical care for HIV infection at 6 sites: (1)
      University of Alabama at Birmingham; (2) Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, Texas; (3)
      Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, Maryland; (4) State University of New
      York, Downstate Medical Center, Brooklyn, New York; (5) Boston Medical Center, Boston,
      Massachusetts; and (6) University of Miami Miller School of Medicine, Miami, Florida.

      Primary endpoints: The proportion of patients attending one or more HIV primary care visits
      in each of three four-month periods over the 12-months. A second measure will be the
      percentage of kept divided by scheduled primary care visits, excluding cancelled visits.

      Duration of study: In the Phase 2 trial, the enrollment period will run six months and the
      three-arm intervention will run 12 months.

      Main eligibility criteria: Phase 1: All patients presenting at the clinics beginning April 1,
      2009 will receive the clinic-wide intervention. Attendance data from electronic medical
      records will be archived at the clinics (and transmitted later to CDC) beginning on April 1,
      2008, one year before the start of the clinic-wide intervention. Patients with at least one
      scheduled clinic appointment qualify for inclusion in the study database. In Phase 2,
      patients 18 years of age and older (19 years of age in Alabama) who meet one of the following
      criteria are eligible to enroll: (1) new patients (first or second care visit at the clinic),
      or (2) patients who have inconsistent attendance for HIV primary care--defined as having had
      at least one no-show for a primary care appointment in the prior 12 months and patients not
      seen for HIV primary care at least once in each of two consecutive 6-month periods (among
      persons who have been patients at the clinic for at least 12 months.)

      Study procedures: In Phase 1, attendance data maintained in electronic databases at the six
      participating clinics will be used (without personal identifiers) to examine attendance rates
      before and during the clinic-wide intervention. The Phase 1 clinic-wide intervention will
      include hanging posters in the clinic and having clinic staff distribute brochures that
      address the importance of attending HIV care on a regular basis, the importance of
      re-scheduling and canceling appointments, and having HIV primary care providers deliver brief
      messages about the importance of regular clinic attendance to all patients.

      In Phase 2 trial, eligible patients (determined by review of attendance data from the
      clinic's database) will be consented, enrolled, and randomized to receive either (1) an
      enhanced contact plus skills intervention or (2) an enhanced contact only intervention from
      two trained interventionists, or (3) to receive standard of care at the clinic (no contact
      with the interventionists). The Phase 2 trial intervention includes periodic one-on-one
      meetings with the interventionists to address barriers to care (attitudes about HIV and unmet
      needs such as transportation, child care, housing, mental health, and drug use). The
      interventionists will work in collaboration with the patient's existing case manager(s) to
      help address these needs. Additionally, the interventionists will develop a personalized
      retention plan based on the patient's responses to a retention risk screener, deliver
      information and motivational statements about the importance of regular medical care for HIV
      infection, help the patient learn how to navigate a complex medical system, maintain contact
      (e.g., via telephone or outreach visits) with patients between clinic appointments, and make
      reminder telephone calls a few days before appointments.

      Attendance data:

      Enrollees' HIV primary care clinic attendance will be monitored quarterly through electronic
      medical records for at least 18 months, six months before and 12 months during the
      intervention. Patients who are not enrolled in the trial will continue to receive regular
      medical care at the clinic as well as the clinic-wide intervention.

      Analysis methods: In Phase 1, a cohort of patients at each clinic will be identified and
      followed over time to compare their attendance (through electronic medical records) before
      and during the clinic-wide intervention using appropriate methods for making pre-post
      comparisons. In the Phase 2 trial, attendance will be compared by intervention arm and
      further broken down by demographic (e.g., gender, race/ethnicity) and clinical subgroups
      (e.g., viral load at baseline, self-reported substance use) to examine variables that may
      modify the intervention effect.

      Data Management:

      Data management and analysis will be the primary responsibility of CDC, although sites will
      also participate in data analysis activities. CDC will train sites in data management and in
      the use of the Secure Data Network (SDN) to transmit data files to CDC. CDC will provide all
      necessary data management guidelines to research sites.

      Protocol Development:

      CDC and HRSA will have the lead responsibility for the development of the project protocol
      for local IRB review by all cooperating institutions participating in the research project.
      HRSA in collaboration with CDC, will organize and conduct site investigators' meetings to
      discuss the project's progress and plan for the next year's milestones.

      Protocol Modifications:

      All protocol modifications will be approved by local site IRBs. Local IRB approvals will be
      obtained before protocol changes are implemented. CDC will maintain copies of current local
      site IRB approval letters and approved consent forms.

      <recruitment_details>Recruitment occurred from June 15, 2010 through February 11, 2011. Recruitment time varied from 6 months to 8 months, by clinic site. Recruitment always occurred during regularly scheduled primary care appointments, either in a private corner of the waiting room, or in an adjacent room of the clinic.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>No exclusions from the trial if participant was deemed eligible and agreed to participate. Once participants were deemed eligible, and agreed, they were escorted to a private room to do the audio-CASI questionnaire. After the audio-CASI was completed they were immediately randomized to one of the three arms.</pre_assignment_details>

          <title>Enhanced Contact-only</title>
          <description>The enhanced contact only arm was described in the summary/Detailed Description as the shorter intervention. This arm did not require any additional special study visits after enrollment. The contacts of the interventionist with the patient were related to making and keeping clinic appointments.</description>
        </group>
        <group group_id="E2">
          <title>Enhanced Contact-plus Behavioral Skills</title>
          <description>This arm was described in the summary/Detailed Description as the &quot;longer comprehensive intervention arm&quot;. Patients assigned to this arm were required to return to the clinic within the next two weeks after enrollment to receive a one-to-two hour training in elements of behavioral skills relevant to improved clinic attendance. The mixture of elements was determined by the interventionist in a discussion with the patient at this special study visit. Subsequent contacts of the interventionist with patients in this arm would refer to these behavioral skills elements and to making and keeping clinic appointments.</description>
        </group>
        <group group_id="E3">
          <title>Standard of Care</title>
          <description>Participants randomized to the SOC arm received the usual attention and encouragement to attend all clinic visits that prevailed at the clinic at the time of this intervention. This attention could include the routine advice from a nurse, personal or robo reminder calls before a next clinic visit. Contacts with case managers and social workers related to clinic appointments could also occur, per the clinic's standard procedures.</description>
