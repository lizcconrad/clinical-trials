  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Few clinical evidence for the Contour 3D Tricuspid Annuloplasty Ring exists; therefore, in
      order to position this product on the market, a post-market release study was completed. The
      purpose of this study was to evaluate the hemodynamic performance of the Contour 3D®
      Tricuspid Annuloplasty Ring following Tricuspid Valve repair in a post-market environment.

      The EASE TRICUSPID Clinical Trial was a prospective, non-randomized, non-interventional,
      post-market release study. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the hemodynamic
      performance of the Contour 3D® Tricuspid Annuloplasty Ring following Tricuspid Valve repair
      in a post-market environment. Therefore, the primary objective of the EASE Tricuspid Study
      was to evaluate the hemodynamic performance of the Contour 3D® Tricuspid Annuloplasty Ring
      (Contour 3D ring) in subjects with tricuspid regurgitation who had a clinical indication for
      TV repair in a post-market use. Secondary objectives included the evaluation of the effect of
      TV repair with the Contour 3D ring on the right ventricular function, as well as the
      assessment of the effect of TV repair with the Contour 3D ring on the functional status in
      subjects undergoing TV repair in a post-market environment. Subjects eligible for TV repair
      and compliant with the enrollment criteria were considered by the Investigator for inclusion
      in the study. To minimize bias, enrolled subjects were followed by their own physician in
      accordance with the center's established practice for routine follow up. Follow-up sessions
      were planned at the physician's discretion. To meet the intended goals, appropriate clinical
      data were collected at baseline (pre-surgery), during the surgical procedure, at discharge
      and during the follow-up period at 6 months. Experienced echocardiologists evaluated the
      echos. At the time of enrollment it was not certain if the subject would receive a Contour 3D
      ring, since the surgeon might have decided during surgery that another treatment was more
      beneficial to the subject. In this case, the subject was terminated from the study.

        The patient population includes all patients indicated for a TV repair procedure
        concomitantly to left-sided heart surgery, and for which the surgeon considers the
        implantation of a Contour 3D® Tricuspid Annuloplasty Ring most appropriate to reconstruct
        the diseased valve. Patients with primary TV are not included, since this is often
        characterized by pathological leaflets for which the Contour 3D® Tricuspid Annuloplasty
        Ring would not be beneficial.
