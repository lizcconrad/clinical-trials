  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Rationale:

      The hysteroscopic morcellator (HM) is a novel technique for removal of intrauterine polyps,
      myomas and placental tissue. It withholds some technical advantages over resectoscopy.
      Previous data suggest that it's a faster technique than the latter, and shows that it has a
      low complication rate.

      Objective:

      To compare the HM to bipolar resectoscopy for removal of:

      1) large intrauterine polyps, 2) smaller type 0 and 1 myomas, 3) residual placental tissue,
      in terms of efficiency and complications.

      Study design: Single blind, randomized controlled multicenter trial.

      Study population: Women aged over 18 years old with:

      1) large (≥ 1 cm) intrauterine polyps, 2) smaller (≤ 3 cm) type 0 or 1 myomas, 3) residual
      placental tissue, who are planned for hysteroscopic removal.

      Intervention:

      Patients are randomized between removal with the HM or the bipolar resectoscope.

      Main study parameters/endpoints:

      Installation and operating time.

      Nature and extent of the burden and risks associated with participation, benefit and group
      relatedness:

      Women who are referred to our polyclinic will be seen on a first visit, and, according to the
      standard work-up, an ultrasound will be performed when intrauterine pathology is suspected.
      To confirm the diagnosis a saline infusion sonography (SIS) and/or ambulant diagnostic
      hysteroscopy will be performed consequently. Once the diagnosis is confirmed and surgery is
      planned, women will be asked whether they want to take part in this study. At this moment,
      both techniques are used in our hospitals and the choice of treatment depends on the
      preference of the gynaecologist. All women will be treated with operative hysteroscopy in a
      daycare setting according to the standard of care, only now randomized between the two
      techniques. A standard postoperative visit with ultrasound examination and/or ambulant
      diagnostic hysteroscopy is scheduled 6 weeks later. Late postoperative complications and
      complaints are recorded.

      It is expected that the HM beholds some advantages over the bipolar resectoscope such as
      shorter operating time and less complications (e.g. risk of perforation, current and fluid
      related complications). Previous data do not demonstrate any additional risks related to the
      use of the HM. Moreover we will check whether the HM has a lower risk of intrauterine
      adhesion formation, as this might influence patient's fertility.

      After completion of the RCT, an observational study is planned considering pregnancies
      subsequent to the hysteroscopic procedure.

    <description>Installation time is defined as the time to set up the hysteroscopic instrumentation ready for use (time from start of setting up the instrumentation to start resection / morcellation).
Operating time is defined as the time starting visual introduction of the hysteroscope until the time at which the procedure is completed and the hysteroscope is removed definitely.
Times will be measured with a stop watch by a trained nurse.</description>

At 6 weeks postoperatively a standard visit is scheduled. Complications and complaints are recorded, and ultrasound is performed.</description>

    <description>Morcellation will be performed with the HM (TRUCLEAR, Smith &amp; Nephew, Andover, USA). The rotary blade is used for polypectomy and removal of residual placental tissue; the reciprocating blade is used for myomectomy. The blade has a window-opening at the end with cutting edges through which tissue is aspirated by means of a vacuum source. The removed tissue is discharged through the device, collected in a pouch and made available for pathology analysis.</description>

    <description>Resectoscopy will be performed with a rigid 8.5 mm bipolar resectoscope (Karl Storz GmbH, Tuttlingen, Germany), equipped with a 0 or 30 degree optic. Normal saline is used for distension and irrigation of the uterine cavity. Fluid balance is closely monitored using a Hystero pump (Richard Wolf GmbH, Knittlingen, Germany) or Hysteromat pump (Karl Storz GmbH, Tuttlingen, Germany).</description>
