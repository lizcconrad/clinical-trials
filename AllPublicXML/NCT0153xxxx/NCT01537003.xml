      The purpose of this trial is to determine if wounds with elevated protease activity (EPA)
      treated with targeted interventions such as protease modulating therapies can improve
      clinical and economic outcomes. It is hypothesized that protease modulating dressings may
      provide significantly better clinical outcomes on EPA wounds over current standard of care.

      Wounds with EPA will be determined using a new POC diagnostic test, WOUNDCHEK™ Protease
      Status, and the efficacy of PROMOGRAN®, a protease modulating therapy will be determined
      against standard of care (moist wound healing and compression) in VLU wounds in both elevated
      EPA and low protease activity wounds.

    <description>The primary end-point of this study will be to identify EPA wounds using WOUNDCHEK™ Protease Status diagnostic test, and to compare the healing outcomes of two treatment regimes (PROMOGRAN®, a protease modulating therapy and current standard of care) on chronic wounds with EPA.
An improved healing outcome for venous leg ulcers will be defined as the proportion of wounds which reach a minimum 30% percentage reduction in wound surface area over a four-week treatment period.</description>
