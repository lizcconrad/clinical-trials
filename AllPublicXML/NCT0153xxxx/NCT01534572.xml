  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There is a constant exchange between the gut epithelium and lumen, including microbial
      interplay. The aim of this study was to investigate dietary test products on inflammatory
      proliferation markers in the gut, and thereby if the products had positive effects in the gut
      as well as in other parts of the body.

      The hypothesis was that the test products would reduce the inflammatory and proliferation
      activity of the gut epithelium by fermentation of normal food products and by converting
      dietary phenolic compounds into anti-inflammatory substances.
