      The goal of this clinical research study is to find the highest tolerable dose of Siltuximab
      that can be given in combination with Velcade (bortezomib), Revlimid (lenalidomide), and
      dexamethasone to patients with MM. The safety of this drug combination will also be studied.

      The Study Drugs:

      Siltuximab is designed to block IL-6, which is a protein that plays an important role in the
      survival of myeloma cancer cells. This may slow the growth of cancer cells or cause the
      cancer cells to die.

      Bortezomib is designed to block a protein that plays a role in cell function and growth. This
      may cause cancer cells to die.

      Lenalidomide is designed to kill the myeloma cells and may change the body's immune system.
      It may also interfere with the development of tiny blood vessels that help support tumor
      growth. This may slow the growth of cancer cells.

      Dexamethasone is a corticosteroid that is similar to a natural hormone made by your body.
      Dexamethasone is often given to MM patients in combination with other chemotherapy to treat
      cancer.

      Study Groups:

      If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, based on when you join the study
      you will be enrolled in the Phase I or Phase II portion. If you are in Phase I, you will be
      assigned to a dose level of Siltuximab based on when you join this study. Up to 2 dose levels
      of Siltuximab will be tested. Three (3) to 6 participants will be enrolled at each dose
      level. The first group of participants will receive the highest dose level. If intolerable
      side effects are seen in the first group, the next group will receive a lower dose.

      All participants will receive the same dose level of bortezomib, lenalidomide, and
      dexamethasone.

      After the highest tolerable dose level is found, up to an extra 54 participants will receive
      the study drugs at this dose level in the Phase II part of the study.

      Study Drug Administration:

      Induction Therapy - Each cycle is 21 days. On Days 1, 4, 8, and 11 of Cycle 1 up to Cycle 8
      (induction therapy), you will receive bortezomib through a needle under the skin or by vein
      over 3-5 seconds.

      On Days 1-14 of every cycle, you will take lenalidomide by mouth 1 time each day. Swallow
      lenalidomide capsules whole with 1 cup (about 8 ounces) of water. Do not break, chew, or open
      the capsules.

      On Day 1 of every cycle, you will receive Siltuximab by vein over 1 hour.

      On Days 1, 2, 4, 5, 8, 9, 11, and 12 of Cycles 1-8 (induction therapy), you will take
      dexamethasone by mouth 1 time a day. After 8 cycles, you may continue to take dexamethasone
      if the doctor thinks it is needed. Dexamethasone should be taken with food.

      You can take the study drugs any time during the day but you should take them at the same
      time every day.

      If you miss a dose of lenalidomide, take it as soon as you remember on the same day. If you
      miss taking your dose for the entire day, take your regular dose the next scheduled day (do
      NOT take double your regular dose to make up for the missed dose). If you take more than the
      prescribed dose of lenalidomide, you should seek emergency medical care if needed and contact
      the study staff right away.

      You will be given a study drug dosing calendar for each cycle to record the lenalidomide and
      dexamethasone you will be taking at home. Please bring the dosing calendar and pill bottles
      to your study visit at the beginning of each new cycle.

      If the doctor thinks it is in your best interest, you may have a stem cell transplant anytime
      after 4 cycles of induction therapy You will sign a separate consent form that will describe
      the procedure and the risks in detail.

      Maintenance Phase - Each cycle is 28 days. If you want to delay the stem cell transplant,
      after 4-8 cycles, you will begin the maintenance phase.

      During the maintenance phase:

        -  You will take lenalidomide on Days 1-21 of each cycle.

        -  You will take dexamethasone by mouth once a week.

        -  You will receive Siltuximab by vein on Day 1 of every cycle.

      Study Visits:

        -  You will have a skeletal survey.

        -  You will have a bone marrow biopsy to check the status of the disease.

        -  Blood (about 4 tablespoon) and urine will be collected for routine tests.

      Long-Term Follow-Up:

      If you go off study for reasons other then the disease getting worse, blood (about 5
      tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests. This will done every 3 months for the first 2
      years, every 6 months for Years 3 and 4, and yearly for Years 5 and 6. The long term visits
      will be to check disease status, survival, long term side effects, and secondary cancers.

      This is an investigational study. Siltuximab is not FDA approved or commercially available.
      It is only being used for research at this time. Bortezomib is FDA approved and commercially
      available for the front-line treatment of MM. Lenalidomide is FDA approved and commercially
      available for the treatment of certain types of myelodysplastic syndrome and for use with
      dexamethasone for patients with MM who have received at least 1 therapy. The use of this drug
      combination to treat MM is investigational.

      Up to 11 patients will take part in this study. All will be enrolled at MD Anderson.

             by the International Myeloma Foundation 2003 Diagnostic Criteria: IMF Diagnostic
             Criteria: DIAGNOSTIC CRITERIA: ALL 3 REQUIRED 1. Monoclonal plasma cells in the bone
             marrow &gt; 10% and/or presence of a biopsy-proven plasmacytoma 2. Monoclonal protein
             present in the serum and/or urine * 3. Myeloma-related organ dysfunction (1 or more)
             ** ; [C] Calcium elevation in the blood S. Calcium &gt;10.5 mg/l or upper limit of normal
             ; [R] Renal insufficiency ; [A] Anemia Hemoglobin &lt; 10 g/dl or 2 g &lt; normal ; [B]

             One week must have lapsed since last date of radiotherapy, which is recommended to be
             a limited field. Patients who require concurrent radiotherapy should have start of the
             protocol therapy (Cycle 1 Day 1) deferred until the radiotherapy is completed and one
             week have passed since the last date of therapy.

          5. Voluntary written informed consent before performance of any study-related procedure
