  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Examine neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) formation, in relation to other neutrophil
      functions like chemotaxis, superoxide production, hydrogen peroxide production, and the
      presence of myeloperoxidase, in pediatric patients undergoing chemotherpy for solid and
      hematological malignancies. This data could shed new light on the mechanism responsible for
      the increased susceptibility to infection among these patients and aid in improving their
      prophylactic antimicrobial treatment.

      NETs formation against tumor cell lines and their ability to kill tumor cells will also be
      examined. The finding of NETs activity against tumor cells could have a major contribution to
      the investigators understanding of the function of the immune system against cancer.

      Neutrophil function, including NETs formation, chemotaxis, superoxide production, hydrogen
      peroxide production, and the presence of myeloperoxidase, will be examined in 50 pediatric
      patientsundergoing chemotherapy for solid and hematological malignancies. Children with the
      following malignancies will be examined: acute lymphoblastic leukemia,acute myelogenous
      leukemia,Hodgkin's lymphoma,non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, primary bone
      sarcoma,rhabdomyosarcoma,non-rhabdomyosarcoma,neuroblastoma,Wilms' tumor,hepatoblastoma or
      hepatocellular carcinoma,germ cell tumors, and hystiocytosis. Also those with brain tumors
      such as medulloblastom,low grade glioma,high grade glioma,ependymoma,and embryonal and pineal
      region tumors. Data gathered on the patients will include background data (age, gender,
      ethnicity) and background diseases, data on current illness (histologic type, grade, stage,
      response treatment,infectious episodes), and on the use of ranulocyte-colony stimulating
      factor (G-CSF).

      The following time points will be examined:

        1. At diagnosis, before initiation of chemotherapy.

        2. immediately before the 2nd course.

        3. After the middle course.

        4. A month after the last course.

        5. Three months after the last course.

        6. In acute myelogenous leukemia and acute lymphoblastic leukemia,time points also include
           the middle of the maintenance course and 3 months after the end of maintenance.

      An additional blood examination will be used to examine NETs formation against tumor cell
      lines and their ability to kill tumor cells.
