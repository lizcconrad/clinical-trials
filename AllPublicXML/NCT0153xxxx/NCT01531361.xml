  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this clinical research study is to find the highest tolerable dose of the
      combination of ZelborafTM (vemurafenib) with Nexavar® (sorafenib) or Xalkori® (crizotinib)
      that can be given to patients with advanced cancer. The safety of these drugs will also be
      studied.

      Vemurafenib is designed to block a protein called BRAFV600E inside the cancer cells, which is
      involved in cancer cell growth.

      Sorafenib is designed to block the function of important proteins in and outside of cancer
      cells. These proteins are involved in cancer cells growth and new blood vessel development.

      Crizotinib is designed to block certain abnormal genes found in cancer cells. This may cause
      the cancer cells to die.

      This is an investigational study. Vemurafenib is FDA approved and commercially available to
      treat progressive melanoma with the BRAFV600E mutation. Sorafenib is FDA approved and
      commercially available to treat progressive hepatocellular carcinoma and renal cell
      carcinoma. Crizotinib is FDA approved and commercially available to treat locally advanced or
      metastatic non-small lung cancer. Giving the combination of vemurafenib either with sorafenib
      or crizotinib to patients with advanced cancer is investigational.

      Up to 183 patients will be enrolled in this study. All will be enrolled at MD Anderson.

      Study Groups:

      Dose escalation:

      If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, your doctor will decide if you
      will receive vemurafenib either with sorafenib or crizotinib. Once it is decided which
      combination you will receive, you will be assigned to a dose level based on when you join the
      study.

      Up to 6 dose levels of vemurafenib with sorafenib will be tested. Up to 5 dose levels of
      vemurafenib with crizotinib will be tested. Up to 6 participants will be enrolled at each
      dose level. The first group of participants will receive the lowest dose level. Each new
      group will receive a higher dose than the group before it, if no intolerable side effects
      were seen. This will continue until the highest tolerable dose of vemurafenib either with
      sorafenib or crizotinib is found.

      Dose expansion:

      Once the highest tolerable dose of vemurafenib either with sorafenib or crizotinib is found,
      up to 14 more participants may be enrolled. This will be to further study the safety of the
      combination of drugs at that dose and the level of effectiveness of the study drugs in a
      certain tumor group.

      Study Drug Administration:

      Each study cycle is 28 days.

      You will take vemurafenib by mouth 2 times a day at the same time every day either with or
      without food, swallowed whole with a glass of water. Tablets should not be chewed or crushed.
      If you miss a dose, you can take it up to 4 hours before the next dose. You cannot take both
      doses at the same time.

      You will take sorafenib by mouth at the same time every day without food (at least 1 hour
      before or 2 hours after a meal). Depending on which dose level you are enrolled in, you will
      take sorafenib by mouth either 1 or 2 times a day. The doctor will discuss this with you.

      You will take crizotinib by mouth at the same time every day consistently either with or
      without food, swallowed whole with a glass of water. Depending on which dose level you are
      receiving, you will take crizotinib by mouth either 1 or 2 times a day. The doctor will
      discuss this with you.

      Study Visits:

      At every study visit, you will be asked if you have had any side effects.

      Around Days 1, 8, 15, and 22 of Cycle 1 and Day 1 of Cycles 2 and beyond:

        -  Blood (about 2-4 tablespoons) will be drawn for mutation/genetic testing.
           Mutation/genetic testing looks at whether specific genes are changed (mutated) in the
           tumor.

        -  Urine will be collected for mutation/genetic testing. You may collect your first urine
           of the morning, anytime during the day, or you may collect urine for 24 hours. You will
           be given containers to collect the urine and will be told how to use them.

      If you collect your urine over 24 hours, the study staff will give you a large (3-liter)
      urine storage container and a small (7-ounce) plastic collection container. You will urinate
      into the small collection container and then pour the urine into the large urine storage
      container within 10 minutes after the collection. You should write down the time of the first
      and last collections in the large storage container and return it to the study staff at the
      end of the 24-hour period.

      If you collect your first urine of the morning, the study staff will give you 3 plastic
      collection cups and 3 small tubes filled with a preservative solution. To collect your first
      morning urine, you will fill the collection cup with urine up to the 100 mL (milliliter)
      line, add 1 of the small tubes of preservative to the cup within 10 minutes, and then mark on
      the container that this is your first morning urine. If possible, fill the other 2 collection
      cups, adding a tube of preservative to each as just described and mark them as part of your
      first morning urine. You will return the collection cups to the study staff at your next
      visit.

      If you collect your urine anytime it suits you, the study staff will give you 3 plastic
      collection cups and 3 small tubes filled with a preservative solution. To collect your urine,
      you will fill the collection cup with urine up to the 100 mL line, add 1 of the small tubes
      of preservative to the cup within 10 minutes, and then mark on the container that this is
      your first morning urine. If possible, fill the other 2 collection cups, adding a tube of
      preservative to each as just described and mark them so the study doctor will know the time
      when you collected your urine. You will return the collection cups to the study staff at your
      next visit. Your study doctor or staff will give you more details, if needed.

      Around Days 15-21 of Cycle 1:

        -  Your medical history will be recorded, including any cancer symptoms.

        -  You will have a physical exam, including measurement of your weight and vital signs.

        -  You will be asked about any health problems you may have and any other drugs or herbal
           supplements you may be taking.

        -  Your performance status will be recorded.

        -  Blood (about 1 tablespoon) will be drawn for routine tests.

      Before starting Cycles 2 and beyond:

        -  Your medical history will be recorded, including any cancer symptoms.

        -  You will have a physical exam, including measurement of your weight and vital signs.

        -  You will be asked about any health problems you may have and any other drugs or herbal
           supplements you may be taking.

        -  Your performance status will be recorded.

        -  Blood (about 1 tablespoon) will be drawn for routine tests.

        -  If you are able to become pregnant, you will have a blood (about 1 teaspoon) or urine
           pregnancy test.

      Every other cycle (every 8 weeks):

        -  Blood (about 1 tablespoon) will be drawn to check your thyroid gland.

        -  You will have a skin exam by a skin doctor to check for any lesions that might have skin
           cancer.

        -  You will have an x-ray, CT scan, MRI, and/or PET/CT scan to check the status of the
           disease. Blood (about 1 tablespoon) will be drawn for tumor marker testing. After at
           least 6 months of taking the study drugs, you may have CT, MRI, and/or PET/CT scans and
           blood drawn every 3 cycles (every 12 weeks) if the study doctor thinks it is needed.

      If the study doctor has to change your dose of study drugs, blood (about 1 tablespoon) will
      be drawn to check for abnormal minerals.

      Anytime during the study if your study doctor thinks it is needed:

        -  You will have an ECG to check your heart function.

        -  Blood (about 1 tablespoon) will be collected for abnormal mineral and digestive enzyme
           testing.

        -  If you are taking the blood thinner warfarin, blood (about 1 teaspoon) will be drawn to
           test how well your blood clots.

      Length of Dosing:

      You may continue taking the study drugs for as long as the doctor thinks it is in your best
      interest. You will no longer be able to take the study drugs if the disease gets worse, if
      intolerable side effects occur, or if you are unable to follow study directions.

      Follow-up:

      You will have a follow-up-visit within 30 days after your last dose of study drugs. The
      following tests and procedures will be performed:

        -  You will be asked about any health problems you may have and if you have had any side
           effects.

        -  If the disease has gotten worse, blood (about 2-4 tablespoons) will be drawn for
           mutation/genetic testing.

        -  If the disease has gotten worse, urine will be collected for mutation/genetic testing.
           You may collect your first urine of the morning, anytime during the day, or you may
           collect urine for 24 hours.

      If your study doctor thinks it is needed, you may have follow-up for a longer period of time.

      You may have a skin exam within 6 months after your last dose of study drugs to check for any
      new lesions that may have skin cancer if the doctor thinks it is needed.
