      This pilot clinical trial studies early brief behavioral intervention in treating sleep
      disturbance and improving quality of life in patients undergoing bone marrow transplant
      (BMT). A brief behavioral intervention may reduce symptoms of insomnia and fatigue and
      improve quality of life and cognitive function in patients undergoing BMT

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To provide preliminary data on the feasibility and efficacy of brief behavioral treatment
      for insomnia (BBT-I) on insomnia in hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT) recipients.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To provide preliminary data on the influence of BBT-I on cancer-related fatigue (CRF) and
      cognitive status in BMT recipients.

      II. To provide preliminary data on the influence of BBT-I on quality-of-life (QOL) in BMT
      recipients.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients complete the BBT-I, comprising the following modules: 1) &quot;What to expect&quot; in terms
      of fatigue and insomnia as it occurs with cancer and cancer treatment; 2) A review of the
      Spielman Model of insomnia; 3) A discussion (based on the Spielman Model) regarding how
      insomnia and fatigue may co-occur and interact in the context of cancer and cancer treatment;
      4) An introduction to the concept and practice of Stimulus Control Therapy; 5) An
      introduction to Sleep Scheduling Specifically modified for cancer patients; 6) Sleep
      Compression; and 7) Concomitant Medications and Substance Use.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 1 month.
