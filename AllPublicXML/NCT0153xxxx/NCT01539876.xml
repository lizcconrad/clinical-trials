    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the fine needle aspiration methodology in collecting
      sufficient tumour cells to measure tissue TNFa levels serially in human breast cancer sample
      receiving Taxane treatment

    <textblock>
      This pilot study will begin to test the clinical relevance of the TNFa pathway in docetaxel
      response in breast cancer patients receiving Taxane chemotherapy.

      - Assess whether docetaxel can induce TNFa expression in breast cancer patients being treated
      with docetaxel
