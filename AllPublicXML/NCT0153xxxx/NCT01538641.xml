      Study Proposal:

      Other drugs where synergy with Gemcitabine has been observed are Cisplatinum, Taxol,
      Taxotere, Etoposide and alkylating agents. However in view of Oxaliplatin's superior activity
      as a single agent against lymphoma, the combination of Gemcitabine with Oxaliplatin is more
      attractive and should be explored in this group of disorders. Based on these data and
      considering the advantage of its favorable toxicity profile, we propose a phase II study in
      patients with either refractory or relapsing aggressive non-Hodgkin's lymphomas including
      peripheral T-cell lymphomas which are known to have a poor outcome when compared with
      equivalent aggressive B-cell lymphomas.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with refractory or relapsed aggressive non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma. The definition
             of refractory includes patients who either did not respond to prior therapy or those
             whose best response was a PR after at least 4 courses of chemotherapy. Aggressive
             histologies include follicular large cell, diffuse large cell, peripheral T cell,
             transformed lymphomas, Lymphoblastic lymphomas, Burkitt and Burkitt like lymphomas.

          -  Histologic or cytological confirmation of refractory or relapsed aggressive
             non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma is desirable but not mandatory and will be left to the
             discretion of the investigator.

          -  Must have measurable or evaluable disease.

          -  No more than 4 previous regimens of chemotherapy will be allowed, including stem cell
             or bone marrow transplant.

          -  Patients must be more than 18 years old.

          -  No evidence of grade 3 or more neurosensory or neuromotor dysfunction (see appendix-
             toxicity criteria)

          -  Written Consent

          -  Those patients who have previously received a platinum or nucleoside
             analogue-containing regimen are eligible.

          -  Patients who are candidates for stem cell or marrow transplant will be included

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with a previous or concurrent history of cancer with the exception of:
             1-treated carcinoma in situ of cervix or breast. 2- treated squamous or basal cell
             skin cancer, or 3- any other surgically cured malignancy from which the patient has
             been disease free for at least 5 years.

          -  HIV positive patients and those with Hepatitis B or C will be excluded from this
             protocol.

          -  Patients with severe neuropathy will be excluded.

          -  Chemotherapy or Radiotherapy within the previous 3 weeks prior to entering study.
