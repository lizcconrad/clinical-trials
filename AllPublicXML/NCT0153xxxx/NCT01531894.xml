  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      GSK2110183 is an orally administered, pan-AKT kinase inhibitor that has demonstrated
      nonclinical activity in hematologic as well as solid tumor cell lines and xenograft models.
      In the First Time In Human (FTIH) trial, monotherapy with GSK2110183 dosed orally, once daily
      has shown encouraging activity in subjects with hematologic malignancies. This multicenter,
      non-randomized, open-label, treatment continuation or 'rollover' study is designed to provide
      continued access to eligible subjects who have previously participated in a GSK2110183 study
      (parent study) sponsored by GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) or another research organization working on
      behalf of GSK. Eligible subjects must be receiving clinical benefit from continued treatment
      and have an acceptable safety profile with GSK2110183. Subjects who have participated in a
      GSK2110183 combination study with an approved anti-cancer agent will also be eligible to
      enroll in this rollover study. Subjects who participated in combination studies with two
      investigational compounds (one being GSK2110183) will not be eligible for this rollover
      study. Subjects will be enrolled by cohort based on the duration and treatment received while
      in their parent study. Safety assessments (physical examinations, vital sign measurements,
      12-lead electrocardiograms, echocardiograms or multiple-gated acquisition scans, clinical
      laboratory assessments and monitoring of adverse events) will be evaluated during this study.
      Disease assessment will be performed using local standard of care imaging practices and
      criteria appropriate for disease type and location.
