  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to explore the effect of an inflammatory and a psychosocial
      stressor and the combination thereof on mood in healthy young and elderly participants and
      patients with Major Depressive Disorder (MDD).
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a 2-way crossover (method used to switch patients from one treatment arm to another
      in a clinical study), randomized (the study medication is assigned by chance),
      placebo-controlled (an inactive substance that is compared with a study medication to test
      whether the medication has a real effect in a clinical study) study in 3 cohorts (group of
      individuals with similar characteristics) ie, 18 healthy young female participants; 18
      healthy elderly female participants; 18 female patients with a past history of MDD.
      Participants will be randomized to 1 of 6 possible treatment groups: Group 1: Treatment AB,
      Group 2: Treatment BA, Group 3: Treatment AC, Group 4: Treatment CA, Group 5: Treatment AD,
      Group 6: Treatment DA, where Treatment A is placebo vaccination, Treatment B is typhoid
      vaccination, Treatment C is psychosocial stress (Trier Social Stress Test [TSST]) followed by
      placebo vaccination, and Treatment D is psychosocial stress (TSST) followed by typhoid
      vaccination. Participants from each of the 3 cohorts will be randomized to these 6 treatment
      groups. In all the 6 groups the 1st treatment comes under Period 1 and 2nd treatment under
      Period 2 (eg, In Group 1: Treatment A [Period 1] and Treatment B [Period 2]) and there will
      be a minimally 7- and maximally 14- day washout period (period when no treatment is received)
      between the study periods. The study will consist of an eligibility screening examination
      (from 21 to 2 days prior to Day 1 of Period 1); a run-in visit (only prior to Period 1) in
      which eligible participants will be briefly explained about the cognitive test battery and
      immediately thereafter the baseline of cognitive function will be measured via these tests; 2
      single-blind (a clinical study in which the person giving the treatment, but not the patient,
      knows which treatment the patient is receiving) treatment periods (2-way crossover); and a
      follow-up examination by phone (approximately 7 to 14 days after last treatment [Period 2]).
      For each participant, the maximal study duration will not exceed 8 weeks.
