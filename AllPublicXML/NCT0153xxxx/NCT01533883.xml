      Cardioband is an adjustable annuloplasty band designed for mitral valve repair by a
      transfemoral delivery system. The aim of this study is to evaluate the performance and safety
      of the Cardioband for repair of mitral regurgitation.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The current state of the art management of severe mitral regurgitation is surgical mitral
      valve repair, either with open chest surgery or mini-thoracotomy. However, standard surgical
      approaches requiring cardiopulmonary bypass are reserved to fit patients with low or moderate
      surgical risk, and thus several patients are refused surgery because of unfavorable
      risk-benefit balance. Cardioband is an adjustable annuloplasty band designed for mitral valve
      repair by a transfemoral delivery system. Cardioband is intended to remodel the annulus by
      deployment and fixation along (and direct) the posterior annulus of the mitral valve, in
      order to correct mitral regurgitation. Adjustment can be performed on a beating heart, to
      optimize correction of mitral regurgitation.
