      The purpose of this study is to verify the efficacy of an 8-week course of manualized Swedish
      massage for reducing pain and increasing function compared to light-touch bodywork, and usual
      care, in 222 adults with OA of the knee.

    <measure>Change in Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis of the Knee and Hip Index (WOMAC)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 8, 16, 24, 36 and 52 weeks (Baseline, 8, 16, 24, 32, 40 and 48 for Usual Care group)</time_frame>
    <description>The Index is self-administered and assesses the three dimensions of pain, disability and joint stiffness in knee and hip osteoarthritis through 24 questions. WOMAC 3.1 is available in 65 languages using either a five-point Likert scale or a 100 mm visual analog scale. The WOMAC has been subject to numerous validation studies to assess reliability and responsiveness to change in therapy, including physical forms of therapy</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Pain: The Visual Analog Scale (VAS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 8, 16, 24, 36 and 52 weeks (Baseline, 8, 16, 24, 32, 40 and 48 for Usual Care group)</time_frame>
    <description>Used to measure pain sensation intensity evoked by nociceptive stimuli. Subjects quickly and easily rate stimuli within the series by indicating level of pain on a 100 mm scale. Pain intensity is represented by the participant drawing a line on the scale indicative of pain experienced (0 = no pain, to 100 = worse pain imaginable). The VAS is anchored at the left by &quot;no pain sensation&quot; and at the right by &quot;the most intense pain sensation imaginable.&quot;</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Pain: PROMIS Pain Interference Questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 8, 16, 24, 36 and 52 weeks (Baseline, 8, 16, 24, 32, 40 and 48 for Usual Care group)</time_frame>
    <description>Patient Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS), funded by the National Institutes of Health (NIH), is a system of highly reliable, valid, flexible, precise, and responsive assessment tools that measure patient-reported health status. The Pain Interference Questionnaire has 6 questions answered on an ordinal scale of five gradations.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Joint Flexibility</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 8, 16, 24, 36 and 52 weeks (Baseline, 8, 16, 24, 32, 40 and 48 for Usual Care group)</time_frame>
    <description>Joint flexibility is defined as the range of motion (ROM) allowed at the knee. The knee's ROM is measured by the number of degrees from the starting position of a segment to its position at the end of its full range of the movement. This is measured using a double-armed goniometer. A stationary arm holding a protractor is placed parallel with a stationary body segment and a movable arm moves along a moveable body segment. The pin (axis of goniometer) is placed over the joint.</description>
