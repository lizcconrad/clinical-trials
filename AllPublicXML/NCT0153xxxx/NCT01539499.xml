  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to help better determine the complication rates for endocrine
      surgery across the nation for both benign and malignant disease. It is our hypothesis that
      the complication rates are low overall and that malignant disease results in a higher
      complication rate than benign disease. This study will do a database review from all
      University HealthSystem Consortium (UHC).
