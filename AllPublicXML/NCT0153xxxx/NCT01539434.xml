    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate to what extent patients with COPD, who have
      participated in physical training for 12 weeks, can maintain their physical activity
      behaviour and physical capacity on a long-term basis if they get a behavioural medicine
      intervention.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) is a progressive disease and the number of
      patients is increasing. Persons with COPD have a low physical capacity and a low physical
      activity level. The risk of premature morbidity and mortality is high especially in persons
      with a low level of physical capacity and activity. Rehabilitation including physical
      training is recommended and results in decreased morbidity and mortality and increased
      physical capacity and quality of life. Unfortunately improvements decrease if patients do not
      maintain their physical activity level.

      To change physical activity behaviour in is challenging. Different methods as Social
      Cognitive Theory, SCT and the Transtheoretical model, TTM have been suggested as theoretical
      framework. According to SCT, to improve physical activity behaviour you should use
      goal-setting, outcome expectancy, self-efficacy, and self-monitoring.

      To use motivational interviewing (MI) improves the success of a behaviour change.

      Patients will be randomized after the 12-week training period, tested, and thereafter both
      the intervention group and the control group will get information about the importance of
      physical activity and the recommendations.

      Thereafter patients in the intervention group will receive weekly telephone calls for the
      first month, telephone calls every second week for the following two months and thereafter
      monthly telephone calls for the following three months. The telephone calls will be in
      accordance with MI and discuss goal-setting, out-come expectancy, and self-monitoring.

      Patients will be tested after 6,12,and 24 months.
