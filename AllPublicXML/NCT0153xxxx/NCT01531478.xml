  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Childhood cancers are rare, and today 75% of patients survive them. An estimated one out of
      850 French persons has survived childhood cancer. However, the complications of chemotherapy,
      radiotherapy or surgery can lead to a higher risk of secondary mortality, which the
      literature estimates is at 14%. Regular care has a positive impact on the quality of life and
      health of adults who survived cancer during their childhoods. It aims to detect the potential
      long-lasting effects of cancer and to provide therapeutic education and psychological care.
      Thanks to cancer registries, several countries (USA, Canada, UK, Germany, the Netherlands)
      have developed long-term care structures which function with specially trained adult medicine
      practitioners. There are only two structures in France: the Long-Term Oncology/Hematology
      Follow-Up Clinic, headed by Dr François Pein, in Nantes (France), and the LEA program for the
      follow-up of children treated for leukemia in the PACA-Corse and Lorraine regions of France,
      which began in 2003 and has since been extended to other centers.

      The Rhône-Alpes and Auvergne regions have had childhood cancer registries since 1987; they
      compile about 200 new cases a year. The Rhône-Alpes registry has conducted a preliminary
      trial on children (0-15 years old) diagnosed with cancer between 1987 and 1992. They analyzed
      the correlation between patients' quality of life and the long-term medical effect of cancer
      and treatment, both recorded in patients' medical files and declared by patients. These young
      adults who survived pediatric cancer appear to suffer from and declare many complications,
      although this does not impact their global quality of life much. There is a negative
      correlation between the number of complications (observed or declared) and the global quality
      of life score, but only three types of complications play a significant role (motor function
      complications, auditory complications, and alopecia.) In addition, there is a significant
      mismatch between patients's perceived health (what they say they experience), and the
      information contained in their medical files. These young adults expressed the need for their
      impressions to be better taken into account by health care professionals. This study does not
      assess patients' psychopathological characteristics.

      Results will help identify long-term complications, respond to patients' expectations, and
      evaluate the feasibility of conducting such a follow-up in all patients. They should guide
      the choice of the most appropriate tools for care, help assess needs in terms of
      collaboration with adult care staff, and identify potential partners.

    <description>The visit will be with an oncologist specialized in the long-term follow-up of cured pediatric cancer patients. The examination will consist in weight and height measurements, a clinical examination and a measurement of arterial pressure. The list of drugs taken in the last two years, as well as all health issues encountered since the cancer treatment, will be collected. Success in education, career and, family status will also be discussed.
After the medical examination, patients will be offered a visit with a psychologist in order to assess their psychopathological outcomes. This questionnaire is a interquestionnaire designed to screen axis I psychopathological conditions. It includes an evaluation of all types of risk-taking behavior (alcohol, drugs, anorexia and bulimia).</description>
