  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to test whether adding chemotherapy/cabazitaxel and
      hormonal/androgen deprivation therapy before surgical removal of your prostate would improve
      the outcome of salvage surgery for locally recurrent prostate cancer after the initial
      primary radiation therapy.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In this study, all participants will receive cabazitaxel chemotherapy, which is approved as a
      second line chemotherapy for treating metastatic prostate cancer. Standard hormone or
      androgen ablation therapy will also be used as part of the chemohormonal therapy prior to the
      surgery.

    <measure>Surgical Margin Negative Rate (SM Rate)</measure>
    <time_frame>One Year</time_frame>
    <description>Post surgery percentage of participants with negative surgical margin. To determine the surgical margin negative rate in patients who have undergone chemohormonal therapy followed by surgery for biopsy proven androgen-dependent high risk locally recurrent prostate cancer following primary radiation therapy. Margin: The edge or border of the tissue removed in cancer surgery. The margin is described as negative or clean when the pathologist finds no cancer cells at the edge of the tissue, suggesting that all of the cancer has been removed. The margin is described as positive or involved when the pathologist finds cancer cells at the edge of the tissue, suggesting that all of the cancer has not been removed.</description>

Patients with a detectable metastatic diseases will be removed from the study. Salvage surgery will be performed within 8 weeks after the completion of Cabazitaxel chemotherapy. For patients who achieved undetectable PSA following surgery, androgen deprivation therapy will be discontinued.</description>

A cycle of combination therapy will be defined as 3 weeks. A total of 4 cycles of combination therapy are planned before surgery for a total duration of 12 weeks.
Cabazitaxel will be administered before surgery by one-hourly infusions via central or peripheral intravenous access at a dose of 25 mg/m^2 as a one hour intravenous infusion in combination with oral prednisone 10 mg administered daily throughout Cabazitaxel treatment. It is advised that all patients receiving Cabazitaxel have a reliable form of venous access, e.g., central venous catheter to ensure their ability to receive therapy without undue delay.</description>

        <description>Post surgery percentage of participants with negative surgical margin. To determine the surgical margin negative rate in patients who have undergone chemohormonal therapy followed by surgery for biopsy proven androgen-dependent high risk locally recurrent prostate cancer following primary radiation therapy. Margin: The edge or border of the tissue removed in cancer surgery. The margin is described as negative or clean when the pathologist finds no cancer cells at the edge of the tissue, suggesting that all of the cancer has been removed. The margin is described as positive or involved when the pathologist finds cancer cells at the edge of the tissue, suggesting that all of the cancer has not been removed.</description>
