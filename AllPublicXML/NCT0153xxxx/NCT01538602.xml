  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS)is closely associated with insulin resistance and
      hyperinsulinemia as well as with increased incidence in diabetes, hypertension, dyslipidemia
      and atherosclerosis. Indeed, subjects with PCOS were reported to carry an increased long-term
      cardiovascular risk, among others. Aiming to correlate the mean platelet volume, the
      thromboxane A2 level and the PCOS, an observational study was planned. Clinical evaluation of
      metabolic outcomes in PCOS patients is compared to a placebo group.
