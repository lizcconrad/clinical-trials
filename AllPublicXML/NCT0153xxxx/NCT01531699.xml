  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, randomized, single-dose, placebo-controlled efficacy study to assess
      the antimicrobial efficacy of ALT005 ophthalmic prep solution following dermal administration
      in healthy volunteers. Efficacy will be assessed by comparing the reduction in microbial load
      for up to 6 hours to that of saline control.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A total of 45 subjects who meet the criteria for inclusion will receive either ALT005 or
      control solution (sterile 0.9% saline) on one occasion to sites on the forehead and the
      cheeks. Subjects will be randomized in a ratio of 2:1 active:control. Subjects will be dosed
      in groups.

      The study will run at one study center in the US. Subjects will be housed in the clinical
      research facility from the morning of Day -4 until the evening of Day 1. The total duration
      of participation for each subject dosed is approximately 21 days (from Day -19 study
      orientation through the follow-up call on Day 2, excluding the initial screening period).

      In this study, the efficacy of ALT005 will be assessed in healthy volunteers who, after
      refraining voluntarily from using topical and oral antimicrobials for at least 2 weeks (14
      days), exhibit acceptably high normal flora counts on the designated skin testing sites.

      An additional cohort was added (3 ALT005, 6 Comparator Product) to make a non-statistical
      comparison of efficacy.
