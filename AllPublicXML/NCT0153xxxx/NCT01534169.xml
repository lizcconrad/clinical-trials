  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Antithyroid drugs is the first choice treatment of Graves' disease in China and Europe.
      However,the relapse rate is very high (40-60%) after therapy withdrawal, and many patients
      need further treatment. In our previous study, a new treatment strategy for GD has been
      introduced. After methimazole (18 months) combined with intrathyroid injection of
      dexamethasone (DEX) (3 months) treatment, the relapse rate of hyperthyroidism was markedly
      reduced compared with methimazole treatment alone (7.4% versus 51%) during the 2-year
      follow-up period. The results have been published in the 'J Clin Endocrinol Metab,
      2009,94:4984-4991'. However, the mechanism by which the DEX reduces the relapse rate of GD is
      not fully understood. In vitro study, we have proven that DEX could effectively improve the
      function of regulatory T (Treg) cells and set up a new balance of T helper 1(Th1)/Th2 in GD
      patients(this results have been in press in the Eur J Endocrinol). In order to elucidate
      mechanism of this treatment strategy in vivo, we plan to recruit 20-30 patients with GD and
      treat those patients by intrathyroid injection of DEX combined with methimazole, and the
      function of Treg cells and balance of Th1/Th2 will be evaluated.

    <description>The course of treatment will be last for 3 months. The intrathyroid injection of dexamethasone will be performed using a 25-gauge (0.25-mm) needle under ultrasound guidance. The injection will be performed in both lobes of the thyroid. The dosage of dexamethasone is 5mg (1.0 ml) in each lobe, twice a week during the first month of the treatment. The treatment strategy will be changed to once a week in the second month and twice a month in the third month; the dosage of dexamethasone is the same as in the first month.</description>
