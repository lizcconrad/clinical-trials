  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is to investigate the optimal clinical dose and administration methods of YH4808
      in patients with reflux esophagitis by evaluating the safety and efficacy after YH4808 oral
      administration.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In the result of recent meta-analysis, there was no improvement in symptoms with the first
      administration of PPI in about 75% of GERD patients, and symptoms were still sustained in
      about 50% of patients after administration of more than 3 days. Especially the nocturnal
      secretion of gastric acid was not effectively inhibited, and about 25% of GERD patients could
      not achieve the proper therapeutic effects even after PPI treatment twice daily for 4-8
      weeks.

      YH4808, as a selective K+- competitive acid blocker (P-CAB), is no need for activation by
      gastric acid since it competitively inhibits proton pump with K+. Thus, the inhibition of
      gastric acid secretion by YH4808 is prompt and effective. In addition, the inhibitive effect
      of gastric acid secretion by stimulation of histamine is proved to be more powerful than PPI
      (esomeprazole) and sustained in in-vitro/in-vivo model, and 24-h inhibition of gastric acid
      secretion and especially nocturnal inhibition of gastric acid secretion was observed to be
      superior to esomeprazole with repeat doses for 7 days in healthy volunteers.

      Based on these nonclinical and clinical outcomes, an exploratory phase-II clinical trial is
      to be conducted to determine the proper treatment dose and administration method of YH48084
      for GERD patients.
