  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The common cold is a major cause of nasal obstruction and reaches children and adults twice
      or more times a year. At the moment, there is no cure for the common cold, and therefore the
      reduction of symptoms is the focus of treatment.

      The study was designed to parallel distribution, with two equal groups, with one group will
      receive treatment with a combination of naphazoline hydrocloride + pheniramine maleate +
      panthenol and the other will receive treatment with naphazoline hydrocloride.

    <measure>Efficacy of treatment in nasal congestion reduction based on Peak Flow Nasal Inspiratory (PFNI) assay</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 5</time_frame>
    <description>The individual response rate to the nasal congestion reduction is calculated by measuring the peak flow nasal inspiratory (PFNI) during the first and last visit.
The response rate is calculated using the following formula:
Response rate = (PFNIvi - PFNIvf) / PFNIvi
Considering:
PFNIvi: PFNI in the first visit;
PFNIvf: PFNI at the last visit;</description>
