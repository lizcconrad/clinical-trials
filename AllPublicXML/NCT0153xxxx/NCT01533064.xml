      Objective: Reports have described how hospitalized psychiatric patients respond to disasters;
      however, few reports have described the response to disaster among psychiatric outpatients,
      who have relatively mild disease in comparison with hospitalized, severely ill psychiatric
      patients. Here the investigators have analyzed the response to disaster among this
      under-studied population.

      Method: The Great East Japan Earthquake on March 11, 2011, was a catastrophic disaster. The
      investigators studied psychiatric change among a population of psychiatric outpatients in
      Tochigi prefecture, located ~160 km (~100 miles) southeast of the Fukushima nuclear power
      plant, in an area that suffered moderate damage from the earthquake. A total of 328
      psychiatric outpatients were enrolled and were grouped into the diagnostic categories F2
      (schizophrenic, schizotypal, and delusional disorders), F3 (affective disorders), and F4
      (neurotic, stress-related, and somatoform disorders). All diagnoses were made using
      International Classification of Diseases (ICD) 10 criteria. Changes in symptoms were measured
      as a change in psychotropic medication after the disaster.

      Patient progress was determined by whether a change in medication was needed. We focused on
      psychotropic drug use, including the use of neuroleptics, antidepressants, and
      benzodiazepines, directly after the disaster on March 11, 2011. Changes in other psychotropic
      drugs that are prescribed less frequently, such as lithium or anticonvulsants, were not
      considered in this study. Changes in symptoms that did not require a need to change
      psychotropic medications were not considered as part of a patient's progress. Physicians
      rated the relationship between each change in psychotropic drug and the disaster as direct,
      indirect, or not relevant. Only when three physicians rated the relationship as direct did we
      consider the change in a patient's progress to be due to the earthquake. Worsening or
      improvement of symptoms was defined as a change in psychotropic medications as a result of
      the deterioration or improvement, respectively, of symptoms. The data were stratified by
      disease category and sex and analyzed using chi-square tests.
