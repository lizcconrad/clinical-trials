        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  A signed and dated informed consent form before any study-specific screening procedure
             was performed,

          -  Healthy male or female 18 to 55 years of age. Women had to be postmenopausal (more
             than 12 months since last period); surgically sterile (hysterectomy or tubal ligation
             or bilateral oophorectomy at least 6 months prior to enrollment); using an
             intrauterine device; a non-hormonal double barrier contraceptive method (i.e.,
             diaphragm or spermicide plus male condom) for the duration of the trial and with a
             negative pregnancy test at screening and upon each check-in to the study facility,

          -  Had a BMI within the range of 18-30 kg/m2,

          -  Able to communicate effectively with the study personnel,

          -  Had no significant disease or abnormal laboratory values as determined by medical
             history, physical examination or laboratory evaluations, conducted at the screening
             visit and on admission to the clinic,

          -  Had a normal 12-lead electrocardiogram, without any clinically significant
             abnormalities of rate, rhythm or conduction,

          -  Non-smokers or ex-smokers for at least 3 months,

          -  Adequately informed of the nature and risks of the study and gave written informed
             consent prior to study entry.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Known hypersensitivity or allergy to moxifloxacin, BIA 9-1067 or related compounds
             such as tolcapone or entacapone,

          -  Women who were pregnant or breastfeeding,

          -  Any disease or condition (medical or surgical) which, in the opinion of the
             Investigator, might have compromised the hematologic, cardiovascular, pulmonary,
             renal, gastrointestinal, hepatic, or central nervous system; or other conditions that
             might have interfered with the absorption, distribution, metabolism or excretion of
             study drug, or would have placed the subject at increased risk,

          -  A sustained supine systolic blood pressure &gt; 140 mmHg or &lt; 100 mmHg or a diastolic
             blood pressure &gt; 95 mmHg at screening or baseline,

          -  A resting ECG heart rate of &lt; 50 bpm or &gt; 100 bpm,

          -  An abnormal screening ECG indicating a second- or third-degree AV block, or one or
             more of the following: QRS &gt; 110 milliseconds (ms), QTc (Fridericia correction) &gt; 450
             ms for male and 470 ms for females, PR interval &gt; 240 ms. Any rhythm other than sinus
             rhythm, which was interpreted by the Investigator to be clinically significant,

          -  The presence of abnormal laboratory values which were considered clinically
             significant by the Investigator,

          -  Positive screen for Hepatitis B (HbsAg, Hepatitis B Surface Antigen), Hepatitis C
             (anti HCV, Hepatitis C Antibody), or HIV (anti-HIV 1/2),

             study,

          -  Received any drug therapy, excluding hormonal contraceptives, within 2 weeks prior to
             administration of the first dose of any study-related treatment. This exclusion was
             extended to 4 weeks for any drugs known to induce or inhibit hepatic drug metabolism,

          -  Consumption of alcohol within 48 hours prior to dose administration or during any
             inpatient period,

          -  A positive urine drug screen including or a positive alcohol breath test,

          -  Any history of alcohol abuse, illicit drug use, significant mental illness, physical
