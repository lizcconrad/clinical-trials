  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      If etiologies of temporomandibular disorders (TMD) are various, parafunctions become more and
      more important. Treatment of patients presenting TMD is based on conservative and reversible
      therapeutics. The behavioural reeducation of these patients which aims at decreasing their
      parafunctions is a treatment often performed.
