  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to show solid evidences of the efficacy of DHEA in improving the
      success rates of in-vitro fertilization (IVF) patients facing poor ovarian reserve.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Poor responders to IVF treatment occurs in 5-24% of in-vitro fertilisation (IVF) cycles,
      resulting in the cancellation of the cycle translating in very low pregnancy rate. Current
      interventions based upon the use of different stimulation regimen do not address the
      fundamental underlying physiological basis of follicular recruitment and development.

      The over-riding objective of this proposal is to devise novel therapeutic approaches to the
      treatment of poor responders of IVF treatment through dietary supplementation with
      Dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA). The investigators hypothesise that DHEA supplementation leads
      to improvements in ovarian steroidogenesis in poor responders, leading to improved IVF
      outcome. Specifically, the investigators aim to

        1. Conduct a prospective randomised controlled trial (RCT) on the effects of DHEA
           supplementation in women who are poor responders to IVF treatment.

        2. Investigate the effects of DHEA supplementation on ovarian steroidogenesis and
           biochemical and ultrasonographic markers of ovarian reserves.
