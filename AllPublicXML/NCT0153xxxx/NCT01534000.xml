      Objectives The CATCH trial (CArdiac cT in the treatment of acute CHest pain) is a prospective
      randomized controlled trial designed to evaluate the clinical value of cardiac multidetector
      computed tomography (MDCT) as a first-line diagnostic strategy in patients with acute chest
      pain, compared to a conventional functional-based testing strategy.

      Methods:

      Consecutive patients admitted with acute chest pain of suspected cardiac origin, but normal
      electrocardiogram and biomarkers were randomized to evaluation with 320-MDCT coronary
      angiography (CT-guided group) or with standard bicycle exercise test and/or myocardial
      perfusion imaging - MPI (Control group).

      After one year, patients will be followed-up, with registration of clinical endpoints such as
      Cardiac death, myocardial infarction, need for revascularisation, admittance for heart
      related problems, sustained chest pain, live quality score, use of medication.
