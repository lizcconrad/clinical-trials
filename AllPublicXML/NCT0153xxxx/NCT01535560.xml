    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study was to demonstrate superiority of AL-60371 relative to Vehicle
      based on clinical cures at test-of-cure (TOC) for the treatment of acute otitis externa
      (AOE).

    <measure>Proportion of Patients With Clinical Cures at the Day 11 (TOC) Visit</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 11</time_frame>
    <description>An otoscopic exam was conducted by the physician. Clinical cure was considered attained if the sum of the numerical scores of the 3 signs and symptoms of AOE (tenderness, erythema, and edema) was 0 at Day 11. Proportion of patients is reported as percentage of participants.</description>

    <measure>Proportion of Patients With Microbiological Successes at the Day 11 (TOC) Visit</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 11</time_frame>
    <description>Microbiological success was considered attained if all pre-therapy bacteria were absent from the exit otic specimen. The presence of fungi and/or yeast was not considered in the determination of microbiological success. Proportion of patients is reported as a percentage of participants.</description>

             presumed bacterial origin in at least one ear.

          -  Combined numerical score of â‰¥4 in at least one affected ear at the Day 1 exam for
             tenderness, erythema, and edema.
