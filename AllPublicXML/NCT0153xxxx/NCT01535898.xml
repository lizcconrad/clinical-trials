  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a diagnostic study that makes pictures of organs of the
      body using magnetic field and radio frequency pulses that can not be felt. The purpose of
      this study is to determine if a new MR imaging method can help tumor evaluation in head and
      neck cancer or prostate cancer. The extra images will be obtained using Diffusion-weighted
      Magnetic Resonance Imaging which provides image contrast through detection of small
      restrictions in the movement of water molecules. This study may help us provide additional
      information about the tumor along with the picture of the organ.

    <description>The intervention for the patients is the additional 10 minutes in the MRI scanner with sequence. The intervention for the volunteers is the scan, which will take a total of 30 minutes. The volunteers will have two more additional studies at 1-2 week intervals. Both the patients and volunteers will also need to fill out a questionnaire.</description>
