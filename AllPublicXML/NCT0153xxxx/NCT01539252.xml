  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the effectiveness of using two dialysers to lower
      the blood mineral levels in people receiving hemodialysis as compared to using one dialyser
      (usual treatment).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Higher levels of serum phosphate are independently associated with an increased risk of death
      in hemodialysis patients. Therefore, there has been considerable interest in controlling
      serum phosphate while minimizing oral calcium load. While most attention has focused on the
      use of non-calcium containing phosphate binders such as sevelamer and lanthanum, modifying
      conventional dialysis regimens to improve phosphate clearance is an alternative approach that
      remains relatively unstudied. A secondary analysis of a previous randomized cross-over study
      from our group found that the use of two dialysers in parallel resulted in a reduction in
      pre-dialysis serum phosphate levels. As this study was small, and the mechanisms resulting in
      the reduction in phosphate levels were unclear, further study is warranted. The investigators
      will conduct a randomized cross-over study comparing the impact of dialyzing using two
      dialysers in parallel with a single dialyser in hyperphosphatemic hemodialysis patients.

      There will be a total of 34 participants from Alberta,Canada participating in this study. The
      length of study participation is 10 weeks.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Age &gt; 18 years

          -  Patients must be on a stable regimen of hemodialysis for ≥ 3 months ('stable' defined
             as not expected to require a change to the duration or frequency of treatments)

          -  Serum phosphate &gt; 1.6 mmol/l on last two consecutive lab tests at least 3 weeks apart
             (KDOQI guidelines recommend maintaining predialysis phosphate &lt; 1.8mmol/l - as such,
             phosphate lowering in this subgroup of patients is particularly relevant)

          -  Patients must be on stable doses of a phosphate binder with no changes in dose 1 month
             prior to study enrolment.

          -  Blood flow rate ≥ 350 ml/min through a well-functioning access (This will exclude
             patients receiving inadequate dialysis due to a temporary venous dialysis catheter and
             will ensure sufficient blood flow to permit dialysis using two dialysers in parallel.)

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients who have a scheduled renal transplant, change in dialysis modality, surgery
             or hospitalization or plan on moving away from the study site in the next three
             months.

          -  Patients with a projected life expectancy of less than 3 months.

          -  Patients with a contraindication to intra-dialytic anticoagulation. (Some patients
             require a small increase in the amount of anticoagulation required to prevent dialyser
             clotting when using two dialysers in parallel).

          -  Patients who have missed &gt;8 dialysis treatments in the past 3 months.

          -  Patients with a dialysis regimen of &gt;3 runs per week.

          -  Failure to provide informed consent.

          -  Patients enrolled in another (interventional) trial
