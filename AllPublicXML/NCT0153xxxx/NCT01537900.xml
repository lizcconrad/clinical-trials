    <textblock>
      The goal of this study was to compare hepatic pharmacokinetics (PK) derived from liver tissue
      to plasma PK after administration of grazoprevir (MK-5172) to participants with chronic
      hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. Participants will be randomized to one of four different
      liver ultrasound-guided Fine Needle Aspirate (FNA) schedules (at 4-, 8-, 24-, or 72-hours
      after the Day 7 dose).

    <measure>Estimated Area Under the Liver Concentration-time Curve for 24 Hours Post-dose (AUC[H]0-24hr) of Grazoprevir</measure>
    <time_frame>4, 8, and 24 hours post-dose on Day 7</time_frame>
    <description>Each participant was assigned to undergo Fine Needle Aspiration (FNA) to obtain liver tissue at different time points. Specifically, one participant underwent FNA at 4 hr post-dose only, another participant underwent FNA at 8 hr post-dose only, and a third participant underwent FNA at 24 hr post-dose only. (The fourth participant underwent FNA at 72 hr post-dose and therefore was not included in the calculation of AUC0-24hr.) Therefore, in calculating AUC0-24hr, there were only 3 data points: 1 data point at 4 hr post-dose, 1 data point at 8 hr post-dose, and 1 data point at 24 hr post-dose. The model assumed that drug concentration was at steady-state, and that the concentration at 24 hr post-dose was equal to the concentration at 0 hr post-dose.</description>

    <measure>Hepatic Concentration of GZR (C[H]Xhr)</measure>
    <time_frame>4, 8, 24, and 72 hours post-dose on Day 7</time_frame>
    <description>C(H)Xhr of GZR was expressed as liver concentration (μmol GZR/L liver) using the concentration of the extracted liver sample (mass of the liver biopsy/0.2 mL solvent), and assuming that liver has the specific gravity of water (1 g/mL). The arithmetic mean C(H)Xhr concentration is based on the means of 4 FNA passes per participant in all 4 participants.</description>

        <title>Hepatic Concentration of GZR (C[H]Xhr)</title>
        <description>C(H)Xhr of GZR was expressed as liver concentration (μmol GZR/L liver) using the concentration of the extracted liver sample (mass of the liver biopsy/0.2 mL solvent), and assuming that liver has the specific gravity of water (1 g/mL). The arithmetic mean C(H)Xhr concentration is based on the means of 4 FNA passes per participant in all 4 participants.</description>
        <time_frame>4, 8, 24, and 72 hours post-dose on Day 7</time_frame>
        <population>The PPP includes all participants who complied with the protocol sufficiently to ensure that the data were likely to exhibit the effects of treatment.</population>
