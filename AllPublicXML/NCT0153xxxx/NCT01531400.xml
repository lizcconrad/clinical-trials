        The inclusion criterion is:

          -  adult patient with working diagnosis of possible neurological disorder and

          -  is referred for both nerve conduction study and needle electromyography

        Exclusion Criteria:

        The exclusion criteria are:

          -  conscious disturbances,

          -  cognitive impairment, or
