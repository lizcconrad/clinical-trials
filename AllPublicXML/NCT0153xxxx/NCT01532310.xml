    <textblock>
      This global Belimumab Pregnancy Registry will collect prospective data on pregnancies and
      pregnancy outcomes on a voluntary basis in women with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) who
      have received commercially supplied belimumab within the 4 months prior to and/or during
      pregnancy. The registry will also evaluate outcomes of infants born to mothers who were
      exposed to belimumab within the 4 months prior to and/or during pregnancy. This registry will
      add to the current clinical experience with belimumab and will complement reproductive data
      from animal toxicology studies. It will also assist clinicians in weighing the potential
      risks against the benefits of treatment for individual patients with SLE. GlaxoSmithKline
      (GSK) will sponsor the Belimumab Pregnancy Registry in countries where it holds Marketing
      Authorization.
