    <textblock>
      This evaluation of the efficacy and safety of AXONA will be a chart review carried out at 16
      practices in which AXONA has been prescribed for the treatment of patients with
      mild-to-moderate AD. Efficacy of AXONA will be assessed by comparison of patient status
      before and after initiation of treatment.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective is to assess the efficacy of AXONA (medium chain triglycerides [MCTs])
      when used alone or in combination with other agents in patients with mild-to-moderate
      Alzheimer's disease (AD) in routine clinical practice.

        The study population will consist of patients with a diagnosis of mild-to-moderate AD who
        have been treated with AXONA for ≥ 6 months and whose medical record includes an evaluation
        within 3 months prior to initiation of treatment and at least one evaluation while
        receiving AXONA.

        Potential for intentional inclusion in the study will be determined on the basis of
        prescribing data and physicians will be contacted. For Neurology and Psychiatry practices
        agreeing to participate, all charts meeting the above criteria and for which
        patients/caregivers give consent will be included in the analysis.
