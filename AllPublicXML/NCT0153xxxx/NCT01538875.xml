  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hypertensive crisis (defined as a systolic pressure &gt; 160mmHg or a diastolic pressure &gt;
      110mmHg) in patients with a hypertensive disorder of pregnancy is a serious complication with
      severe and even deadly consequences. The management in this population had been studied, but
      no consensus has been reached with regards to which treatment is better. Our study will
      compare two drugs: Hydralazine and Labetalol for the management of hypertensive crisis.
