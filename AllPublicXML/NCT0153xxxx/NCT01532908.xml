  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess efficacy of a human monoclonal antibody against
      Hepatitis C (MBL-HCV1) combined with telaprevir [part 1: an HCV protease inhibitor] or
      sofosbuvir [part 2: an HCV NS5B polymerase inhibitor] in a 56 day treatment duration in
      patients undergoing liver transplantation due to chronic HCV infection. There is an option
      for extended study treatment through 84 days if viral load is undetectable at day 56.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patient â‰¥ 18 years of age with documented chronic hepatitis C virus infection of
             genotype 1 undergoing liver transplantation from either a deceased donor or living
             donor.

          -  Patient or legal guardian/health care proxy must have read, understood and provided
             written informed consent and HIPAA authorization after the nature of the study has
             been fully explained.

        Exclusion Criteria:

             local treatment

          -  Hepatocellular carcinoma with tumor burden outside of the Milan criteria

          -  Serum creatinine &gt; 2.5 for &gt; or = six months at the time of enrollment

          -  Personal or family history (first degree relative) of deep venous thrombosis or
             pulmonary embolism

             positive donor

          -  Receipt of liver allograft donated after cardiac death of donor

          -  Receipt of any antiviral agents (licensed or investigational) for hepatitis C virus
             within 30 days prior to liver transplantation, unless patient has documented
             detectable HCV RNA during this 30 day period

          -  Previous receipt of an HCV protease inhibitor (for subjects enrolling in Part 1:
             telaprevir)

          -  Receipt of any other investigational study product within 30 days prior to enrollment

          -  Seizure disorder requiring anti-convulsant therapy

             subjects enrolling in Part 1: telaprevir)

          -  Any other condition that in the opinion of the investigator would jeopardize the
             safety or rights of the patient participating in the study or make it unlikely that
             the patient could complete the study
