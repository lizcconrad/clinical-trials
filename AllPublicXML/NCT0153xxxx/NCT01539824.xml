  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the safety and effects of IMM 101 in combination
      with a single targeted dose of radiation in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer in
      whom chemotherapy or other treatment has not been effective. Administration of radiation
      (using the CyberKnife) to the target tumour growth in the liver results in the release of
      tumour material. IMM-101 may help the immune system to react to the tumour material released
      from the damaged tumour, and so have a beneficial effect in slowing down the rate of growth
      of other tumour growths in the liver and other organs.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Radiotherapy given in standard fractionation regimes leads to cell death by causing double
      stranded DNA breaks via production of oxygen free radicals. At the very high doses of
      stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) administered with extreme accuracy in a single fraction
      by the CyberKnife system, there is induction of tumour necrosis due to endothelial cell
      damage and vascular collapse, cell membrane breakdown, and the release of cellular material
      and tumour antigens into the circulation, in addition to DNA strand breaks. It is
      hypothesised that the combination of modulation of the body's immune responses in the
      presence of an increased exposure to tumour antigen will provide sufficient induction of the
      immune system to suppress tumour growth.

    <description>The treatment regimen with IMM-101 (Mycobacterium obuense) will be every 2 weeks for the first three doses with the last of these doses being on the same day as the radiotherapy by CyberKnife treatment on a liver lesion targeted by the Principal Investigator. Following a rest of 4 weeks, patients will again receive IMM-101 every 2 weeks for the next 3 doses followed by a further 4 weeks rest. Thereafter, IMM-101 will be given at 4 week intervals for up to 12 months or until patient withdrawal for any reason</description>

    <description>The CyberKnife system is normally used for the treatment of cancerous tumours in cases where the type and position of the tumour and the condition of the patient indicate that treatment may be curative. In this study, the CyberKnife is being used in an experimental way to deliver a targeted dose of stereotactic body radiation with extreme accuracy in order to damage a single tumour growth (metastasis) in the liver.</description>
