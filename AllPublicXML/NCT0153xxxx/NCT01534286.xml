      The purpose of this study will be to show the patient response to analgesics taken post
      surgery when taken in combination with Theramine as opposed to Theramine-like placebo. The
      data collected will be used to show that patients have a shorter and lower post operative
      pain measurement and the time to discontinuation of analgesics is less in the active
      comparator group.
