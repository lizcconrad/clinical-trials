  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) must manage not only the demands of dialysis
      and comorbid conditions but also associated symptoms and acute life-threatening events that
      contribute to functional limitations and increased risk of mortality. Yet little is known
      about the trajectories of quality of life dimensions in patients with ESKD when they
      experience acute life-threatening episodes, to guide palliative care for this population. In
      this prospective, descriptive study, we will identify trajectories of symptoms, physical
      functioning, psychosocial needs, and emotional and spiritual well-being in 200 patients with
      ESKD who are at a high risk of experiencing acute life-threatening events and mortality
      within 12 months.
