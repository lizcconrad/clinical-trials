      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of ONO-4053
      across ascending single and multiple doses in healthy adult male and female subjects.

      The secondary objective of the study is to characterize the pharmacokinetic profile of
      ONO-4053 in healthy adult male and female subjects.

      Ono Pharma UK Ltd is the European subsidiary of Ono Pharmaceutical Co. Ltd. As the European
      Legal Representative of Ono Pharmaceutical Co. Ltd, Ono Pharma UK Ltd is carrying out this
      study.

      This is a clinical study of ONO-4053 in healthy volunteers. This study consists of three
      parts. Part A will investigate the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics when single
      ascending doses of ONO-4053 are administered in a double-blind manner. Part B will
      investigate the pharmacokinetics of ONO-4053 in the fed and fasted state in an open-label
      manner. Part C will investigate the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics when multiple
      ascending doses of ONO-4053 are administered in a double-blind manner. Doses for Part B and C
      will be determined after data from Part A are available.
