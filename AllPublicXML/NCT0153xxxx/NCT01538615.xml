  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of the proposed project is to see if an innovative family-based intervention can
      reduce childhood obesity by actively engaging the whole family in promoting healthy behaviors
      in the home. In additions, the project will also examine how the HOME Plus family
      intervention influences children's dietary intake, frequency of family meals, availability of
      healthy and unhealthy foods in the home and served at meals and snacks, and screen time (TV,
      game systems). The study will provide important information on strategies that families can
      use at home to prevent obesity.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Childhood obesity is a serious public health problem with limited effective prevention
      strategies to date. Although previous nutrition and physical activity environmental
      approaches for obesity prevention show some promise, most studies have not shown reductions
      in excess weight gain. Moreover, few prevention studies significantly engage parents and
      focus on the home environment. To prevent childhood obesity it is essential to promote
      healthy behaviors in the home environment because parents are influential primary role models
      for healthy eating and sedentary behavior, and are gatekeepers for food and beverage
      availability and degree of inactivity within the home. Moreover, the home setting is where
      most of children's calories and energy dense foods are consumed and where children engage in
      much of their sedentary behavior, particularly screen time (e.g., television, computer, game
      system). The proposed study will test the efficacy of the Healthy Home Offerings via the
      Mealtime Environment (HOME) Plus program, a ten-month, family-based health promotion
      intervention to prevent excess weight gain among 8-12 year old children. The program is based
      on Social Cognitive Theory and a socio-ecological framework and promotes both regular and
      nutritionally-sound snacks and meals in which family members eat together (i.e., family
      meals) and encourages reductions in sedentary behavior, particularly screen time among
      children in the home setting. The efficacy of the intervention will be tested in a randomized
      controlled trial with 160 families randomized to two conditions (intervention or
      attention-only control). Two cohorts of families, recruited from after-school programs and
      community centers, will be followed for 2.5 years. The primary hypothesis is that, by the end
      of the ten month intervention, target children in the intervention families, relative to
      children in the control families, will have significantly lower body mass index (BMI; primary
      outcome) after adjustment for baseline BMI values. Secondary outcomes include frequency of
      weekly family meals and number of healthful foods and beverages available in the home and
      served at family meals and snacks (as reported by parent), target children's daily intakes of
      healthful foods and beverages, and target children's minutes of sedentary behavior per week,
      particularly screen time. Child and parent measurement will occur in their homes at baseline,
      post-intervention (12-months post-randomization), and follow-up (9-months post-intervention)
      by trained research staff. The proposed study builds upon successful methods from our HOME
      pilot study (2006-2008; NIH R21-DK0072997) and is innovative as it actively engages entire
      families in experiential activities and capitalizes on the home setting. The study will
      provide important information on environmental and behavioral strategies that families can
      use at home to prevent excess weight gain. The intervention program has high translation
      potential and is likely to be immediately useful to families of school-age children because
      it will be tested in real-world community settings and sustained across the state of
      Minnesota by the University of Minnesota's Extension Service.

    <description>The HOME Plus program families will participate in monthly, two-hour group sessions for ten months at local community centers. Each session offers new ideas focusing on family meals, healthy eating, and reducing sedentary behavior. At each session, families prepare and eat a meal together and participate in small group discussions and activities for both parent and child groups to promote healthy behaviors in the home. Topics include planning healthy meals and snacks with your family, having meals with your family more often, and improving the healthfulness of the food available at home. Families also receive periodic supportive phone calls throughout the year using motivational interviewing techniques to promote healthy behaviors to prevent and reduce childhood obesity.</description>

        <title>Change in Child Body Mass Index (BMI Z-score)</title>
        <description>Trained study staff will measure parent and child height and weight and use this to calculate body mass index (BMI). BMI values were than standardized for age and gender using CDC guidelines to obtain BMI z-scores. Analyses controlled for child age and parent education at baseline.</description>
        <time_frame>Change from Baseline at 12 and 21 months</time_frame>
        <population>Numbers reported are for the child in the parent/child dyad. At post-intervention (12 months after baseline), 74 intervention children and 75 control children were measured. At follow-up (21 months after baseline) 70 intervention children and 73 control children were measured.</population>

            <description>HOME Plus intervention: The HOME Plus program families will participate in monthly, two-hour group sessions for ten months at local community centers. Each session offers new ideas focusing on family meals, healthy eating, and reducing sedentary behavior. At each session, families prepare and eat a meal together and participate in small group discussions and activities for both parent and child groups to promote healthy behaviors in the home. Topics include planning healthy meals and snacks with your family, having meals with your family more often, and improving the healthfulness of the food available at home. Families also receive periodic supportive phone calls throughout the year using motivational interviewing techniques to promote healthy behaviors to prevent and reduce childhood obesity.</description>

          <title>HOME Plus Intervention</title>
          <description>HOME Plus intervention: The HOME Plus program families will participate in monthly, two-hour group sessions for ten months at local community centers. Each session offers new ideas focusing on family meals, healthy eating, and reducing sedentary behavior. At each session, families prepare and eat a meal together and participate in small group discussions and activities for both parent and child groups to promote healthy behaviors in the home. Topics include planning healthy meals and snacks with your family, having meals with your family more often, and improving the healthfulness of the food available at home. Families also receive periodic supportive phone calls throughout the year using motivational interviewing techniques to promote healthy behaviors to prevent and reduce childhood obesity.</description>
