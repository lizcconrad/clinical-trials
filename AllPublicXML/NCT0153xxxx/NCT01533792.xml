      Objective: The objective of this research was to compare the effect of a single session
      supragingival scaling in a group of pregnant women with periodontal disease with a group that
      received supra and subgingival scaling.

      Methods: The investigators included 34 pregnant women between 15 and 43 who had at least 4
      teeth with probing depth ≥ 4 mm or clinical attachment loss ≥ 3 mm, with bleeding on probing
      in the same place. Women were divided into two groups, the group 1 received supra and
      subgingival scaling associated with oral hygiene orientation (OHO) and the group 2 received
      only supragingival scaling with OHO too.

    <description>A single calibrated examiner performed clinical examination in pregnant women participating in the measurement of parameters: probing depth, clinical attachment level, hyperplasia, recession, bleeding, presence of plaque and tooth mobility on a standardized form.
Quantitative parameters were evaluated at six sites per tooth: mesio/medium/ distobuccal and mesio/medium/distolingual through millimeter periodontal probe-type Williams. The bleeding and the presence of plaque in dichotomous variables were measured: present and absent. All patients received oral hygiene orientation (OHO).</description>

    <time_frame>Assess periodontal disease at times: initial (when pregnancy arrived) and final (30 days after periodontal therapy).</time_frame>
    <description>The patients were randomly divided by lottery into two groups. The group 1, termed SUPRA/SUB received OHO, supra and subgingival scraping and the group 2: SUPRA supragingival scraping and OHO. In both groups, the scaling procedure was performed using periodontal curettes type Mc Call 13-14 and 17-18 (DUFLEX) in one session.
Within 30 days after the initial session scraping clinical parameters were reevaluated, and now, according to every need, the patients were submitted to the supra and subgingival therapy. Noting that full dental care was provided to participants.</description>
