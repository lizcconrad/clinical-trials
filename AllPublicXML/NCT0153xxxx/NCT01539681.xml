      Prospective, non-interventional, multi-center study. Patients affected by Hepatocellular
      Carcinoma (HCC) who are candidates for systemic therapy and in whom a decision to treat with
      sorafenib has been made. Aim of this non-interventional, post-marketing study is to evaluate
      the efficacy of sorafenib in terms of overall survival rate at 12 months in patients with HCC
      under daily-life treatment conditions.
