  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is being done to look at age differences in the way the investigators bodies break
      down a compound found in flax seed (secoisolariciresinol diglucoside or SDG). It is
      administered to research subjects in a product called BeneFlax, which a concentrated version
      of flax seed containing 38% SDG.

      It is known that as people age, their bodies undergo physical changes both on the outside and
      the inside. The aging process may change the way that the investigators bodies deal with
      compounds the investigators eat. As an important measure of safety, the investigators want to
      check for evidence whether there is a difference in break down of SDG between different age
      groups.
