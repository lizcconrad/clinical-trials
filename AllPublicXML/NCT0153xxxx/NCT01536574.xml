  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This open label extension study allows assessment of the long term safety profile of REQUIP
      PR in subjects who have completed 24 weeks of randomised treatment in study ROP111528.

      Subjects must not have a break in study medication between completing the feeder study and
      entering extension study, treatment must be continuous.

      Subjects will be dispensed down-titration medication at the study completion/early withdrawal
      visit and should be scheduled to return for a follow up visit 4 to 14 days after the last
      dose of study medication.

The Investigator determined if an AE/SAE was related to investigational product. Medical/scientific judgment was used to determine whether SAE reporting was appropriate in situations in which an event may not have met the SAE definition.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Subjects must have completed 24 weeks of randomised treatment in study ROP111528(and
             must have completed the one-week downtitration at the end of treatment/early
             withdrawal).

          2. Subjects must not have a break in medication between completing the downtitration
             phase for studies ROP111528 and beginning treatment in this extension study.

          3. Women of child-bearing potential must be practicing a clinically accepted method of
             contraception during the study and for one month following completion of the study.
             Acceptable contraceptive methods include oral contraception, surgical sterilization,
             intrauterine device (IUD), or diaphragm IN ADDITION to spermicidal foam and condom on
             male partner, or systemic contraception (e.g. Norplant System).

          4. Provide written informed consent for this study.

          5. Be willing and able to comply with study procedures.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients with any ongoing clinically significant adverse events at the end of the
             study ROP111528.

          2. Subjects with severe, clinically significant condition(s) other than Parkinson's
             disease which, in the opinion of the investigator, would render the subject unsuitable
             for the study (e.g., psychiatric, hematological, renal, hepatic, endocrinology,
             neurological (other than Parkinson's disease), cardiovascular, or active malignancy
             (other than basal cell carcinoma).

          3. Subjects with clinically significant abnormalities in Laboratory or ECG tests at the
             end of the study ROP111528.

          4. Subjects with severe dizziness or fainting due to postural hypotension on standing.

             drug known to substantially inhibit CYP1A2 (e.g. ciprofloxacine, fluvoxamine,
             cimetidine, ethinyloestradiol) or induce CYP1A2 (e.g. tobacco, omeprazole) within 7
             days prior to enrolment. Subjects already on chronic therapy with any of these agents
             may be enrolled but doses must have remained stable from 7 days prior to enrolment
             through the end of the treatment period.

          <description>Participants who had received ropinirole PR in the parent double-blind (DB) study received ropinirole PR in this open-label (OL) extension study. Participants started on ropinirole PR 2 milligrams (mg) for 1 week. The dose was uptitrated weekly by 2 mg for the first 3 weeks. Later, the investigators could use their clinical judgment to increase the dose level above 8 mg once daily, in 4 mg increments, up to 24 mg once daily. Participants could remain on the same dose level if tolerability issues occurred during escalation or could reduce their dose by one dose level. After the 24-week treatment phase, all participants were down-titrated over the course of 1 week, or had an early withdraw visit if they did not complete the study for any reason. Participants returned for a follow-up visit 4-14 days after the last dose of ropinirole PR.</description>

        <description>AE=any untoward medical occurrence (UMO), temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product (MP), whether or not considered related to the MP. SAE=any UMO that, at any dose, results in death, is life threatening, requires hospitalization/prolongation of existing hospitalization, results in disability/incapacity, or is a congenital anomoly/birth defect. The Investigator determined if an AE/SAE was related to investigational product. Medical/scientific judgment was used to determine whether SAE reporting was appropriate in situations in which an event may not have met the SAE definition.</description>

Participants started on ropinirole PR 2 milligrams (mg) for 1 week. The dose was uptitrated weekly by 2 mg for the first 3 weeks. Later, the investigators could use their clinical judgment to increase the dose level above 8 mg once daily, in 4 mg increments, up to 24 mg once daily. Participants could remain on the same dose level if tolerability issues occurred during escalation or could reduce their dose by one dose level. After the 24-week treatment phase, all participants were down-titrated over the course of 1 week, or had an early withdraw visit if they did not complete the study for any reason.

        <title>Mean Change From Baseline in the Gambling Symptom Assessment Scale (G-SAS) Score at Week 24</title>
        <description>The G-SAS is a reliable and valid self-reported measure of gambling symptoms. It is comprised of twelve questions aimed at evaluating gambling symptoms; each item is scored on a 5-point scale from 0 (no symptoms) to 4 (extreme symptoms). The total score ranges from 0 to 48, where 0=least severe and 48=most severe. Change from Baseline is calculated as the value at Week 24 minus the Baseline value.</description>

            <description>Participants who had received ropinirole PR in the parent double-blind (DB) study received ropinirole PR in this open-label (OL) extension study. Participants started on ropinirole PR 2 milligrams (mg) for 1 week. The dose was uptitrated weekly by 2 mg for the first 3 weeks. Later, the investigators could use their clinical judgment to increase the dose level above 8 mg once daily, in 4 mg increments, up to 24 mg once daily. Participants could remain on the same dose level if tolerability issues occurred during escalation or could reduce their dose by one dose level. After the 24-week treatment phase, all participants were down-titrated over the course of 1 week, or had an early withdraw visit if they did not complete the study for any reason. Participants returned for a follow-up visit 4-14 days after the last dose of ropinirole PR.</description>
