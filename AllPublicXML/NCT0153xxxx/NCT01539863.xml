  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      As low back pain is often a recurrent and sometime persistent problem, research into
      prevention is important. Chiropractors have traditionally treated patients with maintenance
      care, which means that patients are seen on a regular basis to prevent recurrences or to stop
      a persistent problem getting worse. However, it is not known if this has the expected effect.

      This study will test the effectiveness of the maintenance care approach. Patients with
      recurrent or persistent low back pain will be treated in accordance with two different
      models. The first model is the maintenance care model, meaning that chiropractors will see
      the patient on a regular basis, regardless symptoms. The other model means that patients
      should be treated patients only when they themselves experience symptoms bad enough to seek
      care. After one year, it will be possible to see if there has been any difference between the
      groups in terms of pain, disability, quality of life and total number of treatments over the
      study period and to investigate if there is any difference in the cost-effectiveness between
      the two treatment models.Thus, the study hypothesis is that there is no difference between
      the two models regarding the number of days with pain.

      This study will be a multi-centre trial, and as part of the study, it will be necessary to
      formalize a network of research clinics all over Sweden in which participating chiropractors
      accept to perform complex data collection. This network will then have the expertise and
      potential to perform future clinical studies together with networks in other countries,
      allowing large clinical trials across countries.
