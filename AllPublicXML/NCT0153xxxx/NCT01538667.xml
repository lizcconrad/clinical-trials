  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to characterize variability and extent of the deposition of
      ciprofloxacin in the respiratory tract of healthy subjects in comparison to patients with
      chronic lung diseases after inhalation of a single 50 mg dry powder dose containing 32 mg
      active substance. In addition the safety and pharmacokinetics of ciprofloxacin will be
      evaluated. In this study the radiolabeled substance will be administered and scintigraphy
      imaging techniques will be used to demonstrate the lung deposition visually. In the healthy
      subjects an additional pharmacokinetic method is used to calculate lung deposition indirectly
      based on pharmacokinetic data derived from plasma. For this purpose they will inhale at a
      separate occasion another dose of ciprofloxacin after having ingested activated charcoal. The
      latter serves to bind ciprofloxacin which is swallowed down during the inhalation maneuver in
      the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, thus preventing its uptake into the blood (charcoal block).
      Safety investigations will focus on local tolerability in the lung.

      Pharmacokinetics is to see how the body absorbs, distributes, breaks down and gets rid of the
      study drug.

      Results from this study will be used to show how the drug is distributed in the human lung.

    <description>Firstly, scintigraphic imaging, a non-invasive method using a radioactive (99mTc-) label tagged to the formulation, will be used to describe the distribution and deposition of a single inhaled dose of Ciprofloxacin Dry Powder Inhalation (DPI) in the lung quantitatively. Secondly, based on blood sampling over a period of 24 hours after inhalation non-compartmental pharmacokinetic parameters of ciprofloxacin will be calculated to determine the systemic exposure to drug following inhalation of a single 32.5 mg Ciprofloxacin dose.</description>
