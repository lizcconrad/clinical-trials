      This pilot study is aimed to reconstruct atrophied posterior alveolar mandibular ridges using
      biomaterial and autologous bone marrow derived stem cells (BMMSC) and to insert an implant
      into the new bone in a prosthetically guided position.

    <textblock>
      Eleven patients presenting with the need of an implant retained restoration in the posterior
      mandibula and an alveolar ridge of maximum 4.5 mm width.

      A clinical examination, x- rays and Cone Beam CT(CBCT) are accessed. A sample of the
      patients` bone marrow is extracted from the posterior alveolar ridge, immediately shipped to
      the collaborating good clinical practice (GCP) cell laboratory for cell expansion, and
      returned after 21 days. The stem cells mixed with Bi Calcium Phosphate (BCP) are then used to
      augment the alveolar ridge. The material is covered with a titanium reinforced membrane
      before closure of the site. After four to six months a bone biopsy is performed and implants
      are installed in the regenerated bone.

      The patient will be followed after 1, 2, 3, and 5 years where implant stability will be
      assessed. Furthermore the new formed bone will be clinically and radiologically assessed at
      the same time.
