      The device is intended to endoscopically transect polyps in the gastrointestinal tract
      (sessile or pedunculated) using electrocautery. During the same maneuver the polyp is
      captured, retrieved and submitted for pathological analysis. The Tandem Snare is an
      intervention tool inserted through the colonoscope for the resection and removal of polyps
      sized 6 to 25 mm. The Tandem snare utilizes a technology that has the potential to hold the
      polyp, lift it up, resect and remove it without losing it. This is a feasibility study aiming
      to demonstrate the safety of the Tandem Snare used for 6-25mm polyps' polypectomy in
      screening, diagnostic or surveillance colonoscopy.

    <textblock>
      The colonoscopy procedure is considered the &quot;gold standard&quot; for detecting, diagnosing and
      treating abnormalities in the colon. Detection and removal of colon polyps is the most
      significant benefit colonoscopy provides toward the reduction of colorectal cancer mortality
      and morbidity. The Tandem Snare is an intervention tool inserted through the colonoscope for
      the resection and removal of polyps sized 6 to 25 mm. The Tandem snare utilizes a technology
      that has the potential to hold the polyp, lift it up, resect and remove it without losing it.
      The technology may eliminate the repeated bites with the intervention tool or the need to use
      additional intervention tools such as the net. It may improve visual perception for resecting
      the polyp without losing it while removing from the colon. Consequently it may increase the
      potential for complete polypectomy and reduce intervention time and repetitions, polyp lost,
      risks and cost. This is a feasibility study aiming to demonstrate the safety of the Tandem
      Snare used for 6-25mm polyps' polypectomy in screening, diagnostic or surveillance
      colonoscopy.
