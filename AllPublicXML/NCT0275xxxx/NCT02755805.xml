  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cognitive impairments occur frequently after stroke, and are associated with significant
      long-term activities of daily living (ADL) disability and poor quality of life. This research
      study will undertake an innovative approach addressing cognitive impairments, by examining a
      new patient-centered functionally-relevant rehabilitation intervention that teaches
      individuals with cognitive impairments to manage their deficits to reduce ADL disability.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cognitive impairments are characterized by problems sustaining attention in distracting
      conditions, shifting attention between different task demands, and using working memory to
      consistently execute intended actions, and as a result limit the ability to execute routine
      ADLs. Presently there are no interventions that have demonstrated robust effectiveness in
      reducing disability among individuals with cognitive impairments after stroke. Recent
      findings suggest that individuals with cognitive impairments may experience ADL disability in
      part because they have difficulty engaging in, and benefiting from rehabilitation programs as
      they are currently delivered. In other words, individuals with cognitive impairment, due to
      the nature of their impairments, have difficulty learning and applying adaptive strategies as
      they are currently provided during traditional rehabilitation training. Therefore,
      interventions that train individuals with cognitive impairments a new way to learn and apply
      adaptive strategies may help them benefit from rehabilitation programs and reduce long-term
      disability. Cognitive Orientation to daily Occupation Performance (CO-OP) is a strategy
      training approach that trains individuals to identify problems in the performance of daily
      activities, develop strategies to address these problems, and monitor their own performance
      in the course of their daily routines. Therefore, CO-OP teaches individuals to &quot;take charge&quot;
      of their rehabilitation, and develop adaptive behaviors to &quot;work around&quot; cognitive
      impairments to meet their goals. The proposed project examines whether CO-OP facilitates
      reductions in ADL disability and improvements in rehabilitation engagement among individuals
      with cognitive impairments after acute stroke.

    <measure>Difference in Independence With Activities of Daily Living (Functional Independence Measure) Between Groups Over Time</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, rehabilitation discharge, month 3, month 6</time_frame>
    <description>Difference between groups in mean scores (computed from Functional Independence Measure total scores) over time were examined with mixed effects models.
The Functional Independence Measure contains 18 items with a total score ranging from 18-126 is obtained (18=complete dependence/total assistance with basic self-care and mobility activities; 126=complete independence with basic self-care and mobility activities). Total scores were calculated at baseline, rehabilitation discharge, month 3, and month 6 for each participant, and mean total scores were calculated fro each group at each time point.</description>

    <measure>Difference in Executive Function- Inhibition, CWI (Color Word Interference Inhibition Scale)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 3 months, 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Difference mean scaled scores (Color Word Interference Inhibition Scale) between groups over time using mixed effects models.
The Color Word Interference Inhibition Scale raw scores are converted to norm-referenced scaled scores adjusted for age and education. These scores are aligned with a population mean of 10, and standard deviation of 3. Higher scores indicate better executive function. Scaled scores were generated at baseline, month 3, and month 6 for each participant, and mean scaled scores were computed for each group at each time point.</description>

    <description>Difference between groups in mean scaled scores (Color Word Interference Switching Scale) over time using mixed effects models.
The Cognitive Flexibility Scale raw scores were converted to norm-referenced scaled scores adjusted for age and education. These scores are aligned with a population mean of 10, and standard deviation of 3. Higher scores indicate better executive function. Scaled scores were generated at baseline, month 3, and month 6 for each participant, and mean scaled scores were computed for each group at each time point.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline, 3 months, 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Difference in mean Apathy Evaluation Scale total scores were examined between groups over time using repeated measures fixed effects models.
The Apathy Evaluation Scale measures lack of motivation or interest in goal-directed activities. The scale has 18 items yielding a total score of 18 (indicating absence of apathy) to 72 (indicating severe apathy). Total scores were generated for each participant at each time, and mean scores were computed for each group at each time point.</description>

          <title>CO-OP</title>
          <description>Cognitive Orientation to daily Occupational Performance (CO-OP) is a strategy training approach that trains individuals to identify problems in the performance of their daily activities, develop strategies to address these problems, and monitor their own performance in the course of their daily routines. Participants use a workbook to support their application of the strategy training.

          <description>The attention control intervention controls for the non-specific effects of strategy training.
