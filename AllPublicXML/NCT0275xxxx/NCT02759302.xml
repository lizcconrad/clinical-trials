  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      POMT2 mutation is known to cause Walker Warburg Syndrome and Muscle-Brain-Eye syndrome.
      Recently it has been connected to limb girdle muscular dystrophy (LGMD), a disorder
      characterized by muscle weakness and atrophy of the proximal muscles of the shoulder and
      pelvic girdles. LGMD is classified based on its inheritance pattern and genetic cause into
      more than 31 different types. LGMD with POMT2 mutations is a new phenotype - type 2N. Very
      few patients with the LGMD2N phenotype has been reported. In this study, the investigators
      examine five new cases with the LGMD phenotype. The primary aim is to examine the muscle
      involvement using MRI.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>MRI scan for qualitative analysis of muscle involvement</measure>
    <time_frame>One MRI scan per subject (exam lasts approximately 60 min.)</time_frame>
    <description>The MRI protocol include T1-weighted brain and whole body examination. Four cross-sectional slices at shoulder, lumbar back, thigh and calf are chosen for qualitative analysis using the grading scale from 1 to 4 developed by Mercuri et al. (2007) to evaluate the involvement of muscles by looking at the fat infiltration.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Muscle Biopsy</measure>
    <time_frame>One muscle biopsy per subject (last approximately 15 min.)</time_frame>
    <description>One muscle biopsy from each patient from the tibialis anterior muscle or the deltoid muscle will be analyzed for glycosylated α-dystroglycan, merosin and POMT2. (Concentration determined by standard biochemical analysis).</description>
