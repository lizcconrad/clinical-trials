      The study aims to evaluate the role of endobronchial ultrasound elastography in
      differentiated diagnosis of benign and malignant thoracic lesions

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Ultrasound elastography has been gradually used in clinic with the rapid development of
      ultrasonic technique,and presents a promising application prospect in differentiated
      diagnosis of benign and malignant disease.The aim of the study is to evaluate the accuracy of
      endobronchial ultrasound elastography in the diagnosis of thoracic lesions.

      Conventional ultrasound and ultrasound elastography are respectively used to examine thoracic
      lesions before aspiration,then the images are saved as video clips. Features of conventional
      ultrasound and parameters of ultrasound elastography are analysed and recorded by skilled
      worker. The investigators define the pathological results of EBUS-TBNA combined with results
      of six months follow-up as the &quot;Gold Standard&quot;. The receiver operator characteristic curves
      are drawn to obtain area under the Curve (AUC) and the best diagnostic threshold values of
      each parameters. According to the best cutoff values, the investigators respectively
      calculate the accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, odds product of each parameters, and then
      compare them with each other to evaluate the value of ultrasound elastography

    <description>Elastography strain ratios were calculated between selected area of the lesions and the surrounding normal tissues.Then ROC curve was drawn to obtain the best diagnostic threshold value.According to the best cutoff value, the diagnostic accuracy,sensitivity and specificity of strain ratio were calculated.The pathological results of EBUS-TBNA combined with results of long-term follow-up were defined as the gold standard.</description>

    <measure>Elasticity score</measure>
    <time_frame>six months</time_frame>
    <description>Elasticity scores were obtained by analyzing elastography images.Scores:1-2: benign;3-4: malignant lesions. The sensitivity and specificity of elastography for the diagnosis of malignant thoracic lesions were calculated on the basis of above-specified criteria. The pathological results of EBUS-TBNA combined with results of long-term follow-up were defined as the gold standard.</description>

    <measure>Elastography area ratio</measure>
    <time_frame>six months</time_frame>
    <description>Elastography area ratios were defined as following:areas as blue pixels/lesion areas as region of interest pixels.Then ROC curve was drawn to obtain the best diagnostic threshold value.According to the best cutoff value, the diagnostic accuracy,sensitivity and specificity of area ratio were calculated.The pathological results of EBUS-TBNA combined with results of long-term follow-up were defined as the gold standard.</description>
