  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A phase I, first-time-in-human (FTIH), randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled,
      dose-escalation study is conducted to determine the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetic
      (PK) profile of GSK3342830 after administration of single intravenous (IV) infusion in Part 1
      and repeat IV infusion in Part 2 in healthy subjects. Part 1 will investigate escalating
      single IV doses of GSK3342830. Part 2, will investigate escalating repeat IV doses of
      GSK3342830 with repeat dosing for 15 days as follows: a single IV infusion on Day 1, TID
      (three times a day) IV infusions on Days 2 through 14 (approximately every 8 hours), and a
      single IV infusion on Day 15. The planned starting GSK3342830 dose in Part 1 is 250 milligram
      (mg) administered as a single IV infusion. The dose is planned to increase in subsequent
      cohorts to 500, 1000, 2000, 4000, and less than or equal to (≤) 6000 mg. Part 1 will be
      divided into 6 cohorts (A-F) and each cohort will enroll 10 subjects (6 in active and 2 in
      placebo). Dose escalation will be conducted only if it is supported by the preliminary
      safety, tolerability, and PK results from the preceding dose levels in the study. The repeat
      dose escalation component (Part 2) of this study will be planned to be initiated after
      completion and evaluation of the all single dose cohorts up to and including 4000 mg.

             14 days if the drug is a potential enzyme inducer) or 5 half-lives (whichever is
             longer) before the first dose of study treatment, unless in the opinion of the

             compromise subject safety.

          -  History of regular alcohol consumption within 6 months of screening defined as an
             average weekly intake of &gt;21 units (or an average daily intake of &gt;3 units) for males

             cephalosporin, carbapenem, or penicillin antibiotics) or other drugs, a history of
             multiple antibiotic intolerances, or a history of serious adverse drug reactions.

          -  Sensitivity to poison ivy or other catechol-related hypersensitivity (e.g., mango

             history of drug or other allergy that, in the opinion of the investigator,
             contraindicates participation in the study.

          -  Presence of hepatitis B surface antigen or positive hepatitis C antibody test result

          -  Glomerular filtration rate &lt;90 millilter per minute per 1.73 square meter
             (mL/min/1.73m^2) as calculated by the Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology
             Collaboration formula

          -  Albumin to creatinine ratio (ACR) &gt;0.03 mg/mg. In the event of an ACR above this
             threshold, eligibility may be confirmed by a second measurement.

          -  Urinalysis positive for blood without other cause identified.

          -  A positive pre-study drug or alcohol screen.

          -  A positive test for human immunodeficiency virus antibody at or before screening.

             excess of 500 mL within a 56-day period.

          -  The subject has participated in a clinical trial and has received an investigational
             product within the following time period before the first dosing day in this study: 30
             days, 5 half lives or twice the duration of the biological effect of the
             investigational product (whichever is longer).

          -  Exposure to more than 4 new chemical entities within 12 months before the first dosing
             day in this study.

          -  Exclusion criteria for screening and baseline 12-lead ECG: Heart rate &lt;40 and &gt;100
             beats per minute for males and &lt;50 and &gt;100 beats per minute (for females), pulse rate

             Bazett's formula (QTcB ) and corrected QT interval using Fridericia's formula (QTcF )
             &gt;450 msec.. Also apart from this, subject having evidence of previous myocardial
             infarction, bundle branch block and Any conduction abnormality (including but not
             specific to left or right complete bundle branch block, AV block [2nd degree or
             higher], Wolf-Parkinson-White syndrome), sinus pauses more than 3 seconds,
             non-sustained or sustained ventricular tachycardia (&gt;=3 consecutive ventricular
             ectopic beats), or any significant arrhythmia that, in the opinion of the investigator
             will interfere with the safety of the individual subject.
