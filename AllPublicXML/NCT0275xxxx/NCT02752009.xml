      This research protocol is studying the accuracy of the sentinel lymph node biopsy procedure
      in breast cancer patients who have cancer cells in the lymph nodes in the armpit (axilla) who
      have received chemotherapy or endocrine therapy prior to having surgery (neoadjuvant
      therapy).

      -  This research study is a Pilot Study, which is the first time investigators are
           examining this study intervention locally; although this intervention has been studied
           nationally in published clinical trials.

        -  In this research study, the investigators are studying the accuracy of the sentinel
           lymph node biopsy procedure in breast cancer patients who have cancer cells in the lymph
           nodes in the armpit (axilla) who have received chemotherapy or endocrine therapy prior
           to having surgery (neoadjuvant therapy).

        -  A sentinel lymph node biopsy is a surgical evaluation of the lymph nodes in the underarm
           area in patients who have early breast cancer. Approximately, two-five nodes are removed
           from the underarm area for evaluation. The sentinel lymph node biopsy is performed in
           patients with breast cancer to determine if there are cancer cells in the lymph nodes in
           the armpit.

        -  The sentinel lymph node biopsy procedure is performed by injecting one or two dyes into
           the breast, which then travel to the armpit region via small vessels in the immune
           system. These nodes are called the sentinel lymph nodes. They represent the first nodes
           that drain the breast tissue. They are closely evaluated by a Pathologist to determine
           if cancer cells are present.

        -  This information allows physicians to know how far the cancer may have spread and
           recommend therapies accordingly.

        -  If sentinel lymph node biopsy is determined to be accurate in patients who are known to
           already have cancer cells in the axillary lymph nodes who receive neoadjuvant therapy,
           then in the future, many of the patients in this population may be spared the procedure
           of a full axillary lymph node dissection, which removes a larger number of lymph nodes
           and thus has increased risks and side-effects.

    <description>Axillary Lymph Node Biopsy
-- Axillary lymph node sampling with clip placement into the sampled lymph node. After the tissue sampling of any suspicious nodes, a marker clip will be placed to allow for intra-operative identification of the biopsied nodes.
Neoadjuvant therapy at the discretion of the treating Medical Oncologist. Once Neoadjuvant therapy is completed, surgery in the form of either Lumpectomy or Mastectomy is performed.
Wire-localization of the clipped node on the day of surgery.
Lymphatic mapping performed with either radiocolloid and/or blue dye.
Sentinel lymph node biopsy will be performed on the day of surgery.
--- If the clipped node which contains the wire is not part of this sentinel lymph node specimen, then it will be removed separately and be sent to Pathology as a separate specimen.
Axillary lymph node dissection as is the standard of care.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Eligible patients will include any patients with biopsy-proven breast cancer and
             biopsy-proven axillary lymph node metastases at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center
             who are candidates for Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy or Neoadjuvant Endocrine therapy.

          -  A core needle biopsy or fine needle aspiration is acceptable for diagnosis of
             metastatic disease in lymph nodes.

          -  Patients will be identified as possible participants in the Radiology Imaging suites
             and Breast Surgery Clinics.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        -Patients with inflammatory breast cancer or distant metastases will be excluded from
