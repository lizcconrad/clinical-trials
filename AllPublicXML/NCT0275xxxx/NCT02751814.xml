  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Objective is to examine the physical activity and screen-time behaviors of children enrolled
      in licensed childcare centers before and after the enactment of new state regulations.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Pause and Play aims to enroll 266 children. Each child will participate in the study for
      approximately 1 year. Surveys, anthropometric measures, and screen-time observations will
      take approximately 1 day each to complete, and the child will be given an accelerometer to
      wear at home for 7 days at both baseline and 1 year follow-up. Fundamental motor skill
      assessments will take place at baseline and 1 year follow-up after the 7 days of
      accelerometer wear. Staff members will spend approximately 2 weeks at each childcare center
      at baseline and 1 year follow-up to complete study procedures with each child.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes in objective child physical activity</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
    <description>Physical activity will be measured with a 7 day accelerometer at baseline and 1 year, including minutes/day MVPA in childcare center, minutes/day MVPA total. Physical activity and time spent in moderate to vigorous physical activity will be measured by a triaxial accelerometer (Actigraph GT3X+, Actigraph of Ft. Walton Beach, FL). Children will be measured on 7 full days during the baseline and follow-up periods.The Actigraph is one of the most common accelerometers used for scientific purposes, and the GT3X+ version provides extensive data on steps/day and time spent in various activity intensities. The research team will ask the parents to have the children wear the accelerometer for additional days (to a maximum of 14 days) to ensure that minimal data requirements are met.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Classroom observation of child screen-time</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
    <description>Classroom observation of child screen-time will be measured with the Environment and Policy Assessment and Observation (EPAO) method to quantify average minutes/day screen-time in childcare center. Screen time will be assessed using classroom observation at the childcare center (from the EPAO observation in Aim 1).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Parent reports of child screen time</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
    <description>Parent reports of child screen time to quantify minutes/day screen-time total. Parents will complete a survey adapted to provide information about the child's screen-time (separately for TV, computer, games console and smartphone) on weekdays and weekend days. For each item the parent will be asked to report the time the child spent using it for (a) a normal weekday and (b) a normal weekend day, with response options: none; 1 to 30 minutes; 31 minutes to 1 hour; 1 to 2 hours; 2 to 3 hours; 3 to 4 hours; 4 hours or more. The assessment of TV viewing using parental report has been shown to correlate moderately (r=0.60) with 10 days of TV diaries among young children.</description>

      <textblock>
        Ten licensed DOE Class A or B childcare centers will be randomly selected from a list of
        all DOE licensed childcare centers in East Baton Rouge Parish (EBR). From the ten centers,
        266 children and their parent(s) will be recruited to complete additional measures of
        physical activity and screen-time behaviors.
