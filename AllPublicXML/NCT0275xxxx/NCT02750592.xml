    <textblock>
      Assess the clinical efficacy, safety and tolerability of secukinumab subcutaneous injections
      up to 52 weeks in Japanese patients with active AS despite current or previous non-steroidal
      anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and/or anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF) α therapy. Efficacy
      and safety data will be used to support the registration of secukinumab in Japan for the
      treatment of active AS.
