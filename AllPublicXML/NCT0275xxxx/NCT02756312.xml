  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Although bench data and retrospective studies have provided a promising picture of the
      possible influence of anesthetic technique on the risk of tumor progression, current evidence
      from RCTs is inadequate to show whether the type of anesthetics might influence tumor
      progression.There are many thousands of patients with a cancer diagnosis undergoing surgery
      every year, and in the context of biological plausibility, it should lead to the urgent
      undertaking of RCTs to further evaluate the association between the anesthetic management and
      postoperative malignant glioma progression.
