  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase I study of the combination of volasertib and romidepsin in patients with
      relapsed/refractory peripheral T cell lymphoma (PTCL) or stage IIB-IV cutaneous T cell
      lymphoma (CTCL). This study will determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of this
      combination by treating cohorts of patients at a certain dose combination. The investigators
      will use a Bayesian design to determine the dose combination for the next cohort of patients
      and to determine the MTD. Overall response rate as well as adverse events will be monitored
      and reported.

    <textblock>
      This is a non-randomized, unblinded single arm Phase I multi-center trial to determine the
      maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of the combination of volasertib and romidepsin in patients with
      relapsed/refractory peripheral T cell (PTCL) and cutaneous T cell (CTCL) lymphoma.

      Primary Objectives:

      1. Determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of the combination of romidepsin and volasertib
      in patients with relapsed/refractory peripheral T cell and cutaneous T cell lymphoma.

      Secondary Objectives:

        1. Evaluate the overall response rate (ORR) to the combination of romidepsin and volasertib
           in patients with relapsed/refractory peripheral T cell and cutaneous t cell lymphoma.

        2. Define gene expression signatures and patterns of acquired tumor mutations that
           dynamically correlate to clinical response to romidepsin/volasertib combination therapy
           in cutaneous T cell lymphoma (CTCL) through longitudinal RNA sequencing of tumor
           samples.

      Dose Combinations

      (-1): Volasertib 50mg/m2 Days 1 &amp; 8; Romidepsin 10mg/m2 Days 1, 8 &amp; 15

      (1-starting dose): Volasertib 75mg/m2 Days 1 &amp; 8; Romidepsin 12mg/m2 Days 1, 8 &amp; 15 (2):

    <description>Define 1) genes expressed at significantly different levels (using linear analysis or the Wilxocon rank sum test and p&lt; 0.05 as significance threshold) in tumor biopsies taken before treatment from patients exhibiting a clinical response versus non-responders to romidepsin/volasertib by analysis of levels of mRNA gene transcription by mRNA whole transcriptome sequencing (RNA-seq) Comparison of baseline to interim 8 week biopsy samples will be used to define changes in gene expression induced by combination treatment. These will be derived for each patient by using paired T tests for RNA sequencing FPKM values with correction for multiple comparisons via FDR calculation by the Benjamini-Hochberg method (a cutoff of FDR &lt; 0.05 will be used to define genes included in the treatment gene signature).</description>

    <description>Define 2) and 2) define mutations associated with primary (lack of clinical response) or acquired resistance (relapse or loss of response after first clinical response) to romidepsin/volasertib by analysis of tumor genetic sequences by using RNA-seq metholodies on tumor samples taken before or after treatment with romidepsin/volasertib and analysis of paired normal DNA sequence(s). Mutations for relapse samples will be obtained by comparing transcriptome profiles before and after development of resistance to romidepsin/volasertib. Specifically, we will assess whether individual genes become mutated at relapsed in a recurrent fashion (in 2 or more patients in the cohort).</description>
