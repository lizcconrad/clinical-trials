  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The potential of non-invasive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) as a therapeutic tool
      for improving schizophrenic symptoms, in particular resistant hallucinations, has been
      increasingly studied over the past decades. Several studies have demonstrated that
      low-frequency patterns of repetitive TMS (rTMS) applied over the left Temporoparietal
      Junction (TPJ), which are known to decrease local activity, significantly reduced auditory
      verbal hallucinations in schizophrenic patients. In spite of highly promising results, a high
      level of inter-individual variability in the responses to non-invasive brain stimulation
      treatments, and the fact that rTMS may prove ineffective in some patients, keep spurring
      controversy about the efficacy of these approaches (as currently performed), as well as about
      how to increase its efficacy and consistency. Accordingly, the objectives of this project are
      to better understand the impact of rTMS on the brains of patients with resistant auditory
      hallucinations, and to use this information not only to better understand this condition but
      to develop more efficient and consistent therapies. Thus, in this study, the investigators
      focus more specifically on resistant auditory hallucinations in schizophrenia, which is a
      common symptom in schizophrenic patients, and can be treated by rTMS. The investigators
      hypothesize that there is a baseline difference in anatomical and/or functional connectivity
      between responder and non-responder patients who are treated with rTMS. Therefore, our
      project will aim to determine some anatomical and functional connectivity markers of response
      to rTMS treatment in patients with schizophrenia

      The potential of non-invasive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) as a therapeutic tool
      for improving schizophrenic symptoms, in particular resistant hallucinations, has been
      increasingly studied over the past decades. Several studies have demonstrated that
      low-frequency patterns of repetitive TMS (rTMS) on the left temporoparietal junction (TPJ),
      which are known to decrease local activity, significantly reduce auditory verbal
      hallucinations in schizophrenic patients. In spite of highly promising results, a high level
      of inter-individual variability in the response to non-invasive brain stimulation treatments,
      and the fact that rTMS may prove ineffective in some patients, keep spurring controversy on
      the efficacy of these approaches as currently performed, and on how to increase its efficacy
      and consistency. To date, few studies have aimed to explain this variability when, in fact, a
      better understanding of this common phenomena in the neurostimulation domain would clearly
      increase the effectiveness of this treatment, and lead to individualized therapeutic
      approaches specifically tailored to the conditions of each patient. Moreover, many questions
      stand, particularly regarding the influence of rTMS treatment on the anatomical and
      functional connectivity in schizophrenic patients.

      Accordingly, the objectives of this project are to better understand the impact of rTMS on
      the brains of patients with resistant auditory hallucinations, and to use this information
      not only to better understand this condition but to develop more efficient and consistent
      therapies. The investigators hypothesize that there is a baseline difference in anatomical
      and/or functional connectivity between responder and non-responder patients who are treated
      with rTMS. Therefore, this project aims to determine some anatomical and functional
      connectivity markers of response to rTMS treatment in patients with schizophrenia. For this,
      the investigators compare the patterns of diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) white matter
      tractography and resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data between
      responder and non-responder patients to rTMS treatment. Moreover, the investigators believe
      that rTMS can increase the functional connectivity between frontal and temporo-parietal
      cortices in schizophrenic patients associated with improvements in auditory hallucinations.
      Therefore, the second objectives of this work are to evaluate the impact of rTMS in
      functional connectivity in patients with schizophrenia by comparing the DTI and resting-state
      fMRI data before and after rTMS treatment in both responder and non-responder patients.
