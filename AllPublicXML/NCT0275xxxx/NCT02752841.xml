      Examine the effect of nutritional vitamin D repletion on urinary calcium excretion and kidney
      stone burden in calcium kidney stone formers

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators plan to conduct a clinic-based interventional study of 50 patients followed
      at Miriam Hospital Kidney Stone Clinic with history of nephrolithiasis, urinary calcium
      excretion between 150 and 400 mg/day, and 25-vitamin D deficiency/insufficiency (defined as
      serum level ≤ 30ng/ml). The intervention is oral ergocalciferol 50,000 IU per week for 12
      weeks (repletion course). After that, the same repletion course will be repeated if serum
      25-vitamin D remains ≤ 30ng/ml or drops to ≤ 30ng/ml anytime during the study. Otherwise, a
      maintenance dose of cholecalciferol 1,000 IU daily or ergocalciferol 50,000 IU monthly will
      be prescribed for the rest of the study. Each participant will serve as his own control. The
      outcome is the change in urinary calcium excretion and stone burden assessed by renal
      ultrasound. The planned study duration is 12 months. The investigators will have greater than
      95% power to detect a 10% increase in 24-hour urinary calcium.

    <description>Examine changes in urine calcium excretion at the end of the 12month study. Urinary calcium excretion are measured by 24-hour urine collections for calcium (mg per day), and the differences are the changes of 24-hour urine calcium (mg per day) between those measured at month 12 and at the enrollment</description>

    <description>Changes in kidney stone burden at the end of the 12month study. Total stone burden is calculated by number of stones x stone sizes, i.e., patient A has one stone measured at 2 mm and two stones measured at 3 mm, then total stone burden = 1x2 +2x3=8mm.</description>
