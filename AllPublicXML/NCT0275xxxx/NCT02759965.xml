  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary hypothesis that orthopaedic surgery induces a neuroinflammatory response within
      48 hours after elective hip surgery and that there is an association between exaggerated CNS
      inflammatory response or impaired inflammatory resolution and postoperative cognitive
      dysfunction within one week and at three months postoperatively.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients at 50-85 years of age undergoing orthopedic surgery will be investigated in the
      perioperative period to detect signs of neuroinflammation using serial CSF and blood sampling
      for 48 hours in combination with cognitive testing preoperatively, at 3-7 days and after 3
      months.
