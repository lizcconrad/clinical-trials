  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Bloodstream infections cause significant morbidity and mortality and their prompt
      identification is an essential part of modern medicine. False positive results in blood
      cultures are primarily due to contaminants. It has been estimated that up to 50% of positive
      blood cultures represent contamination. These false positive cultures, at the microbiological
      laboratory level, require significant additional resources for workup. Additionally, they
      result in unnecessary antibiotic treatment and hospitalization days, causing needless harm to
      patients. Various methods have been implemented in order to reduce blood culture
      contaminants, including modifying the solution used for sterilizing the skin and feedback on
      contamination rates. However, it has been shown that the bacteria which colonize the human
      skin are not only on the surface but in fact colonize deeper surfaces as well. The SteriPath
      device diverts the initial 1-2 ml blood so as to remove any potential skin plug with
      contaminants. Thus, the principle object of this study is the determination of the rate of
      contamination of blood culture taken prior to initiating intervention versus the rate of
      contamination using three interventions: Monthly feedback via departmental report card, a
      chlorhexidine plus alcohol wipe and the SteriPath device. Secondary objectives will include
      ease of use of the wipes and the SteriPath device and an estimate of the sensitivity of
      SteriPath device use to true bacteremia. If the various interventions will be shown to reduce
      contamination, researchers will also attempt to estimate the financial effects of those
      reductions, comparing intervention cost to estimated savings related to reduced
      contamination.
