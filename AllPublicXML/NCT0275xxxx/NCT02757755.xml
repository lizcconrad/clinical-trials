  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will examine the safety of ascending doses of AB-SA01 when topically applied to
      intact skin of healthy adults.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      AB-SA01 consists of three bacteriophages (viruses) that target Staphylococcus aureus
      bacteria.

      The safety of AB-SA01 will be assessed when topically administered once daily to the volar
      aspect of the forearm at a dose of 10^8 plaque forming units (PFU) per phage for 3
      consecutive days, and then at a dose of 10^9 plaque forming units (PFU) per phage for 3
      consecutive days. Both AB-SA01 and placebo will be administered to each subject to provide
      his/her own control for evaluation of skin reactions. The right or left placement of the
      placebo will be randomized and double-blinded.

          2. Willing and able to sign the informed consent and adhere to the study schedule

          3. Healthy subject as determined by the principal investigator or designee via medical
             history and clinical examination before enrollment in the study

          4. Normal skin of the volar aspect of the forearms, as determined by the principal
             investigator or designee via examination
