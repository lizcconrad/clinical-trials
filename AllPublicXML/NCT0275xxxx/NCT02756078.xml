    <description>CLUE Handling is assessed using the Contact Lens User Experience (CLUE™) Questionnaire. CLUE™ is a validated patient-reported outcomes questionnaire to assess patient experience attributes of soft, disposable contact lenses (comfort, vision, handling, and packaging) in a contact lens-wearing population in the US, ages 18-65. Scores follow a normal distribution with a population average score of 60 (SD 20), where higher scores indicate a more favorable / positive response. 97% of the scores fall within 0 and 120 (mean +/- 3XSD).</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  The subject must read, understand, and sign the STATEMENT OF INFORMED CONSENT and
             receive a fully executed copy of the form.

          -  The subject must appear able and willing to adhere to the instructions set forth in
             this clinical protocol.

          -  The subject must be between 18 and 40 years of age.

          -  The subject's vertex corrected spherical equivalent distance refraction must be in the
             range of -0.50 Diopters (D) to -8.00 D in each eye.

          -  The subject's refractive cylinder must be no more than -1.00 D cylindrical correction
             in each eye after vertexing to the corneal plane.

          -  The subject must have best corrected visual acuity of 0.20 or better in each eye.

          -  The subject must be a current wearer of daily, spherical, soft contact lenses (no
             bifocal or multifocal contact lenses, no extended wear or monovision) for at least 5
             days/week and at least 8 hours/day during the month prior to enrollment.

          -  The subject must be using digital devices (any combination of computers, tablets,
             smart phones etc.) for at least 8 hours over the course of a typical day.

             baseline visit.

          -  The subject must have normal eyes with no evidence of abnormality or disease that in
             the opinion of the investigator would contraindicate contact lens wear.

          -  The subject must meet normal eligibility conditions of binocular vision tests.

          -  The subject may not have any double vision at near with their habitual contact lens
             correction.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Currently pregnant or lactating (subjects who become pregnant during the study will be
             discontinued).

             (at the investigator's discretion).

             with contact lens wear (at the investigator's discretion).

          -  Use of any medication that causes side effects similar to side effects experienced
             when using digital devices, such as a subject reporting headaches associated with
             birth control pills (at the investigator's discretion).

          -  Any infectious disease (e.g., hepatitis, tuberculosis) or a contagious
             immunosuppressive disease.

          -  Any active ocular infection.

          -  Entropion, ectropion, extrusions, chalazia, recurrent styes, glaucoma, history of

          -  Any previous, or planned, ocular or interocular surgery (e.g., radial keratotomy,
             photorefractive keratectomy (PRK), laser-assisted in situ keratomileusis (LASIK),
             etc.).

          -  Clinically significant (grade 3 or 4) corneal edema, corneal vascularization, corneal
             staining, or any other abnormalities of the cornea which would contraindicate contact
             lens wear.

          -  Clinically significant (grade 3 or 4) tarsal abnormalities or bulbar injection which
             might interfere with contact lens wear.

          -  Any known hypersensitivity or allergic reaction to the study products.

          -  Participation in any contact lens or lens care product clinical trial within 7 days
             prior to study enrollment.

          -  History of binocular vision abnormality or strabismus.
