  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Understanding how foods and nutrients are digested, absorbed and metabolized when weight is
      stable and during weight loss induced by bariatric surgery procedure using the technologies
      of genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics and fluxomics (&quot;omics&quot;) will enable
      generation of new hypotheses that could explain the inter-individual differences in weight
      loss and could lead to optimization and individualization of therapies designed to lose
      weight.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The overarching hypothesis is that there are baseline, pre- and post-surgery combinations of
      'omics' signatures in response to food and nutrients that explain the weight loss response of
      obese subjects to the pre-operative very low calorie (VLC) diet and to bariatric surgery.

      In order to address the general hypothesis the following specific aims will be addressed:

      Specific Aim 1: To test the hypothesis that there is a combination of 'omics' parameters in
      response to a defined meal that discriminate between morbidly obese subjects and normal
      weight subjects.

      Specific Aim 2: To test the hypothesis that variation in % weight loss to the VLC diet prior
      to bariatric surgery is related to baseline genomic markers, gene expression profile,
      proteomic and metabolomic signatures as well as baseline metabolic and substrates fluxomics
      response to a defined meal.

      Specific Aim 2: To test the hypothesis that variation in % weight loss 3 months after
      bariatric surgery is related to baseline genomic markers, gene expression profile, proteomic
      and metabolomic signatures as well as baseline metabolic and substrates fluxomics response to
      a defined meal.

      Specific Aim 3: To test whether there are &quot;omics&quot; characteristics post-surgery that track
      with variability in weight loss at 3 months.

      The benefit of these experiments will be the knowledge gained from understanding the
      variation in % weight loss to the medically required VLC diet prior to bariatric surgery, and
      to bariatric surgery, in relation to baseline genomic markers, gene expression profile,
      proteomic and metabolomic signatures as well as baseline metabolic and substrates fluxomics
      response to a defined meal in obese and healthy adults.
