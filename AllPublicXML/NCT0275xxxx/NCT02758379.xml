      The objective of this clinical trial is to study the early safety and feasibility of the
      Shockwave Coronary Lithoplasty System. To demonstrate that the Shockwave device can safely
      and effectively deliver localized shockwave energy for balloon dilatation of calcified,
      stenotic, de novo coronary lesions.

      Prospective, non-randomized, single center First In Human (FIH) trial for treatment of
      stenotic calcified coronary lesions with the Shockwave Lithoplasty System. Patients will be
      enrolled and consented in the study based on history and in some instances an angiogram
      obtained prior to the study. The study is designed to demonstrate that the Shockwave device
      can safely and effectively deliver localized shockwave energy for balloon dilatation of
      calcified, stenotic, coronary arteries. Subjects will be prepared for PCI per the
      institution's standard protocol. Medications will be administered per the treatment protocol.
      Femoral access will be obtained using a 6F access sheath, and guiding catheter placed at the
      ostia of the right or left coronary artery. Baseline angiography of the culprit lesion will
      be performed prior to placement of a 0.014&quot; guide wire. Baseline and either IVUS or OCT will
      be performed to determine the Maximum Lumen Area (MLA), percent stenosis, and volumetric
      lesion assessment. Baseline angiography will be performed to determine lesion length, %
      stenosis and reference vessel diameter. The investigational device will be prepped per the
      IFU and positioned at the target lesion. The distal end of the balloon catheter will be
      connected to the patient cable. The balloon catheter will be inflated to 4 atm and the
      investigator will deliver 10 pulses for 20 seconds. The balloon will then be inflated to
      reference vessel diameter and then deflated to reestablish flow and complete one treatment
      cycle. The treatment cycle will then be repeated. Angiography and either IVUS or OCT will be
      repeated for the treated lesion.. A coronary stent will be deployed at the site of treatment.
      Angiography and either IVUS or OCT will be performed following stent placement. Patients will
      be followed through discharge and at 30 and 180 days. A subset of up to five (5) subjects
      will receive an angiographic assessment at the 180 day follow up visit, per the Sponsor's
      discretion.
