  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a common disorder with serious complications. Positive
      airway pressure (PAP) is the first line treatment of OSA, which eliminates obstructive
      events, reduces daytime sleepiness, and improves quality of life, especially in those with
      excessive daytime sleepiness. However, despite the benefits of the PAP treatment, overall
      acceptance and adherence rates are not fully promising. Less is known regarding the PAP
      adherence rates in Turkey. In the current study, the researchers primarily addressed if an
      intensified patient education strategy including the polysomnography (PSG) charts viewing
      followed by frequent follow-ups would improve the compliance rates at long-term in patients
      with OSA.

      OSA is a common disorder with serious complications. PAP is the first line treatment of OSA,
      but overall acceptance and adherence rates are not fully promising. In the current study, the
      researchers primarily addressed if an intensified patient education strategy including the
      PSG charts viewing followed by frequent follow-ups would improve the compliance rates at
      long-term in patients with OSA.

      METHOD:

      This single-center, randomized, controlled study was conducted at the Süreyyapaşa Chest
      Diseases and Thoracic Surgery Training and Research Hospital in Istanbul between June 2014
      and April 2015. Eligible OSA patients were randomized to Standard Support (SS) group (general
      information about OSA and PAP treatment at baseline), or to Educational Support (ES) group
      (additional polysomnography chart viewing from both diagnostic and titration nights). All
      patients were scheduled to five PAP control visits between 2 weeks and 6 months after the PAP
      prescription. Primary outcome was the PAP compliance (4 h/night for 70% of all the nights) at
      the last visit.
