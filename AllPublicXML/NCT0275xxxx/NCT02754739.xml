  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      An increased risk of incident diabetes with statin therapy have been reported in several
      studies. However, it is not recommended to limit the use of statin for this reason since the
      absolute risk increase was small, and the cardiovascular event rate reduction with statins
      overweighed the risk of new diabetes (Scatter N et al. Lancet, 2010). Moreover, each statin
      may have different effect on the development of incident diabetes. In the West of Scotland
      Coronary Prevention Study, pravastatin therapy reduced the hazard of becoming diabetic by
      30%. Also, with pravastatin use, an increase in adiponectin level, which is related to the
      improvement in insulin sensitivity, has been reported. In this clinical trial, the
      investigators are aiming to evaluate the effect of pravastatin on insulin resistance, insulin
      secretion, glycemic control, and adiponectin level in participants with prediabetes or early
      diabetes by assigning them in a 24 weeks of pravastatin therapy group or in a placebo group.

    <masking_description>This study was initially designed as a single center, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 2-group factorial randomized trial (placebo or pravastatin 40mg once daily for 24 weeks). Subjects were randomly assigned, in a 1:1 ratio, to receive pravastatin in a blinded fashion at a dose of 40 mg once daily or placebo. However, because of the problem of expiration date of the placebo drug, the study was converted to an open-label trial, and subjects without any medications were enrolled in an open-label control group in contrast to the pravastatin group. Therefore, the study cohort comprised the pravastatin group, placebo group, and the open-label control group. The placebo group and the open-label control group were classified as the control group.</masking_description>
