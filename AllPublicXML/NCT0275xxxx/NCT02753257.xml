  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Valtari Bio has early proof of concept clinical data of a multi-omic peripheral blood
      biomarker profile that can be used to determine stroke from no stroke in the emergency
      setting. The objective of this observational cohort clinical study is to determine the
      clinical utility of this multi-omic biomarker profile.

      Primary Study Aims:

        1. The diagnostic tests characteristics of a multi-omic biomarker diagnostic for stroke
           (ischemic stroke, transient ischemic attack (TIA) and hemorrhagic stroke) versus no
           stroke (stroke mimic).

        2. The ability of a multi-omic biomarker profile to differentiate ischemic stroke from
           hemorrhagic stroke and TIA.

      At the completion of this project the investigators will have evaluated a peripheral blood
      test that determines the expression of a multi-omic biomarker profile to differentiate stroke
      from no-stroke in the emergency setting. Five hundred patients aged 18 years or older who
      present to the hospital with stroke-like symptoms will be recruited within 24 hours of
      symptom onset at participating clinical sites. Data will be obtained from the medical
      records. Blood for research purposes will be obtained. Research evaluations for stroke
      severity, symptoms and outcome will be performed by trained personnel. All clinical
      evaluation and management will be per standard of care.

      The primary outcome of this study is the criterion standard stroke diagnosis. This will be
      used to estimate the diagnostic test characteristics of a multi-omic biomarker profile in the
      peripheral whole blood for distinguishing stroke (IS, TIA, SAH, ICH) versus non-stroke in ED
      patients with acute neurologic symptoms. Secondly, the investigators will estimate the
      ability of the multi-omic biomarker profile to differentiate between stroke subtypes. A
      diagnosis of stroke will be defined as clinical syndromes consistent with stroke (i.e.,
      sudden onset neurological deficit) plus imaging confirmation (or symptom resolution and lack
      of imaging findings in TIA). Finally, the investigators will explore the relationship between
      the multi-omic profile and time from symptom onset in ischemic stroke patients. Descriptive
      and inferential statistics will be used to address the aims of the study. Pattern recognition
      analysis and machine learning will be employed as a systems level approach to determine
      relevant pathophysiologic pathways associated with diagnosis and symptom onset time.

      Venous blood samples will be collected from all patients at baseline resulting in two 2.5 ml
      Paxgene RNA tubes, two 8 ml EDTA tube, and one 7 ml serum tube. Approximately 28 ml of blood
      will be collected.

        A prospective consecutive sample of possible stroke cases will be recruited within 12 hours
        of symptom onset. Final diagnoses may include: ischemic stroke (IS), TIA, aneurysmal
        subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH), intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) with or without
        intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH) (or primary IVH), and stroke mimic (all other patients
        presenting with acute onset stroke-like symptoms who do not have ischemic or hemorrhagic
        stroke).
