    <textblock>
      The aim of this randomized trial will be to evaluate the clinical performance of the I-gel,
      air- Q ILA compared with the LMA classic in pediatric patients undergoing peripheral surgery
      under general anesthesia.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The laryngeal mask airway (LMA) Classic has gained popularity for airway management in both
      anesthesia and resuscitation due to its ease of use. However, insertion of the LMA Classic is
      not always easy in children due to differences in airway anatomy compared with adults, and
      more complications are related to its use in younger children compared with adults.

      The i-gel has been commercially available in sizes suitable for children since 2010. It has a
      non-inflatable cuff and an additional lumen for the active or passive drainage of gastric
      contents (except in size 1). It is available in four children's sizes (1, 1.5, 2 and 2.5).

      The air-Q_ ILA, is easily inserted with the index finger of the right hand, while the
      anesthetist performed jaw's lift with left hand, without a rotational technique (Jagannathan
      N et al., 2011, Dar long et al, 2014 and Keil et al, 2015).

      Oropharyngeal leak pressure is defined as the airway pressure at which air leaks into the
      mouth or enters the stomach (Hughes et al., 2012). This feature is the most common primary
      outcome parameter used to evaluate the safety and efficacy of supraglottic airway devices
      because high pressures generally indicate that adequate ventilation can be achieved without
      air leakage during positive pressure ventilation at high inspiratory pressures (Teoh et al.,
      2010).

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Airway leak pressure</measure>
    <time_frame>intraoperative</time_frame>
    <description>Airway leak pressure will be determined by closing the adjustable expiratory pressure-limiting (APL) valve and setting the fresh gas flow rate to 3 L/min. The airway pressure at which an audible leak in the mouth is heard is recorded as the &quot;leak pressure&quot;. If leak pressure reached 35 cmH2O, the expiratory valve will be opened. After adjusting the APL valve to 35 cmH2O, the maximum tidal volume (TVmax) will be measured by squeezing the balloon of anesthesia circuit until an audible leak occurred. Airway pressures were not allowed to exceed 35 cmH2O.</description>

    <measure>Fiberoptic laryngoscopic view</measure>
    <time_frame>intraoperative</time_frame>
    <description>Fiberoptic images will be recorded using a digital camera and will be stored on a personal computer for grading by an independent anesthetist. The images will be graded with a score from 1 to 5, which has been defined and proposed previously (Beringer et al, 2011 and Lee et al, 2012); (grade 1-only larynx seen; grade 2-larynx and epiglottis posterior surface seen; grade 3-larynx and epiglottis tip of anterior surface seen, &lt;50%visual obstruction of epiglottis to larynx; grade 4-epiglottis down folded and its anterior surface seen, &gt;50%visual obstruction of epiglottis to larynx; and grade 5-epiglottis down folded and larynx cannot be seen directly).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>ventilation score</measure>
    <time_frame>intraoperative</time_frame>
    <description>the ventilation score which is scored from 0 to 3 based on three criteria: no leakage with an airway pressure of 15 cm H2O, bilateral chest excursions with a peak inspiratory pressure of 20 cm of H2O, and a square wave capnogram, with each item scoring 0 or 1 point (Sanuki et al., 2011). Thus, if all three criteria are satisfied, the ventilation score is 3.</description>
