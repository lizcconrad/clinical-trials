      This study is intended to evaluate the effect of the dietary supplement NEM® brand eggshell
      membrane versus placebo in reducing exercise-induced joint pain &amp; stiffness &amp; cartilage
      turnover in healthy post-menopausal women. Half of the study participants will receive NEM,
      once daily, orally while the other half of the study participants will receive placebo, once
      daily, orally.

    <textblock>
      Moderate exercise can induce discomfort in joints when done infrequently or when done too
      intensely or for too long a period. This discomfort is often realized as either pain or
      stiffness in the joint that was the focus of the exercise. For example, one's knees will hurt
      after jogging for several miles, particularly if jogging for the first time. This study is
      intended to evaluate whether NEM® brand eggshell membrane can alleviate joint pain or
      stiffness, either directly following exercise or 12 hours post-exercise versus placebo. The
      study will also evaluate NEM's effect, if any, on cartilage turnover via the cartilage
      degradation biomarker c-terminal cross-linked telopeptide of type II collagen (CTX-II).
      Participants will perform a minimum of 50 steps per leg utilizing an aerobics step at the
      clinical site. They will follow this exercise regimen on alternating days for 2 weeks.
      Changes in pain &amp; stiffness (immediate &amp; 12-hour) will be compared to both baseline and to
      the placebo group. Blood &amp; Urine samples will also be collected at baseline and at the end of
      Week 1 &amp; Week 2. The change in CTX-II will be compared to baseline.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Subject must be female, 40-75 years of age.

          2. Subject must have been amenorrheic (post-menopausal) for at least 12 months prior to
             baseline evaluation, either naturally or surgically.

          3. Subject must not have been diagnosed with a joint or connective tissue (JCT) disease
             (i.e. osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, spondyloarthritis, bursitis, gout,
             systemic lupus erythematosus, fibromyalgia, etc.) affecting the hip, knee, or ankle by
             a licensed physician prior to enrollment evaluation.

          4. Subjects must have a resting pain/discomfort score of ≤ 3 on the 10 point Likert scale
             in the knee with the most severe pain/discomfort.

          5. Subject must be willing and healthy enough to perform moderate exercise.

          6. Subject must be available for and willing to attend all evaluation visits.

          7. Subject must be able and willing to give informed consent.

          8. Subjects must be willing to use only acetaminophen as rescue pain medication, if
             needed.

          9. Subjects participating in prior studies evaluating eggshell membrane can participate
             in the current study so long as they are not currently taking an eggshell membrane
             supplement and have not done so for 60 days prior to screening.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Subject is currently receiving therapy with remission-inducing drugs (i.e.
             methotrexate, tumor necrosis factor (TNF) biologics, etc.), immunosuppressive drugs

             subject's health, as judged by the clinical investigator.

          5. Subject participates in activities involving intensive use of the lower extremities
             (i.e. running / jogging, sports, bicycling, dancing, etc.) 2 or more days per week or
             participates in activities that involve moderate use of the lower extremities (i.e.
             walking, golfing, yoga, etc.) 3 or more days per week.

          6. Subject body weight is greater than 275 pounds (125 kg).

          7. Subject is currently taking or is unwilling to forgo the use of prescription,
             over-the-counter (OTC) treatments, and/or dietary supplements affecting joint health
             within 30 days prior to baseline evaluation and for the duration of the study.
             Prohibited medications include: NSAIDs, analgesics (other than acetaminophen),
             opioids, anti-depressants prescribed for painful conditions (i.e. fibromyalgia) &amp;
             joint supplements. Examples of these types of medications are: aspirin, ibuprofen,
             naproxen, oxycodone, propoxyphene, diclofenac, celecoxib, amitriptyline, duloxetine,
             glucosamine, chondroitin, MSM, white willow bark, turmeric or curcumin, Boswellia,

             a. Washout Periods: Subjects are eligible to participate in the study following a
             7-day washout period for opioids, a 14-day washout period for analgesics &amp; NSAIDs, and
             a 90-day washout period for steroids, anti-depressants, or JCT dietary supplements
             (i.e. glucosamine, chondroitin, methylsulfonylmethane (MSM), etc.) Acetaminophen must
             not have been taken within 24 hours of baseline evaluation.

          8. Subject is involved in any other research study involving an investigational product
             (drug, device or biologic) or a new application of an approved product, within 30 days
             of baseline evaluation.
