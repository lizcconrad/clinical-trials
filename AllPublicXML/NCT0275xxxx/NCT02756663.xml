  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the anti-myeloma effect of panobinostat given at
      two different doses (10 mg and 20 mg oral) in combination with carfilzomib (20/56 mg/m2 i.v.)
      and low dose dexamethasone (20 mg oral) vs carfilzomib plus low-dose dexamethasone in
      patients with relapsed or relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma. Safety and efficacy will
      be evaluated. Treatment will be administered in 4-week cycles until patients discontinue due
      to disease progression or unacceptable toxicity or for other reasons.

      Patients who discontinue the study treatment for reasons other than documented disease
      progression will be followed for disease assessments every 8 weeks until progression. All
      patients will be followed for survival until 3 years have passed from their entry into the
      study, or they have discontinued the follow up earlier.
