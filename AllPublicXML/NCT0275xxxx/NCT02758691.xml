  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Recent research has suggested insulin may be involved in how human's form and recall
      memories. This study is designed to look at how nasal insulin is used in the brain.
      Specifically, how insulin alters the various connections within brain regions that occur
      while adults perform simple attention and memory tasks. This study is divided into two parts:
      blood draw procedure and fMRI (functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging) procedure. The blood
      draw procedure is designed to look at the effects of intranasal insulin using a Precision
      Olfactory Delivery (POD) device on the blood levels of glucose and insulin. Those asked to
      participate will receiving a low-dose saline solution and low-dose of insulin through a nasal
      spray followed by a blood draw session to measure your blood glucose and insulin levels over
      a 90 minute period.

      Participation in the fMRI (functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging) procedure will involve
      receiving a low-dose of insulin or a saline solution through a nasal spray using a Precision
      Olfactory Delivery (POD) device and brain scan using Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). During
      the scan, participants will complete a series of memory tasks reflected on a computer screen.
      The trial will be randomized and double-blinded.

    <description>Recall performance will be measured based off a forced recall memory task. Participants will be asked to categorizes images as indoor or outdoor during an encoding task and then show a series of images and asked to indicated if the pictures is 'old' or 'new' in a recall task. The score will be calculated as a percentage of images correctly identified as 'old.'</description>
