  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to compare the efficacy of a physiologically-augmented
      breath-focused mindfulness-based intervention to reduce symptoms of dissociation that are
      associated with psychological trauma, as well as symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder
      (PTSD). The study will evaluate whether physiological augmentation produces a greater change
      in dissociative symptoms, meditative engagement and attentional control, compared to
      non-augmented mindfulness. The augmentation comprises physiological feedback in the form of a
      vibration on the wrist. Vibrations are delivered by a device that will be placed on a
      participant's arm; the device vibrates in proportion to the person's breath.

    <textblock>
      Chronically traumatized people are at much higher risk for developing dissociative symptoms,
      which are notoriously difficult to treat, particularly in the context of other posttraumatic
      stress disorder symptoms. Dissociation is a phenomenon that involves feelings of separation
      from one's body and emotional state. Mindfulness practices, including breath-focused
      mindfulness meditation, are known to be useful for improving attention to one's physiological
      state, thus enhancing a feeling of &quot;connection&quot; with one's present experience. However,
      mindfulness-based practices are naturally a challenging task for highly dissociative people.
      The present project proposes the use of a novel device that uses physiological feedback to
      boost the effects of breath-focused mindfulness meditation in this population. This device is
      an element placed on the wrist that vibrates in accordance with one's breath. The method
      capitalizes on a &quot;bottom-up&quot; neurophysiological process. We plan to recruit 60 highly
      dissociative traumatized people through an established and highly productive NIH-funded
      project. Participants will be randomly assigned to 8 sessions of either breath-focused
      mindfulness meditation or physiologically augmented breath-focused mindfulness meditation.
      Electroencephalography data will be collected during the intervention sessions, and fMRI data
      will be collected pre- and post-intervention. These methods will be used to assess whether
      the physiological augmentation is producing: increased coherence or &quot;network-like&quot; activity
      among brain regions involved with interoception (awareness of one's bodily state); selective
      attention to the breath (increased tempero-parietal EEG gamma) and meditative engagement
      (increased frontal EEG theta). Clinical and neuropsychological measures will be used to
      assess potential effects on dissociative and posttraumatic symptoms, as well as selective and
      sustained attention and mindfulness ability. A follow-up will be conducted 1 month
      post-treatment to examine sustained clinical and cognitive effects.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Multiscale Dissociation Inventory (MDI) Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and one month</time_frame>
    <description>The MDI is a 30-item self-report test of dissociative symptomology and it measures six different types of dissociative response. The scales of the MDI are disengagement, depersonalization, derealization, emotional constriction/numbing, memory disturbance, identity dissociation, and total dissociation.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Clinician Administered PTSD Scale (CAPS) Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and up to one month</time_frame>
    <description>The CAPS is a 30-item structured interview that can be used to make current and lifetime diagnosis of post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD )as well as assess PTSD symptoms over the past week. Questions also examine the onset and duration of symptoms, subjective distress, impact of symptoms on social and occupational functioning, improvement in symptoms since a previous CAPS administration, overall response validity, overall PTSD severity, and specifications for the dissociative subtype (depersonalization and derealization). The identification of an index traumatic event to serves as the basis for symptom inquiry. The full interview takes approximately 45-60 minutes to administer. A higher score indicates more severe PTSD symptoms.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in PTSD Symptom Scale (PSS) Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and up to one month</time_frame>
    <description>The PSS is a 17-item semi-structured interview that assesses the presence and severity of PTSD symptoms related to specific traumatic events in individuals with a known trauma history. PTSD symptomatology over the prior 2 weeks is assessed, yielding a continuous measure of PTSD symptom severity ranging from 0 to 51. A higher score indicates greater symptom severity.</description>

    <measure>Change in Kentucky Mindfulness Scale Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and up to one month</time_frame>
    <description>The Kentucky Mindfulness Scale is a 39-item scale that assesses skills related to what one does while practicing mindfulness. Items are rated on a 5 point Likert scale ranging from 1 (never or very rarely true) to 5 (almost always or always true). Items reflect either direct descriptions of the mindfulness skills, or they describe the absence of that skill and are reverse scored. High scores reflect more mindfulness.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Brain Activity as Assessed by the Rumination Task</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and up to one month</time_frame>
    <description>The rumination task consists of alternately viewing a fixation square for 30 seconds and personally relevant negative (&quot;ruminate&quot;) or positive (&quot;savor&quot;) vignettes for 2 minutes about topics they typically think about while dynamically rating their mood while in a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scanner. This task will examine the extent to which different breath focus probes decrease limbic engagement and increase pre-frontal control during personally relevant negative thinking.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Affective Number Stroop (ANS) Task Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and up to one month</time_frame>
    <description>During the Affective Number Stroop (ANS) Task, participants are instructed to rapidly identify the number of numbers in a given display while ignoring evocative distractor images (trauma-relevant scenes) while in a MRI scanner.The participants will be presented with positive and neutral pictures in addition to the negative trauma-relevant images.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in the Test of Variables of Attention Task (TOVA) Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and up to one month</time_frame>
    <description>This task measures facets of sustained attention, including errors of omission, which are thought to reflect inattention, and commission, which are thought to reflect impulsivity. Participants are presented with a series of numbers/non-number distractors or letters/non-letter distractors (each presented at 1 second duration). Participants are asked to press a button when they see an actual number or letter.</description>

    <intervention_name>Breath Focused Meditation</intervention_name>
    <description>During the breath focus task, participants are asked to alternatively focus their breathing (1.5 minutes of breathing and 15 seconds of rest). Participants will be asked to &quot;attend to the changing patterns of physical sensations as the breath moves in and out of your body. Focus your awareness on any sensations you may experience (e.g., your abdominal wall rising). Follow the sensations as you breathe in and all the way through until your breath leaves your body&quot;.</description>

    <intervention_name>Physiological Feedback</intervention_name>
    <description>Participants will receive breath feedback, via dynamic velocity estimates from a respiration belt, which allows an analog of breath to be felt as vibration on their wrist via a tactile transducer on a table. The transducer is tuned to produce low frequencies so there is more vibration and less of an audible component than a regular speaker would produce.</description>
