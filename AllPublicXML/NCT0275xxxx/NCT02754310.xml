  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Repeated exposure to simulated cases has been shown to improve performance, but repeating the
      same scenario may impair the ability of learners to transfer their knowledge and skills to
      slightly different situations. The objective of this study is to compare the use of repeated
      versus varied simulation cases for teaching the management of pediatric asthma exacerbation
      to 3rd year medical students.

    <measure>Management score on transfer scenario n°1</measure>
    <time_frame>One week</time_frame>
    <description>The transfer scenario n°1 is a new scenario that learners face for the first time. It is a pediatric asthma exacerbation rapidly worsening.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Management score on transfer scenario n°2</measure>
    <time_frame>One week</time_frame>
    <description>The transfer scenario n°2 is a new scenario that learners face for the first time. It is a pediatric pneumonia. Students are expected to realize that the child's presentation differs from an asthma exacerbation and should not start short-acting beta agonists nor steroids.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Management score on evaluation scenario n°1</measure>
    <time_frame>One week</time_frame>
    <description>The evaluation scenario n°1 is a scenario of a moderate asthma exacerbation not responding to treatment, used during the learning phase of both groups (3 times for the group &quot;repetition&quot; and just once for the group &quot;variation&quot;.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Management score on evaluation scenario n°2</measure>
    <time_frame>One week</time_frame>
    <description>The evaluation scenario n°2 is a scenario of a mild asthma exacerbation not responding to treatment, used during the learning phase of the &quot;variation group&quot;.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Management score on transfer scenario n°3</measure>
    <time_frame>4 months</time_frame>
    <description>The transfer scenario n°3 is a new scenario that learners face for the first time. It is a severe asthma exacerbation improving before relapsing.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Management score on transfer scenario n°4</measure>
    <time_frame>4 months</time_frame>
    <description>The transfer scenario n°4 is a new scenario that learners face for the first time. It is a pediatric laryngitis. Students are expected to realize that the child's presentation differs from an asthma exacerbation and should not start short-acting beta agonists.</description>

    <description>Participants in the varied scenarios group will learn the management of a pediatric asthma exacerbation on three different scenarios: a moderate asthma exacerbation, a mild one, and a severe one, for the same length of time than the &quot;repeated scenarios&quot; group. In this group, there is a variation of scenarios.</description>
