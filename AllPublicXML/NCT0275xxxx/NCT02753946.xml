  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of ZTI-01 (IV fosfomycin)
      as non-inferior to piperacillin/tazobactam in overall success (clinical cure and
      microbiologic eradication) for the treatment of hospitalized patients with complicated
      urinary tract infections (cUTI) or acute pyelonephritis (AP).

      This is a multi-center, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group study to evaluate the
      safety, tolerability, efficacy, and pharmacokinetics of ZTI-01 (IV fosfomycin) compared to
      piperacillin/tazobactam in the treatment of hospitalized adults with cUTI or AP. Diagnosed
      and prescreened hospitalized patients will be randomized 1:1 to receive one of two
      intravenous treatments: 6 g ZTI-01 three times daily (18g total daily dose) or 4.5 g
      piperacillin/tazobactam three times daily (13.5g total daily dose) for 7 calendar days, with
      option to extend treatment up to 14 days in patients with positive blood culture at
      pretreatment. Patients will participate in the study for approximately 26 days. Urine
      cultures will be obtained and organisms quantified for qualified patients at baseline, during
      treatment, at end of treatment (EOT), at test of cure (TOC) and late follow up visits (LFU).
      Blood cultures will be obtained at baseline and repeated if positive throughout the study.
      Safety and efficacy evaluations will include vital signs, labs, physical exams, ECG and
      overall response as evaluated by the Investigator. Pharmacokinetic samples will be obtained
      (sparse sampling) for all patients.
