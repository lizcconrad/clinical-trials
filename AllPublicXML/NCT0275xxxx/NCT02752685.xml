  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-arm open-label multi-cohort Phase II study evaluating the
      safety/tolerability and clinical activity of the combination of nab-paclitaxel and the
      antibody against programmed cell death 1 (PD-1), pembrolizumab, in patients with human
      epidermal growth factor receptor (HER-2) negative metastatic breast cancer (n=50). There will
      be two cohorts of patients consisting of a triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) cohort with
      30 subjects and a hormone receptor (HR)-positive cohort with 20 subjects. There will be an
      initial safety run-in with 12 subjects from the TNBC and HR-positive cohort (~ 6 patients
      from each cohort). If no unexpected toxicity is observed (as defined in the study protocol),
      then enrollment will continue to complete both cohorts (30 total TNBC, 20 total in HR
      positive cohort). The subjects from the run in safety part will be included in the Phase II
      analysis. Tumor expression of programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1) is not required for
      enrollment in the study, but will be assessed as possible predictive marker.

             0-1+ or 2+ with HER2/17 ratio on FISH ≤1.8) according to ASCO/CAP guidelines11,67. HR
             positive is defined as: ER/PR &gt;= 1% and HER-2 negative as per ASCO/CAP guidelines.

          -  Have received 0-2 lines of cytotoxic chemotherapy for metastatic breast cancer
             endocrine therapy and/or targeted therapy is allowed.

          -  Be willing to provide tissue from a newly obtained core or excisional biopsy of a
             tumor lesion. Newly-obtained is defined as a specimen obtained up to 6 weeks (42 days)
             prior to initiation of treatment on Day 1. Subjects for whom newly-obtained samples
             cannot be provided (e.g. inaccessible or subject safety concern) may submit an
             archived specimen only upon agreement from the PI or designee.

          -  Have a performance status of 0 or 1 on the ECOG Performance Scale. Be willing to
             undergo tissue biopsies as mandatory as per protocol for patients with biopsy

          -  Female subject of childbearing potential should have a negative urine or serum
             pregnancy within 72 hours prior to receiving the first dose of study medication. This
             applies even if the subject practices true abstinence* from heterosexual contact. If
             the urine test is positive or cannot be confirmed as negative, a serum pregnancy test
             will be required.

          -  A female subject of childbearing potential is a sexually mature women who (1) has not
             undergone hysterectomy [the surgical removal of the uterus] or bilateral oophorectomy
             [the surgical removal of both ovaries] or (2) has not been naturally postmenopausal
             for at least 24 consecutive months [i.e., has had menses at any time during the
             preceding 24 consecutive months]. The female subject must: either commit to true
             abstinence* from heterosexual contact (which must be reviewed on a monthly basis), or
             agree to use, and be able to comply with, effective contraception without interruption
             (2 methods of birth control), 28 days prior to starting IP therapy (including dose
             interruptions), and while on study medication or for a longer period if required by
             local regulations following the last dose of IP.

          -  Male subjects must practice true abstinence* or agree to use a condom during sexual
             contact with a pregnant female or female of childbearing potential starting with the
             first dose of study therapy, during dose interruptions, and for up to 6 months
             following last dose of study therapy, even if he has undergone a successful vasectomy.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Is currently participating and receiving study therapy or has participated in a study
             of an investigational agent and received study therapy or used an investigational
             device within 4 weeks of the first dose of treatment.

          -  Has a diagnosis of immunodeficiency or is receiving systemic steroid therapy or any
             other form of immunosuppressive therapy within 7 days prior to the first dose of trial
             treatment.

             Day 1 or who has not recovered (i.e., ≤ Grade 1 or at baseline) from adverse events
             due to agents administered more than 4 weeks earlier.

          -  Taxane therapy within the past 3 months (90 days) prior to study Day 1.

          -  Has had prior chemotherapy, targeted small molecule therapy, or radiation therapy
             within 2 weeks prior to study Day 1 or who has not recovered (i.e., ≤ Grade 1 or at
             baseline) from adverse events due to a previously administered agent.

             that might confound the results of the trial, interfere with the subject's
             participation for the full duration of the trial, or is not in the best interest of
             the subject to participate, in the opinion of the treating investigator.

          -  Has known psychiatric or substance abuse disorders that would interfere with
             cooperation with the requirements of the trial.

          -  Is pregnant or breastfeeding, or expecting to conceive or father children within the
             projected duration of the trial, starting with the pre-screening or screening visit
             through 120 days after the last dose of trial treatment.

          -  Has received prior therapy with an anti-PD-1, anti-PD-L1, or anti-PD-L2 agent.

          -  Has a known history of Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) (HIV 1/2 antibodies, testing
             not mandatory).

          -  Has known active Hepatitis B (e.g., HBsAg reactive) or Hepatitis C (e.g., HCV RNA
             [qualitative] is detected)
