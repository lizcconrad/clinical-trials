    <textblock>
      Anticalins® are engineered human proteins that are able to bind specific target molecules.
      The Anticalin PRS-080#022-DP to be investigated in this study is directed against hepcidin
      and is intended for the treatment of anemia of chronic disease. This Phase Ib study shall
      investigate the safety, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of a single administration of
      PRS-080#022-DP in anemic stage 5 chronic kidney disease patients undergoing hemodialysis.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a multi-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, single ascending dose
      phase Ib study in anemic stage 5 chronic kidney disease patients requiring hemodialysis.
      Eligible subjects will undergo screening assessments and PRS-080#22-DP will be administered
      by intravenous infusion. The study will consist of 3 dose cohorts of 2 mg/kg, 4 mg/kg, and 8
      mg/kg body weight with 8 subjects in each cohort. Using a standard 6+2 design, 6 subjects in
      each cohort will be randomized to PRS-080#022-DP and 2 subjects in each cohort will be
      randomized to placebo. The decision to escalate the dose will be based on an interim analysis
      of clinical safety and safety laboratory data. Safety and tolerability, pharmacokinetics,
      pharmacodynamics as well as potential immunogenicity will be investigated.
