      Verify the effect and the incidence of oral mucositis of concurrent chemoradiotherapy in
      locally advanced squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck versus concomitant cetuximab
      with radiotherapy after neoadjuvant chemotherapy.

      The predictive effect of Apurinic/apyrimidinic endonuclease 1(APE1)/ Ref-1 protein and
