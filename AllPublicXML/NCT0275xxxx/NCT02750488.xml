    <description>50 μl/ cm2 of the test article is applied directly to two sites on the skin and covered with the appropriate patch. Twenty-four (24) hours later, the patches are removed. The test sites are lightly wiped with a dry cloth/tissue and 3μl/ cm2 of test article is reapplied directly to the skin of the test site designated for irradiation, and lightly spread over the test site. Forty-eight (48) hours later the procedure is repeated to the same test sites. This process is repeated twice weekly for a total of six exposures.</description>
