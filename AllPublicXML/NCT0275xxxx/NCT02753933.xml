  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to evaluate whether direct access from General Practitioners (GPs) to
      Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) for patients with chronic headache decreases overall NHS
      costs and increases patient satisfaction compared to clinical practice with referral to
      Neurology Services.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Headache is the most common symptom reported in the community, affecting more than 90% of the
      population at some point in their lifetime. Despite the low level of referrals to secondary
      care (as most patients tend to be managed within primary care), the absolute number of
      headache episodes (due to its high prevalence) makes headache the most frequently listed
      reason for referral to the Neurologist and thus, utilises precious capacity that is severely
      constrained.

      In order to support future management of this chronic condition, this study aims to evaluate
      existing clinical pathways in the management of patients with chronic headache - either
      referral to the Neurology Department or direct access to Imaging. Participants will be
      followed-up for a period of 12 months after the initial Secondary Care episode (either an MRI
      scan or Neurology appointment). Costs from the NHS perspective and self-perceived patient
      quality of life will be assessed and cost per patient and cost-effectiveness analyses will be
      performed.
