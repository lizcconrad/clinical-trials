  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Female participants with an episode of late-life depression (LLD) and age-matched control
      participants with no history of mental disorder will attend a one hour Magnetic Resonance
      Imaging (MRI). A 3 Tesla MRI scanner will be used to measure levels of glutathione (GSH) in
      the brain via magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H MRS).

    <textblock>
      This is a pilot/feasibility, single-centre, open-label, cross-sectional study. Research
      participants will be women aged 60 to 85. This study seeks to recruit 26 female participants;
      13 participants with a confirmed diagnosis of late-life depression and 13 control
      participants with no history of mental illness. This pilot study will be used to determine if
      a larger Randomized Controlled Trial is feasible.

      The role of antioxidant capacity in Late Life Depression (LLD) has thus far been inadequately
      assessed, providing the investigators with a timely opportunity to spearhead such an
      investigation. The results of this pilot study, and subsequent large-scale studies, will
      allow the investigators to identify novel targets for therapeutic intervention in LLD.

    <description>Using the MEGA-PRESS pulse sequence, high resolution T1-weighted sagittal anatomic images covering the brain using an inversion-prepared MP-RAGE pulse sequence to produce high grey/white matter contrast will be acquired. These will be used to localize the spectroscopy voxel in the vmPFC. Magnetic field homogeneity will be optimized in the voxel using an automated map shimming procedure. MEGA-PRESS spectra will be acquired to detect the glutathione cysteinyl ÃŸ-CH2 peak at 2.95 ppm with the editing pulse set at the j-coupled a-CH resonance at 4.95 ppm. A reference unsuppressed water spectrum will be acquired for absolute quantification. Metabolite spectra will be fitted in the time domain using a Levenberg-Marquardt least squares minimization routine. The contribution of each metabolite to the in-vivo spectrum can be scaled to the water signal intensity from within the voxel of interest to obtain an absolute measurement of metabolite concentration.</description>
