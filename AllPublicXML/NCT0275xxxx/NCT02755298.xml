      The study seeks primarily to determine the chronic clinical effect of AZA on exercise
      capacity (6MWD) compared to placebo.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Pulmonary hypertension (PH) of various etiologies causes dyspnea, impairs exercise
      performance and is associated with reduced quality of life (QoL) and survival. Treatment
      options include therapy for any underlying causes, pulmonary vasodilator drugs, oxygen and,
      in selected cases, pulmonary endarterectomy or lung transplantation. Unfortunately, PH
      specific drugs are expensive, associated with side effects and even combined pharmacological
      treatment is often not sufficient to achieve clinical benefits. Therefore, novel therapeutic
      drugs are needed. We have recently demonstrated that sleep related breathing disorders, which
      are common in PH patients, can be improved by both nocturnal oxygen therapy and acetazolamide
      (AZA). AZA is a carbonic anhydrase (CA) inhibitor that acts as a respiratory stimulant
      thereby improving oxygenation and possibly PH. There are even data suggesting that
      CA-inhibitors have a direct pulmonary vasodilator effect. However, the potential role of AZA
      in the treatment of PH has not been conclusively studied. Therefore, the purpose of the
      current project is to investigate, the chronic clinical effects of AZA in PH patients.
