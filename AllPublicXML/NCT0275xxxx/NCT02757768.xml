      The purpose of the study is to assess the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of mirabegron
      versus placebo in men with overactive bladder (OAB) symptoms while taking tamsulosin
      hydrochloride for lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) due to Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia
      (BPH).

      At Screening (Visit 1), subjects will enter into a 4-week open label tamsulosin hydrochloride
      0.4 mg QD run-in period prior to being randomized into the 12-week double-blind treatment
      period (Visit 2). At conclusion of the 4-week tamsulosin hydrochloride run-in period,
      subjects will complete a 3-day diary just prior to Baseline (Visit 2). Approximately 7 days
      prior to Visit 2 subjects will receive a phone call reminding them about the diary and to
      answer any questions.

      If subjects meet all entry criteria at the end of the tamsulosin hydrochloride run-in period,
      subjects will be randomized to 1 of 2 treatment groups (mirabegron or placebo) for 12 weeks
      of treatment in addition to the continuation of tamsulosin hydrochloride 0.4 mg QD. Those
      subjects randomized to mirabegron will start at 25 mg and will increase to 50 mg after 4
      weeks. Those subjects randomized to placebo will start blinded product matched to the
      mirabegron 25 mg tablet and will increase to blinded product matched to 50 mirabegron after 4
      weeks. Once a subject has increased dose, the subject will remain on that dose for the
      remainder of the study unless for safety reasons is required to discontinue study drug.

      A training diary will be completed in the first 2 weeks of the tamsulosin hydrochloride
      run-in period. During this evaluation period at least one telephone contact will take place
      with the subject. Diaries will be completed at home, using the electronic patient-reported
      outcome (ePRO) device, for 3 consecutive days prior to each visit: Baseline (Visit 2), Week 4
      (Visit 3), Week 8 (Visit 4), and Week 12/End of Treatment (Visit 5). Site staff will contact
      the subject approximately 7 days prior to the scheduled visit to remind the subject to
      complete the electronic diary, review completion instruction and review changes to
      concomitant medications and adverse events (if applicable).

      Three days before Visits 2 (Baseline), 3 (Week 4), 4 (Week 8), and 5 (Week 12), subjects will
      complete a 3-day diary, using the ePRO device in which the subject will record micturition
      frequency, urgency (PPIUS), incontinence and volume voided. In addition, the diary will
      capture morning and evening blood pressure and pulse rate measurements via Home Blood
      Pressure Monitoring (HBPM). At Visit 1, International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS) will be
      completed. At Visits 2, 3, 4, and 5, subjects will complete the IPSS, EQ-5D-5L, OAB-q, PPBC,
      and TS-VAS. Maximum urinary flow (Qmax) will be measured at Visit 1 (Screening/tamsulosin
      hydrochloride run-in) and Visit 5 (Week 12/End of Treatment). Post-void residual volume (PVR)
      will be assessed at Screening/tamsulosin hydrochloride run-in (Visit 1), Baseline (Visit 2)
      and at Week 4 (Visit 3), Week 8 (Visit 4), and Week 12/End of Treatment (Visit 5). A
      follow-up phone call (Visit 6) will be conducted 4-weeks after End of Treatment (Visit 5).
      Total study participation is approximately 20 weeks.
