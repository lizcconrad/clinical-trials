    <description>50 μl/cm*2 or 0.05 gm/cm*2 of each test product is applied to duplicate skin sites (approximately 2 x 2 cm each). After the test articles have dried for 5 to 15 min, the sites are covered by the appropriate patch.24 hours later, the set of patches covering the product are removed. Three (3) μl/ cm2 or 0.003 gm/cm*2 of the test product is reapplied to the test site, air dried for 5 to 15 minutes for volatilization and then the test site is exposed to UVA radiation.</description>
