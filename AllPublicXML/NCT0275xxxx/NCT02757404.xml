        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Male or female subject aged over 20.

          2. Subjects who has grade 1 + and more spasticity at least one of upper limb muscles as
             measured on Modified Ashworth Scale after stroke.

          3. Subjects who was diagnosed stroke at least 1 month prior to study participation.

          4. Subjects or legal representatives who voluntarily decided the participation of the
             study and signed the informed consent.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Subjects who had spinal injuries to be a factor of spasticity except for stroke prior
             to study enrollment.

          2. Subjects with allergy or hypersensitivity to the Botulinum Toxin.

          3. Subjects who have changed the muscle relaxant taking for treatment within past 4 weeks
             prior to study participation.

          4. Subjects who have taken injection treatments using alcohol or phenol in upper limb
             within past 6 months prior to study participation.

          5. Subjects with general neuromuscular synaptic disorder(e.g. Myasthenia gravis,
             Lambert-Eaton syndrome, Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis).

          6. Subjects who have been injected with botulinum toxin within past 3 months before the
             injection.

          7. Subjects who are pregnant or lactating of disagreed to avoid pregnancy during 3 months
             study period.

          8. Subjects who are scheduled to take part in other clinical trial during the study
             period.

          9. Patients who are not eligible for this study at the medical discretion of the
