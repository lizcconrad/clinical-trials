  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this open-label study, eligible and consenting adult patients admitted to the hospital for
      critical care that have acute severe anemia, defined as a blood hemoglobin level ≤ 5 g/dL,
      but who are unwilling or unable to receive red blood cell (RBC) transfusion, will receive one
      or more infusions of SANGUINATE as are deemed necessary by the Investigator for survival of
      the acute anemic episode.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Data collection for each patient during the in-patient portion of the study will be required
      for up to a maximum of 14 days while under critical care, with additional collection of
      safety-related findings at 7 days and 14 days after the last infusion of SANGUINATE. Each
      patient will thus have up to 28 days participation in the trial.

      A minimum of 100 subjects are to be enrolled and to receive at least one infusion of
      SANGUINATE, with 14-day follow-up after the last infusion.

      Because of the life-threatening effects of severe anemia, it is expected that all patients in
      this trial will receive care within a critical care facility (may be called intensive care or
      some similar name), wherein all patients will have real-time monitoring of vital signs and
      ECG (e.g., by telemetry) before, during, and after all study drug infusions.
