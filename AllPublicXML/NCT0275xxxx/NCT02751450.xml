    <textblock>
      This single centre, comparative design study will be used to investigate the efficacy of an
      experimental stannous fluoride containing dentifrice in relieving dentinal hypersensitivity
      (DH) after short term use compared with a standard fluoride dentifrice.

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Schiff Sensitivity Score on Day 3</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to Day 3</time_frame>
    <description>The examiner assessed the participant's response to an evaporative air stimulus for each tooth using the Schiff Sensitivity Scale which was scored as follows - 0: Participant does not respond to air stimulation; 1: Participant responded to air stimulus but does not request discontinuation of stimulus; 2: Participant responded to air stimulus and requests discontinuation or moves from stimulus; 3: Participant responded to stimulus, considered stimulus to be painful, and requested discontinuation of the stimulus. A reduction in Schiff Sensitivity score was indicative of an improvement in sensitivity.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in Tactile Threshold Post First Treatment by Direct Application</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to 60 seconds post first treatment</time_frame>
    <description>The examiner assessed the response to tactile sensitivity using a Yeaple probe which allowed application of a known force to the dentin surface, starting at 10g and rising in increments of 10g until the tactile threshold or maximum force was reached. The tactile threshold for each tooth was determined by asking the participant whether the sensation caused discomfort. The pressure setting at which the participant gives two consecutive 'yes' responses was recorded as the tactile threshold. The higher the tactile threshold, the less sensitive the tooth. At baseline, the maximum force used was 20g; at all subsequent visits, it was 80g.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Schiff Sensitivity Score on Day 3</title>
        <description>The examiner assessed the participant's response to an evaporative air stimulus for each tooth using the Schiff Sensitivity Scale which was scored as follows - 0: Participant does not respond to air stimulation; 1: Participant responded to air stimulus but does not request discontinuation of stimulus; 2: Participant responded to air stimulus and requests discontinuation or moves from stimulus; 3: Participant responded to stimulus, considered stimulus to be painful, and requested discontinuation of the stimulus. A reduction in Schiff Sensitivity score was indicative of an improvement in sensitivity.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Tactile Threshold Post First Treatment by Direct Application</title>
        <description>The examiner assessed the response to tactile sensitivity using a Yeaple probe which allowed application of a known force to the dentin surface, starting at 10g and rising in increments of 10g until the tactile threshold or maximum force was reached. The tactile threshold for each tooth was determined by asking the participant whether the sensation caused discomfort. The pressure setting at which the participant gives two consecutive 'yes' responses was recorded as the tactile threshold. The higher the tactile threshold, the less sensitive the tooth. At baseline, the maximum force used was 20g; at all subsequent visits, it was 80g.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Tactile Threshold on Day 3</title>
        <description>The examiner assessed the response to tactile sensitivity using a Yeaple probe which allowed application of a known force to the dentin surface, starting at 10g and rising in increments of 10g until the tactile threshold or maximum force was reached. The tactile threshold for each tooth was determined by asking the participant whether the sensation caused discomfort. The pressure setting at which the participant gives two consecutive 'yes' responses was recorded as the tactile threshold. The higher the tactile threshold, the less sensitive the tooth. At baseline, the maximum force used was 20g; at all subsequent visits, it was 80g.</description>

            <description>Experimental: Participants were instructed to apply a pea-sized dose of experimental dentifrice containing 0.454% w/w stannous fluoride (1100 ppm fluoride) to each of the two qualifying teeth using their finger by direct application and gently rubbing into the tooth’s cervical margin for the allocated time. No rinsing was permitted after direct application with treatment. Participants then brushed their whole mouth for at least 1 minute and were permitted to rinse with 5ml tap water (room temperature) for 5 seconds maximum after brushing.</description>
