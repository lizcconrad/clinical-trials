  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Low-volume high-intensity interval exercise training may improve aspects of health and
      fitness in young people, but the effect of this type of exercise on quality of life has yet
      to be assessed. The investigators aim to examine the effect of a 4-week school-based
      low-volume high-intensity interval training programme (called the Fun Fast Interval Training
      [FFIT] activity project) on physical fitness and quality of life in adolescent school pupils.
      Approximately 145 English adolescents aged 11-12 years will be approached and invited to take
      part in the study. Participants will be healthy female volunteers, recruited from one school
      in Northeast England. Using a non-randomised design, one school year group will be assigned
      to take part in the intervention, and a second year group assigned to the control
      condition.Those in the intervention group will complete a 4-week school-based high-intensity
      interval exercise training programme. The intervention will take place twice per week, and
      comprise of 6-8 repetitions of 45 s maximal effort exercise (boxing, running, soccer and
      basketball drills), each interspersed with 90-s rest. Participants will be encouraged to work
      maximally during the 45-s repetitions. Control participants will be instructed not to change
      their lifestyle, dietary or physical activity habits during the intervention period, and
      maintain their normal school physical education routine. Study outcomes will be 20 m shuttle
      run test performance, health-related quality of life, standing broad jump performance, hand
      dynamometer performance, waist circumference and 10 m and 20 m sprint performance.
