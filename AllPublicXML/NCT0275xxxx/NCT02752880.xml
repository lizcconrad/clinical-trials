  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Type 2 diabetes mellitus is a chronic metabolic disease that seriously affects patients
      worldwide, and it is always among the top 10 causes of death in Taiwan. To date, still many
      patients who take more than three kinds of oral hypoglycemic agents could not effectively
      control their glycohemoglobin levels in clinics. Hypoglycemia as well as weight gain are
      common side effect with insulin therapy, and many patients in Taiwan are not willing to
      receive insulin injection. It is common for diabetic patients treated with Chinese herbal
      medicine in China currently, and some therapeutic effects have been published in
      international journals. In this study, we will evaluate whether Chinese herbal medicine, YH1,
      enhances the glycemic control and is safe as add-on medication in poorly controlled type 2
      diabetes patients.

      A total of 80 poorly controlled type 2 diabetes patients with glycohemoglobin ≥ 7% from
      Endocrinology and Metabolism clinics or Internal Chinese Medicine clinics will be enrolled in
      this randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trial. Subjects will be randomly assigned to
      receive either YH1 (6 g) or the placebo three times per day for 12 consecutive weeks. All
      subjects in both groups will also continuously receive their oral hypoglycemic agents without
      any dose or medicine change. During this 12-week period, the glycohemoglobin, fasting plasma
      glucose, 2h postprandial glucose, waist circumference, body weight, and body mass index will
      be assessed. In addition, insulin resistance, β -cell function, lipid profile, liver and
      renal function will also be evaluated. Independent statisticians will perform the data
      analysis at the end of the trial.
