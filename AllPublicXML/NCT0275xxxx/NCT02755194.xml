  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Some medications taken by the breastfeeding women are excreted into milk, posing a potential
      risk of toxicity to the infant. The first line of evidence required for toxicity risk
      assessment is prediction of drug levels in milk. However, pharmacokinetic (PK) information of
      drug excretion into milk is largely lacking, or limited to data from case reports. This makes
      it difficult to provide population-level prediction of drug levels in milk. The lack of data
      on this topic jeopardizes not only maternal adherence to drug therapy during breastfeeding
      but also establishment of breastfeeding, even if the drug is considered safe during nursing.
      Clearly, this clinical problem in drug safety is an important women's health issue, affecting
      both mother and infant. &quot;Drugs in Lactation&quot; Analysis Consortium (DLAC) is a &quot;drug-in-milk&quot;
      monitoring network, which is designed as a platform for efficient collection of patient milk
      samples in a real world setting to generate population predictions of drug excretion levels
      into human milk.

      OVERARCHING GOAL OF DLAC:

      To establish a post-marketing &quot;drug-in-milk&quot; monitoring system for nursing women who are
      prescribed and using medications. Drugs in Lactation Analysis Consortium (DLAC) will provide
      risk assessment data and tools for toxicity detection in the form of population estimates and
      variations of drug levels in mother's milk and infant plasma for several common medications
      in a real world setting.

      SPECIFIC OBJECTIVES:

        -  To generate data on drug levels in breast milk

        -  To develop a population pharmacokinetic model describing drug levels in milk

        -  To simulate/predict drug levels in milk in a population, based on the pop PK model

        -  To develop a physiologically-based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) model describing drug levels
           in infant serum

        -  To screen the breastfed infants of mothers on the study drugs for general health
           condition (medical issues, developmental milestones)

      SCOPE AND RATIONALE:

      Information on the extent of drug excretion into mother's milk is lacking, mainly due to the
      following two reasons: 1) nursing women are excluded from drug trials; 2) ethical and
      practical difficulties in conducting intensive-sampling PK studies in the breastfeeding
      mothers. Even if data exist, they are based on small numbers of patients, and it is difficult
      to translate the information into population estimates of drug levels in milk. DLAC is
      developed as a novel drug safety network using population PK (popPK) modeling approach, which
      allows population-level PK parameter estimation, modeling and simulation based on a scheme of
      sparse sampling per individual, systematically collected from a large number of nursing women
      on medication in real world setting. This approach will provide population risk estimates as
      probability distribution of reaching certain drug level in milk and plasma. Equipped with a
      versatile drug analysis core and a popPK modeling and simulation unit, DLAC will be able to
      generate PK estimates of a population in the context of breastfeeding.

    <description>Robust parameter estimates from pop PK modelling usually require samples from &gt;30-50 individuals. Therefore, an average of 4 years is considered as the time frame, so that the required numbers of samples for each drug can be collected for population PK analysis and modelling.</description>
