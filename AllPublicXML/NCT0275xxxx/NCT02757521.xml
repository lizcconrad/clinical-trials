    <textblock>
      Investigators will study approximately 64 patients with Treatment-Resistant Bipolar
      Depressive Disorder, defined as a failure of at least 1 antidepressants in the current
      depressive episode and 2 lifetime medication failures. The study will last approximately 6 to
      8 weeks, involving randomization into one of two treatment groups receiving 3 one hour long
      inhalation treatments over a week.

      Investigators will study approximately 64 patients with Treatment-Resistant Bipolar
      Depressive Disorder, defined as a failure of at least 1 antidepressants in the current
      depressive episode and 2 lifetime medication failures. The study will last approximately 6 to
      8 weeks, involving randomization into one of two treatment groups receiving 3 one hour long
      inhalation treatments over a week. Post-treatment assessments follow each inhalation
      treatment and are conducted 1 week and 2 weeks following the final inhalation treatment.
      Patients are then randomized again into the Second Stage of the study, involving the same
      treatment and post-treatment schedule as the First Stage detailed above.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Adults 18-65 years of age

          -  Treatment-resistant bipolar depressive disorder without psychosis and a MADRS baseline
             score of &gt;20. All patients must have history of being on a serum-verified (at time of
             entry into study) mood stabilizer [lithium at 0.5-1.2mEq/L; or valproic acid,
             50-125mcg/ml] for 4 weeks prior to entry into the study and remain on this mood
             stabilizer during the course of the trial. Further, subjects will have failed two
             adequate dose/duration antidepressant courses in their lifetime, including one in the
             current depressive episode (verified by Antidepressant Treatment History Form).

          -  Good command of the English language

          -  Active or recent substance abuse or dependence (in remission at least 1 year prior to
             the study; exception = nicotine use disorders)

          -  A diagnosis of personality disorder that may interfere with the patient's ability to
             improve on nitrous oxide as determined by study investigator

          -  Acute medical illness that may pose subject at risk during nitrous oxide
             administration (neurological disorders or medical disorders including dementia,
             stroke, encephalopathy, Parkinson's Disease, brain tumors, multiple sclerosis, seizure
             disorder, severe cardiac disease, any disease known to affect drug metabolism and
             excretion, i.e. renal or liver disease) per P.I. discretion

          -  Active suicidal intention (inability to contract for safety)

          -  Active psychotic symptoms

          -  Patients with significant pulmonary disease and/or requiring supplemental oxygen

          -  Contraindication against the use of nitrous oxide: pneumothorax; bowel obstruction;
             middle ear occlusion; elevated intracranial pressure; chronic cobalamin and/or folate
             deficiency treated with folic acid or vitamin B12; pregnant patients; breastfeeding
