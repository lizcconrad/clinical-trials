  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Bedrest and lack of mobility in the inpatient hospital setting hastens the functional decline
      of elderly patients and is associated with increased risk of complications such as falls,
      delirium, venous thrombosis, and skin breakdown. These adverse health effects drive increased
      cost as patients spend additional time in both the acute (hospital) and post-acute care
      settings. Physical activity is thus widely recognized as an important factor for improving
      outcomes in hospitalized patients; however, numerous challenges to its implementation exist.
      Specifically, although it has been found that with small increases in physical activity such
      as increasing number of steps by only 600 daily for inpatients, length of stay can be reduced
      by nearly 2 days, usual care in many hospitals, including the Cleveland Clinic, does not
      include exercise, and physicians do not all regularly order physical activity for their
      hospitalized patients. Even when activity is recommended or ordered, compliance and execution
      of the orders has been spotty and/or negligible. It is therefore clear that the current
      system for the provision of ambulation is ineffective. The investigators hypothesize that a
      graded protocol of ambulation which can be implemented by a dedicated patient care nursing
      assistant (PCNA) multiple times daily will provide significant benefit to patients without
      the labor and cost requirements of full-time nursing and physical therapy expertise. The
      objective of this study is to assess the feasibility and effectiveness of dedicated
      ambulator-assisted physical activity in elderly inpatients. The primary hypothesis is that an
      ambulator-assisted intervention for hospitalized elderly inpatients will prove feasible and
      may result in improved hospital outcomes, including less need for inpatient rehabilitation
      and shorter length of stay in the hospital. This study will provide pilot data for a larger
      randomized trial.

      Specific Aims

      Aim 1: To determine the feasibility of implementing an ambulator-assisted exercise
      intervention in elderly patients on an inpatient medicine service.

      The investigators will work closely with the physical therapy team to develop a graded
      ambulation protocol that can be implemented multiple times daily per enrolled patient by a
      PCNA. Investigators will work closely with the medicine units to recruit eligible patients
      and assess protocol implementation including recruitment, patient cooperation, and
      scheduling.

      Aim 2: To determine the effects of an ambulator-assisted exercise intervention on discharge
      disposition, length of stay and cost.

      The investigators will measure the proportion of patients in the intervention and usual care
      group who are discharged to home vs. acute rehabilitation facilities. Length of stay and cost
      will be obtained from hospital billing records.

      Research Strategy

      The investigators propose the development of a feasible program to assist in improving the
      physical capacity of elderly inpatients. Such improvements may translate to cost savings in
      the form of decreased length of stay, improved discharge disposition, and fewer
      hospital-related complications, but establishing that is not the purpose of this study. The
      investigators propose that the most feasible and cost-effective implementation of such a
      program will utilize a patient care nursing assistant (PCNA) dedicated to carrying out a
      graded ambulation protocol in eligible patients multiple times daily. A simple and
      standardized protocol for ambulation will reduce the need for the expertise of a dedicated
      physical therapist. Additionally, utilizing an existing mechanism for assessing baseline
      functional capacity, the 6-Clicks score, will eliminate the time and personnel requirements
      for evaluation of patient eligibility. This score has been validated as a mechanism to assess
      patient mobility limitations in an acute care setting and is currently used on all patients
      seen by physical therapy on the inpatient medicine services.

      This pilot study will enable the investigators to identify which patients would tolerate the
      intervention and what degree of participation would be meaningful to improve the outcomes
      measured. The study will begin by enrolling patients with 6-Clicks scores of 16-20, as these
      patients will experience the greatest benefit from an ambulation protocol. At present, such
      patients do not receive any PT intervention and ambulation by nurses occurs only sporadically
      as time allows. Additionally, the pilot will help to bring clarity to the direct impact of
      aggressive mobilization of medical inpatients on important outcomes that are directly tied to
      healthcare cost. Results of this work will inform feasibility and power calculations for a
      larger randomized trial. Results of that trial could directly impact the approach to the
      medical inpatient in terms of prioritizing and resourcing mobilization strategies.

      Preliminary findings from this pilot study demonstrating the feasibility of a dedicated
      ambulator-assisted physical activity protocol and its potential impact on hospital outcomes
      will provide the justification for external funding of a larger randomized clinical trial.
      Lessons learned from the pilot study will allow us to optimize the ambulation protocol and
      target population for a larger study. Such a study would investigate the effect of the
      ambulator-assisted physical activity protocol on patient mobility associated health care
      costs. This work could shift the current paradigm that aggressive mobilization is reserved
      for post-acute care settings and could serve as a model for improving the value of care
      provided to elderly patients in acute care facilities.

    <description>Patients randomized to the intervention group will be asked to participate in the ambulation protocol outlined by the PT staff 3 times daily under the supervision of the dedicated ambulator PCNA. This protocol will involve four exercise levels (mobilization, standing, walking, stairs) that may be implemented depending on the current physical capacity of the patient. The cohort of patients randomized to &quot;ambulator protocol&quot; will also receive the usual care by primary nursing.
In an effort to best characterize mobility in these patients, the team will collect Braden Scale Activity data from the electronic health record, and provide each patient a mobility tracking device to directly record daily steps taken while the patient is in the hospital. Daily step counts will be collected on a weekly basis from each device. The Braden Scale is entered by nursing on each patient at least daily and measures current activity level on a 4-point scale.</description>
