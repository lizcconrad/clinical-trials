  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It is a single-center, prospective, randomized and controlled study focused in microsurgical
      autologous breast reconstruction. It involves applying indocyanine green (ICG) angiography
      for the study of the vascularization of DIEP flaps. The aim of the study is to determine
      whether there are differences in complications and aesthetic results when ICG is used to
      discard the poorly vascularized areas of the flap. The study includes adult women undergoing
      unilateral DIEP flap breast reconstruction. The calculated sample size is 60 patients. There
      are two groups. In group 1, the investigators use the usual clinical criteria to discard the
      poorly vascularized areas of the flap. In group 2, the investigators use the ICG to shape the
      flap.

    <description>After microvascular anastomosis is performed, the investigators clinically assess flap vascularization and the well vascularized tissue is marked by means of a dermographic pencil. Then the investigators administer 0,2mg/kg of ICG intravenously. The vascularization of the flap is also checked by means of the Photo Dynamic Eye (Pulsion Medical System) but finally the decision of discarding the poorly vascularized areas of the flap is made by clinical assessment.</description>
