    <textblock>
      The primer aim of the study was to determine serum and gingival crevicular fluid (GCF)
      endocan levels in periodontal diseases pathogenesis supported with vascular endothelial
      growth factor (VEGF) and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) levels.

      The study consist of three groups: periodontally healthy individuals (group 1; n = 20),
      individuals with generalized chronic periodontitis (group 2; n = 20), the same patients with
      chronic periodontitis after they had been treated with scaling and root planing (SRP) were
      considered as Group 3. Clinical measurements were recorded; GCF and serum samples were
      obtained from each participant before and 6 weeks after therapy. Endocan, VEGF-A and TNF-α
      levels were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.
