    <description>Subjects in the inspiratory muscle training (IMT) group will perform loaded deep breathing exercise at 6 breaths/min using BreatheMaxยฎ device. The IMT protocol at 6 breathing rate (inspiratory time = 4 seconds and expiratory time = 6 seconds) with load at 25 percent of MIP for eighth weeks.
The pressure will be control by pressure manometer and duty cycle are control by subjects count duration for inspiration and expiration during training. The program will perform at home for 10 breaths/min/set, 6 sets/day with at least 1 minutes rest between sessions, 7 days/week for 8 weeks</description>

    <description>Subjects in the control (CON) group will perform breathing exercise with inspiratory load at 2 cmH2O at 6 breathing rate using one BreatheMAXยฎ device. The pressure will be control by pressure manometer and duty cycle are control by subjects count duration for inspiration and expiration during training. The program will perform at home for 10 breaths/min/set, 6 sets/day with at least 1 minutes rest between sessions, 7 days/week for 8 weeks</description>
