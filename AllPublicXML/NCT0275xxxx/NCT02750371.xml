  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Several studies showed that radiotherapy as brain tumors treatment may affect cognition. It
      was observed that durable memory impairments could arise at irradiated patients if
      radiotherapy is applied on medial temporal lobes.

      However, results concerned studies of anterograde memory and none, this day, estimates the
      impact of radiotherapy on autobiographical memory which also involves hippocampus.

      The aim of this study is to evaluate effects of cavernous sinus or sellar region irradiation
      on autobiographical memory.

      Thirty 35 to 65 years old patients, with cavernous sinus meningioma or pituitary adenoma for
      who radiotherapy is indicated will be recruited.

      Several studies showed that radiotherapy as brain tumors treatment may affect cognition. It
      was observed that durable memory impairments could arise at irradiated patients if
      radiotherapy is applied on medial temporal lobes. However, results concerned studies of
      anterograde memory and none, this day, estimates the impact of radiotherapy on
      autobiographical memory which also involves hippocampus, as specified in Nadel and Moscovitch
      model, the Multiple Trace Theory.

      Autobiographical memory impairment issue is fundamental for identity construction. Prevent
      those impairments is important to quality of life improvement after such treatments.

      The aim of this study is to evaluate effects of cavernous sinus or sellar region irradiation
      on autobiographical memory.

      A pilot study was conducted with 10 patients affected by left cavernous sinus meningioma
      divided in two groups: the first one with untreated patients and the second one with patients
      who received cavernous sinus irradiation between 2 and 5 years before pilot study. This study
      indicated autobiographical memory deterioration in two groups and a worsening in treated
      group. Study limits did not allow us to draw conclusions. That is why, sample size will be
      extended and patients with cavernous sinus meningioma or pituitary adenoma will be recruited
      because of proximity between cavernous sinus, pituitary gland and hippocampus. Investigators
      wish to recruit 30 patients with cavernous sinus and meningioma.

      Investigators hope for confirm our results from pilot study.
