  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The sample of this randomized controlled trial was obtained in the Cardiovascular Prevention
      and Rehabilitation Unit, of the Hospital Centre of Porto, Santo Antonio General Hospital. The
      target population was individuals who have completed the training phase of cardiovascular
      rehabilitation program, volunteers and referenced by the responsible for the service.

      This study has as main objective to analyze the influence of a specific exercise program,
      maintenance phase of cardiovascular rehabilitation , in home care context, for a period of 6
      months, using a virtual format (computer and Kinect) or a conventional format (paper manual)
      in subjects with coronary artery disease. It was intended to analyze the immediate effect of
      exercise program on body composition and food consumption patterns, functional muscle
      strength of lower limb, level of physical activity: total volume of activity as well as the
      profile of this intensity, kyphotic index, balance, cognitive and executive function, as well
      as in the quality of life.

      The aim is also to examine the effects, approximately 3 months after the end of the exercise
      program, in the lipid profile, the level of physical activity: total volume of activity as
      well as the profile of this intensity and cardiovascular fitness: maximum double product ;
      metabolic equivalents; and proof and recovery time.

      The individuals were distributed at random, every 3 individuals, using the capabilities of
      Microsoft Excel 2010 RANDBETWEEN command, by three groups: the experimental group 1- a
      cardiovascular rehabilitation program, in home care context, using a computer and Kinect,
      virtual format, the experimental group 2- in cardiovascular rehabilitation program, in home
      care context, using a paper-based manual, conventional format, and control group-only subject
      to education for cardiovascular risk factors.

      The program defined 3 training sessions per week. The rehabilitation program was oriented by
      the guidelines for exercise prescription.

      Participants perform the a program of specific exercises independently and individually, with
      remote supervision, using communication (phone, email, etc.) and a routine scheduled
      individual meetings.

    <description>Participants perform a program of specific exercises. The exercise protocol was adapted to the home context and presented two progressive levels of intensity of exercise, having the second level being introduced after 3 months. The exercise protocol was performed at a moderate intensity, initiated, using data from the stress test, maximal heart rate, the Karvonnen formula, with 65% of the reserve heart rate, progressing for 70%.
It was given the educational component about the control of cardiovascular risk factors and was encouraged to carry out the daily walks.</description>
