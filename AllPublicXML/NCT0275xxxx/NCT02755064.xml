  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      With this study, the investigators hoped to learn if the rate at which food empties from the
      stomach affects blood sugar values. Using data from this study, we hope to improve our
      ability to control blood sugars in individuals with type 1 diabetes mellitus.

      The study comprised 3 outpatient visits over a period of 11 days. Safety lab test were
      performed at the screening visit. At each visit, GE was evaluated by 13C-spirulina breath
      tests.

      Phase 1:

      After the baseline assessment (GE1), the second and third GE tests were performed during
      treatment with intravenous (GE2) and oral erythromycin (GE3) or placebo. Subject arrived
      fasting at each study visit. Prior to gastric emptying study, there was placement of an
      intravenous line. Subject continued to take insulin and other medications as usual. Subjects
      were required to do finger-stick glucose readings 4 times a day or as instructed by their
      physician. Subjects were provided with a log sheet to keep track of meal times, insulin
      dosing and times, glucose readings, and activities. Continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) and
      gastric emptying were evaluated for the duration of the study (11 days) and thrice
      respectively. GE was evaluated at baseline (GE1) and after randomized to intravenous saline,
      erythromycin (2 mg/kg) or erythromycin (3 mg/kg).

      Phase 2:

      Thereafter, patients were randomized to erythromycin ethyl succinate suspension (250 mg tid)
      or placebo for a total period of 7 days. GE3 was preferably performed on day 7, after oral
      erythromycin or placebo was started.

      An EKG was performed at baseline to identify (and exclude) patients who have
      contraindications to erythromycin. An EKG was also repeated at the end of the study, i.e., on
      GE3 for safety. No change to insulin (apart from those that patients do with their self
      management skills) or other medications was made during this research study.

The subject consumed the test meal containing 13C-Spirulina in no more than 10 minutes. Breath samples were collected at baseline obtained upon completion of the meal and at 15, 30, 45, 60, 90, 120, 150, 180, and 240 minute time points. Thereafter, an infusion of 1.5 mg/kg was given over the next 50 min with the same infusion pump.</description>
