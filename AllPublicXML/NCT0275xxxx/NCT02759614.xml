    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, open-label, controlled, multicenter, Phase III study. Patients will be
      randomly assigned to treatment group (1:1) through a dynamic randomization process with use
      of the following stratification factors: sex (female/male), disease stage (stage IIIb vs.
      stage IV vs. recurrence), and EGFR gene mutation (exon 19 deletion vs. exon 21 L858R).

      An independent review committee (IRC) will be used to determine the response based study
      endpoints. IRC membership and procedures will be detailed in an IRC charter.

      A data safety monitoring board (DSMB) will be used in this study. DSMB is an independent body
      and will be responsible for reviewing safety data of the study. DSMB membership and
      procedures will be detailed in a separate DSMB document.

      Information regarding the nature and the duration of subsequent treatment will be collected.
