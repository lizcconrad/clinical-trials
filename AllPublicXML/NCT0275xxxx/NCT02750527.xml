      The Fr1dolin-Study will be presented to the parents of ca. 320,000 children living in Lower
      Saxony, Germany. The recruitment of subjects, collection of written consent, the capillary
      blood sample and the screening questionnaire will be done by the registered pediatricians in
      their local medical practices.

      After study enrolment 200 µl of capillary blood are be taken from the subject and are sent
      pseudo-anonymized to the lab. LDL-C and the diabetes-associated antibodies are identified.
      Based on the results a second blood sample will be required. In case of pre-type-1 diabetes
      or signs for a familial hypercholesterolemia the pediatrician will be informed. He will
      contact the parents and discuss the further procedure in cooperation with the study center.

      In case of a positive result by measuring diabetes-related antibodies and LDL-C the goal of
      this trial is to advise and educate the families appropriate and to treat them if necessary.
      In addition families should have the possibility to participate in prevention trials.

      All data will be registered in a study database.

      Follow-up pre-type 1 diabetes:

      During the first year, follow-up will be performed after 6 and 12 months and thereafter
      annually until the age of 12 years or up to 6 months after the clinical onset of type 1
      diabetes.

      Follow-up familial hypercholesterolemia:

      During the first year, follow-up will be performed after 6 and 12 months and thereafter
      annually until the age of 12 years.

        According to the Federal Statistical Office (31.12.2014) 320.000 children in the age of 2
        to 6 years are living in lower Saxony, Germany. Based on the Fr1da experience a
        participation rate of 25-35 % is expected. The current estimated prevalence of FH und T1D
        of 1:300 leads to the expected number of 450 newly identified cases of FH and T1D in each
        case in the period of 18 months. Additional subjects with FH would be identified by cascade
        screening.
