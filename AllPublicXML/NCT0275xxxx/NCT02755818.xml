  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Approximately 20 million people in the United States have some form of kidney failure. People
      with kidney failure have an increased chance of having low levels of high density lipid
      (HDL), so called &quot;good cholesterol.&quot; Patients who are overweight or obese also have low
      levels of HDL. The investigators are trying to find out whether causes of low HDL are the
      same in people who are overweight and in patients with kidney failure so that in the future
      doctors can better treat low HDL cholesterol levels. People with low levels of HDL are more
      likely to have heart attacks and strokes and are more likely to lose kidney function. This
      study hope to learn more about how kidney failure causes low HDL cholesterol levels.

      This study is not a treatment or outcome trial.This is a single center cross sectional
      analysis of body composition and lipoprotein level and structure among patients with graded
      levels of renal failure in comparison to control subjects. To study the relationship between
      HDL cholesterol and both body composition and insulin resistance measured as homeostatic
      model assessment (HOMA) among a cohort of non diabetic non-proteinuric patients with advanced
      chronic kidney disease (CKD) compared to non diabetic subjects having normal kidney function.
      Renal patients chosen will be with advanced CKD stage 3, Stage 4, and stage 5 - which is end
      stage renal failure (ESRD) and on hemodialysis. Fasting blood will be taken for the
      evaluation of baseline lipid and renal function, and blood glucose level to make sure that
      there is no recent evidence of diabetes. Body compositions will be measured with 2
      established methods: DEXA and whole body bio-impedance spectroscopy (BIS). Fat mass and
      analysis will be estimated so as to provide a relationship between adiposity, insulin
      resistance, residual renal function and HDL levels and structure.

    <description>Baseline measurements will be collected and compiled for cross sectional study analysis. This is done once all group is completed. Each patient is analyzed only once --termed &quot;baseline&quot;. Renal function (such as creatinine) and fasting glucose level is evaluated to measure insulin resistance. Baseline lipid panel will include high density lipoprotein (HDL), low density lipoprotein (LDL), cholesterol, and triglyceride. Dual energy X-ray analysis (DEXA) and bioimpedance spectroscopy (BIS) will result in fat free tissue mass measurement and analysis.</description>
