      Intravenous BI 836826 in combination with ibrutinib in relapsed/refractory Chronic
      Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL) patients who have been pre-treated with at least one prior line of
      systemic therapy, and who are eligible for treatment with ibrutinib. Objectives of the trial
      are to determine the recommended Phase 2 dose of BI 836826, to investigate the number of
      patients with a complete response and to document the safety and tolerability of BI 836826
      when given in combination with ibrutinib
