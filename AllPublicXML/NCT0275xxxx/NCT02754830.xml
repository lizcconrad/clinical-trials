    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of the study drug,
      LY3303560. Side effects and laboratory results will be monitored. This study will involve
      single doses of LY3303560 administered intravenously (IV), meaning into a vein or
      subcutaneously (SC), meaning under the skin.

      Screening is required within 28 days before the start of the study for healthy participants
      and within 42 days before the start of the study for AD participants. The study requires
      about 16 weeks of each participant's time including a 4 day clinical research unit (CRU)
      admission and 10 follow-up appointments.

      This is the first time that this study drug is being given to participants. This study is for
      research purposes only, and is not intended to treat any medical condition.
