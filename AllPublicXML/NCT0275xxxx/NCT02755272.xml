  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main purpose of this study is to see if Pembrolizumab in combination with chemotherapy
      (carboplatin and gemcitabine) is safe and effective in treating patients with metastatic
      triple negative breast cancer.

      Pembrolizumab is a drug which may help the immune system to target and destroy cancer cells.
      Pembrolizumab has been approved by the FDA for the treatment of advanced melanoma and
      metastatic non-small cell lung cancer. However, it has not been approved as a treatment for
      breast cancer.

             meningitis. Subjects with previously treated brain metastases may participate provided
             they are stable (without evidence of progression by imaging for at least four weeks
             prior to the first dose of trial treatment and any neurologic symptoms have returned
             to baseline), have no evidence of new or enlarging brain metastases, and are not using

         20. Has a history or current evidence of any condition, therapy, or laboratory abnormality
             that might confound the results of the trial, interfere with the subject's
