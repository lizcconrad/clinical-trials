  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Researchers are looking for better ways of understanding and treating pancreatic cancer. The
      purpose of this study is to see how useful it is to look for changes and characteristics in
      your genes (molecules that contain instructions for the development and functioning of the
      cells) and the genes within the tumour. These characteristics may be useful in choosing
      treatments for patients in the future. Changes (mutations) in genes have been shown to be an
      important characteristic in cancers. Looking at differences in genes in patients with
      advanced pancreatic ductal adenocarcinomas and comparing this information with response to
      their initial chemotherapy treatment may help to learn which treatments may be better for
      certain patients after initial treatment.
