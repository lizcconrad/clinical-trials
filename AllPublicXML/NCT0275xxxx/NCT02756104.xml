  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      ALS is a devastative disorder characterized by motor neuron degeneration. Median survival is
      3 years after onset, but may vary from a few months to more than 30 years. Various factors
      have been suspected to play a role in such a variation, but recently, it has been described
      that regulatory T-lymphocytes (T regs) may mediate ALS progression and survival. Vitamin D is
      an hormone know to regulated T reg function in vivo and in vitro. It have recently
      demonstrated that vitamin D (VD) levels correlated with ALS prognosis. The investigator want
      to go further in the study of the immune processes that could modulate prognosis in ALS. This
      could allow proposing VD as a potential treatment of ALS in a future trial. More largely,
      this could reinforce arguments in favor of an immune intervention to attenuate the severity
      of this devastating disorder.

      ALS is a devastative disorder characterized by motor neuron degeneration. Median survival is
      3 years after onset, but may vary from a few months to more than 30 years. Various factors
      have been suspected to play a role in such a variation, but recently, it has been described
      that regulatory T-lymphocytes (T regs) may mediate ALS progression and survival. Vitamin D is
      an hormone know to regulated T reg function in vivo and in vitro. It have recently
      demonstrated that vitamin D (VD) levels correlated with ALS prognosis and patients with a
      severe VD deficiency had a 6 time more rapid evolution than those with normal VD levels. The
      investigator want to go further in the study of the immune processes that could modulate
      prognosis in ALS. We propose 1- to study T cell phenotypes (Treg, CD4 (cluster of
      differentiation 4) -Th1, -Th17, -Th2, CD8 (cluster of differentiation 8)and NK) in ALS vs
      controls ; 2- In VD-deficient patients, to analyze the influence of a vitamin D
      supplementation on T cell phenotypes ; 3- to study the relationships between T cell
      phenotypes and ALS prognostic factors. The project will include 70 ALS patients and 27
      controls in this prospective study. VD-deficient patients will be supplemented, according to
      national recommendations for 6 months, and the evolution of T cell phenotypes will be
      followed over 1 year. We hope to demonstrate first that T cell phenotypes in ALS are
      consistent with a pro inflammatory profile, compared to controls, secondly that VD treatment
      modulates T cell phenotypes towards a non-inflammatory one and, thirdly, that inflammatory T
      cell phenotypes correlate with a worse prognosis of the disease. This could allow proposing
      VD as a potential treatment of ALS in a future trial. More largely, this could reinforce
      arguments in favor of an immune intervention to attenuate the severity of this devastating
      disorder.

        For the patients :

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Man or woman with sporadic ALS and a possible, probable or definite diagnosis
             regarding the revised Escorial criteria (Forbes et al., 2001). Patients are followed
             quarterly according to national recommendations. At the end of the follow up period (1
             year for each patient), all patients remaining in the &quot; possible &quot; group of diagnosis
             will be excluded.

          -  Disease onset (date of onset of muscle weakness) &lt; 18 months at the time of inclusion.

          -  Age: 30 to 80 years-old, inclusive.

          -  Patient treated by riluzole at a steady dosage since at least 3 months.

          -  Patient accepting to give informed consent

        Exclusion criteria will be :

          -  A previous treatment with VD in the preceding 2 years, whatever the dose used.

          -  Patient with an already known autoimmune disorder

          -  Patient with severe ALS involvement suggesting that survival over the 1 year follow up
             is highly unlikely (ex : tetraplegia, use of non-invasive ventilation for more than 10
             hrs/day, ALSFRS-R (ALS Functional Rating Scale) score &lt; à 20).

          -  Pregnant or breast-feeding woman.

          -  Patient without social security insurance

        For the Controls:

        Controls will be spouses of our ALS patients. Such a group has the advantage of similar
        life style conditions, and frequently similar geographical origin. Controls and ALS
        patients will match for age and gender. Controls will also fulfill the following inclusion
        and exclusion criteria
