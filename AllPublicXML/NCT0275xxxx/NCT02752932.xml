  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Primary objectives:

        1. Evaluate the feasibility of rapidly accruing 30 participants with recurrent metastatic
           head and neck squamous cell carcinoma for the development of patient derived xenographs
           (PDX) from fresh, real time biopsies in which sensitivity to &lt; 4 Ontario funded
           chemotherapeutic regimen will be tested. Written feedback to the primary oncologist will
           be provided.

        2. There is also a curative intent cohort of 30 participants undergoing surgical resection
           with curative intent. These PDX models will undergo exome sequencing with written
           feedback.

        3. Feasibility in both surgical and recurrent cohorts will be a measure of i) engraftment
           rate, ii) patient status at the time of drug testing completion and iii) rate of
           accrual.

      Tumour samples from 30 participants with HNSCC that undergone curative surgery will be used
      to establish patient-derived xenografts (PDXs). These tumours will also undergo exome
      sequencing. This will provide a biobank of PDX models with available genomic information for
      future research projects. Another 30 participants with recurrent or metastatic HNSCC
      (RMHNSCC) will be recruited to this study. PDX models will be developed from these patient
      tumours, followed by genomic sequencing. PDX models are developed by transplanting small
      tumour pieces into immunocompromised mice. These mice are then treated with different
      available drugs for RMHNSCC at the discretion of their medical oncologist. These mice will be
      then followed up to examine the tumour response to treatments. When studied in clinic, PDX
      models have shown high correlation with patient response to the treatment. The PDX drug
      testing results will be provided to the treating medical oncologist to guide care at the
      oncologists discretion. Investigators' hope is that improved chemotherapy responses are
      observed with this strategy.
