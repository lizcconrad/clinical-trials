    <textblock>
      This study evaluates whether different explanations given to patients with long lasting back
      pain influence a physical therapy treatment technique. Half of the patients will receive an
      explanation of the proposed treatment technique focusing on how their joints are moving and
      not moving. The second half of the group will receive the same treatment technique as the
      first group, but their explanation of the technique's purpose will focus on how their brain
      interprets the information. The study aims to determine if patients have a different response
      to the treatment based on the words chosen to explain the technique.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Traditional treatment provided by physical therapists to patients with chronic low back pain
      focuses on the biomechanical or anatomical impact to local tissues. Recent research has shown
      that treatment effects may be more related to the understanding of the structural and
      functional changes in the brain of someone suffering from chronic low back pain. This
      research implicates that the patients understanding and interpretation of input to the brain
      may change the patient's perceived representation and interpretation of output of pain within
      the brain.
