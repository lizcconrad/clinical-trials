    <textblock>
      Background: Chronic excessive alcohol consumption leads to progressive and chronic cardiac
      dysfunction. In general, patients consuming alcohol more than five years are at risk for the
      development of dilated cardiomyopathy. As only few data about immediate changes in left
      ventricular function after acute excessive alcohol ingestion are available, this study sought
      to close this gap.

      Methods: 200 subjects (not used to alcohol, no cardiac disease) will be examined up to 12
      hours after alcohol excess and after 4 weeks of complete alcohol abstinence. Echocardiography
      will performed at baseline and at follow-up regarding conventional parameter [as left
      ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), transmitral early (E) and late (A) Doppler flow
      velocities, E/A ratio, deceleration time of E (DT) and isovolumic relaxation time (IVRT)] and
      myocardial deformation data [as layer specific global circumferential (endo GCS, mid GCS, epi
      GCS) and longitudinal (endo GLS, mid GLS, epi GLS) strain].
