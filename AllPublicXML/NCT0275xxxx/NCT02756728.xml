        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  A diagnosis of multiple myeloma by 2014 IMWG criteria and have been recommended to
             undergo HDM + ASCT as a standard-of-care therapy for their multiple myeloma.

          -  Subjects must have adequate vital organ function and functional status for HDM + ASCT

          -  Subjects must have collected and cryopreserved ≥4x106 hematopoietic stem cells per kg
             of actual body weight that are suitable for use in autologous stem cell
             transplantation in the judgment of the investigator.

          -  At the time of enrollment, subjects must have had at least a partial response, as
             defined by IMWG criteria and in comparison to baseline/pre-treatment parameters, to an
             induction regimen containing lenalidomide and/or bortezomib.

          -  Subjects must have measurable disease according to one of the following criteria:

               1. Serum M-spike ≥0.1 g/dl

               2. Urine M-spike &gt;200 mg in a 24-hour urine collection

               3. Involved serum free light chain above the upper limit of normal and a serum free
                  light chain ratio outside the normal range.

          -  At the time of enrollment, subjects must be within 12 months of the first dose of
             initial/induction therapy, and the anticipated day of ASCT must be within 12 months of
             the first dose of initial/induction therapy

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Prior allogeneic or autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplant

          -  Current active infections, including HIV and hepatitis C and B

          -  Autoimmune disease requiring ongoing immunosuppressive therapy.

          -  History of atrial fibrillation or flutter, including paroxysmal atrial fibrillation or
             flutter.

          -  History of transient ischemic attack or stroke.

          -  At the time of enrollment, subjects must not have required multi-agent
             continuous-infusion cytotoxic chemotherapy (e.g., regimens such as D-PACE) as part of
             their initial/induction therapy.
