  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research study is studying capmatinib as a treatment for advanced non-small cell lung
      cancer with MET exon 14 skipping, where the participant has already received prior therapy
      with a MET inhibitor.

      This research study is a Phase II clinical trial. Phase II clinical trials test the safety
      and effectiveness of an investigational intervention to learn whether the intervention works
      in treating a specific disease. &quot;Investigational&quot; means that the intervention is being
      studied.

      The FDA (the U.S. Food and Drug Administration) has not approved Capmatinib as a treatment
      for any disease.

      In this research study, the investigators are using the study drug called Capmatinib.
      Capmatinib is a specific blocker of the cMET protein. This protein acts as a trigger to start
      a series of events in your cells in what is known as the C-Met pathway. Patients with MET
      exon 14 skipping have activation of the MET pathway. By blocking MET, Capmatinib may slow or
      stop the growth and/or survival of cancer cells. Capmatinib is not yet FDA approved for the
      treatment of people with this type of cancer. It is not known if capmatinib will be effective
      in people who have previously had other drugs that block the cMET pathway. This study will
      help us understand how capmatinib works in the body and what capmatinib does to cancer. Any
      potential harmful effects of capmatinib will also be studied.

          -  Histologically or cytologically confirmed non-small cell lung cancer, advanced,
             recurrent, or metastatic

          -  MET exon 14 skipping alteration by molecular testing (local testing is accepted for
             eligibility; all patients will have confirmation by NGS-rearrangement assay at MGH but
             this result is not necessary for eligibility; local molecular pathology result will
             suffice). This testing can be from any archival or fresh sample.

          -  Must have received prior platinum containing chemotherapy for advanced/metastatic
             non-small cell lung cancer, or have refused or be ineligible for such therapy. Prior
             neoadjuvant/adjuvant platinum containing chemotherapy will count has having received
             prior platinum, provided that disease recurred within 6 months of completion of
             neoadjuvant/adjuvant therapy.

          -  EGFR and ALK status must be known in all patients with adenocarcinoma histology.
             Patients with activating EGFR mutations or ALK translocations are excluded from this
             study, unless disease has progressed on all available, approved therapies targeting
             these alterations.

          -  At least one measurable lesion as defined by RECIST 1.1. A previously irradiated site

             since the irradiation.

          -  Must have received prior MET inhibitor as their immediately preceding therapy. There
             are no limits to the number of lines of prior therapy as long as prior MET inhibitor
             is the most recent therapy.

          -  Patients must have recovered from all toxicities related to prior anticancer therapies
             to grade ≤ 1 (CTCAE v 4.03). Patients with any grade of alopecia are allowed to enter
             the study.

               -  Aspartate transaminase (AST) ≤ 3 x ULN, except for patients with liver
                  metastasis, who are included if AST ≤ 5 x ULN

               -  Alanine transaminase (ALT) ≤ 3 x ULN, except for patients with liver metastasis,

             who have not recovered from radiotherapy-related toxicities. For all other anatomic
             sites (including radiotherapy to thoracic vertebrae and ribs), radiotherapy ≤ 2 weeks
             prior to starting INC280 or patients who have not recovered from radiotherapy-related
             toxicities. Palliative radiotherapy for bone lesions ≤ 2 weeks prior to starting
             INC280 is allowed

          -  Major surgery (e.g., intra-thoracic, intra-abdominal or intra-pelvic) within 4 weeks
             prior (2 weeks for resection of brain metastases) to starting INC280 or who have not
             recovered from side effects of such procedure. Video-assisted thoracic surgery (VATS)

          -  Unable or unwilling to swallow tablets as per dosing schedule

          -  Patients receiving unstable or increasing doses of corticosteroids. If patients are on
             corticosteroids for endocrine deficiencies or tumor-associated symptoms other than CNS

             first dose of INC280

          -  Patients receiving treatment with any enzyme-inducing anticonvulsant that cannot be
             discontinued at least 1 week before first dose of INC280, and for the duration of the

             with study participation, or that may interfere with the interpretation of study
             results

          -  Any other condition that would, in the Investigator's judgment, contraindicate
             patient's participation in the clinical study due to safety concerns or compliance
             with clinical study procedures, e.g., infection/inflammation, intestinal obstruction,
             unable to swallow medication, social/ psychological issues, etc.

          -  Pregnant or nursing women, where pregnancy is defined as the state of a female after
             conception and until the termination of gestation, confirmed by a positive hCG
             laboratory test

          -  Women of child-bearing potential, defined as all women physiologically capable of
             becoming pregnant, unless they are using highly effective methods of contraception
             during dosing and for 7 days after stopping treatment. Highly effective contraception
             methods include:

          -  Total abstinence (when this is in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of the
             subject. Periodic abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, post-ovulation
             methods) and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of contraception

          -  Female sterilization (have had surgical bilateral oophorectomy with or without
             hysterectomy) or tubal ligation at least six weeks before taking study treatment. In
             case of oophorectomy alone, only when the reproductive status of the woman has been
             confirmed by follow up hormone level assessment

          -  Male sterilization (at least 6 months prior to screening). For female subjects on the
             study the vasectomized male partner should be the sole partner for that subject

          -  Combination of any two of the following (a+b or a+c, or b+c):

               -  Use of oral, injected or implanted hormonal methods of contraception or other
                  forms of hormonal contraception that have comparable efficacy (failure rate ≤
                  1%), for example hormone vaginal ring or transdermal hormone contraception

               -  Placement of an intrauterine device (IUD) or intrauterine system (IUS)

               -  Barrier methods of contraception: Condom or Occlusive cap (diaphragm or
                  cervical/vault caps) with spermicidal foam/gel/film/cream/vaginal suppository

               -  In case of use of oral contraception women should have been stable on the same
                  pill for a minimum of 3 months before taking study treatment.

          -  Women are considered post-menopausal and not of child bearing potential if they have
             had 12 months of natural (spontaneous) amenorrhea with an appropriate clinical profile
             (e.g., age appropriate, history of vasomotor symptoms) or have had surgical bilateral
             oophorectomy (with or without hysterectomy) or tubal ligation at least six weeks ago.
             In the case of oophorectomy alone, only when the reproductive status of the woman has
             been confirmed by follow up hormone level assessment is she considered not of child
             bearing potential

          -  Sexually active males unless they use a condom during intercourse while taking drug
             and for 7 days after stopping treatment and should not father a child in this period.
             A condom is required to be used also by vasectomized men in order to prevent delivery
             of the drug via seminal fluid
