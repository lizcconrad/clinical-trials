    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. The subject must be willingly and able to provide written informed consent

          2. Age 19 years of age or older (The age of consent in Nebraska)

          3. HCV treatment-naïve, as defined as no prior exposure to any Interferon (IFN), RBV, or
             other FDA approved or experimental HCV-specific direct-acting antiviral agent

          4. HCV RNA level at most 6 months prior to the Baseline/Day 1 visit.

          5. HCV genotyping 1a, 1b, or mixed 1a/ab. Any non-definitive results will exclude the
             subject from study participation.

          6. Alcohol misuse as defined by the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT)
             score subjects must score &gt; 8 (associated with harmful or hazardous drinking)

          7. Cirrhosis determination [up to 20% of study subjects may have cirrhosis]:

               1. Cirrhosis is defined as any one of the following:

                    -  History of a liver biopsy showing cirrhosis (e.g. Metavir score = 4 or Ishak
                       score &gt; 5)

                    -  Fibroscan showing cirrhosis or results &gt; 12.5 kPa

                    -  FIBRO Spect II index consistent with F3 or F4 AND an AST : platelet ration
                       index (APRI) of &gt; 2 during Screening

               2. Absence of cirrhosis is defined as any one of the following:

                    -  Liver biopsy within 2 years of Screening showing absence of cirrhosis

                    -  Fibroscan within 6 months of Baseline/Day1 with a result of ≤ 12.5 kPa

                    -  FIBRO Spect II Index consistent with F0- F2 AND APRI of ≤ 1 during Screening

          8. Liver imaging within 6 months of Baseline/Day 1 to exclude hepatocellular carcinoma
             HCC) is required

          9. Subjects must have the following laboratory parameters at screening:

               1. ALT &lt; 10 x the upper limit of normal (ULN)

               2. AST &lt; 10 x ULN

               3. Direct bilirubin &lt; 2.0 x ULN

               4. Platelets &gt; 50,000

               5. HbA1c &lt; 8.5%

               6. Creatinine clearance (CLcr) ≥ 60 mL /min, as calculated by the Cockcroft-Gault
                  equation

               7. Hemoglobin ≥ 11 g/dL for female subjects; ≥ 12 g/dL for male subjects.

               8. Albumin ≥ 2.5 g/dL

               9. INR ≤ 1.5 x ULN unless subject has known hemophilia or is stable on an
                  anticoagulant regimen affecting INR.

         10. Subject has not been treated with any investigational drug or device within 30 days of
             the screening visit.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Pregnant women and nursing mothers are ineligible due to the possible risk of adverse
             effects in the newborn. Eligible patients of reproductive potential should use
             adequate contraception if sexually active.

          2. Serious concurrent medical illness which would jeopardize the ability of the subject
             to receive the therapy as outlined in this protocol with reasonable safety.

          3. Malignancy diagnosed or treated within 5 years (recent localized treatment of squamous
             or non-invasive basal cell skin cancers is permitted; cervical carcinoma in situ is
             allowed if appropriately treated prior to screening); subjects under evaluation for a
             malignancy are not eligible.

          4. Infection with hepatitis B virus (HBV) or human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)

          5. Use of any prohibited concomitant medications within 30 days of the Baseline/Day 1
             visit.

          6. Known hypersensitivity to LDV/SOF
