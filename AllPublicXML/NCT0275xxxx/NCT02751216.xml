  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is an interventional, observatory single center trial investigating the functional
      connectivity of the electrical brain activity in high frequency/high density spinal cord
      stimulation in failed back surgery syndrome patients with back and leg pain.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Based on the reimbursement rules in Belgium, a trial implantation of 4 weeks is necessary
      before implanting the definitive neurostimulator. The definitive neurostimulator will be
      implanted minimum 4 weeks after the trial implantation, when the patient reports more than
      50% pain reduction and/or more than 50% reduction in pain medication.

      Patients who are included in this study will have four extra study visits at the University
      Hospital Brussels. The first assessment will take place during the week prior to surgery, the
      second minimal one month after definitive implantation of the stimulator. The assessments
      consist of filling in the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) and the Pain Catastrophizing
      Scale (PCS) and recording brain activity before and during the pain protocol. Additionally,
      patients will wear an Actiwatch for measuring sleep patterns and fill in a VAS diary (back
      and leg pain separately), one month before the baseline assessment and one month before the
      second assessment.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Subject is at least 18 years old.

          2. Subject is able and willing to comply with the follow-up schedule and protocol

          3. Diagnosis of FBSS with predominant leg pain (VAS) &gt; 5) and non-dominant back pain.

          4. Cognitive and language functioning enabling coherent communication between the
             examiner and the subject;

          5. Failed conservative treatments for pain including but not limited to pharmacological
             therapy and physical therapy

          6. Stable neurologic function in the past 30 days

          7. In the opinion of the Investigator, the subject is psychologically appropriate for the
             implantation for an active implantable medical device

          8. Subject is able to provide written informed consent

          9. Subject speaks Dutch or French.

        Exclusion Criteria:

             pregnant during the course of the trial

          2. Subject has had radiofrequency treatment of an intended target DRG within the past 3
             months
