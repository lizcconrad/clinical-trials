      The purpose of this study is to quantify the serious risks of misuse, abuse, and addiction
      associated with long-term use of opioid analgesics for management of chronic pain, among
      patients prescribed ER/LA opioid products.

    <textblock>
      The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has asked the companies that are New Drug Application
      (NDA) holders of extended-release/long-acting (ER/LA) opioids to conduct one or more studies
      to provide quantitative estimates of the serious risks of misuse, abuse, addiction, overdose,
      and death associated with long-term use of opioid analgesics for management of chronic pain,
      among patients prescribed ER/LA opioid products. Although abuse and misuse of prescription
      opioids have increased over the past decade, there is debate about the magnitude of misuse,
      abuse, and addiction among patients who are treated with opioids for chronic pain. Further,
      although there appears to be comorbidity of opioid use disorders with other substance use and
      psychiatric disorders, there is insufficient data to estimate how the risk of these outcomes
      varies by the presence of risk factors among patients treated with opioids long-term. This
      study seeks to fill that gap. The primary objective is to quantify the serious risks of
      misuse, abuse, and addiction associated with long-term use of opioid analgesics for
      management of chronic pain among patients prescribed ER/LA opioid products. Patients will be
      recruited from six Health Care System Research Network (HCSRN) sites; one U.S. Department of
      Veterans Affairs (VA) site, and clinics participating in 2 Primary Care Practice-Based
      Research Network sites. The data sources for the proposed study will be: 1) patient reported
      outcomes through in-person interviews (or phone if unavailable to participate in-person),
      web-based assessments (or phone if unable to complete via web), and electronic medical record
      and claims data. The study design includes 2 components: 1) A prospective longitudinal study
      of patients who have recently initiated at least 30 days of ER/LA opioid therapy, and 2) A
      cross-sectional study of patients who have been treated with opioids (including at least one
      ER/LA opioid) for greater than 1 year.

        Of the 2300 eligible subjects in the prospective study, 1900 will be from the HCSRN sites,
        200 from the VA, and 200 from the PBRN. Sampling and recruitment strategies for the
        cross-sectional study will parallel those used to identify the prospective sample.
