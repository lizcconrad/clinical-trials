      This is a prospective, multicenter, randomized, open-label, Phase II, two arms interventional
      trial performed in 5 departments of hematology in China. The investigators explore the
      efficacy and safety of Rituximab plus short-term methylprednisolone compare standard dose
      methylprednisolone in newly diagnosed ITP participants.
