  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In the last few years, a new clinical entity has emerged which includes patients who consider
      themselves to be suffering from problems caused by wheat and/or gluten ingestion, even though
      they do not have celiac disease (CD) or wheat allergy. This clinical condition has been named
      non-celiac gluten sensitivity (NCGS), although in a recent article, the investigators
      suggested the term &quot;non-celiac wheat sensitivity&quot; (NCWS), because it is not known to date
      what component of wheat actually causes the symptoms. Nickel is the fourth most used metal
      and the most frequent cause of contact allergy in the industrialized world. As a natural
      element of the earth's crust small amounts are found in water, soil, and natural foods,
      especially plant ones. Nickel allergy not only affects the skin but also results in systemic
      manifestations. Systemic nickel allergy syndrome can have cutaneous (urticaria/angioedema,
      flares, itching), and/or gastrointestinal (meteorism, colic, diarrhoea) signs and symptoms.
      In this study, the investigators evaluated 1) the frequency of Nickel allergy and Systemic
      Nickel allergy syndrome in NCWS patients, and 2) the clinical, serological, and histological
      characteristics of NCWS patients with contact dermatitis Nickel positive in comparison to
      NCWS patients without contact dermatitis.

      In the last few years, a new clinical entity has emerged which includes patients who consider
      themselves to be suffering from problems caused by wheat and/or gluten ingestion, even though
      they do not have celiac disease (CD) or wheat allergy. This clinical condition has been named
      non-celiac gluten sensitivity (NCGS), although in a recent article, the investigators
      suggested the term &quot;non-celiac wheat sensitivity&quot; (NCWS), because it is not known to date
      what component of wheat actually causes the symptoms. Other areas of doubt in NCWS regard its
      pathogenesis, while some papers reported intestinal immunologic activation, others linked
      NCWS to the dietary short chain carbohydrate (fermentable oligo-di-monosaccharides and
      polyols, FODMAPs) load. The investigators recently demonstrated that higher proportions of
      patients with NCWS develop autoimmune disorders, are antinuclear antibodies (ANA) positive,
      and show DQ2/DQ8 haplotypes compared with patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS),
      supporting an immunologic involvement in NCWS. Furthermore, some papers reported also a high
      frequency, ranging from 22% and 35%, of coexistent atopic diseases in NCWS patients, and the
      investigators suggested that a percentage of NCWS patients could really suffer from
      non-IgE-mediated wheat allergy.

      Nickel is the fourth most used metal and the most frequent cause of contact allergy in the
      industrialized world. As a natural element of the earth's crust small amounts are found in
      water, soil, and natural foods, especially plant ones. Nickel allergy not only affects the
      skin but also results in systemic manifestations. Systemic nickel allergy syndrome can have
      cutaneous (urticaria/angioedema, flares, itching), and/or gastrointestinal (meteorism, colic,
      diarrhoea) signs and symptoms.

      Volta et al. reported that 15% of NCWS patients suffered from allergy to nickel, but they did
      not further characterize this subgroup of patients, neither posed the NCWS diagnosis by means
      the double-blind placebo controlled challenge (DBPCC), as recommended. In this study, the
      investigators evaluated 1) the frequency of Nickel allergy and Systemic Nickel allergy
      syndrome in NCWS patients, and 2) the clinical, serological, and histological characteristics
      of NCWS patients with contact dermatitis Nickel positive in comparison to NCWS patients
      without contact dermatitis.

    <description>The clinical charts of NCWS patients attending the outpatient centers of the Department of Internal Medicine at the University Hospital of Palermo and the Department of Internal Medicine of the Hospital of Sciacca were retrospectively reviewed. Patients had all been diagnosed with NCWS between January 2001 and June 2011, by a DBPCC method, and included in a previously published study. These charts included specific sections for the presence of associated atopic diseases, including nickel allergy. In this way, the characteristics of the NCWS patients suffering from nickel allergy were compared with those of the NCWS patients who did not suffer from nickel allergy. Incomplete clinical charts were excluded.</description>

    <description>The investigators also prospectively surveyed adult patients with functional gastroenterological symptoms according to the Rome III criteria, and a definitive diagnosis of NCWS. The patients were recruited between December 2014 and March 2016 at 3 centers: the two already mentioned and the Gastroenterology Unit of the ARNAS Civico Hospital of Palermo, Italy. Most of the patients had been referred due to gastrointestinal symptoms, the onset of which, they reported, could be related to wheat ingestion. Again, the characteristics of the NCWS patients suffering from nickel allergy were compared with those of the NCWS patients who did not suffer from nickel allergy.</description>

    <description>To compare the frequency of nickel allergy in NCWS and non-NCWS patients, a control group composed of 70 irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) patients, was selected. These controls were randomly chosen by a computer-generated method from subjects diagnosed during the same period and age- (+/-2 years) and sex-matched (+/-5%) with the NCWS patients. The IBS controls had been receiving the same elimination diet as the NCWS patients and had not shown any clinical improvement; they belonged to the cohort of subjects the investigators had studied previously.</description>

        The study was divided into 2 different parts. In the first, the clinical charts of NCWS
        patients were retrospectively reviewed, comparing the characteristics of the ones suffering
        from nickel allergy with those who did not suffer from nickel allergy, using, as control
        group, 70 IBS patients. In the second, the investigators prospectively surveyed adult
        patients with functional gastroenterological symptoms (Rome III criteria) and a definitive
        diagnosis of NCWS, comparing the characteristics of the ones suffering from nickel allergy
        were compared with those who did not suffer from nickel allergy, using, as control group,
        70 patients with functional gastroenterological symptoms.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        All the patients met the recently proposed criteria:

          -  negative serum anti-tissue transglutaminase and antiendomysium (EmA) IgA and IgG
             antibodies;

          -  absence of intestinal villous atrophy;

          -  IgE-mediated immunoallergy tests negative to wheat (skin prick tests and/or serum
             specific IgE detection).

        Adjunctive criteria adopted in our patients were:

          -  resolution of the gastrointestinal symptoms on a standard elimination diet, without
             wheat, cow's milk, egg, tomato, chocolate, or other food(s) causing self-reported
             symptoms;

          -  symptom reappearance on double-blind placebo-controlled (DBPC) wheat challenge,
             performed as described previously. As in previous studies, DBPC cow's milk protein
             challenge and other &quot;open&quot; food challenges were also performed.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Exclusion criteria were:

          -  age &lt; 18 years;

          -  positive EmA in the culture medium of the duodenal biopsies, even if the villi to
             crypts ratio in the duodenal mucosa was normal;

          -  self-exclusion of wheat from the diet and refusal to reintroduce it before entering
             the study;

          -  other organic cutaneous and/or gastrointestinal diseases;

          -  concomitant treatment with steroids and/or antihistamines.

        Allergic contact dermatitis was diagnosed in patients showing local eczematous lesions on
        the skin in close contact with nickel-containing objects. Suspected systemic nickel allergy
        syndrome (SNAS), was defined as a reaction characterized not only by diffused eczematous
        lesions (systemic contact dermatitis) but also by extracutaneous signs and symptoms, mainly
        gastrointestinal, after ingestion of nickel-rich foods (i.e. tomato, cocoa, beans,
        mushrooms, vegetables, wheat flour, etc). In all cases, the diagnosis was confirmed by
        means of the epicutaneous patch tests which provoked delayed lesions.
