  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare a motor learning (ML)-based gait-related training
      intervention to a functional lower limb strength training intervention, with a concurrent
      evaluation of functional, neural and participation outcomes for children and youth with
      Cerebral Palsy (CP).

      This study is a two-group, parallel arm RCT in which twenty-two children with CP in GMFCS
      Levels I-II will be randomly allocated to a 6-week, 16 session program of: (i) ML based gait
      training or (ii) lower limb strength training. Outcome assessments occur pre/post/4-months
      post-intervention.

    <description>The motor learning (ML)-based gait-related training program is designed to improve advanced gross motor skills and athleticism. It will involve 45-min sessions twice to three times weekly over 6 weeks for a total of 16 active sessions. A maximum of 7 weeks will be permitted. Each session will consist of 35-min of active training along with a 10-min active warm-up/cool-down that incorporates ML. Children will be given a 3- to 5-min mental motor imagery script to practice on days when they do not have active training sessions. The total number of sessions (combined training/home imagery) will be five per week.</description>
