      This study aims to assess the impact of 24-week treatment of dapagliflozin in type 2
      DM(diabetes mellitus) patients on diastolic dysfunction. Primary endpoint is assessing the
      impact of 24-week treatment of dapagliflozin in type 2 DM patients on subclinical diastolic
      dysfunction assessed by supine bicycle diastolic stress echocardiography. Secondary endpoint
      is assessing the impact of 24-week treatment of dapagliflozin in type 2 DM patients on
      functional capacity, he impact of 24-week treatment of dapagliflozin in type 2 DM patients at
      resting diastolic function. This is single-center, randomized, double-blind,
      placebo-controlled, parallel-arm intervention study.

      This study is planned to evaluate the impact of dapagliflozin on diastolic dysfunction
      assessed. The dose of dapagliflozin will be 10 mg as approved.

      For assessment of diastolic dysfunction, supine bicycle stress exercise echocardiography was
      performed, and changes in diastolic functional reserve, VO2max, exercise time, and maximal
      exercise capacity were assessed before and after treatment. This study will be randomized,
      double blind, placebo controlled, to minimize the risk of bias.
