    <textblock>
      The study will compare the number of women who deliver vaginally after artificial initiation
      of labor pains(i.e. induction of labor) by two methods. Half of the women would receive
      tablet misoprostol vaginally and the other half would receive tablet misoprostol and foley's
      balloon catheter both.

    <textblock>
      Artificial initiation of labor pains has become a common occurrence. A variety of methods are
      employed to initiate labor pains. Labor pains are more successful in culminating into vaginal
      delivery if the neck of womb that is the cervix is soft (ripe). This is usually achieved by
      ripening agents. They include drugs and devices that help soften the cervix. Misoprostol and
      foley's balloon catheter both are used to soften the cervix so that vaginal delivery is
      possible. Both work on different aspects of the softening of cervix.

      Misoprostol acts on shortening the cervix and making it more pliable Foley's balloon helps to
      open up the cervix that is it aids in dilating the cervical canal.

    <description>Patients who would receive Only oral misoprostol{(50 micrograms) tab cytotec ¼ tablets (Searle)}. All patients in this group will be given oral misoprostol 50 μg per dose. The dose will be repeated at 4 hours interval up to a maximum of 4 doses till labor is induced (3 contractions per 10 minutes). If labor is not established within 4 hours of the administration of the fourth dose, induction will be considered to be failed</description>

    <description>All patients in this group will be explained the technique of foley's catheter ballooning and informed consent will be taken. The cervix will be visualized with the help of Cusco's speculum. The balloon will be inflated with about 30 cc of sterile water. The catheter will be pulled down to bring the balloon into the cervical canal and will be tapped around the thigh. Patients will also be given oral misoprostol 50 μg per dose. The dose will be repeated at 4 hours interval up to a maximum of 4 doses till labor is induced (3 contractions per 10 minutes).</description>
