    <textblock>
      This study aims at assessing the hard and soft tissues remodelling of the alveolar crest
      after extraction socket managements in the aesthetic areas:

        -  3D radiographic evaluation (CT scan) was performed post extraction and 3 months after at
           the time of implant placement. (Outcomes 1: Hard tissues analyses )

        -  Impressions, models and 3D analyses of the treated area allowed studying external soft
           tissue remodeling at different time points after extraction. (Outcomes 2: Soft tissues
           analyses )

    <description>A Mucograft membrane will be used in state of a connective tissue graft. The dimension of the Mucograft® will be previously calculated according to the site dimensions and inserted into buccal pouch and sutured to be stabilized on the buccal aspect. The membrane is then positioned to cover the socket and inserted and sutured in the palatal pouch by the means of vertical interrupted sutures</description>

    <description>A connective tissue graft will be harvested to the palate or posterior maxilla tuberosity. The dimension of the graft will be previously calculated according to the socket dimensions. The harvesting site will be made with a single edge incision and sutured with 4.0 silk (uninterrupted suture). The connective tissue graft will be reshaped if necessary to be 1-2mm thick and inserted into buccal pouch and sutured with 2 vertical interrupted sutures to be stabilized on the buccal aspect.
The connective tissue graft is then positioned to caver the socket and inserted and sutured in the palatal pouch also by the means of vertical interrupted sutures (polypropylen 6.0).</description>

    <description>An atraumatic extraction will be performed in order to preserve the socket bone wall as well as the cervical soft tissues.
Split- thickness pockets will be performed 5-6 mm deep buccally and 3-4 mm deep palatally preserving interproximal papillae. The filling biomaterial (Bio-Oss®, Geistlich), previously humidified with a saline solution containing doxycycline (1mg/ml) and inserted into the socket without heavy compaction. At this level of the surgery, the randomization envelope will be open and either the control or the test surgical protocol will be applied.</description>
