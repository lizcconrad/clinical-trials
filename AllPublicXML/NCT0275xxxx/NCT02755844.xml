  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Endometrial cancer ranks 11th in terms of incidence (7275 / year) and mortality (2025 deaths/
      year). The 5-year overall survivals of patients at diagnosis with locally advanced and
      metastatic carcinomas are about 50% and 15% respectively. Beyond first line treatment with
      platinum-based chemotherapy, there is lack of effective drug in this disease, which explains
      the poor prognosis of patients.

      The prognosis of metastatic endometrial cancer patients is poor, and few drugs have been
      shown to be effective beyond first chemotherapy line.

      Endometrial carcinomas are characterized by frequent alterations of PI3K-AKT-mTor; IGF1R and
      of DNA repair pathways. Phosphatase and tensin homologue (PTEN)-phosphoinositide 3-kinase
      (PI3K)-mammalian target of rapamycin (mTor) and DNA repair pathways interact, and inhibition
      of PI3K-AKT-mTor signaling pathway may alter DNA damage repair.

      Metronomic cyclophosphamide regimen may increase the anti-proliferative effects of olaparib
      because it is an alkylating agent, and it exerts anti-angiogenic effects, with a favorable
      toxicity profile.

      Metformin may increase the anti-proliferative effects of olaparib because it downregulates
      IGF1R and PI3K-AKT-mTor pathways, with no additive toxicity.
