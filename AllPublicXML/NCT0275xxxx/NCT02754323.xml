      There are different definitions of stress according to each discipline. In psychology, it is
      defined according to the individual's ability to adapt. The medical approach focuses on the
      reactions of the body to stress situations. And the organizational approach seeks to define
      in terms of sources of stress situations. According to a national interprofessional agreement
      on stress at work in 2008 is defined as a condition that occurs when there is an imbalance
      between the perception of a person with constraints imposed by its environment and the
      perception that it has its own resources to cope.

      Stress at work

      INRS emphasizes prevention to fight against the cost of work stress and seeks to develop
      methods and tools objectification stressful situations. The social cost of workplace stress
      would represent 10 to 20% of the expenses of the branch for employment injuries /
      occupational diseases of the Social Security According to a survey by the European Agency for
      Safety and Health at Work conducted in 1999, stress is the cause of 50 to 60% of all lost
      working days. The cost of occupational stress assessed by INRS represent 830 million euros in
      2000 in France.

      Media coverage of working conditions related suicides has prompted some companies to
      communicate about work stress and develop actions.

      According to the study of Sumer in 2003, 61% of employees have a highly stressful job and 27%
      complained of work-related health problems.

      However, the 2009 survey shows that job stress is a major risk factor for mental health and
      is associated with decreased job performance. Burnout sets in stages idealistic enthusiasm,
      stagnation, frustration, apathy. Therefore, it is essential to track the state of chronic
      stress as soon as possible to prevent burnout.

      Stress testing procedures

      The major problem is that there is not now comprehensively measure of stress. The measurement
      models that are available to date, all incomplete, can be classified according to two
      categories.

      First, the general patterns that measure only partially stress but which can be used in any
      type of fields. One application of self-KARASEK and the imbalance of effort / reward
      SIEGRIST. These two models are mainly used for epidemiological studies on job stress.

      Second, the specific models that provide a more comprehensive measure but we can only use in
      the area from which they come. These measure specific stressors (organizational, professional
      and emotional) in the study population.

      The main objective of this study is evaluate the feasibility and validate the measurement of
      chronic stress by CODESNA tool. The method is to compare the measured result by the CODESNA
      tool to measure stress questionnaires collected by the Maslach Burnout INVENTORY and KARASEK.
      This method explores finely enough constraints and allows a comparison of national data.

    <description>The result of chronic Stress is expressed in% above the value 100. It measures the chronic stress in a universal scale for all human beings and using as reference the balance point of the autonomic nervous system.
This shall be measured from the recording of R-R intervals of an ECG, also called Heart Rate Variability (HRV),,. Then the CODESNA algorithms perform mathematical processing being based physiological principle to deliver information Chronic Stress</description>
