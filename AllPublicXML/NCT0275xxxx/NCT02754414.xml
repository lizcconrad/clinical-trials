    <textblock>
      This is a platelet transfusion study. The purpose of this study is to measure the life span
      and quality of platelets stored in a refrigerator. Participants will give platelets by
      apheresis. Platelets will be stored for 3 -20 days. A small portion of the subject's own
      stored platelets will be tagged with a radioactive isotope and infused back into the
      participant. This will enable us to track how many transfused platelets survive after storage
      in the refrigerator.

      A single hyperconcentrated apheresis platelet unit will be collected from a healthy adult
      volunteer subject using the Trima Accel® Automated Blood Collection System. Concurrent plasma
      will be collected. The platelet unit will be stored, not-agitated, for up to 20 days at 4°C
      in a suspension of 35% plasma and 65% PAS (Platelet Additive Solution).

      At the end of the storage period, the subject will return to receive an 111Indium Oxine
      (Indium 111, In-111) radiolabeled aliquot of their 4°C stored platelets. Follow-up samples
      from the subject will be collected approximately 2 hours post-infusion and on Days 1 (2X), 2
      (2X), and 3 to calculate recovery and survival of the subject's 4°C stored platelets. The Day
      1 and Day 2 the sample draws will be 2 - 10 hours apart.

      In addition to radiolabeled platelet recovery and survival measurements, various in vitro
      assays will be performed on the day of collection at the end of 4°C storage.

      One week after the infusion of the radiolabeled aliquot, the subject will return to receive a
      second radiolabeled aliquot of fresh platelets. To facilitate this, on the morning of the
      second infusion, the subject will return for collection of a 43 mL blood sample. The blood
      will be processed to obtain a fresh sample of the subject's platelets to serve as a control
      comparator. The platelets will be radiolabeled with In-111. The subject will return later in
      the day for infusion of the radiolabeled fresh 'control' comparator aliquot. Follow-up blood
      samples will be drawn at ~2 hours after the infusion on Day 0 and then on Days 1, 2, 3, 4 or
      5, and 6 or 7 day post infusion to calculate recovery and survival of the subject's fresh vs.
      stored platelets.

    <description>Tables of recovery and survival summary statistics will display values by group from fresh and stored platelets. Recovery and survival of stored platelets as percentage of corresponding fresh platelets will be plotted against days stored. Regression methods will be used to determine if there is evidence of any trend in the mean storage or recovery of 4°C stored platelets with respect to storage time as a percentage of each subject's fresh platelet results. Histograms of recovery and survival as percentage of 4°C stored platelet measurements will be plotted, and corresponding confidence intervals will be calculated.</description>
