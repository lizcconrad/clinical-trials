      This clinical trial studies how well early stem cell transplantation works in treating
      patients with high-grade myeloid neoplasms that has come back after a period of improvement
      or does not respond to treatment. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as filgrastim, cladribine,
      cytarabine and mitoxantrone hydrochloride, work in different ways to stop the growth of
      cancer cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping
      them from spreading. Giving chemotherapy before a donor peripheral blood cell transplant
      helps stop the growth of cells in the bone marrow, including normal blood-forming cells (stem
      cells) and cancer cells. When the healthy stem cells from a donor are infused into the
      patient they may help the patient's bone marrow make stem cells, red blood cells, white blood
      cells, and platelets. The donated stem cells may also replace the patient's immune cells and
      help destroy any remaining cancer cells. Early stem cell transplantation may result in more
      successful treatment for patients with high-grade myeloid neoplasms.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the feasibility of &quot;early&quot; allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT) for
      patients with relapsed or refractory (R/R) high-grade myeloid neoplasms.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Estimate relapse-free survival (RFS), acute graft versus host disease (GVHD), treatment
      related mortality (TRM), event-free survival (EFS), overall survival (OS), and complete
      remission (with or without measurable disease) among patients who receive early HCT.

      II. Assess factors that distinguish patients who receive early HCT from those who do not.

      III. Compare RFS, EFS, OS, acute GVHD, and TRM between patients in the feasibility study and
      matched patients who were transplanted with standard scheduling.

      IV. Demonstrate the feasibility of collecting patient-reported outcomes and resource
      utilization data for trial participants.

      V. Describe the outcomes of patients enrolled who went on to allogeneic HCT off-study.

      OUTLINE:

      RE-INDUCTION CHEMOTHERAPY: Patients receive filgrastim subcutaneously (SC) on days 0-5,
      mitoxantrone hydrochloride intravenously (IV) over 60 minutes on days 1-3, cladribine IV over
      2 hours on days 1-5, and cytarabine IV over 2 hours on days 1-5. Treatment continues for a
      maximum of 2 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      CONDITIONING REGIMEN: Beginning 14-60 days after re-induction chemotherapy, patients receive
      fludarabine phosphate IV over 30 minutes on days -6 to -2, melphalan IV on days -3 to -2,
      cyclosporine orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on day -3, and sirlolimus PO BID on day -3.
      Patients &gt; 55 years or with significant co-morbidities also receive total body irradiation
      (TBI) on day -1 or day 0.

      EARLY TRANSPLANT: Patients undergo allogeneic HCT after conditioning regimen on day 0.

      GVHD PROPHYLAXIS: Patients receive mycophenolate mofetil PO three times daily (TID) on days
      0-30, then BID until day 40, and cyclosporine PO BID on days -3 to 96, with a taper until day
      150. Patients with matched unrelated donors also receive sirolimus PO on days -3 to 150, with
      a taper until day 180.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up periodically.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        INCLUSION CRITERIA (ENROLLMENT)

          -  Relapsed or refractory high-grade myeloid neoplasms, defined as having a blast count
             of &gt;= 10% blasts at initial diagnosis; examples include excess blasts (EB)-2, with &gt;=
             10% blasts at initial diagnosis, acute myeloid leukemia (AML) or chronic
             myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML-2); standard definitions of relapse will apply (i.e.,
             characterized by &gt;= 5% abnormal blasts as assessed by multiparameter flow cytometry or
             morphologic examination; peripheral blood blasts; or extramedullary granulocytic
             sarcoma, per European LeukemiaNet [ELN] 2017 guidelines); bone marrow aspirate/biopsy
             will be accepted if performed outside University of Washington/Fred Hutchinson Cancer
             Research Center (UW/FHCRC); determination of disease status should occur within 30
             days of signing informed consent

               -  R/R high-grade myeloid neoplasm following intensive induction chemotherapy;
                  relapsed high-grade myeloid neoplasm: patients will be classified as relapsed if
                  they have &gt;= 5% blasts after being in a complete remission (CR) following
                  treatment for high-grade myeloid neoplasm; refractory high-grade myeloid
                  neoplasm: patients may be classified as refractory if they have received at least
                  one prior cycle of induction chemotherapy, whether with cladribine cytarabine
                  mitoxantrone (GCLAM) or another regimen

                    -  Patients may have received up to two courses of intensive induction
                       chemotherapy during initial treatment prior to enrollment on this protocol;
                       for example, patients who have received two courses of granulocyte colony
                       stimulating factor (G-CSF) GCLAM (or similar) chemotherapy, with most recent
                       high-dose cytarabine-containing chemotherapy &gt; 6 months ago and CR lasting &gt;
                       6 months, will be eligible for this protocol; regimens &quot;similar to GCLAM&quot;
                       would include cytarabine at doses of 1g/m^2 for at least 5 doses; examples
                       of regimens &quot;similar to GCLAM&quot; would be GCLA, fludarabine cytarabine
                       granulocyte (FLAG), and FLAG-idarubicin (ida); however, patients who
                       received more than two courses of GCLAM (or similar) chemotherapy, or
                       patients who received two courses of GCLAM and had CR lasting &lt; 6 months,
                       would not be eligible

               -  R/R high-grade myeloid neoplasm following less intensive induction chemotherapy.
                  Patients who have received at least three cycles of treatment with a
                  hypomethylating agent (HMA; such as azacitidine or decitabine) and still have &gt;=
                  10% blasts will be eligible for the study (they will be considered refractory);
                  similarly, patients who have received three or more cycles of HMA therapy who
                  have had a response (e.g., achieving CR with &lt; 5% blasts), but who then progress
                  using standard definitions of relapse, will also be eligible (they will be
                  considered relapsed)

             -DRB1) donor according to institutional standards

          -  Caregiver capable of providing post-HCT care, who will be present once induction
             therapy with filgrastim, cladribine, cytarabine, mitoxantrone hydrochloride (GCLAM)
             begins

          -  Written informed consent for transplant

             information

               -  Cardiac ejection fraction &lt; 40% or symptomatic coronary artery disease or
                  uncontrolled arrhythmia

               -  Diffusing capacity of the lungs for carbon monoxide (DLCOc) &lt; 40% or forced

               -  Estimated glomerular filtration rate (GFR) &lt; 40 ml/min

               -  Need for supplemental oxygen

               -  Direct bilirubin or alanine aminotransferase (ALT) &gt; 2 x upper limit of normal,
                  unless these abnormalities are thought to be related to Gilbert's disease or
                  leukemic infiltration of hepatic parenchyma

          -  Known human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) positivity

          -  Pregnant or nursing (to be confirmed with quantitative human chorionic gonadotropin
             [HCG] testing)

          -  Invasive solid tumor within 5 years; non-melanoma skin cancer or in situ malignancies
             are allowed

          -  Need for supplemental oxygen

          -  Direct bilirubin or ALT &gt; 2 x upper limit of normal, unless these abnormalities are
             thought to be related to Gilbert's disease or leukemic infiltration of hepatic
             parenchyma
