  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel group, patient-blind, single-center phase
      I clinical trial of repeated once every 4 weeks administration by subcutaneous injection of
      AFFITOPE® PD01A, adsorbed to aluminium oxide in 30 patients with PD-GBA over a treatment
      period of 8 weeks. Patients will be randomized in a 2:1 ratio to two different treatment
      groups: A) 75 µg AFFITOPE® PD01A, adsorbed to aluminium oxide and B) placebo (= 1 mg
      aluminium oxide).

      Over a study duration of 52 weeks, each patient will receive 3 injections of AFFITOPE® PD01A
      or placebo during the participation in the clinical trial. Patients will either receive 75 µg
      AFFITOPE® PD01A adsorbed to 1 mg aluminium oxide or placebo (=1mg aluminium oxide). The
      treatment group consists of 20 PDGBA patients, the placebo group of 10 PDGBA patients. Male
      and female patients aged 40 to 80 years can participate in the trial.

      AFF010 is part of the project MULTISYN funded by the European Commission
      (FP7-HEALTH-2013-INNOVATION-1 project; N° HEALTH-F4-2013-602646).
