  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the effects of multiple oral doses of LEO 32731
      on the pharmacokinetics of a single oral dose of the cytochrome P450 3A substrate midazolam
      in healthy male subjects.

  </brief_summary>
  <overall_status>Terminated</overall_status>
  <why_stopped>
    Due to tolerability issues related to the dose titration, unexpected withdrawals were observed
    and it was unlikely for the trial to meet its objectives

          -  Subjects must be of good health

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Male subjects who are not willing, or whose partners are not willing, to use
             appropriate contraception (such as condom with spermicidal
             foam/gel/film/cream/suppository), or who are not willing to refrain from donating
             sperm from the time of the first dose until 3 months after the final dosing occasion.

          -  Male subjects whose partners are of child bearing potential must also agree to use an
             additional highly effective method of contraception

          -  Subjects who have received any prescribed systemic or topical medication within 14
             days of the first dose administration unless in the opinion of the Investigator the
             medication will not interfere with the study procedures or compromise safety.

          -  Subjects who have used any non-prescribed systemic or topical medication (including
             herbal remedies) within 7 days of the first dose administration of midazolam.

          -  Subjects who have received any medications, including St John's Wort (or other dietary
             restriction), known to chronically alter drug absorption or elimination processes
             (change enzyme levels) within 30 days of the first dose administration of midazolam.

          -  Subjects who are still participating in a clinical study (e.g. attending follow-up
             visits) or who have participated in a clinical study involving administration of an
             investigational drug (new chemical entity) or a marketed drug within the past 3 months
             prior to the first dosing occasion.

          -  Subjects who have donated any blood, plasma or platelets in 3 months prior to

          -  Subjects who have a supine blood pressure and supine pulse rate at screening higher
             than 140/90 mmHg and 100 beats per minute (bpm), respectively, or lower than 90/50
             mmHg and 45 bpm, respectively.

             administration.

          -  Subjects with, or with a history of, any clinically significant neurological,
             gastrointestinal (GI), renal, hepatic, cardiovascular, psychiatric, respiratory,
             metabolic, endocrine, haematological, dermatological or other major disorders as
             determined by the Investigator.

          -  Subjects who have had a clinically significant illness within 4 weeks of the start of
             dose administration as determined by the Investigator.

          -  Subjects who are known to have serum hepatitis, or who are carriers of the hepatitis B
             surface antigen (HBsAg) or hepatitis C antibody, or who have a positive result to the
             test for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) antibodies.

          -  Active tuberculosis or history of incompletely treated tuberculosis, based on medical
             history or medical report, or tuberculosis test at screening.

          -  Subjects who, in the opinion of their General Practitioner or the Investigator, should
