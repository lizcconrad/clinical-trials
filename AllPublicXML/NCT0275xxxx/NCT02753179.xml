  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with chronic bilateral vestibular hypofunction may suffer from a visual instability
      during head movement called oscillopsia. Visual consequence of vestibular deficit can lead to
      a severe impairment of their quality of life. However, correcting saccades during rapid head
      movement, called covert-saccades, have been more recently identified. These saccades, which
      occur during the head movement in patients with vestibular hypofunction, present a very short
      latency. They could compensate for the lack of vestibular-ocular reflex and greatly decrease
      oscillopsia and visual impairment. The objective of this study is to evaluate the potential
      functional benefice of these compensatory movements in a population of 20 patients with
      chronic bilateral areflexia, in a cross-sectional study.

    <description>Head Impulse Tests are performed by the clinician who holds the patient's head in his hands, while he is looking straight at an earth-fixed target; then by turning the patient's head abruptly and unpredictably to the left or right, up or down through a small angle (only 10-20 degrees - not a large angle). 20 impulses in each directions (6) will be performed.</description>
