  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study will be to determine the effects of pilocarpine as an adjunct
      medication to latanoprost monotherapy at multiple intervals throughout a 24-hour period and
      compare these effects to latanoprost alone.

      This study plans to learn more about the effect of pilocarpine on intraocular pressure and
      ocular perfusion pressure for a full twenty-four hour period.

      In this study, the investigators seek to better characterize the knowledge base of the
      intraocular pressure (IOP) lowering effects of pilocarpine in patients with open angle
      glaucoma or ocular hypertension who are currently taking latanoprost. The goal is to define
      the potential additive effect of pilocarpine throughout a 24-hour period, not only for IOP,
      but for ocular perfusion pressure (defined as 2/3[diastolicBP + 1/3(systolicBP -
      diastolicBP)] - IOP). These data will allow to expand current knowledge of the effects of
      pilocarpine and help determine if this medication has a useful role as an adjunctive
      treatment in glaucoma.

    <description>Subjects will be enrolled at the first visit. Patients already on latanoprost may proceed immediately with the second visit. Patients on a different prostaglandin analog medication will be switched to latanoprost for at least 6 weeks. At second visit, intraocular pressure and blood pressure will be measured every 2 hours for a 24-hour period. At any point over the next 4 weeks, another 24-hour visit will be performed. This time, a dose of pilocarpine 2% will be administered at 3 different times in addition to the latanoprost . As before, intraocular pressure and blood pressure will be measured every 2 hours. After visit 3, subjects will return to their prior treatment regimen. Change in the intraocular pressure from the second and the third visit will be determined.</description>
