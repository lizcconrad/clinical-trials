      The aim of this study is to evaluate sit-stand phases and gait speed detection using an
      externally worn Reveal LINQTM compared to an external reference (3D accelerometer, and/or the
      Computer Assisted Rehabilitation Environment (CAREN) system) in one center in the Netherlands

    <textblock>
      Frailty is a geriatric syndrome characterized by reduced homeostatic reserves, exposing the
      organism to extreme vulnerability to endogenous and exogenous stressors.

      Frailty is prevalent in older people and involves a progressive physiological decline of
      multiple body systems, typical signs and symptoms include weight loss, fatigue, muscle
      weakness, slow or unsteady gait declines in activity.

      Frailty is increasingly recognized as an important prognostic indicator in heart failure (HF)
      and is more prevalent in HF than the general population.

      The identification of frailty in its early stage is important because interventions may
      potentially prevent, or delay the clinical consequences of frailty.

      Of particular focus in this study will be walking speed as prior research has demonstrated
      that slow gait speed has the strongest prognostic ability of the traditional components used
      to assess frailty, and has been reported as one of the strongest to predict adverse outcomes,
      such as mobility disability, falls, or hospitalization.

      Also of interest is the detection of posture changes as this may have implications for
      detecting changes in sleeping habits and could also provide context for other biomarker
      signals collected by the LINQ device.

      The literature has been reviewed and the scientific soundness of the proposed analytical
      techniques evaluated. The rationale for this study design is to evaluate the feasibility of
      using the Reveal LINQ™ to monitoring walking patterns.

      HF patients (the target population for the study in discussion) would make it possible to
      test the sensitivity of the accelerometer embedded in the LINQ device in a small cohort of
      subjects with reduced mobility and for which frailty is more prevalent than the general
      population, as well as recognized as an important prognostic indicator.

      No risk to the subjects is expected with this study.

    <description>Single arm, all the patients enrolled will perform the same walking exercises.
On arrival to the rehabilitation center subjects will have the Reveal LINQ, the 3D-accelerometers (one on the chest by medical-grade adhesives and a second at the level of the waist over the top of a medical grade adhesive) and the Holter attached externally. Then, they will be asked to perform the following exercises:
Walking Exercises-4 Meter Gait Speed (4MGS) Test Walking exercises - Six Minute Walk (6MW) Test
Walking exercises - 4 Meter Gait Speed (4MGS) Test
Walking Exercises - Five Times Sit to Stand (FTSTS) Test

    <description>The Six Minute Walk (6MW) Test measures the distance an individual is able to walk over a total of six minutes on a flat surface. The goal is for the individual to walk as far as possible in six minutes.

    <description>The 4 Meter Gait Speed (4MGS) Test measures the gait speed an individual is able to walk over 4 meters on a flat surface. The goal is for the individual to walk as fast as possible over 4 meters.
It will be repeated 3 times within the aforementioned 6MW test (after approximately 1, 3 and 5 minutes) to get variability due to subject tiredness. The test will be performed within the CAREN system environment. - single arm</description>
