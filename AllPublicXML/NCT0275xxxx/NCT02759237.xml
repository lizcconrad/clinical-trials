    <textblock>
      The Medtronic Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implant System (CoreValve System Family) has been
      demonstrated to be safe and effective for high through extreme risk patients with symptomatic
      severe native aortic stenosis or a stenosed, insufficient, or combined surgical bioprosthetic
      valve failure. Per DCGI systematic post marketing surveillance requirement, the purpose of
      this PMS plan is to provide local post marketing surveillance data regarding the safety of
      Medtronic CoreValve System Family

      The objective of this PMS will be to monitor and gather data on the safety of The Medtronic
      Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implant System (CoreValve System Family) in the approved intended
      use.

      The main focus of this PMS will be to generate additional information and report on all major
      adverse events up to 30 days from the day of implant procedure.
