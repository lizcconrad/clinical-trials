      The purpose of this study is to test whether a novel form of biofeedback training can help
      individuals regulate their pain more effectively.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Relaxation is a low-cost treatment for managing pain with little or no side effects. The
      proposed study will use a novel biofeedback procedure to try to enhance the ability of
      relaxation to engage pain inhibition. Specifically, a biofeedback system will be used to
      provide training in conditioned pain regulation. The biofeedback system will monitor the
      trainee's level of sympathetic arousal and use it to control the intensity of painful
      stimulations delivered to the trainee during biofeedback. So when the trainee successfully
      relaxes (and reduced arousal), the intensity is lowered and produces pain relief. Efficacy of
      the training will be tested in a randomized controlled trial in which healthy, pain-free
      trainees are assigned to receive 3 training sessions or 3 sessions of a control procedure (2
      other procedures will serve as controls; 3 groups total). The aim will be to assess whether
      the training results in inhibition of experimental pain and the nociceptive flexion reflex
      (NFR, a physiological marker of spinal pain signaling) to determine whether brain-to-spinal
      cord inhibitory circuits are engaged.

    <description>Participants will receive brief training in relaxation and biofeedback to develop basic skills in relaxation/arousal reduction. Then they will receive instructions to relax and reduce arousal as they view graphical arousal feedback. Electric stimulations will be delivered throughout the biofeedback to provide pain relief when relaxation is achieved.</description>
