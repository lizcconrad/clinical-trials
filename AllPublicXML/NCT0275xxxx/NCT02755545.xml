    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of 2 acne treatments for 24 weeks of
      use in adult men and women with mild to moderate facial acne, at least 5 inflammatory
      lesions, and at least 10 - 100 non-inflammatory lesions.

      Objective:

        1. To characterize the effectiveness of the acne treatment in lesion count at week 1, week
           2, week 6, week 12, and week 24 as compared to baseline and compare between treatments

        2. To characterize the effectiveness of the acne treatment in Investigator's Global
           Improvement Assessment at week 1, week 2, week 6, week 12, and week 24 as compared to
           baseline and compare between treatments

        3. To characterize the effect of the acne treatment in clinical grading of efficacy
           parameters through digital images at week 6, week 12, and week 24 as compared to
           baseline and compare between treatments

        4. To characterize the effect of the acne treatment in subject self-assessment
           questionnaire responses at week 1, week 2, week 6, week 12, and week 24 as compared to
           baseline and compare between treatments
