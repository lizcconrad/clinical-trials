  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is a single-center, multiple-arm investigation of co-administration of Uprifosbuvir
      (MK-3682) 450 mg and Ruzasvir (MK-8408) 60 mg in participants with chronic Hepatitis C Virus
      (HCV) Genotype (GT)1, GT2, GT3, GT4, GT5, or GT6. The impact of the study treatment regimen
      on Sustained Virologic Response (SVR)12 (undetectable HCV ribonucleic acid [RNA] 12 weeks
      after ending study treatment) for each HCV Genotype will be evaluated in cirrhotic
      participants and non-cirrhotic participants.
