      Affective disorders are associated with a substantial personal and socio-economic burden.
      This study evaluates an intensive brief stress-coping intervention week (ISCIW) as feasible
      follow-up treatment for real world patients who suffer from this highly prevalent and chronic
      stress-related disorders. Stress-associated blood (Interleukin-6, Homocystein,
      Myeloperoxidase), saliva cortisol and psychosocial screening parameters will be analyzed to
      determine who will benefit from the ISCIW. All patients were identified in a preventive
      medical screening before pre-treatment for at least three month as outpatient and the
      following inclusion to the follow-up ISCIW-trial at the Health and Prevention Center,
      Sanatorium Hera, Vienna, Austria. For the three planed groups and interventions see
      interventions and arms.
