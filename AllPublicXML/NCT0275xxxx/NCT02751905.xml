    <textblock>
      The primary objectives of the study are: To determine the mass balance and routes of
      elimination of BIIB074 and its known metabolites following administration of a single oral
      dose of BIIB074 in healthy male participants and To describe the pharmacokinetics (PK) of
      BIIB074 and its known metabolites and the disposition profiles of total radioactivity in
      whole blood and plasma following a single oral dose. The secondary objectives of this study
      are: To assess the safety and tolerability of BIIB074 in healthy participants and To identify
      and characterize any additional metabolites of BIIB074 in plasma, urine, and feces.

        Key Inclusion Criteria:

          -  All subjects must practice effective contraception during the study and be willing and
             able to continue contraception for 90 days after the administration of study
             treatment.

          -  Must be in good health as determined by the Investigator, based on medical history and
             screening evaluations.

        Key Exclusion Criteria:

          -  History of any clinically significant cardiac, endocrine, gastrointestinal,
             hematologic, hepatic, immunologic, metabolic, urologic, pulmonary, neurologic,
             dermatologic, psychiatric, or renal disease, or other major disease, as determined by
             the Investigator.

          -  Previous exposure to BIIB074.

          -  Other unspecified reasons that, in the opinion of the Investigator or Biogen, make the
             subject unsuitable for enrollment.

        NOTE: Other protocol defined Inclusion/Exclusion criteria may apply.
