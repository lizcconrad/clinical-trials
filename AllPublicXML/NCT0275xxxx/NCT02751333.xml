  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Esophageal stents are commonly used for benign esophageal pathology, especially strictures or
      esophageal mucosal defects such as leaks, fistulae, or perforations. The major limiting
      factor to stent placement is the high migration rate of the stent. Investigators are trying
      to prospectively evaluate the efficacy of endostitch in preventing stent migration in benign
      esophageal disease in comparison with standard, fully covered self-expanding metal stents
      (FCSEMS) placement without fixation.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The use of removable, fully covered self-expanding metal stents (FCSEMS) in the management of
      benign esophageal pathology has been increasingly applied in recent years. Several studies
      have shown promising results with its application in esophageal perforation, fistula, or
      leak, and refractory benign strictures. However, the major limiting factor to successful
      treatment with FCSEMS in this setting is the substantial migration rates.

      Different strategies has been used to secure esophageal stents but to little success. Several
      tertiary institutions including investigators have adopted the use of endostitch (ES) with
      the OverStitchTM system (Apollo Endosurgery, Austin, Texas) as the preferred method for stent
      fixation. Animal ex-vivo studies have confirmed the greater anchoring ability and tensile
      strength with this method when compared to esophageal stenting alone or with through the
      endoscope clip fixation while retrospective series have shown promising results with lower
      rates of stent migration when compared to conventional stent insertion. However, although the
      use of endostitch stent fixation has been used in several centers in the United-States with
      strong retrospective data (including investigators data), no prospective randomized
      controlled trial have confirmed its effectiveness in preventing stent migration.

    <description>General anesthesia or conscious sedation will be started and an upper endoscope will be inserted into the participants mouth and advanced into the stomach. Endoscopic stenting with a fully covered self-expanding metal stents (FCSEMS) will then be performed. Once the stent is in place, the endoscope will be withdrawn from the participant to set-up the endostitch device unto the endoscope. Bites are taken separately with the first on the esophageal mucosa followed by a second on the stent itself and finishing with a last bite on esophageal mucosa. A cinch is then used to secure the deployed suture. An attempt at placing 2 sutures will be performed. Stent removal will then be performed at 8-weeks post-stent insertion.</description>
