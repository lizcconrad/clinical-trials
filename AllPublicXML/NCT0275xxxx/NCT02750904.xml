      The study consist of two separate phases. Phase I consists of website usability testing.
      Investigators will collect feedback and incorporate the feedback into our website that is
      tailored for people with bipolar disorder. In Phase II investigators will be comparing quit
      rates of two groups both utilizing Nicotine Replacement Therapy and a website.
