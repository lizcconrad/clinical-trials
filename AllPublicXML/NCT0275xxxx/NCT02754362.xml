  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase II study to determine the immunogenicity and efficacy of a vaccine composed
      of tumor associated long synthetic peptides mixed with Montanide ISA-51 VG administered with
      polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid - poly-L-lysine carboxymethylcellulose (Poly-ICLC) and
      bevacizumab in adults with recurrent glioblastoma.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      All patients will receive the same dose of vaccine, Poly-ICLC and bevacizumab. The therapy
      consists of 3 blocks. During the first block, patients will receive bevacizumab every 2 weeks
      for 2 doses. During block 2, patients will receive vaccine + Poly-ICLC + bevacizumab on weeks
      1, 3, 5 and 7. An MRI will be performed after week 7 therapy. If there is no significant
      progression, then the patients will continue with block 3. During block 3, therapy consists
      of vaccine + Poly-ICLC monthly and bevacizumab every 2 weeks for 10 months. Keyhole limpet
      hemocyanin (KLH) will be given as a positive control with the first vaccine. Immune studies
      will be performed in all patients enrolled in this study.
