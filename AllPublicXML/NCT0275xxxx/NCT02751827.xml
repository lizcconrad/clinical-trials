  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In order to assess the important issue of the safety of antiangiogenic TKI in geriatric
      population we set up this project which aims to identify, among clinical, biological,
      pharmacokinetic data, predictive factors for severe toxicity of antiangiogenic TKI
      (sunitinib, sorafenib, pazopanib, regorafenib, axitinib) in patients over 75 year-old.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective cohort with collection of biological samples, including 300 patients &gt;
      75 year-old treated in multicenter with antiangiogenic TKI regularly approved for metastatic
      cancers. Data on clinical and biological characteristics of the patient, disease and
      treatment as well as pharmacogenomics will be centrally collected at the beginning of the
      treatment. Drug exposure-safety analyses will be performed through assessment of drug through
      levels (Cmin). Primary endpoint is severe toxicity defined as treatment-related death,
      hospitalization or disruption of treatment for more than three weeks.
