      Investigators will recruit 250 subjects; Group A will consist of 100 prediabetic patients
      with an A1c of 5.7%-6.4%. Group B will consist of 100 patients with uncontrolled T2D defined
      as either a) an A1c of 6.5%-7.9% without diabetes medications or b) an A1c ≥ 8.0% with or
      without diabetes medications. Group C will include 50 participants without T2D or known
      cardiovascular disease to serve as control comparisons.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with prediabetes have an elevated risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD).
      Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is also the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in patients
      with Type 2 Diabetes. There remains an unmet clinical need to identify modifiable risk
      factors for CVD in patients with disordered glucose homeostasis, including prediabetes and
      T2D. Exposure to inorganic arsenic and other environmental toxicants may be novel targets for
      CVD risk reduction for these patients. However, there have been no clinical studies of
      environmental exposures on vascular function and thrombotic risk among patients with
      prediabetes and growing understanding of environmental exposures as modifiable risk factors
      for CVD, and can have an impact by: (1) describing the role of environmental exposures for
      patients with or at risk for T2D; (2) identifying T2D patients at higher risk for the adverse
      biological effects of environmental exposures; and (3) informing health policies and
      treatment pathways to reduce the risk of these exposures.

      Investigators will evaluate the association between inorganic arsenic exposure and measures
      of vascular function, estimate the association between inorganic arsenic exposure and
      measures of thrombotic risk and will explore the independent association between
      environmental exposures other than inorganic arsenic and measures of vascular function and
      thrombotic risk.
