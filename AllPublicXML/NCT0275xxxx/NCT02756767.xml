      The goals of this study are to assess the feasibility of weekly administration of site
      specific patient reported assessments using an electronic platform and to explore the
      correlation between patient reported outcomes as well as known dosimetric prognostic factors
      in patients with lung, breast, head and neck, or pelvic malignancies

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with breast cancer, lung cancer, head and neck cancer, or gynecologic cancer
             receiving definitive external beam radiotherapy.

          -  Must be â‰¥ 18 years of age

          -  Able to read, write, and speak English in order to complete patient reported outcomes.

        Patients will be approached about the study at the time of consultation or at the time of
        simulation by their treating physicians or by a research coordinator. All patients must
        sign a study-specific informed consent to participate. All patients, including those who do
        not choose to consent to the study, will be provided with a short survey to assess health
        literacy using the eHealth Literacy Scale (eHEALS).

        For those not consenting to the study, the survey will be de-identified and will also ask
        for basic demographic information including age grouping, race, education level, and type
        of cancer.
