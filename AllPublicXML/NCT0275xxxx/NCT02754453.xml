      There are three different phases to this study:

        1. Screening phase to determine if you are eligible to participate in the study.

        2. Study phase, which will entail diet and activity, exercise and then finally self
           monitoring goals.

        3. End of treatment phase where you will be asked to complete questionnaires.

      The purpose of this study is to determine the feasibility of a group treatment program for
      individuals experiencing weight regain after bariatric surgery and to evaluate the
      effectiveness of the group treatment program. There is little information on programs to
      assist patients who experience weight regain after bariatric surgery. This treatment program
      will focus on behavioral changes and activity.

    <description>The overall goal of the project is to collect pilot data for a RO1 application. The primary outcome will be kg lost and BMI units lost from pre- to post-treatment. The effect size (Mean1 - Mean2 / pooled s.d.) of the intervention will be determined for within subject and between subject differences. It is hypothesized that a moderate effect size (.5) will be demonstrated and that has been selected a priori as the criteria for pursuing a larger-scale randomized clinical trial.</description>
