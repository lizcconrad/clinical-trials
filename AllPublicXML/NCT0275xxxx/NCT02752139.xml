      Sleep disorders continue to be the most unrecognized modifiable risk factor for stroke. The
      relationship between sleep disorders and vascular risk factors and stroke has been
      well-documented but not fully understood. The investigators hypothesize hemodynamics
      impairment to be its potential mechanism. It has been reported that sleep-related breathing
      disorder, a type of sleep disorders, contributed as a risk factor for stroke through
      hemodynamic and hematologic changes. The purpose of this study is to determine the
      relationship between sleep disorders and cerebral hemodynamics. The dynamic cerebral
      auto-regulation (dCA) and Transcranial Doppler (TCD) will be used to evaluate cerebral
      hemodynamics.

    <description>A dynamic cerebral auto-regulation parameter derived from transfer function analysis.Continuous cerebral blood flow velocities of bilateral middle cerebral artery will be assessed noninvasively using transcranial Doppler. Spontaneous arterial blood pressure will be simultaneously recorded using a servo-controlled plethysmograph on the left or right middle finger with an appropriate finger cuff size. Transfer function analysis will be used to derive the autoregulatory parameters.</description>

        The investigators conducted a prospective study of consecutive patients with sleep
        disorders treated at the Department of Neurology, First Hospital of Jilin University,
        China, from March 2016 to March 2017. Each patient was diagnosed with intrinsic sleep
        disorders by two neurologists according to the Diagnostic Criteria for Sleep Dyssomnias.
