    <textblock>
      Parkinson's disease (PD) affects between 1% and 2% of the world's population aged 60 and
      older; in Europe the prevalence is around 150 PD patients per 100,000 individuals. PD is
      classically characterized by a symptomatic triad that includes rest tremor, akinesia and
      hypertonia and although the motor expression of the symptoms involves mainly the limbs, the
      muscles implicated in speech production are also subject to specific dysfunctions. Motor
      speech disorders, so-called dysarthria, can thus be developed by PD patients. The main
      objective of our project is to evaluate the physiological parameters (acoustics), perceptual
      markers (intelligibility) and psychosocial impact of dysarthric speech in PD, in the context
      of language (French vs. Portuguese) modulations. Acoustic parameters are expected to be
      physiologically-based, linked with the motoric aspects of dysarthric speech. The same degree
      of impairment of such parameters should be associated with the pathology and be present
      universally in all patients, even if they speak different languages; that should be also the
      case of prosodic markers, whereas impairment of speech intelligibility may participate to the
      psychosocial impact in communication alteration.

      PD patients will be enrolled in the study in Aix-en-Provence (N = 60) and Lisbon (N = 60).
      Their global motor disability will be assessed with dedicated clinical rating scales, without
      (off) and with (on) pharmacological treatment. Two groups of 60 healthy age-matched
      volunteers will provide the normal reference for between-group comparisons. Along with the
      off and on medication clinical examinations, several speech tasks will be recorded. Moreover,
      speech organ functions will also be assessed during the same examination. The psychosocial
      impact of dysarthria will be evaluated via self-questionnaires; it will be analysed a
      posteriori, as well as the speech intelligibility evaluation, and both will strengthen the
      overall speech assessments. This global investigation will represent a unique opportunity to
      provide the most precise and reliable description of PD patients' speech and its impacts on
      intelligibility and quality of life. Challenging and interdisciplinary aspects are combined
      in our project, which original cross-linguistic approach involves an international
      collaboration definitely new in the field of motor speech disorders.

      Background - Individuals with Parkinson's disease (PD) have to deal with several aspects that
      contribute to voice and speech decline and thus, alteration of communication ability during
      the course of the disease: (i) The orofacial motor dysfunction, so-called dysarthria, which
      depends on the neurodegenerative processes; (ii) The effects of the medical treatment, which
      vary according to the disease stage; and (iii) The particular speech modifications that can
      be language-specific, i.e. dependent on the language spoken by the patients. The main
      objective of the FralusoPark project is to evaluate changes in dysarthric speech in PD as a
      result of medical treatment and disease duration using acoustic parameters (voice and
      prosody), perceptual markers (intelligibility), and patient-based outcomes (the psychosocial
      impact on quality of life) in two different languages (French vs. European Portuguese).

      Methods - Individuals with PD will be enrolled in the study in Aix-en-Provence, France (N =
      60) and Lisbon, Portugal (N = 60). Their global motor disability and orofacial motor
      functions will be assessed with specific clinical rating scales, without (OFF) and with (ON)
      medical treatment. Two groups of 60 healthy age-matched volunteers will provide the reference
      for between-group comparisons. Along with the clinical examinations, several speech tasks
      will be recorded to obtain acoustic and perceptual measures. Self-evaluation questionnaires
      will be used to assess the psychosocial impact of dysarthria on quality of life.

      Discussion - Our three a priori hypotheses are the following: (i) Global acoustic features
      are altered similarly in French and Portuguese individuals with PD; (ii) Language-specific
      prosodic patterns might be altered differently according to the language spoken by the
      patients; and (iii) The impact of speech disorders on intelligibility and quality of life
      depends on the cultural and linguistic environment. The study combines an interdisciplinary
      and cross-linguistic approach to study motor speech disorders and will allow for a better
      understanding of the progression of speech symptoms in PD and their response to medical
      treatment. It will provide recommendations on how to assess speech and voice disorders in
      individuals with PD in order to monitor symptom progression and management.

    <description>Participants are recorded while performing several tasks and the acoustic measures characterize dimensions of aero-phonatory control. For example, for the steady vowel /a/ phonation, two kinds of measures will be extracted: First, for a macro-analysis: fundamental frequency (F0, Hertz) and F0 variation (%); and second, for a micro-analysis: perturbation measures such as jitter factor (%), absolute shimmer (dB), and harmonics-to-noise ratio (HNR, %). For the maximal phonation time, the longest duration (in seconds) of the sustained vowel /a/ will be extracted.</description>

    <description>The neurological assessment is the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale, using the revised version provided by the Movement Disorders Society (MDS-UPDRS).

    <description>Patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs), such as the Dysarthria Impact Profile (DIP), are used to obtain self-reported information about the functional impact of their speech/communication impairment. Additional self-assessments focus on the patients' perception of their quality of life (the 39-Item Parkinson's Disease Questionnaire [PDQ-39]) and on how voice/speech impairment may induce a handicap (Voice Handicap Index, VHI). The French and European Portuguese adapted DIP, VHI and PDQ-39 will be used in our study. The Patient Global Impression (PGI) scoring, and the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) are also administered. The MDS-UPDRS also includes a patient self-assessment (sections 1.B and 2), which are administered together with the other questionnaires under medication.</description>
