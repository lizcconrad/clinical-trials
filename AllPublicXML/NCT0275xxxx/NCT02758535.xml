    <textblock>
      Percutaneous image-guided parenchymal renal biopsy has been used to detect the different
      pathologies of renal parenchyma, to define the degree of reversible changes, and to define
      when the medical treatment fails. Percutaneous core needle renal biopsy has been reported to
      have a higher diagnostic yield compared to fine needle aspiration. Percutaneous core needle
      renal biopsy is usually based on tissue sampling under guidance of either sonography or
      computed tomography. Renal parenchymal biopsy can be done either with a coaxial or noncoaxial
      technique. In coaxial technique, the introducing needle is placed in the renal parenchyma;
      then, multiple tissue sampling can be performed throughout the same tract. Alternatively, in
      noncoaxial technique, biopsy needle is inserted repeatedly for each tissue sampling. Although
      there are some reports regarding the comparison of coaxial and noncoaxial methods of renal
      mass biopsy, comparison of the two methods in renal parenchymal biopsy has not yet been
      described in the literature. In this prospective study, the investigators sought to compare
      the procedural time and the complication rate of coaxial technique with those of noncoaxial
      technique in percutaneous renal parenchymal biopsy.

    <description>In this method, a larger introducing needle is used for the puncture. The introducing needle is advanced just to the outer cortex of the kidney, and the needle angle is adjusted so that the needle pathway became mostly in the renal cortex, then the biopsy needle is inserted throughout the introducing needle and at least 4 cores are obtained. In this technique, the skin surface is punctured only once during the procedure.</description>

    <description>In this method, introducing needle is not used. Biopsy needle punctures the skin surface and the needle is advanced to about 10-15 mm into the renal cortex, and tissue sampling is done. After each sampling, the needle is removed and then for the next biopsy, the whole procedure is repeated until four cores being taken.</description>
