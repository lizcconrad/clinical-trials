  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to learn more about the microbes (bacteria) that live in the
      vagina and the bladder. The investigators are doing this research study to understand the
      relationship between microbes (the microbiome) and the occurrence of urinary tract infection
      following surgical removal of the uterus and pelvic organ prolapse repair. The investigators
      expect Lactobacillus and Gardnerella will be the dominant organisms for most women.
      Non-Lactobacillus dominant microbiome communities will be more common in women who ultimately
      develop postoperative urinary tract infection.

      The goal of this pilot study is to characterize the presence and stability of the microbial
      community in the vagina and lower urinary tract in a cohort of 20 postmenopausal women
      undergoing transvaginal hysterectomy with pelvic reconstruction for pelvic organ prolapse.
      The investigators intend to collect longitudinal samples in the preoperative, intraoperative,
      and postoperative time period in order to understand the pervasiveness of the microbes in the
      vagina and lower urinary tract, and to identify, in a very preliminary way, particular
      microbes that may be associated with postoperative urinary tract infection.
