      The &quot;INTELLIH&quot; (brand name of the mobile health application) Diabetes Study is to understand
      the usage of a mobile health application, IntelliH, and connected wireless devices such as
      glucometer by the diabetic patients and ascertain if there are any improvements in short-term
      health outcomes.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The proposed pilot program is the first of its kind in the nation to use a product,
      &quot;IntelliH&quot; - Intelligent Health for All, that combines four key technologies in one platform:
      1) Mobile health application (mHealth) App and web portal, 2) wireless sensors and wearable
      devices, 3) Secure text messaging when both sender and receiver are logged in to the system
      and video-based patient interaction, and 4) remote health monitoring. The purpose of this
      pilot program is to understand a) usage and adoption of these technologies by providers and
      patients, and b) document the short-term improvements in health outcomes in a diabetic
      population. This pilot study will follow 20 diabetic patients (Type 1 or Type 2) as they
      beta-test this system, and will acquire data on consented subjects over a period of six
      months.

        Study participants will be recruited from the list of diabetes patients coming to
        Cedars-Sinai Medical Center for their regular treatment. Several physicians will be
        involved in making this program available to their patients. Eligible and consenting
        patients will be recruited.
