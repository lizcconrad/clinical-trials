    <textblock>
      Screening Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with Fluid-attenuated Inversion Recovery
      (FLAIR) and Susceptibility Weighted Imaging (SWI) sequences will be performed pre and post
      season on high school football players. One set of players will wear the Guardian Cap on
      their five star rated helmets and the other will wear five star rated helmets only. The
      investigators will compare outcomes of ImPACT scores and MRI findings between the two groups
      to see if there is a statistical difference in reduction of injury and to establish what the
      baseline level of MRI findings related to injury from high school football is as well as what
      the baseline level of injury is prior to the start of the season.

      season on high school football players. One set of players will wear the Guardian Cap on
      their five star rated helmets and the other will wear five star rated helmets only. The
      investigators will compare outcomes of ImPACT concussion scores and MRI findings on FLAIR and
      SWI sequences between the two groups to see if there is a statistical difference in reduction
      of MRI findings on FLAIR and SWI sequences or adverse ImPACT concussion score outcomes and to
      establish what the baseline level of MRI findings on FLAIR and SWI sequences related to
      injury from high school football is as well as what the baseline level of MRI findings on
      FLAIR and SWI is prior to the start of the season.
