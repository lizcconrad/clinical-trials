      Background:

      Prostate cancer is the most common non-skin cancer in U.S. men. Treatments for early or less
      aggressive disease are limited. Researchers want to test a device that destroys cancerous
      tissue with laser energy. They want to see if using it with ultrasound is more comfortable
      than using it with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).

      Objectives:

      To test a cooled laser applicator system to treat prostate cancer lesions. To see if
      ultrasound imaging is a practical and feasible treatment with laser ablation for focal
      prostate cancer treatment.

      Eligibility:

      Men at least 18 years old with prostate cancer seen on MRI that has not spread in the body.

      Design:

      Participants will be screened with standard cancer care tests. These can include physical
      exam, lab tests, and MRI. For the MRI, they lie in a machine that takes pictures.
      Participants will have a prostate biopsy. Needle samples will be taken from 12 places in the
      prostate. This will be guided by MRI and ultrasound, which is obtained through a coil in the
      rectum.

      Participants will stay at the clinic for 1 2 days. A cooling catheter (plastic tube) will be
      put in the bladder. Ultrasound will guide the laser applicator directly to the tumor.

      The cooling catheter will be removed. A different catheter will be put in the urethra to keep
      the bladder emptied.

      The next day, participants will have a physical exam and a PSA blood test.

      Participants will have 6 follow-up visits over 3 years. At each visit, they will have a
      physical exam and lab tests. At some visits, they will also have an MRI or other scans and a
      prostate biopsy.

      Background:

        -  Pilot study to evaluate the feasibility of real time ultrasound imaging to guide focal
           thermal ablation of low risk focal prostate tumors

        -  Prostate cancer is relatively slow growing, with doubling times for local tumors
           estimated at 2 to 4 years.

        -  Recent patient series suggest that 20% to 30% of men undergoing radical prostatectomy
           have pathologic features in the radical prostatectomy

      specimen consistent with an insignificant or &quot;indolent&quot; cancer that poses little threat to
      life or health.

        -  An NIH/NCI protocol #11-C-0158 titled MR Image guided focal laser ablation therapy of
           prostate cancer has treated 15 patients without major complication over the past 5
           years. Out of 15 patients, 3 have had evidence of disease recurrence. This data is being
           prepared for publication (verbal communication with Peter Pinto, MD, principal
           investigator); however, it requires a very long and resource-intensive MRI imaging,
           which may be a barrier to broad translation to the community setting. Specialized custom
           and expensive MRI-compatible equipment is also required. Focal laser ablation for
           prostate cancer using the Medtronic-Visualase laser is FDA cleared.

        -  Focal thermal ablation such as laser ablation or cryosurgery are standard of care
           therapies for prostate cancer, with cancer control comparable to that of external beam
           radiotherapy and brachytherapy.

        -  NIH / NCI clinical trials have performed MRI + ultrasound (US) fusion biopsy in nearly
           1500 patients, greater than 30,000 biopsies over the past 12 years.

        -  We propose to perform ultrasound (US) guided focal thermal ablation with fusion
           visualization and co-display of pre-acquired MRI during the treatment of patients

      Objectives:

      - To determine the feasibility of treating biopsy-confirmed US-targetable and/or
      MR-visible,low to intermediate grade prostate tumor(s) using ultrasound (US) image-guided
      focal interstitial thermal ablation.

      Eligibility:

        -  Patients must have organ confined, biopsy-confirmed, low or intermediate risk prostate
           cancer that is either US-targetable or MR visible or both.

        -  Men greater than or equal to 18 years of age.

      Design:

        -  Pilot study, testing feasibility of ultrasound-guided thermal ablation of focal prostate
           cancer.

        -  A total of 30 patients will be enrolled to yield 20 evaluable patients.
