    <textblock>
      The investigators hypothesis is that we can determine estrogen and progesterone levels in the
      hair by using the immune method and we can show a significant difference in the levels of
      these hormones in both groups of women: pre- and postmenopausal women. If indeed it would
      then be possible in future to carry out research that can find a relationship between the
      levels of these hormones and various diseases

      One group will include 20 women under the age 40 years old, with regular menstruation cycles
      and without any illness or medication including birth control pills or steroidal ointments,
      and without known diagnosis of polycystic ovaries or fertility disorder. The second group
      will include 20 women over the age of 60, with no menstruation at least for the last five
      years, and without hormone therapy or treatment of any Steroidal therapy for the last year.

      From all of the participants the investigators will collect hair samples at the crown back of
      the head (hair will be cut as close as possible to the scalp), the samples will be measured
      quantitatively about 100 hairs at a length of 2-3 cm. In order to grind the hair samples we
      will use a mini-Bead beater machine. milled hairs will be incubated overnight in a solution
      of 1 ml methanol 50, in constant gentle muddling. Afterwards, ethanol will disperse through a
      stream of nitrogen. The remainder of the suspension will be dissolved at 200 microliter
      buffer PBS (Phosphate-Buffered Saline) (pH 8.0) and the concentration of estrogen and
      progesterone will be measured by using the immune method which is available in the endocrine
      laboratory in Bnai Zion medical center. At the end of the study the investigators will cary
      out a statistical comparison of progesterone and estrogen levels between the two groups.
