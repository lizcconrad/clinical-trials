  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (allo-HCT) is a potentially curative therapy
      for patients with hematologic malignancies including acute myeloid leukemia (AML),
      myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), and acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL); however, human
      leukocyte antigen (HLA)-matched donor availability continues to be a major hurdle.
      Historically, HLA haploidentical donor hematopoietic cell transplantation (haplo-HCT) was
      associated with high incidences of graft rejection and excessive non-relapse mortality (NRM),
      but recent advances utilizing post-transplant cyclophosphamide (PT-Cy) have revolutionized
      haplo-HCT and the outcomes are now comparable to allo-HCT using more traditional HLA matched
      related and unrelated donors. However, graft-versus-host disease (GvHD) continues to be a
      problem and is associated with significant morbidity and mortality in allo-HCT patients
      including those who receive haplo-HCT on PT-Cy platform. The aim of this early phase study is
      to investigate the safety and overall efficacy of azacitidine in reducing the incidence and
      severity of GvHD when added to PT-Cy based haplo-HCT platform for patients with AML, ALL, or
      advanced MDS.
