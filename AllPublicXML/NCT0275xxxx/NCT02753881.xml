  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with primary and secondary liver cancer may participate in this study. The purpose
      is to perform an analysis of the effects of doxorubicin and its metabolite doxorubicinol on
      the body (doxorubicin pharmacokinetics ) after conventional transarterial chemoembolization
      (cTACE). cTACE is a procedure in which chemotherapy drugs are injected, followed by an
      injection of small beads to block the tumor-feeding arteries. Doxorubicin is a
      chemotherapeutic agent used in the cTACE procedure. This study will examine doxorubicin
      pharmacokinetics in patients who: 1) receive whole liver cTACE; and 2) receive
      super-selective CTACE (i.e., delivered in close proximity to the tumor).

      Patients with primary and secondary liver cancer may participate in this study. The purpose
      is to perform an analysis of the effects of doxorubicin and its metabolite doxorubicinol on
      the body (doxorubicin pharmacokinetics ) after conventional transarterial chemoembolization
      (cTACE). A pharmacokinetics profile (PK profile) will be constructed and will include peak of
      plasma concentration (Cmax), time of maximum concentration (TMax), and area under the
      concentration curve (AUC). This composite measure will be used to compare patients in cTACE
      lobar administration and cTACE superselective administration. In addition, the PK profile
      will be correlated with toxicity, tumor burden, body surface area, and gender. Feasibility
      and safety will also be assessed.
