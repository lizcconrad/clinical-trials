  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), non-invasive mechanical ventilation
      (NIV) is usually initiated in an in-hospital regime. The investigators evaluated if NIV
      initiated in an outpatient setting can be as effective as regards patients' adherence. The
      investigators also evaluated factors predicting NIV adherence and disease progression.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      All patients with a definite ALS diagnosis, aged &gt; 18 years, referred to the ALS outpatient
      clinics of the Fondazione Salvatore Maugeri Institute of Lumezzane (Brescia) and Istituto Don
      Gnocchi Onlus (Milano), Italy, for respiratory functional assessments for the purpose of
      early initiation of NIV were considered. Patients who were in clinically stable condition and
      without chest infections during the previous 3 months were considered eligible for the study.

      Between March 2011 and March 2014, during an outpatient visit, the patients were randomized
      1:1 to two groups for NIV initiation: outpatient vs. inpatient protocol.

      In both groups a diurnal NIV initiation trial was performed using pressure-support
      ventilators in spontaneous/timed mode with a preset tidal volume (300 ml/kg) and a fixed
      back-up respiratory rate (12 breaths/min). The trial included: choice of the mask, setting of
      ventilator pressure, at least 2 hours of NIV under supervision.

      Then, the patients underwent the nighttime NIV initiation trial for a maximum of 20 nights
      according to the outpatient vs. inpatient protocol.

      NIV trial was stopped when: 1) patients used NIV &gt; 4 hours/night for 3 consecutive nights, 2)
      patients and caregivers were able to manage with ventilator, 3) patients failed after 10
      consecutive educational sessions.

      At enrollment (T0), the end of NIV initiation trial (T1) and after 3 months from the end of
      the trial (T2) respiratory function tests, blood gas analysis, and sleep study were
      performed.

      At T1 the investigators assessed NIV acceptance (as a minimum of 3 consecutive days &gt;4
      h/night), and dyspnea symptoms by VAS (day/night), staff and patients' satisfaction.

      At T2: NIV adherence (&gt;120 h/month) and patients' satisfaction.

    <description>In-hospital nightime NIV initiation. For the inpatients Group, NIV was initiated in the respiratory wards of the two hospitals and continued during night for a minimum of 4 hours/night.
Inpatients had a 24-h availability of health staff care. During the night, they had nurses and physicians available on-hand.</description>

A minimum of 4 hours/night was required. No support during the night was provided to these patients.</description>
