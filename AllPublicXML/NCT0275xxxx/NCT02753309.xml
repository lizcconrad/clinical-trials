        Inclusion Criteria:

             T1) bladder cancer

          -  In their treating physician's opinion is a good candidate for BCG therapy

          -  Be able to give informed consent

          -  Be age 18 or older

          -  Not be in an immunosuppressed state (e.g. HIV, use of chronic steroids)

          -  Not have active, uncontrolled infections

          -  Not be on agents known to alter rapamycin metabolism significantly

          -  Not have a reported history of liver disease (e.g. cirrhosis)

          -  Not have a prior history of non-bladder cancer unless the cancer is clinically stable
             and not requiring active treatment except basal cell carcinoma or squamous cell
             carcinoma of the skin.

          -  Not pregnant, or taking effective contraception before rapamycin therapy, during
             therapy and for 12 weeks after discontinuation of therapy.

             cell carcinoma of the skin)

          -  Patients at risk of pregnancy who are unwilling or unable to take effective
             contraception before rapamycin therapy, during therapy, and for 12 weeks after
             discontinuation of therapy.
