  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study, peptide receptor radionuclide therapy (PRRT) with 177Lu-Octreotate (LuTate)
      will be personalized, i.e. administered activity of LuTate will be tailored for each patient
      to maximize absorbed radiation dose to tumor, while limiting that to healthy organs.

      The purpose of this study is to:

        -  Assess the objective (radiological), symptomatic and biochemical response rates
           following an induction course of personalized PRRT;

        -  Assess the overall, the disease-specific, and the progression-free survival following
           P-PRRT;

        -  Correlate therapeutic response and survival with tumor absorbed radiation dose;

        -  Evaluate the acute, subacute and chronic adverse events following P-PRRT;

        -  Correlate toxicity (i.e. occurence and severity of adverse events) with absorbed
           radiation doses to organs at risk;

        -  Optimize the quantitative SPECT imaging-based dosimetry methods in a subset of 20
           patients (sub-study funded by the Canadian Institutes of Health Research).

      This study also has a compassionate purpose, which is to provide access to PRRT to patients.

      A prospective, single-center, non-comparative, open phase 2 study. In this study,
      personalized peptide receptor radionuclide therapy (P-PRRT) with 177Lu-Octreotate (LuTate)
      will be administered to patients with progressive and/or symptomatic inoperable
      neuroendocrine tumors (NET) of any origin expressing the somatostatin receptor.

      The primary objective to assess the objective response rate at 3 months following a
      four-cycle induction course of P-PRRT will be assessed for the first 85 participants.

      This study as a compassionate aim to provide access to PRRT patients at CHU de Québec -
      Université Laval center, and therefore this study has no pre-determined recruitment period
      duration or limited number of participants, and may remain open as long as necessary to
      fulfill this aim.

      The study will continue until all participants have completed a minimum follow-up of 5 years.
      Interim analyses will be conducted annually.

    <description>177Lu-Octreotate (LuTate) P-PRRT will be administered as follows:
Renal absorbed radiation dose will be prescribed for the 4-cycle induction course (23 Gy) and for each subsequent cycle (6 Gy), with a reduction in cases of impaired renal or bone marrow function, or significant toxicity from prior cycles.
The personalized activity to be administered at each cycle will be derived from renal dose per unit of injected activity that is predicted by patient characteristics or renal dose delivered during prior cycle(s).
Participants responding to the induction course of P-PRRT will be eligible to receive additional consolidation and/or maintenance cycles.
Participants with prior PRRT exposure outside the trial may receive less induction cycles, or only consolidation/maintenance cycle(s).</description>

    <description>The induction course will consist in 4 cycles at 8-10 weeks intervals.
Concomitant amino acids will be administered for renal protection.
Intra-arterial LuTate administration will be allowed in suitable cases.
Dosimetry will be based on quantitative SPECT/CT imaging.
In patients with hormonal symptoms, somatostatine analogues can be given between P-PRRT cycles.</description>
