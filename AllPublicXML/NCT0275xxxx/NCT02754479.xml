      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the real-world effectiveness of the 532 nm KTP and
      1064 nm Nd:YAG lasers within the Cutera Excel V system for the treatment of lower extremity
      spider veins, specifically on the ankles, within a clinic setting.

             follow-up period.

          8. Willingness to have digital photographs taken of ankle spider veins and agree to use
             of photographs for presentation, educational or marketing purposes.

          9. Agree not to undergo any other procedure for the treatment of ankle spider veins
             during the study.
