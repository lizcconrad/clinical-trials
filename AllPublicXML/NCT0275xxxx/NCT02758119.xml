  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to compare two forms of pre-training (an online narrative
      presentation and a serious game) to prepare 2nd year medical students for a hands-on training
      with physical simulators about out-of-hospital cardiac arrest management.

    <textblock>
      Technology-enhanced simulation allows mastery learning. Mastery learning is a variety of
      competency-based education which has demonstrated its efficacy for skills acquisition and
      their transfer to actual settings. While traditional education defines fixed learning time
      and allows outcomes to vary, in mastery learning, all trainees must achieve a predefined
      level of proficiency while their learning time can vary. The main limitation of mastery
      learning is that it takes more time than non-mastery learning. This is of concern because the
      main barrier to simulation-based training is the lack of faculty time. Thus, new solutions
      should emerge to conciliate mastery learning and time constraints on physical simulators.

      Pre-training with a &quot;simulation game&quot; may be a mean to reach this objective. Simulation games
      are serious games which are at the cross roads between (1) educational games which are
      &quot;applications using the characteristics of video and computer games to create engaging and
      immersive learning experiences&quot;, and (2) simulation, the imitation of situations which can be
      encountered in real-life. They combine the advantages of educational games (active,
      personalized learning) and simulation (realistic and safe environment for experiential
      learning). By contrast, pre-training with an online course using a PowerPoint presentation
      with voiceover narration lecture is both passive and abstract.

      The objective of this study is to evaluate the time-efficiency of pre-training using a
      simulation game versus an online course to reach mastery learning in the management of an
      adult out-of-hospital cardiac arrest.

    <description>Following the 2015 European Resuscitation Council guidelines, a checklist was developed for this study. This checklist allows the assessors to evaluate the participant's compliance with guidelines, and to determine if he/she needs to practice again on the scenario or if he/she reached the minimum passing score and can stop the training.
The quality of the chest compressions provided is recorded automatically through the ResusciAnne Skill Reporter Software (Laerdal, Norways), and is integrated in the checklist.</description>

    <description>Participants in the &quot;serious game&quot; group will be pre-trained before the hands-on sessions with the serious game &quot;Staying Alive&quot;, available at http://www.stayingalive.fr/index_us.html This game aims at teaching the management of an out-of-hospital cardiac arrest to the general public and health professionals. In this game, the player faces a man who has experienced sudden cardiac arrest and learns the appropriate behavior, movements and techniques that can contribute to saving his life. The first level of the game lasts 4-5 minutes, depending on the skills of the player. It is a point and click game, displayed on a PC computer.</description>

    <description>Participants in the lecture group will watch individually a 4-min video of a PowerPoint presentation with voiceover narration, given in the medical school of Paris Descartes University. The video is edited to contain the same informations on out-of-hospital cardiac management than the serious game, with the same duration.</description>
