      The purpose of this study is to compare the lens fit characteristics, specifically lens
      centration, of ACUVUE® OASYS® 1-DAY (AO1D) contact lenses and DAILIES TOTAL1® (DT1) contact
      lenses.

    <measure>Percentage of Lenses Graded as 0 or 1 for Lens Centration at Day 14</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 14, each product</time_frame>
    <description>Lens centration, was assessed by the investigator for each eye individually and rated on a 5-point scale: 0=centered/optimal, 1=slight decentration, 2=mild decentration, 3=moderate decentration, 4=severe decentration. The combined percentage of lenses assessed as &quot;centered&quot; or &quot;slight decentration&quot; is reported. Lenses from both eyes contributed to the percentage.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Ex Vivo Critical Coefficient of Friction (CCOF) at Day 14</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 14, each product</time_frame>
    <description>The ex vivo CCOF (ratio of the force of friction between two bodies and the force pressing them together) was measured by the incline plane technique after 16 hours of lens wear. Worn lenses were collected and analyzed for a subset of subjects (all subjects from one site only) who attended the Day 14 visit (Visit 2 and Visit 3) after 16 hours of lens wear. Only lens worn on the right eye (OD) was measured in each subject per each lens brand. CCOF values for contact lenses range from near zero to approximately 0.10 using the inclined plane method. A lower CCOF indicates higher contact lens lubricity.</description>

        <title>Ex Vivo Critical Coefficient of Friction (CCOF) at Day 14</title>
        <description>The ex vivo CCOF (ratio of the force of friction between two bodies and the force pressing them together) was measured by the incline plane technique after 16 hours of lens wear. Worn lenses were collected and analyzed for a subset of subjects (all subjects from one site only) who attended the Day 14 visit (Visit 2 and Visit 3) after 16 hours of lens wear. Only lens worn on the right eye (OD) was measured in each subject per each lens brand. CCOF values for contact lenses range from near zero to approximately 0.10 using the inclined plane method. A lower CCOF indicates higher contact lens lubricity.</description>
