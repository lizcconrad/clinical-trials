      Spanish registry of retrievable vena cava filters.

      This registry is sponsored by the Spanish Society of Vascular and Interventional Radiology
      (SERVEI) and conducted by the Research Group GITMI (Group of Research in Minimally Invasive
      Techniques) of the University of Zaragoza (Spain).

      A software tool hosted on the official website of SERVEI and the journal Intervencionismo
      will be used for data collection a(https://estudios.watsoncme.com).

      This is an prospective observational study of patients that have been implanted a inferior
      vena cava filter with intention to be retrieved.

      Patients are recruited when the filter is implanted, and the investigators observe when is it
      finally retrieved (dwell time), if retrieval is possible or not, and if there is any
      complication at the retrieval of the filter.

    <description>There are really no interventions in this study. This is an prospective observational study of patients that have been implanted a inferior vena cava filter with intention to be retrieved.
Patients are recruited when the filter is implanted, and the investigators observe when is it finally retrieved, and if there is any complication at the retrieval of the filter.</description>
