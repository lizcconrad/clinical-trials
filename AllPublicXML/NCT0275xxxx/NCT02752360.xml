    <textblock>
      Intestinal anastomosis plays an important role in various general surgeries, but the
      complications such as anastomotic leakage,stenosis and hemorrhage cannot been avoided.
      Although many ways are put up to solve this problem, there are still many imports need to
      improve. Therefore, the Biodegradable Stenting Anastomoses(BSA), which make intestinal
      anastomosis easily and less complications, have been produced.The major goal of this study is
      to evaluate the efficacy of Biodegradable Stenting Anastomoses(BSA) for reconstruction in
      surgery of intestinal anastomosis.

    <description>The patients with anastomotic leakage / the total patients. The definition of anastomotic leakage in this study, is included one of the situation as follows: (1) peritonitis caused by leakage, pelvic abscess without radiologically proven anastomotic leakage were considered as equivalents of clinically anastomotic leakage as defined above.; (2) Discharge of faeces, pus or gas from the abdominal drain; (3) All anastomotic leakages were confirmed by one or more of the following methods such as CT scan, ultrasonography and laparotomy.</description>

    <measure>Anastomotic Hemorrhage Rate</measure>
    <time_frame>2 Weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The patients with anastomotic hemorrhage / the total patients. Anastomotic bleeding was considered gastrointestinal bleeding after surgery, and it ascertains that the bleeding is from anastomosis with endoscopy.</description>

    <description>Biodegradable Stenting Anastomoses(BSA) is a new method and device which helps to make intestinal anastomosis easily. According to the measurement of intestinal canal diameter, chose an appropriate size of BSA and use the Seromuscular layer Purse-string Suture to stitch with an absorbable line (VCP311, Ethicon, Inc.) away from the end 0.5 to 1.0 cm and not knot temporarily, then open and sterilize intestinal canal fully, and place the BSA into the intestinal canal at appropriate position before tightening knot. Last, the interrupted whole layer inversion suture is used to fix.</description>
