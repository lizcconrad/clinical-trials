    <textblock>
      The investigators will establish a platform at Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center to generate
      novel models of estrogen receptor alpha-positive (ER+), human epidermal growth factor
      receptor 2-negative (HER2-) breast cancer, which will be used for research studies to develop
      novel treatment strategies and dissect signaling pathways underlying drug sensitivity and
      resistance.

        Subjects &gt;18 years of age with disease progression during neoadjuvant therapy, recurrence
        after neoadjuvant or adjuvant therapy, or progression after systemic therapy for metastatic
        disease that expresses estrogen receptor alpha (ER+) and does not overexpress HER2 (HER2-,
        HER2-negative).

        Subjects must be scheduled to undergo a clinically indicated biopsy or surgical removal of
        tumor, and excess tumor tissue must be available for research use.

    <sampling_method>Non-Probability Sample</sampling_method>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion criteria

          1. Men and women &gt; age 18 with histologically documented ER+/HER2- breast cancer or with
             a history of ER+/HER2- breast cancer, for whom a tumor biopsy or surgical resection is
             clinically indicated and will be performed as standard of care.

             Tumor specimens may be from breast (progressive or recurrent) or metastatic sites.
             Patients with multicentric or bilateral disease are eligible.

          2. Patients must have disease progression during neoadjuvant therapy, recurrence after
             neoadjuvant or adjuvant therapy, or progression after systemic therapy for metastatic
             disease.

          3. ER positivity is defined as &gt;10% of malignant tumor cells staining positively for ER
             by immunohistochemistry (IHC).

             HER2 negativity is defined as IHC 0-1+, or with a fluorescence in situ hybridization
             (FISH) ratio of &lt;1.8 if IHC is 2+ or if IHC has not been done.

          4. Excess LIVE tumor tissue must be available from the surgically resected tumor
             specimen, or from 1-3 extra core needle or incisional biopsy. LIVE tumor tissue must
             be available within 2 hours of removal from patient (shorter time is preferable).

          5. A recurrent or progressing breast cancer must be greater than 1 cm in greatest
             diameter.

          6. Prior therapy is allowed as long as excess viable tumor tissue is available from the
             biopsy or surgical excision procedure.

          7. Patients must be willing to provide 6 mL of blood, which can be obtained during a
             routine clinically indicated blood draw (ideally, done on the same day as the tumor
             biopsy/surgery).

          8. Ability to give signed informed consent.

        Exclusion Criteria

        1. Fine needle aspirates and effusions of bodily fluids are not eligible as sources of
        tumor cells.
