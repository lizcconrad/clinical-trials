  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This project proposes to both develop and test adaptive automation countermeasures for the
      effects of stressors such as sleep deprivation (SD) on human performance related to robotic
      tasks, and investigate the relationship between human trust and appropriate use of these
      countermeasures.

    <time_frame>72 hours</time_frame>
    <description>Over this 72 hour time frame there will be six assessments. Once on Day1, 4 times during the sleep deprivation on Days 2-3, and once on Day 4, the participant will perform computer simulations of &quot;missions&quot; with tasks. The time to complete tasks will be one of the metrics. The change in metrics related to length of time of awake will be assessed using longitudinal analysis methods.</description>
