      Six-hundred subjects with vitamin D deficiency will be randomized to vitamin D 3000 IU per
      day versus placebo for 4 months, with effects on cardiovascular risk factors as main endpoint

    <textblock>
      Vitamin D is a hormone with effects not only on the skeleton, but on most tissues in the
      body. Lack of vitamin D is associated with cardio-vascular disease (CVD) and type 2 diabetes,
      and also with risk factors for these diseases like hypertension, dyslipidemia, insulin
      resistance, and endothelial dysfunction. However, intervention studies with vitamin D have
      been inconclusive regarding diseases and risk factors. Most of these studies were done in
      white, Western populations in subjects fairly vitamin D sufficient, and accordingly, no
      benefits were to be expected. Also, in many studies the doses of vitamin D have been too low,
      and the studies underpowered. To firmly establish the role of vitamin D regarding CVD risk
      factors we will in the present study include 600 subjects with vitamin D deficiency (serum
      25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) &lt; 30 nmol/L) and randomize to high dose vitamin D (3000 IU per
      day) versus placebo for four months. The subjects will be recruited based on 25(OH)D
      measurements in the forthcoming 7th survey in the Tromsø study where more than 20 000
      subjects are expected to attend. If our hypotheses are correct and the vitamin D supplement
      has a positive effect, this will be of great importance not only in countries with low sun
      exposure, but particularly for subjects in developing countries where vitamin D deficiency is
      highly prevalent.
