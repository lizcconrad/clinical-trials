    <textblock>
      The goal of this clinical research study is to learn if it is safe to deliver a CD8+T cell
      therapy to patients with advanced gastrointestinal cancers.

      This study will use your tumor cells (either from a fresh biopsy or from leftover tissue
      samples) and blood to help create a T cell immune-based therapy designed specifically for you
      based on what the study doctor and research staff can learn about the type of mutated
      proteins (a type of genetic change) in the tumor.

      Leukapheresis and Tissue Collection:

      If you are eligible and agree, you will be consented and enrolled under a separate protocol,
      PA14-0138, to have the leukapheresis procedure performed. Leukapheresis is a special type of
      blood draw procedure that separates the red blood cells, white blood cells, and other parts
      of your blood from each other. The consent form for this protocol will explain how the
      leukapheresis procedure is performed and its risks. The white blood cells collected from
      leukapheresis will be used in this study.

      You will need tumor tissue available for this study. If you do not have enough tumor tissue
      available, you will be consented and enrolled in a separate protocol, PA15-0176 for the tumor
      tissue collection. The consent form for PA15-0176 will explain how the tissue will be
      collected and its risks.

      After the tissue and blood cells have been collected, your T cell product will be made.

      Standard of Care Chemotherapy:

      You must receive at least 1 type of chemotherapy after you are enrolled in this study but
      before your T cell dose. There is no limit to the number or types of chemotherapy you may
      receive. Your study doctor will decide when you will enter the treatment part of this study.
      In general you will have exhausted all standard chemotherapy options before you receive your
      T cell product.

      Within 28 days after your last dose of chemotherapy:

        -  You will have a physical exam.

        -  Blood (about 6 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests and for genetic mutation and
           immune system testing. The routine blood draw will include a pregnancy test if you can
           become pregnant.

        -  You will have a CT scan to check the status of the disease.

        -  A date will be chosen for your T cell infusion.

      Cyclophosphamide Administration:

      Two (2) days before your CD8+T cell infusion, you will receive cyclophosphamide by vein over
      30 minutes. Cyclophosphamide will be given at a low dose to weaken the body's natural defense
      against the T-cell transplant, so that the transplanted T-cells have a chance to grow and
      multiply.

      CD8+T Cell Infusion:

      You will be admitted to the hospital the day before your CD8+T cell infusion (Day 0). The
      infusion will take about 2 hours. After the T cell infusion, you will be monitored overnight
      for any side effects.

      On Day 0:

        -  You will have a physical exam.

        -  6 tablespoons of blood will be drawn for routine, genetic, and immune system testing.

      Aldesleukin (IL-2) Administration:

      Starting within 6 hours after the cell infusion and then 2 times a day after that for 14
      days, you will have an aldesleukin injection into your skin around your abdomen. Aldesleukin
      is given to help the survival of the infused CD8+T cells.

      You will be taught how to give yourself these injections, and you will be given needles,
      syringes and other supplies so that you can finish the 14-day course at home.

      Pembrolizumab Administration:

      Pembrolizumab will be given about 24 hours after the T cell infusion by vein over about 30 to
      60 minutes. Pembrolizumab takes away the natural immune system process that would stop the
      CD8+T cells. You will have additional infusions 3, 6, 9, 12, and 15 weeks after the T cell
      infusion.

      Study Visits:

      On Day +3, and Day 1 of Weeks 1, 2, 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18 and 24:

        -  You will have a physical exam (except for weeks 1 and 2).

        -  Blood (about 6 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine and genetic mutation and immune
           system testing.

      During Weeks 6, 12, 18, and 24, you will have a CT scan to check the status of the disease.

      Length of Study:

      After the T cell infusion, you may receive pembrolizumab for up to 6 total doses.

      You will no longer be able to be on the study if the disease gets worse, if intolerable side
      effects occur, or if you are unable to follow study directions.

      Your participation on the study will be over about 6 months after your T cell infusion.

      Follow-Up:

      You will be called 2 times by the study staff in the 6 months after you are off the study and
      asked about any side effects you may have had. Each call should last about 10 minutes.

      If you left the study because you had side effects, you will be called by the study staff
      until that side effect has gone away or has become stable.

      This is an investigational study. The CD8+T cell infusion is not FDA-approved or commercially
      available. It is currently being used for research purposes only. The study doctor can
      explain how the T cell therapy is designed to work.

      Up to 40 participants will be enrolled in this study. All will take part at MD Anderson.

          4. Women of childbearing potential (WOCBP) must be using an adequate method of
             contraception to avoid pregnancy throughout the study in such a manner that the risk
             of pregnancy is minimized. Suggested precautions should be used to minimize the risk
             or pregnancy for at least 1 month before start of therapy, and while women are on
             study for at least 8 weeks after pembrolizumab is stopped. WOCBP include any female
             who has experienced menarche and who has not undergone successful surgical
             sterilization (hysterectomy, bilateral tubal ligation or bilateral oophorectomy) or is
             not postmenopausal. Acceptable forms of birth control include condom, diaphragm,
             hormonal, IUD, or sponge plus spermicide. Abstinence is also an acceptable form of
             birth control.

          5. Men must be willing and able to use an acceptable method of birth control, during and
             for at least 3 months after completion of the study, if their sexual partners are
             WOCBP.

          6. Willing and able to give informed consent.

          7. Adequate vein access: consider PICC or other central line.

          8. Patients must have adequate tissue (fresh or frozen) available or planned removal of
             adequate tissue for analysis. At least 250mg of tumor are needed for peptide elution.
             There is no specific time limit on how long the tissue can remain frozen prior to use.
             The tissue will be collected and analyzed under Lab protocol PA15-0176.

          9. Patients can have any lines (including zero) of prior therapy to sign consent prior to
             tissue harvest.

         10. Toxicity related to prior therapy must either have returned to &lt;/= grade 1, baseline,
             or been deemed irreversible.

         11. ELIGIBILITY FOR TREATMENT: ECOG/Zubrod performance status of 0 to 2.

         12. Bi-dimensionally measurable disease by radiographic imaging (CT scan) that represents
             at least one measurable lesion per RECIST v1.1.

         13. At least 4 Weeks must have elapsed since the last chemotherapy, radiotherapy or major
             surgery.

         14. Toxicity related to prior therapy must either have returned to less than or equal to
             grade 1, baseline, or been deemed irreversible.

         15. Subjects must have received at least one line of chemotherapy prior to receiving
             adoptive T cell therapy and should have exhausted standard of care systemic therapy
             options. The decision to implement the T cell therapy will be at the discretion of the
             treating physician. The timing and total exposure to chemotherapy will depend on the
             tumor type in question (more systemic options for breast cancer; fewer for gastric
             cancer, for example). Due to the heterogeneity of tumors being treated in this
             protocol, the discretion of the treating physician in terms of timing of immunotherapy
             will be critical.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. EXCLUSION FOR ENROLLMENT: Any other malignancy from which the patient has been
             disease-free for less than 5 years, with the exception of adequately treated and cured
             basal or squamous cell skin cancer, superficial bladder cancer, and carcinoma in situ
             of the cervix.

             identified during screening MRI or contrast CT). Patients with asymptomatic, treated
             metastases may be eligible if their lesion(s) have demonstrated stability over 2
             months.

          5. Autoimmune disease: Patients with a history of Inflammatory Bowel Disease are excluded
             from this study, as are patients with a history of autoimmune disease (e.g. Systemic
             Lupus Erythematosus, vasculitis, infiltrating lung disease) whose possible progression
             during treatment would be considered by the Investigator to be unacceptable.

          6. Any underlying medical or psychiatric condition, which in the opinion of the
             Investigator, will make the administration of study drug hazardous or obscure the
