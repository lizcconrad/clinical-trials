  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is aimed to investigate the efficacy of an 12-week Chinese calligraphy training
      program for enhancing cognitive and emotional functions of older adults with mild cognitive
      impairment. Participants are tested with several cognitive tests and electroencephalography
      (EEG), psycho-physical parameters and brain activities are recorded. Results are compared at
      pre-intervention, post-intervention, and 6-month post-intervention to provide evidence of
      benefits of Chinese calligraphy practice.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Participants are older adults with mild cognitive impairment, who will be recruited from
      several community elderly centers in Hong Kong according to selective criteria. The
      participants are randomly assigned to an experimental or a control group. The experimental
      group is invited to participate in 16 sessions of structured Chinese calligraphy program over
      12 weeks. Each session lasts for 1.5 hours. The control group is invited to participate in an
      iPad learning program with navigating the Internet. The iPad program is also consisted of 16
      sessions of 1.5 hours each over 8 weeks. Cognitive tests and physiological measures are
      conducted immediately before and after intervention and at 6-month post-intervention
      follow-up. Statistical analysis are performed to investigate the significant differences and
      interactions among the three time points. The association of cognitive performance and
      emotional calmness is also investigated.

      Selected participants are invited to take part in a EEG session while doing some computer
      tasks related to Chinese calligraphy. EEG results of are used to explore neural activities
      associated with visuospatial working memory and to provide evidence for neural changes at
      functional level as a result of Chinese calligraphy training and practice.

    <measure>Change in Digit span backward test (DSB) from baseline, after end of training, and 6-month follow-up.</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, within 2 weeks after end of training, and 6-month follow-up.</time_frame>
    <description>DSB evaluates working memory, which requires recalling digits in reverse order. The DSB test is structured with increased levels of difficulty.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Color Trails Test (CTT)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, within 2 weeks after end of training, and 6-month follow-up.</time_frame>
    <description>CTT is consisted of two parts. CTT 1 evaluates attention and perceptual speed. Participants are asked to draw a line to between circles in consecutive order numbered 1 - 25, as quickly as possible. CTT 2 evaluates set-shifting. Each number (1 - 25) of CTT 2 is printed twice, one in pink and another in yellow color circle. Subjects are asked to connect the numbers in consecutive order but alternating between pink and yellow.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Symbol-digit Modalities Test (SDMT)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, within 2 weeks after end of training, and 6-month follow-up.</time_frame>
    <description>SDMT evaluates executive function, in particular mental flexibility, of older people with cognitive impairment. It is a simple substitution task in which participants are asked to substitute series of symbols with specific digits within a period of 90 seconds.</description>

    <measure>Heart rate and heart rate variability.</measure>
    <time_frame>At the week 1, 5, 9, 12 during the intervention period, and at 6-month post-intervention.</time_frame>
    <description>It is measured by the Polar RS800C.</description>

    <measure>Blood pressure.</measure>
    <time_frame>At the week 1, 5, 9, 12 during the intervention period, and at 6-month post-intervention.</time_frame>
    <description>It is measured by the Portapres.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Geriatric Depression Scale - Short Form (GDS-SF)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, within 2 weeks after end of training, and 6-month post-intervention.</time_frame>
    <description>GDS-SF measures subjective appraisal of the mood state. It consists of 15 statements about various aspects of mood such as appetite, quality of sleep, hope, and social functioning. Each statement is responded using a dichotomous format (yes/no).</description>
