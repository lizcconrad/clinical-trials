  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Peritoneal carcinomatosis is a common event in the natural history of colorectal and other
      digestive tract cancers. Cytoreductive surgery (CRS) and hyperthermic intraperitoneal
      chemotherapy (HIPEC) provides a promising therapeutic option for highly selected patients
      with peritoneal carcinomatosis arising from different malignancies such as colorectal cancer,
      gastric cancer, ovarian cancer, or peritoneal mesothelioma with improvement of both patient
      survival and quality of life. CRS, i.e., removal of all visible metastatic abdominal and
      pelvic disease with peritonectomy along with HIPEC (for 90 min at a temperature of 42ยบ C)
      and/or early postoperative intraperitoneal chemotherapy (EPIC) in order to eradicate all
      microscopic metastasis.

      CRS with HIPEC is a long and complex procedure with significant blood and fluid loss during
      debulking, hemodynamic, hematological, and metabolic alterations before and during the HIPEC
      phase, and even in the early postoperative period, with resultant significant morbidity and
      mortality. Despite that most of the reported patients are in American Society of
      Anesthesiologist class I and II, without significant comorbidities or systemic disorder; the
      morbidity and mortality ranges from 12 to 65% in these procedures, so a well coordinated team
      of anesthesiologist, surgeons and intensivist and other ancillary services can result in good
      outcome. This study will see the challenges faced by the team regarding the
      pathophysiological alterations during the CRS with HIPEC in the perioperative period.
