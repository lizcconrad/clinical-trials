  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A comparative study will be conducted and the patient will undergo a conventional urodynamic
      study. In order to successfully determine if the Air-Charged (AC) and Water-Perfused (WP)
      measurements are equivalent, the two sources of intravesical pressure (Pves) and abdominal
      pressure (Pabd) will be collected concurrently in the sitting position and at various fill
      volumes for the bladder.
