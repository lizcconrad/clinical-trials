  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This will be a single-center, 12 week, examiner-blind, randomized, stratified (gender and
      baseline mean whole mouth MGI score), two-treatment, parallel group, clinical study in
      healthy adult volunteers with moderate gingivitis. This study will evaluate the efficacy of a
      dentifrice containing 0.454% weight by weight (w/w) stannous fluoride to control gingivitis
      and gingival bleeding following 12 weeks twice daily brushing, compared to a negative control
      dentifrice.

    <measure>Number of Bleeding Sites at Week 12</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>Number of bleeding sites was measured as bleeding index (BI) via a single examiner using a color coded periodontal probe. The probe was engaged approximately 1 millimetre (mm) into the gingival crevice. A moderate pressure was used whilst sweeping from interproximal to interproximal along the sulcular epithelium. The BI was assessed on the facial and lingual gingival surfaces of each scorable tooth (7-7 in each arch). The BI scoring system used to measure bleeding sites is as follows: 0= No bleeding after 30 seconds; 1= Bleeding upon probing after 30 seconds; 2= Immediate bleeding observed. Bleeding sites were assessed as the number of bleeding sites with a BI score of 1 or 2.</description>

    <measure>Modified Gingival Index (MGI) at Week 4 and Week 12</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 4, Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>MGI was assessed on facial and lingual surfaces at two sites on each tooth (papillae and margin). The scoring of the MGI was performed under dental office conditions using a standard dental light for illuminating the oral cavity. This procedure was performed by a single examiner. The MGI scoring system is as follows: 0 = absence of inflammation; 1 = mild inflammation; slight change in color, little change in color; little change in texture of any portion of the marginal or papillary gingival unit; 2 = mild inflammation; criteria as above but involving the entire marginal or papillar gingival units; 3= moderate inflammation; glazing, redness, edema, and/ or hypertrophy of the marginal or papillary gingival unit; 4 = severe inflammation; marked redness, edema and/or hypertrophy of the marginal or papillary gingival unit, spontaneous bleeding, congestion, or ulceration.</description>

        <title>Number of Bleeding Sites at Week 12</title>
        <description>Number of bleeding sites was measured as bleeding index (BI) via a single examiner using a color coded periodontal probe. The probe was engaged approximately 1 millimetre (mm) into the gingival crevice. A moderate pressure was used whilst sweeping from interproximal to interproximal along the sulcular epithelium. The BI was assessed on the facial and lingual gingival surfaces of each scorable tooth (7-7 in each arch). The BI scoring system used to measure bleeding sites is as follows: 0= No bleeding after 30 seconds; 1= Bleeding upon probing after 30 seconds; 2= Immediate bleeding observed. Bleeding sites were assessed as the number of bleeding sites with a BI score of 1 or 2.</description>

          <description>Number of bleeding sites was measured as bleeding index (BI) via a single examiner using a color coded periodontal probe. The probe was engaged approximately 1 millimetre (mm) into the gingival crevice. A moderate pressure was used whilst sweeping from interproximal to interproximal along the sulcular epithelium. The BI was assessed on the facial and lingual gingival surfaces of each scorable tooth (7-7 in each arch).
