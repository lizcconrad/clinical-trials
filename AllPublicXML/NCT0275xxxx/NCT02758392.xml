    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK) and
      immunogenicity of JNJ-61178104 following a single ascending Intravenous (IV) dose
      administration and a single Subcutaneous (SC) dose administration in healthy participants.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, single ascending dose, single site,
      interventional study. There will be 5 single ascending dose (SAD) IV cohorts and 1 SC cohort.
      Nine participants will be enrolled into each of 5 IV cohorts and 1 SC cohort and participants
      will be randomized at a ratio of 2:1 to receive JNJ-61178104 or placebo. The total duration
      of participants participation will be approximately 21 weeks including a Screening Visit up
      to 4 weeks prior to study drug administration. Participants will have an inpatient period
      consisting of 6 days/5 nights and will return to the study-site at Weeks 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 9,
      13, and 17. Participants will be evaluated for safety throughout the study.

    <description>The F is the percentage of the subcutaneously administered dose that is systemically available relative to an intravenous (IV) administration. It is calculated as (AUC [0-infinity] for 1 mg/kg SC JNJ-61178104)/(AUC [0-infinity] for 1 mg/kg IV JNJ-61178104 )*100, where the AUC (0-infinity) is area under the concentration-time curve from time zero to extrapolated infinite time.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria

          -  Participant must sign an informed consent form (ICF) indicating that he or she
             understands the purpose of and procedures required for the study and are willing to
             participate in the study

          -  Participant must have a body weight in the range of 50 Kilogram (kg) to 100 kg,

             kg/m2, inclusive

          -  Participant must be healthy on the basis of clinical laboratory tests performed at
             Screening and Day-1. If the results of the serum chemistry panel including liver
             enzymes, hematology panel, or urinalysis are outside the normal reference ranges, the
             participant may be included only if the investigator judges the abnormalities or
             deviations from normal to be not clinically significant or to be appropriate and

             participant's medical record with documented review confirmation by the investigator

          -  Before randomization, a woman must not be of childbearing potential: a) Postmenopausal
             {greater than (&gt;) 45 years of age with amenorrhea for at least 12 months or any age
             with amenorrhea for at least 6 months and a serum follicle stimulating hormone (FSH)
             level &gt;40 International Units Per Litre (IU/L) at Screening}; or b) Permanently
             sterilized (example, bilateral tubal occlusion, hysterectomy, bilateral salpingectomy,
             oophorectomy); or c) Otherwise be incapable of pregnancy

          -  Be considered eligible according to the following tuberculosis (TB) Screening
             criteria: a) Have no history of latent or active TB prior to Screening; b) Have no

             examination; c) Have had no recent close contact with a person with active TB; d) Have
             a negative T-Spot TB test result at Screening

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Participant currently has or has a history of any clinically significant medical
             illness or medical disorders the investigator considers should exclude the
             participant, including (but not limited to), neuromuscular, hematological disease,
             immune deficiency state, cardiac, vascular, metabolic, endocrine, rheumatologic,
             respiratory disease, hepatic or gastrointestinal disease, neurological or psychiatric
             disease, ophthalmological disorders, neoplastic disease, renal or urinary tract
             diseases, or dermatological disease

          -  Participant has a QT corrected according to Fridericia's formula (QTcF) interval &gt;450
             msec, has a complete left or right bundle branch block, or has a history or current
             evidence of additional risk factors for torsades de pointes (example, heart failure,
             hypokalemia, family history of Long QT Syndrome) at Screening and at Day -1

          -  Participant has had major surgery, (example, requiring general anesthesia) within 4
             months before Screening, or will not have fully recovered from surgery, or has surgery
             planned during the time the participant is expected to participate in the study or
             within 17 weeks after the last dose of study drug administration

          -  Participant plans to undergo non-major elective surgery within 4 weeks prior to study
             drug administration through the end of the study

          -  Participant has a known or suspected intolerance or hypersensitivity to any biologic
             medication or known allergies or clinically significant reactions to murine, chimeric,
             or human proteins, monoclonal antibodies or antibody fragments, or to any components
             of the formulation of JNJ-61178104 and its excipients used in this study
