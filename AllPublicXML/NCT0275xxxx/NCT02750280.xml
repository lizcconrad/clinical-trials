      This ia a prospective controlled longitudinal study to evaluate the effects of MatriStem®
      plus standard local wound care versus standard local wound care alone in the treatment of
      diabetic foot ulcers (DFUs), as assessed by incidence of complete wound healing by 16 weeks
      and ulcer recurrence with a 2 year follow-up.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Male and female subjects 18-85 years of age with diabetes mellitus (type 1 or type 2)

          2. Subject's foot ulcer is on the plantar surface of the foot.

          3. DFU has not healed after more than2 months of SOC treatment administered

          4. Subject's ulcer must be Wagner type 1 or 2 (uninfected, extending through the dermis
             and into subcutaneous tissue or granulating but without exposure of tendon, bone, or
             joint capsule.

          5. Subject's wound is free of necrotic debris (post debridement) and clinical infection,
             should be comprised of healthy, vascular tissue.

          6. Subject's Ankle-Brachial Index (ABI) by Doppler method is ≥ 0.7

          7. The subject has adequate circulation to the foot to allow for healing. This must be
             demonstrated by methods described in section 5.1

          8. Subject's diabetes is under control as determined by the Investigator

          9. Study subject must be reliable, responsible and able to visit the clinic weekly for
             the full 16 week period. The subject is willing and able to tolerate TCC. Subject is
             willing to comply with the monthly follow-up regimen for 32 weeks (8 months) The
             subject is able to return to the clinic if ulcer recurrence occurs

         10. Subject or his/her legal representative has read and signed the Institutional Review
             Board (IRB) approved Informed Consent form before treatment

         11. No active malignancy except non-melanoma skin cancer

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Subject has clinical evidence of gangrene on any part of the affected foot

          2. Subject has a Wagner type 3 or greater ulceration

          3. The subject's ulcer is due to a non-diabetic etiology, Ulcers of arterial, venous
             stasis, pressure, radiation, traumatic, rheumatoid, vasculitis, collagen vascular
             disease, or other non-diabetic etiologies

          4. Subject has a known sensitivity to bovine or porcine derived devices

          5. Subject has one or more medical condition(s) including renal, hepatic, hematological,
             neurologic, or immune disease that in the opinion of the Investigator would make the
             subject an inappropriate candidate for this wound healing study

          6. Subject has or has had a malignant disease (other than cutaneous epithelioma) not in
             remission

          7. Subject is receiving oral or parenteral corticosteroids, immunosuppressive or
             cytotoxic agents, or is anticipated to require such agents during the course of the
             study

          8. Subject has chronic osteomyelitis as determined by high resolution ultrasonography

          9. Subject's ulcer is infected or accompanied by active cellulitis as determined by the
             Investigator

         10. Subject has any condition(s) that seriously compromises the subject's ability to
             complete the study

         11. Subject is pregnant or lactating at the time of treatment

         12. Subject has received growth factor therapy (e.g. autologous platelet-rich plasma gel,
             bacaplermin, bilayered cell therapy, dermal substitute, extracellular matrix) within
             two weeks of enrollment. If Santyl or any other collagenase is used, a subject must
             have a washout period of 2 weeks before MatriStem® can be applied.

         13. Subject is currently receiving or has received radiation or chemotherapy within 3
             months of randomization

         14. Subject has a history of alcohol or drug abuse

         15. Subject allergic to a broad spectrum of primary &amp; secondary dressing materials,
             including occlusive dressings and the adhesives on such dressings.

         16. Subject is currently enrolled or participated within the previous 30 days of
             enrollment in another device, drug or biological trial.
