  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Prospective, open-label, multi-centre, single arm treatment only trial to evaluate the safety
      and effectiveness of RefluxStop for the treatment of GERD.

      The used medical device &quot;RefluxStop&quot; is an implantable single use sterile device to ensure
      maintenance of gastro oesophageal junction (GEJ) in an intra-abdominal position to reduce or
      eliminate GERD.

      Prospective, open-label, multi-centre, single arm treatment only trial to evaluate the safety
      and effectiveness of RefluxStop for the treatment of GERD.

      The used medical device &quot;RefluxStop&quot; is an implantable single use sterile device to ensure
      maintenance of gastro oesophageal junction (GEJ) in an intra-abdominal position to reduce or
      eliminate GERD.

      The study plan will include a screening/baseline visit, a surgical procedure phase with
      hospital stay until discharge, and follow-up visits at 6 weeks, 3 months and 6 months after
      device implantation.

      The study will include a part A (20 patients followed for 6 weeks) and a part B (the first 20
      patients assessed at 3 months and 6 months, and the remaining 30 patients assessed at weeks,
      3 months, and 6 months).

      An independent Safety Monitoring Board (SMB) will review the results of the first 20 patients
      after 6 weeks.

      The Board will also meet one month prior to the anticipated inclusion of 50 patients in order
      to recommend whether an increase of the sample size will be needed for safety documentation
      purposes.
