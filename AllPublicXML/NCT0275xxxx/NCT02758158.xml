    <textblock>
      Thyroid cancer affects 6,000 Canadians each year. Nodules on the thyroid are detected using
      ultrasound imaging and surgery is the most common treatment. However, most nodules are
      benign, and therefore a biopsy is needed to decide whether surgery is necessary. Ultrasound
      imaging is very sensitive for localizing nodules, but does not differentiate between
      cancerous and benign ones. To address this limitation of US imaging, investigators have
      designed and constructed, in collaboration with Sogang University, Seoul, S. Korea, a novel
      imaging system that performs complimentary imaging modalities (ultrasound (US), photoacoustic
      (PA)) that could potentially help diagnose nodules without the need for biopsy and
      unnecessary surgery.

    <description>This trimodal imaging system was developed in collaboration with Sogang University and is composed of three subsystems: ultrasound, photoacoustic and fluorescence. For this study, the fluorescence subsystem will not be used. The photoacoustic and ultrasound subsystems and data acquisition are controlled by a single workstation. The complete system is Canadian Standards Association (CSA) certified.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Male or female patients with thyroid nodules (cancerous, benign or undetermined)

          2. 18 years of age or older

          3. Have been consented to their standard-of-care surgery for resection of the thyroid
             (partial or complete) and lymph nodes (if applicable)

          4. Have had pre-surgical US imaging of the thyroid and lymph nodes

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Inability to provide informed consent

          2. Pre-operative therapy for current thyroid cancer (including chemotherapy, endocrine
             therapy and radiotherapy)

          3. History of photosensitivity or skin disease (exposure to laser light is involved in PA
             imaging)

          4. Pregnancy
