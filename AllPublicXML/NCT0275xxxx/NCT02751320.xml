    <textblock>
      This will be a single-centre, randomized, blinded, placebo-controlled, 6-treatment, 4-period
      crossover, incomplete block design, in situ caries study in healthy adults who wear a
      removable bilateral mandibular partial denture. The denture will be modified to accommodate 4
      gauze-covered specimens of human dental enamel (4x3mm) that have been previously
      demineralized in vitro to form either S or low-R lesions (2 specimens of each lesion type
      will be used with each participant). After 14 days of twice daily product use off-site, the 2
      S lesion specimens will be removed at the study site, with the remaining 2 low-R lesion
      specimens removed at the study site after a further 14 days of product use. To determine the
      remineralization ability of the treatments, all specimens will be analyzed by transverse
      microradiography (TMR) and enamel fluoride uptake (EFU), with the S lesions additionally
      analyzed by surface micro hardness (SMH) and the low-R lesions additionally analyzed by
      quantitative light fluorescence (QLF).

    <measure>Percentage Surface Microhardness Recovery (SMHR) of Phyte (0% 0.425% and 0.85%) at 2 Weeks</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline upto 2 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>SMHR test was used to assess the changes in mineralization status of partially demineralized enamel specimens using a Wilson 2100 Hardness tester. SMH was determined by measuring the length of the indentations of enamel specimens. % SMHR was calculated from indentation length (micrometer [μm]) of sound enamel specimen at baseline (B), indentation length (μm) after in vitro demineralization(D), indentation length (μm) after intra-oral exposure (R): [D-R/D-B]*100.</description>

    <description>TMR was used to assess changes in the mineral status of partially demineralized enamel specimens. Lesions were analyzed at baseline and Integrated Mineral Loss (∆Z): (∆Z =(lesion depth x 87) - area under the curve [Area under the curve which relates volume % mineral at distances from the specimen surface with respect to section thickness]). After treatment a further section was taken from each lesion specimen for radiography assessment; ∆Z was calculated. The change which occurred in mineral content (∆M) of the lesions as a result of treatment was calculated by: ∆M= (baseline ∆Z - Post-treatment ∆Z).</description>

    <measure>Enamel Fluoride Uptake (EFU) of All Study Formulation Variables</measure>
    <time_frame>At Week 2</time_frame>
    <description>The microdrill enamel biopsy technique was used to analyze the fluoride uptake by enamel. Each enamel specimen was mounted on the long axis of a drill attached to a microdrill and drilled to a depth of approximately 100 μm through the entire lesion (four cores per specimen). The enamel powder pooled from four drilling samples was then immediately analyzed for fluoride content using fluoride specific electrode and pH/ion meter. The amount of fluoride-uptake by enamel was calculated based on the amount of fluoride divided by the area of the enamel cores and expressed as μg/cm^2.</description>

        <description>SMHR test was used to assess the changes in mineralization status of partially demineralized enamel specimens using a Wilson 2100 Hardness tester. SMH was determined by measuring the length of the indentations of enamel specimens. % SMHR was calculated from indentation length (micrometer [μm]) of sound enamel specimen at baseline (B), indentation length (μm) after in vitro demineralization(D), indentation length (μm) after intra-oral exposure (R): [D-R/D-B]*100.</description>

        <title>Transverse Microradiography (TMR) Net Remineralization Change (ΔM) Value of Phytate (0% 0.452% and 0.85%) at 4 Weeks</title>
        <description>TMR was used to assess changes in the mineral status of partially demineralized enamel specimens. Lesions were analyzed at baseline and Integrated Mineral Loss (∆Z): (∆Z =(lesion depth x 87) - area under the curve [Area under the curve which relates volume % mineral at distances from the specimen surface with respect to section thickness]). After treatment a further section was taken from each lesion specimen for radiography assessment; ∆Z was calculated. The change which occurred in mineral content (∆M) of the lesions as a result of treatment was calculated by: ∆M= (baseline ∆Z - Post-treatment ∆Z).</description>

        <title>Enamel Fluoride Uptake (EFU) of All Study Formulation Variables</title>
        <description>The microdrill enamel biopsy technique was used to analyze the fluoride uptake by enamel. Each enamel specimen was mounted on the long axis of a drill attached to a microdrill and drilled to a depth of approximately 100 μm through the entire lesion (four cores per specimen). The enamel powder pooled from four drilling samples was then immediately analyzed for fluoride content using fluoride specific electrode and pH/ion meter. The amount of fluoride-uptake by enamel was calculated based on the amount of fluoride divided by the area of the enamel cores and expressed as μg/cm^2.</description>
