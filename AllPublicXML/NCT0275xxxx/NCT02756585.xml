  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a leading cause of post-injury hospitalization, disability,
      and death worldwide. In Nova Scotia, approximately 50% of major trauma reported is head
      trauma. TBI is predicted to be the most common and expensive neurological condition in Canada
      through the year 2031.

      Families and medical teams must often decide on the appropriate level of care for patients
      with severe TBI and frequently need to consider withdrawal of life support measures. These
      decisions have implications for patients with severe TBI, costs to the health care system,
      and rates of organ donation.

      A reliable method for neurological evaluation at the time of the patient's arrival to the
      hospital is important, because it is possible that many patients with severe TBI already have
      permanent brain damage. Assessing this brain damage with clinical tests is difficult because
      of the nature of patients' injuries and the sedative medication they receive at the time of
      their hospital admission. Current standard imaging technique for these patients is severely
      limited in the assessment of the extent and severity of the brain damage.

      Advanced diagnostic imaging, called Computed Tomography Perfusion (CTP), can help detect
      permanent brain damage. However, CTP of the head is not currently done for patients with
      severe TBI when they arrive at the hospital. The investigators want to test whether CTP of
      the head can detect permanent brain damage among patients with severe TBI.

    <textblock>
      To demonstrate that CTP is useful for assessing patients with severe TBI, the investigators
      will conduct a large study at multiple hospitals across Canada. Before conducting the large
      study, the investigators need to make sure that it is feasible to add CTP of the head to the
      routine imaging that patients with severe TBI undergo at the time of their arrival at the
      hospital. The current study is a pilot study to test the feasibility of adding CTP imaging of
      the head to the routine imaging protocol for patients with severe TBI at the time of their
      hospital admission. The proposed feasibility study will help determine how many participants
      the investigators need for the larger study to attain a significant result and whether the
      investigators need to modify the investigators study methods.

      Participants will undergo the imaging protocol with CTP of head at the time of initial
      diagnostic imaging upon hospital arrival. Non-contrast CT (NCCT) of the head will be
      performed as part of current imaging protocol for severe TBI patients. At the time of the
      NCCT, participants will undergo whole-brain CTP protocol, ensuring coverage of the entire
      brainstem. A total of 40 mL of nonionic iodinated contrast media will be injected. Images
      will be acquired according to the investigators previously published imaging protocol.
      Cerebral blood flow (CBF) and cerebral blood volume (CBV) images from the CTP will be
      qualitatively assessed for the presence or absence of a matched decrease of CBF and CBV in
      the brainstem. CTP will be assessed independently by two radiologists blinded from each
      other. If disagreements arise, they will be resolved by discussion.
