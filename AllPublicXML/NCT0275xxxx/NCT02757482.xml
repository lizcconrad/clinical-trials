    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to examine the effects of patient training about the safety of
      warfarin therapy on related knowledge levels and on International Normalized Ratio (INR)
      control.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Although warfarin is widely used in the treatment and prophylaxis of thromboembolic diseases,
      it is an oral anticoagulant with serious adverse effects. Therefore, the patient must be
      informed about its safe use.

      A patient's level of knowledge concerning the drug plays a key role in the effective and safe
      use of warfarin. In the Joint Commission International (JCI) National Patient Safety Goal
      (NPSG) guideline for 2014 education on treatment for patients taking oral anticoagulants was
      recognized as a vital factor. Previous studies have reported that a positive relationship
      between patients' anticoagulant knowledge levels and the INR number in the therapeutic range.

      For this reason there is a need for effective education programs to increase patients'
      knowledge concerning warfarin and to keep it up to date. Education and information services
      provided to patients using anticoagulants will reduce the costs of treatment by reducing
      risks such as thromboembolism and bleeding. When planning education, individual
      characteristics and needs must be kept in mind, and group education in addition to individual
      sessions and the use of written and visual material will increase the effectiveness of the
      education.

    <measure>Warfarin Knowledge Level Measurement</measure>
    <time_frame>2 months</time_frame>
    <description>Warfarin knowledge level was measured by The Warfarin Knowledge Assessment Form. This form consisted of 30 questions. These questions covered basic information for drug treatment such as the drug dose, the duration of drug use, adverse effects of the drug, drug-drug and drug-food interaction, drug use in pregnancy, dental care and treatment, laboratory monitoring, exercise and diet. Each correct answer scored 1, and each wrong answer or a 'don't know' response scored 0. The last two questions in the last section on drug use related to pregnancy and nursing a child, and so these were answered only by women. Patients' raw information scores were between 0 and 30. Those scoring 0-15 were accepted as having a low level of information, those scoring 16-21 a moderate level, and those scoring 22-30 a high level of information.</description>

    <measure>International Normalized Ratio Measurements</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The last three INR measurement values for the two patient groups were taken from the hospital records and recorded, together with the INR values for the day of the first interview. The warfarin knowledge evaluation form was applied again to the patients of each group in the first and second months, and the INR values for those dates were obtained from hospital records.</description>
