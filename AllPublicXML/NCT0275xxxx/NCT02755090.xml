    <textblock>
      This study is a multi-site, double-blinded, randomized, non-inferiority clinical trial of
      inhaled nitrous oxide with oxygen (N2O/O2) versus intravenous (IV) sedation, with fentanyl
      and midazolam, for pain management in adult women having a pregnancy termination procedure
      between 12 and 16 weeks gestational age.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate whether nitrous oxide is a feasible and acceptable alternative to IV
      sedation for pain management during early second trimester D&amp;E. Primary endpoints will
      include maximum procedural pain using the visual analog scale (VAS) as well as satisfaction
      with anesthesia using the Iowa Satisfaction with Anesthesia Scale.

    <description>To compare women's maximum procedural pain measured on a visual analog scale (VAS) during a surgical abortion between 12 weeks 0 days to 16 weeks 0 days gestational age between women randomized to nitrous oxide versus intravenous sedation. A score of 0 represents no pain and a score of 100 represents pain as bad as it could be.</description>
