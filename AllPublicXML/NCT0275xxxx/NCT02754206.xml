  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to understand how biochemical markers in blood, balance
      disturbances, and cognitive performance are related to brain blood flow changes after a
      concussion.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Comparisons will be made between control data and data following a concussion collected from
      athletes participating in contact-collision sports. For those suffering a concussion,
      comparisons will be made between day 3 (acute phase), day 21 (recovery phase), and 3 months
      post-concussion.
