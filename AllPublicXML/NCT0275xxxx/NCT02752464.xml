  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Overweight/obesity is strongly linked to mortality from multiple chronic diseases, including
      cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and obesity-related cancers.The successful management of
      overweight/obesity requires management of nutrition and physical activity over time. For
      racial/ethnic minority and low-income populations, who face both higher prevalence of obesity
      and chronic diseases compared to others, interventions promoting behavioral change are a
      national health priority. From the available range of behavioral change intervention
      strategies, there is a growing knowledge base that documents the efficacy of peer support
      interventions for improving self-care, quality of life, and behavioral change. In this study,
      the investigators will examine the following research question: What is the preliminary
      efficacy and degree of implementation and acceptability of an intervention approach in which
      peer counselors provide evidenced-based counseling about nutrition and physical activity
      behaviors for weight management to public housing residents using a computer-assisted program
      called CuesWeight?
