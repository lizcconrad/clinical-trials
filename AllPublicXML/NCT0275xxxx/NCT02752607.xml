  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background: Venous thromboembolism (VTE), which includes deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and
      pulmonary embolism (PE), is the third most common cardiovascular disorder after myocardial
      infarction and stroke. VTE occurs in about 1 person per 1,000 per year, increasing
      dramatically in patients with cancer to about 25 per 1,000 per year. Among the known risk
      factors of VTE, cancer is one of the most potent. Patients with cancer have a 7- to 28-fold
      higher risk for VTE than non-cancer patients. VTE has important implications for the care of
      cancer patients, including reduced life expectancy, high rates of VTE recurrence both while
      on and after stopping anticoagulation, the need for chronic anticoagulation with related
      adverse drug reactions, and delays in cancer therapies. Clinical dilemma: Current clinical
      guidelines recommend a minimum of 3-6 months of anticoagulation with weight-adjusted low
      molecular weight heparin (LMWH) in cancer patients with VTE. However, there are no
      recommendations beyond the initial 6 months of therapy due to the lack of data on extended
      duration therapy for cancer-associated thrombosis (CAT). This leads to variability in
      physician practices, with some continuing weight-adjusted LMWH therapy beyond 6 months. This
      poses concern because, while the goal is to prevent recurrence of VTE, the risk of major
      bleeding with prolonged weight-adjusted LMWH therapy is significant. Potential solutions:
      There is a lack of data to inform on VTE treatment in cancer patients beyond the initial 3-6
      months of anticoagulation. We propose that after a minimum of 3-6 months of therapeutic dose
      anticoagulation, the use of prophylactic doses of LMWH will have an acceptable and adherence
      profile in cancer patients with VTE. The data obtained from this study will help inform
      physician practices. Design: This is a multicentre, open-label study of enoxaparin (40 mg
      subcutaneous injection, once daily) for additional 6 months after an initial minimum
      3-6-month course of therapeutic dose anticoagulant therapy. Patients: 150 patients with VTE
      secondary to cancer will take part in this multicentre study conducted in 8 Canadian centres
      within Quebec, Ontario and Nova Scotia. Study Outcomes: The primary objective of the study is
      to determine the rate of recurrent VTE in patients receiving prophylactic dose enoxaparin for
      secondary VTE prophylaxis after an initial minimum 3-6 months of anticoagulation. The
      secondary objective is to determine the safety profile of prophylaxis dose enoxaparin for
      secondary VTE prophylaxis after an initial 3-6 months of anticoagulation. This includes
      determining for all subjects: 1) cumulative incidence of major bleeding events; 2) cumulative
      incidence of clinically relevant non-major bleeding events; 3) cumulative incidence of minor
      bleeding event, and 4) overall survival during follow-up.

        Subjects will have an active malignancy defined as any of: a) diagnosis of cancer
        (excluding basal cell or squamous cell carcinoma) within 18 months of study enrolment; or
        b) have received treatment for cancer within 18 months (e.g. radiation therapy,
        chemotherapy, adjuvant therapy) of study enrolment; or c) have documented recurrent or
        metastatic cancer. Subjects must also have a first episode of objectively confirmed VTE
        (distal or proximal deep vein thrombosis (DVT) of the lower limb or proximal DVT of the
        upper limb, or pulmonary embolism (PE)) that is being treated with therapeutic
        anticoagulation for a minimum intended duration of 3-6 months. Subjects must be ≥18 years
        of age with a life expectancy of &gt; 6 months.
