  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This trial will compare two strategies for patients with Heart Failure, Left Ventricular
      systolic dysfunction, and intermediate QRS durations. The control group is conventional CRT.
      The experimental group is LVendo CRT
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients randomized to the Conventional CRT will receive a CRT device with or without ICD.
      Device implantation will be performed within 10 working days of randomization.

      Patients randomized to LV endocardial CRT will receive a CRT device with or without ICD,
      placed in the same time frame and will have RA and RV leads implanted as the conventional CRT
      group. The device will be implanted in a facility that has the capacity to perform
      trans-atrial septal puncture with ultrasound guidance. The LV lead will be placed using a
      trans-atrial septal approach using a specially designed puncture tools and LVendo delivery
      tool kits specifically designed for this study

    <description>Patients randomized to the Conventional CRT will receive a CRT device with or without ICD. Device implantation will be performed within 10 working days of randomization. Conscious sedation or general anesthesia can be used for the implant procedure. The device will be implanted in a facility that has the capacity to perform coronary sinus venography at the time of implantation. The RA lead will be placed in the RA appendage or high RA. The RV lead should be placed at the RV apex or distal RV septum (R wave &gt; 7 mV, pacing threshold &lt; 1.5 V at a pulse-width of 0.5 ms). The LV lead should be positioned through the CS to an LV branch. The lead should be placed at one of the left ventricular venous branches, avoiding the LV apex and scar region identified by pre-implant imaging</description>
