  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Infertility-the inability to conceive despite one year of properly timed unprotected
      intercourse-is a common problem. Of all types of male factor infertility, non-obstructive
      azoospermia may be the most difficult for couples. Importantly, patients with non-obstructive
      azoospermia are asked to make difficult decisions in terms of reproductive choice; surgical
      attempts at identifying sperm (microdissection testicular sperm extraction) are often offered
      to these patients without a guarantee of being able to identify sperm. New methodologies in
      terms of evaluation of azoospermic males PRIOR to the couple embarking upon IVF are needed
      urgently. The other potential benefit of non-invasive determination of testis function and
      spermatogenesis would be the potential targeting of sperm extraction procedures. We
      hypothesize that quantitative MRI employing advanced functional metrics will be sensitive to
      functional and metabolic differences between subsets of azoospermic cases and will improve
      upon current characterization of patients with this condition. Moreover, it is believed that
      these techniques will provide complementary information, such that they may be combined in a
      synergistic fashion for targeted extraction methodologies.

    <textblock>
      Of all types of male factor infertility, non-obstructive azoospermia may be the most
      difficult for couples. Azoospermia (both obstructive and non-obstructive) occurs in
      approximately 10-20% of all infertile males with non-obstructive azoospermia encompassing the
      majority of cases.

      In this study, quantitative MRI will be investigated by employing advanced functional metrics
      for addressing these challenges. Specifically, diffusion-weighted imaging will be assessed,
      multi-echo T2 mapping, arterial-spin labeling, and spectroscopy. No intravenous contrast will
      be administered for purposes of this study. It is hypothesized that these techniques will be
      sensitive to functional and metabolic differences between subsets of azoospermic cases and
      will improve upon current characterization of patients with this condition. Moreover, it is
      believed that these techniques will provide complementary information, such that they may be
      combined in a synergistic fashion for targeted extraction methodologies.

      The goal of this exploratory study is to investigate whether associations exist between
      quantitative MRI metrics and the previously noted features of testis architecture.
