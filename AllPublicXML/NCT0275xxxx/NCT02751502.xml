  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Twenty pediatric patients aged 5-17 years with Acquired Brain Injuries (ABI) will be
      randomized to receive either a bimanual-to-unimanual device home training program (10
      subjects) or a conventional non-device home training program (10 subjects) for a period of 6
      weeks.

      The specific aims of this proposal are to:

      Aim 1: Introduce home-based targeted upper limb training in children with hemiplegia from ABI
      (Acquired Brain Injuries) using a bimanual-to-unimanual training approach It is hypothesized
      that child-friendly home-based upper limb bimanual-to-unimanual training will lead to greater
      compliance and improved motor outcome on the Fugl Myer Scale compared to a conventional home
      training program.

      Aim 2: Improve the understanding of the pattern of recovery of isolated joint movements in
      the pediatric population with hemiplegia following ABI.

      It is hypothesized that individuals receiving device-based bimanual-to-unimanual training
      will show improvement in active range of motion across upper limb joints compared with a
      conventional home training program.
