  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1, First-Time-In-Humans, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind,
      escalating single- and multiple-dose study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and
      pharmacokinetics of CNM-Au8 in healthy male and female volunteers. There will be 2 phases to
      this study: a single ascending dose (SAD) phase and a multiple ascending dose (MAD) phase.
      The SAD Phase will be conducted first followed by the MAD phase of the study.

    <textblock>
      SAD Phase:

      A total of 8 subjects will be randomly assigned in a 3:1 ratio to receive a single dose of
      either CNM-Au8 (n=6) or placebo (n=2) at an initial dose level of 15 mg CNM-Au8. Additional
      cohorts of 8 subjects will be enrolled to investigate escalating single doses of CNM-Au8 at
      30, 60, and 90 mg. Cohorts will be balanced by sex with no more than 2/3rd of subjects being
      of one sex.

      MAD Phase:

      A total of 12 subjects will be randomly assigned in a 3:1 ratio to receive a multiple dose of
      either CNM-Au8 (n=9) or placebo (n=3) once daily for 21 days at an initial dose level of 15
      mg CNM-Au8. Additional cohorts of 12 subjects will be enrolled to investigate escalating
      multiple doses of CNM-Au8 at 30, 60, and 90 mg CNM Au8 administered once daily for 21 days.
      Cohorts will be balanced by sex with no more than 2/3rd of subjects being of one sex.
