      Pulmonary rehabilitation has been demonstrated by evidence-base medicine to reduce the
      pulmonary complications after thoracic surgery. According to the literature reviews, these
      studies did not specifically point out the proper timing for the intervention of pulmonary
      rehabilitation on patients with thoracic surgery; moreover, interventions about pulmonary
      rehabilitation that focused on long-term training have not been studied. The purpose of this
      study is to determine whether Pulmonary rehabilitation are effective on patients who had
      thoracic surgeries.

    <textblock>
      Pulmonary-related surgeries remain some potential risks according to the previous
      evidence-based studies. Particularly, individuals who were over 65 years of age with smoking,
      chronic pulmonary disease, wheezy, cardiovascular comorbidities, upper respiratory infection
      were at the high risk of pulmonary complications after surgery,which accounted for
      approximately 2% to 40% of occurrence rate. For instance, atelectasis, pneumonia,
      bronchospasm, chronic pulmonary disease, fluid accumulation in the lung cavity, lung edema,
      hypoxemia, acute upper airway obstruction, respiratory failure were common problems on the
      patients in clinic. Therefore, intervention-related studies about the way to reduce the
      pulmonary complications after operation and to improve the physio- psychological recovery
      were significantly meaning for the process of the care on patients who had thoracic
      surgeries.

      Pulmonary rehabilitation has been demonstrated by evidence-base medicine to reduce the
      pulmonary complications after thoracic surgery and increase the breathing capacity by means
      of smoking cession before operation, breathing exercise, extremities exercise, breathing
      muscle training, incentive spirometry (Triflo-II) training, intermittent positive pressure
      ventilation, and chest physical therapy. According to the literature reviews, these studies
      did not specifically point out the proper timing for the intervention of pulmonary
      rehabilitation on patients with thoracic surgery; moreover, interventions about pulmonary
      rehabilitation that focused on long-term training have not been studied. Thus, the study was
      designed with the randomized controlled trial to recruit the patients with thoracic surgery
      who had wedge resection, segmental resection, lobectomy, and total lung resection and to
      compare the effectiveness of pulmonary rehabilitation on patients with chest surgery between
      the operation stage on before op-day 3 day and after op-day 2 weeks and long-term training on
      discharge 2 weeks, 6 weeks and after 12 weeks. In addition, the study will discover its
      effectiveness on the pulmonary function after operation, breathing strength, pulmonary
      complication and pain, dyspnea degree, and also be presumed pulmonary rehabilitation will
      improve the physio- psychological recovery.
