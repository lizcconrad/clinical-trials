      Aim: clinical effectiveness of 0.05% cetylpyridinium chloride mouth rinse in patients with
      gingivitis as compared to non-alcoholic chlorhexidine mouth wash.

      Methods &amp; Material: Twenty-four subjects, without systemic diseases, with plaque-induced
      gingivitis will be selected for this study. The patients were treated with scaling and root
      planing at the baseline; Oral hygiene instructions were given that included brushing twice-
      daily, The volunteers brushed their teeth with the Bass brushing technique for at least 2
      minutes, these patients were randomly ,equally divided into two groups, Group A: perform
      daily mouthwashes twice a day with the solution containing 10 ml of 0.05 cetyl pyridinium,
      (Vi-one, Rojin, Cosmetic-Lab, Kurdistan -Iran), Group B: use daily mouthwashes twice a day
      with 10ml of the chlorhexidine(Kin Laboratories, Spain), On day 0,7,15 and day 21 of each
      phase the Plaque Index (PI), Pocket depth(PD), Stain Index(SI) and Bleeding Index (BI) of
      each volunteer were measured.

      In this study, 34 patients referred to periodontics Department that no serious systemic
      disease in terms of periodontitis and disease Gingivitis (ie pockets of periodontal tissue to
      a depth of less than or equal to 4 mm without CAL in the jaw down or up) the following
      explanation necessary for the procedure tastings consent, the index of oral hygiene (plaque
      index) index # Turesky, pocket depth and to control the inflammatory condition * bleeding
      index bleeding during the probe based on Carter and Barnes (if any bleeding number 1 and its
      absence 0) and attachment loss were evaluated areas. The amount of pigment (Stain) after of
      using mouthwash based on S.I (Stain Index) was evaluated .
