  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this project is to examine the physical activity and screen-time environment of
      licensed childcare centers before and after the enactment of new state regulations.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Pause and Play will take a prospective observational epidemiological approach before and
      after enactment of new regulations. 10 childcare centers licensed in East Baton Rouge Parish
      will be randomly selected and standardized behavioral observation scales will be used to
      objectively quantify the physical activity and screen-time environment of the centers and the
      children's behaviors both in and outside the center. These assessments will be collected
      twice during the 2-year grant period to capture potential changes after the policies are
      implemented.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in EPAO score and EPAO subscales.</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
    <description>The EPAO instrument will be used, which is a comprehensive, day-long observation that objectively defines the nutrition and physical activity environmental characteristics of child care centers. To address the specific aim, only the EPAO variables related to physical activity and screen-time will be included in the assessment. Means, standard deviations, and Pearson correlations will be calculated to describe the sample and examine relationships among the environment subscales at baseline and follow-up. Differences in center characteristics (i.e. racial distribution) will be tested using t-tests and chi-square tests. Repeated measures analysis of covariance (ANCOVAs) will be used to examine change in the EPAO score overall.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes in practice-based survey items based on childcare director responses.</measure>
    <time_frame>1 Year</time_frame>
    <description>A survey will be administered to the director of each childcare center to determine the following: awareness of the new policy; structured programs and/or field trips that allow children to be physically active (including number of times per day or week); if one or more community organizations support or provide physical activity programs at the center; whether or not the childcare center has policies regarding television viewing and computer use; amount of time allowed for free play; and amount of time spent outside.</description>
