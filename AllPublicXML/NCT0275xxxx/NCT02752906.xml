      The aim of the study is to describe the safety and antibody response to revaccination with
      MenACYW conjugate vaccine in persons who received their first quadrivalent meningococcal
      conjugate vaccine dose at ≥ 10 years of age.

      Primary Objective:

        -  To demonstrate the non-inferiority of the vaccine seroresponse of meningococcal
           serogroups A, C, Y, and W following the administration of a booster dose of MenACYW
           conjugate vaccine compared to those observed following the administration of a booster
           dose of a licensed Meningococcal Conjugate Vaccine (MCV4) in subjects who were first
           vaccinated with 1 dose of MCV4, 4 to 10 years before the booster dose.

      Secondary Objectives:

        -  To evaluate the vaccine seroresponse of meningococcal serogroups A, C, Y, and W measured
           using human serum bactericidal assay (hSBA) in serum specimens collected 6 days after
           vaccination in a subset of subjects

        -  To evaluate the antibody responses (geometric mean titers) to serogroups A, C, Y, and W
           measured using hSBA on Day 0 (pre-vaccination) and Day 30 after vaccination

      Observational Objectives:

        -  To describe the antibody titers against meningococcal serogroups A, C, Y, and W measured
           by hSBA assessed at Day 0, Day 6, and Day 30 days after vaccination

        -  To describe the safety profile of MenACYW conjugate vaccine compared to that of a
           licensed MCV4 after booster vaccination.

      Healthy adolescents and adults who had received 1 dose of a quadrivalent meningococcal
      conjugate vaccine 4 to 10 years previously will be randomized to receive either 1 dose of
      MenACYW conjugate vaccine or a licensed MCV4 . All participants will undergo immunogenicity
      assessment at baseline (pre-vaccination) and 1 month post-vaccination and will also be
      evaluated for safety up to Day 180 post-vaccination. In addition, a subset will have an
      additional blood sample collected at 6 days post-vaccination for immunogenicity assessment.
