  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to develop a questionnaire to measure patient expectations of
      breast-conserving therapy (breast-conserving surgery and radiation). This questionnaire will
      assist both surgeons and patients by helping provide valuable information to patients about
      what to expect during and after surgery.

    <description>This study aims to develop the Patient Expectations with Breast-Conserving Therapy questionnaire. New questionnaire content will be generated using qualitative research methods. Interview data will be analyzed using a grounded theory approach, which involves generating codes, categories, and themes inductively, rather than imposing a priori assumptions or classifications on the data.</description>

    <description>The assessments are all qualitative. The assessments include an in-person, open-ended qualitative interview, during which the interviewer will use an interview guide to ensure that all relevant topics are discussed. Participants will also complete the Patient Expectations with Breast Reconstruction questionnaire using the think-aloud technique in order to identify which questions reflect the expectations of BCT patients, which questions need modification to reflect the expectations of BCT patients and which questions are not appropriate for BCT patients. The responses to the expectations questionnaire for this portion of the interview will not be recorded or analyzed; only the participants' thoughts and opinions about the questions will be recorded.</description>
