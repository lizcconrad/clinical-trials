  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Speech is a privileged means of communication for humans: its trouble can thus prove being
      extremely handicapping. Standard speech therapy is limited in some cases by the lack of
      sensory feedback available to the patient (hearing, surgery, neural damage, etc.).

      The present study aims at quantify the contribution of the tongue articulatory visual
      feedback offered by ultrasound echography to speech trouble rehabilitation.

      Two complementary populations will be studied : 30 adults with buccopharyngeal surgery, and
      10 childrens with important speech troubles due to central nervous system damage.

      The principle is to conduct standard speech therapy sessions, alternating series of sessions
      with the use of visual feedback and sessions without visual feedback.

      The progress will be regularly measured by means of standard batteries of speech articulation
      tests.
