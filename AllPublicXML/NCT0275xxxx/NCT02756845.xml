      This is a phase 1, multicenter, open-label study of talimogene laherparepvec in pediatric
      subjects with advanced non-CNS tumors that are amenable to direct injection in the clinical
      setting. Approximately 18 treated pediatric subjects are expected to be enrolled into 2
      cohorts stratified by age (permissible based on the incidence of DLTs, a minimum of 6
      subjects/cohort and a minimum of 18 subjects total). DLT will be evaluated based on 6 to 12
      DLT-evaluable subjects in each cohort. The DLT evaluation period is 35 days from the initial
      administration of talimogene laherparepvec.

    <intervention_model_description>Approximately 18 treated pediatric subjects are expected to be enrolled into 2 cohorts stratified by age (permissible based on the incidence of DLTs, a minimum of 6 subjects/cohort and a minimum of 18 subjects total).
Cohort A1 (12 to . 21 years of age)
Cohort B1 (2 to &lt; 12 years of age) Initially, 3 subjects 12 to . 21 years of age are to be enrolled and treated at 100% of the recommended adult dose regimen of talimogene laherparepvec (cohort A1). dose level review team (DLRT) will review the safety data of the first 3 subjects in the olderage cohort A1 to decide if the younger age cohort B1 can be opened for enrollment. If a DLT occurs in the first 3 DLT-evaluable subjects in the older age cohort (A1 or A2), the younger age cohort will not open until a DLT rate &lt; 33% is observed with at least 6 DLT-evaluable subjects in the older age cohort (A1 or A2).</intervention_model_description>

    <description>The first dose of talimogene laherparepvec will be administered at a dose of up to 4.0 mL of 10ᶺ6 PFU/mL followed by a dose of up to 4.0 mL of 10ᶺ8 PFU/mL 21 days (+3 days) later. Subsequent doses of up to 4.0 mL of 10ᶺ8 PFU/mL will be administered every 14 days (± 3 days) thereafter. Cohorts will be assigned as follows: Cohort A1 (age 12 to &lt;=21 years). Cohort B1 (age 2 to &lt; 12 years). The DLRT will review the safety data of the first 3 subjects in the older age cohort A1 to decide if the younger age cohort B1 can be opened for enrollment. If dose de-escalation is needed and if permissible based on the incidence of DLTs, additional DLT-evaluable subjects will be enrolled and treated at a lower dose level of talimogene laherparepvec. Dose de-escalation cohorts will be assigned as follows and the same DLT rules will be applied: Cohort A2 (age 12 to &lt;=21 years), Cohort B2 (age 2 to &lt; 12 years).</description>

    <description>Talimogene laherparepvec will be administered by intralesional injection only into injectable cutaneous, subcutaneous, nodal tumors, and other non-visceral tumors with or without image ultrasound guidance. The first dose of talimogene laherparepvec will be up to 4.0 mL of 10^6 PFU/mL administered on day 1. The second injection, up to 4.0 mL of 10^8 PFU/mL (or up to 4.0 mL of 10^6 PFU/mL for a dose de-escalated cohort), will be administered 21 (+3) days after the initial injection. All subsequent injections, up to 4.0 mL of 10^8 PFU/mL (or up to 4.0 mL of 10^6 PFU/mL for a dose de-escalated cohort), will be administered every 14 (± 3) days. The treatment cycle interval may be increased due to toxicity.</description>
