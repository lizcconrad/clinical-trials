    <textblock>
      Along with the improvement of living standard, the prevalence of Lower extremity arterial
      occlusive disease (LEAOD) is also increasing, which has become an important cause of lower
      extremity amputation and greatly affected the patients' life quality. Currently, percutaneous
      transluminal angioplasty (PTA), including balloon dilatation and stent implantation, has been
      regarded as the most widely applied and accepted treatment for LEAOD. The therapeutic effects
      of lower extremity interventional treatment, varied in different reports. It was reported
      that the therapeutic effects were influenced by some traditional risk factors, including age,
      gender, smoking, and so on. More risk factors are still unknown. The difference of
      therapeutic effects, the endpoint events were compared between interventional and
      conventional treatment group to analyze the effect of interventional treatment on LEAOD and
      explore its risk factors.
