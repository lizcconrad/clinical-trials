  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Until the irruption of the Carotid Revascularization Endarterectomy versus Stenting Trial
      (CREST), carotid stenting (CAS) has been mainly offered to those patients considered at &quot;high
      risk&quot; for open carotid endarterectomy (CEA) based on the available data from large randomized
      clinical trials. &quot;High risk&quot; has been defined as (1) patients with severe comorbidity (class
      III/IV congestive heart failure, class III/IV angina, coronary disease involving ≥ 2 major
      vessels, left ventricular ejection fraction ≤ 30%, myocardial infarction, severe pulmonary
      disease, severe renal failure) and (2) Technical/challenging anatomical criteria (previous
      neck surgery, cervical irradiation, contralateral carotid occlusion, post-endarterectomy
      restenosis, inaccessible lesions or tracheotomy). Several recent studies have called medical
      &quot;high-risk&quot; into question for CAS indication.

      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and perioperative and long-term
      effectiveness in patients with significant carotid artery stenosis with &quot;high-risk&quot; criteria
      (for CEA) treated with carotid stenting and proximal protection device (MOMA®) compared to
      patients with standard-surgical-risk features.
