    <textblock>
      This is an open label prospective study of the impact on healthcare utilization of a surface
      Electromyography (sEMG) based seizure detection system for detecting Generalized Tonic-Clonic
      (GTC) Seizures.

    <textblock>
      The Brain Sentinel® GTC Seizure Detection and Information System is an ambulatory system
      designed to continuously monitor and perform real-time analysis of surface electromyography
      (sEMG) data to detect GTC seizures and to provide an alarm to alert caregivers within 30
      seconds of bilateral, appendicular, tonic extension that a seizure is occurring. The System
      is for recording and storing sEMG data, which is subsequently reviewed by a trained
      healthcare professional in the outpatient clinical setting. The Brain Sentinel® GTC Seizure
      Detection and Information System is intended for real time monitoring of pediatric and adult
      patients who have an arm circumference ranging from at least 16 cm to no greater than 51 cm
      at the biceps. It may be used in the home or healthcare facilities for real-time monitoring
      during the day, night, or for continuous monitoring, including during the titration of, or
      the withdrawal from anti-epileptic drugs.
