  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Vascular claudication is a common cause of functional limitation. This painful condition is a
      source overall muscle deconditioning in the peripheral arterial diseased (PAD) patient
      leading gradually to a state accented inactivity. The characterization of the claudication as
      it results from a proximal or distal ischemia has never carried out. Investigators will
      analyze dynamic pedometer parameter throughout walking tests in PAD patients with
      claudication

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients referred for exercise tests on treadmill for the quantification of walking ability
      will gave a recording of their walking parameters through an instrumented treadmill recording
      biomechanic parameters (surface electromyography, walking pace; force of the foot/treadmill
      interface, length of the step.. etc.) Analysis will be performed until walking is stopped due
      to usual claudication during a constant load 2 miles per hour 10% slope treadmill procedure.
