      This phase II trial studies how well nivolumab and brentuximab vedotin work in treating older
      patients with untreated Hodgkin lymphoma. Monoclonal antibodies, such as nivolumab, may block
      cancer growth in different ways by targeting certain cells. Biological therapies, such as
      brentuximab vedotin, use substances made from living organisms that may stimulate or suppress
      the immune system in different ways and stop cancer cells from growing. Nivolumab and
      brentuximab vedotin may work better in treating older patients with untreated Hodgkin
      lymphoma.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the efficacy based on complete metabolic remission (CMR) rate of brentuximab
      vedotin/nivolumab in previously untreated Hodgkin lymphoma patients 60 years of age or older,
      or those considered unsuitable for standard chemotherapy because of a low cardiac ejection
      fraction (&lt; 50%) or impaired pulmonary or renal function.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. The overall response rate (CMR + partial metabolic response [PMR]). II. Safety and
      tolerability of the regimen in this patient population. III. Duration of response (DOR). IV.
      Progression-free survival (PFS). V. Overall survival (OS).

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. T-cell/cytokine - peripheral blood specimens will be used to assess T-cell activation and
      cytokine up regulation as measures of treatment effect.

      II. Biomarkers - intratumoral cell populations, genetic variability, serum cytokines and
      T-cell activation will be evaluated to identify potential biomarkers that correlate with
      response to therapy.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive brentuximab vedotin intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes and nivolumab IV over
      60 minutes on day 1. Treatment repeats every 21 days for 7 courses and 6-8 weeks in course 8
      in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 30 days for 90 days,
      every 90 days for 2.5 years, and then every 6 months until 5 years from registration.
