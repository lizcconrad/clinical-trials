  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if an avatar-based depression self-management
      intervention (eSMART-MH) once a week for the duration of the participant's radiation
      treatment will significantly reduce depressive symptoms. Investigators also seek to explore
      how women with breast cancer describe their mood using prompted and unprompted speech through
      electronic social media and interviews.

      Participants will be randomized into the eSMART-MH group or the theater testing (attention
      control) group. In addition to the assigned interventions, participants will be asked to
      complete questionnaires and interviews with the study staff.

      complete questionnaires and interviews with the study staff.

      Participants will be enrolled within two weeks of radiotherapy. A preliminary depression
      survey (IDS-SR) will be given to assess depression. There will be a total of three routine
      study assessments, one within two weeks prior to the beginning of radiotherapy, one the last
      week of radiotherapy and one 5 - 7 weeks after radiotherapy is completed.

    <description>eSMART-MH (Electronic Self-Management Resource Training for Mental Health) is a software, which is set in a 3-D virtual primary care office environment in which a subject interacts with avatar virtual healthcare staff (medical receptionist, medical assistant, providers, and a virtual healthcare coach). The avatars are programmed to behave like humans. The subject moves through the 3-D virtual primary care office and encounters virtual healthcare staff and providers. The subject practices discussing depressive symptoms with avatar healthcare providers and practices self-management skills related to symptoms of depression.The subject also interacts with the health care coach. The health care coach provides the subject with real-time strategies to enhance communication with healthcare providers during their virtual office visit. eSMART-MH will be used once a week throughout the duration of radiation treatment.</description>
