    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate if a diet with a high content of phytoestrogens can
      slow down the prostate tumor proliferation. Phytoestrogens are found in food items such as
      soy, rye, and seeds.

      Two hundred thirty men with prostate cancer will be included in the study and followed until
      surgery (at least 6 weeks). Half of the study participants will receive general information
      about healthy food choices and a package of foods with high content of phytoestrogens to add
      to their food. The other half will get the same information but not receive the food-package.

      Data from ecologic and experimental studies clearly show a protective effect of dietary
      phytoestrogens against prostate cancer. Genetic factors are also of etiologic importance in
      prostate cancer and there is growing evidence for the importance of a gene-diet interaction
      in prostate cancer progression. The investigators have recently found a putative genetic
      interaction for this protective role of phytoestrogens. The overall decreased risk of
      prostate cancer in men with a high intake of phytoestrogens was strongly modified by a
      nucleotide sequence variant in the estrogen receptor-beta (ERß) gene. An American study found
      a similar interactive effect between intake of phytoestrogens, as well as body mass index
      (BMI), and another nucleotide sequence variant in ERß.The phytoestrogens isoflavonoids and
      coumestans bind tightly to the estrogen receptor-beta (ERß) and are mainly found in soy and
      other beans. ERß expression has been found to be involved in progression of prostate cancer,
      suggesting that phytoestrogens may interact with ERß in the development of prostate cancer.
      With regard to potential carcinogenic mechanisms, phytoestrogens may be involved in the
      endocrine control of prostate cell growth by influencing the balance between AR and
      ERß.Testosterone and its metabolite 5α-dihydrotestosterone (DHT) cause proliferation of
      prostate epithelial cells through binding to the AR. In contrast, by binding to ERß, 5α
      androstane-3ß,17ß-diol (3ßAdiol), a metabolite of DHT, represses the expression of AR and
      thereby inhibits androgen-driven proliferation while promoting cell differentiation. In terms
      of proliferation, current data suggests a combined stimulatory role of ERα and AR in the
      prostate whereas ERß inhibits proliferation and stimulates differentiation. Both estrogen ERα
      and ß have affinity for estradiol whereas phytoestrogens and 3ßAdiol selectively activate
      ERß. Phytoestrogens should, as a result, be able to restrict cancer growth by acting as a
      substitute for 3ßAdiol. This is confirmed by experimental studies.

      Results from previous intervention studies have given promising results indicating that
      certain dietary or lifestyle modifications can influence the progression of prostate cancer,
      although most of these studies have been of fairly short of duration and based on relatively
      small numbers of patients. For example, a randomised study showed that men who were given a
      dietary addition of flaxseeds had a lower percentage of positive cells containing the
      proliferation marker Ki-67 than men who had not received this addition to their diet. Taken
      together, the present evidence points towards the possibility for prostate cancer patients to
      complement with lifestyle-related treatment alternatives to prevent or delay tumor
      progression.

      Specific aim: To perform a controlled randomized dietary intervention study in men with
      prostate cancer. The investigators will pursue the following specific aims/hypothesis:

        1. &quot;Among men with prostate cancer of intermediate risk-level, a diet high in
           phytoestrogens will reduce tumor progression compared to men with a diet low in
           phytoestrogens&quot;.

        2. &quot;The effects of a diet high in phytoestrogens on prostate cancer tumor progression
           differ between men with different genotypes of polymorphisms in the ERß gene&quot;. The men
           will be divided into two subgroups, those bearing TT or TC/CC alleles, of the
           single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs2987983-13950 T/C in the ERß-gene, in which the
           hypothesis will be tested.

        3. To determine whether RNA expression of the AR, ERα and ERβ in prostate tumor tissue, as
           well as levels of steroid hormones, differs between men with a diet high and low in
           phytoestrogens, respectively, or between different genotypes of the ERβ gene.

        4. To determine whether Cyclic citrullinated peptide (CCP) gene expression in prostate
           tumor tissue differs between men with a diet high and low in phytoestrogens,
           respectively, or between different genotypes of the ERβ gene.

      Study protocol: Trough treating physicians, the investigators will identify 240 men in the
      Västra Götaland healthcare region who have been diagnosed with prostate cancer of
      intermediate risk-level (T1-T2, Gleason score &lt;8, PSA&lt;20)scheduled for radical prostatectomy.
      The clinic will be informed of which patients have been enrolled in the study, and the
      surgery for these patients will be scheduled six weeks ahead of time from the date of
      inclusion. Once a patient has agreed to participate, he will be randomized to one of the two
      intervention arms. The patient will then receive additional information depending on which
      group he belongs to and will be asked to donate a blood sample. Under normal clinical
      routine, data on all prostate cancer cases is collected in the National Prostate Cancer
      Register (NPCR), for example information on Gleason score, tumor volume, Prostate-specific
      antigen (PSA) levels. The investigators will collect information from the registry in
      connection with the analysis of data.

      Intervention: Patients will be introduced to the intervention diet by a dietitian and will
      receive general information about healthy food choices (according to recommendations for the
      general public) and not to eat any dietary supplements, no other dietary restrictions will be
      given. The patients will be given a package containing food with a high amount of
      phytoestrogens (≥100 mg isoflavonoids and ≥100 mg lignans) that are to be consumed daily. The
      intervention continues until the day before the surgery (at least 6 weeks). The patients in
      the control group will be informed in the same way as the intervention group except that they
      will not receive any food-package.

      Endpoint: The effect of the diet on tumor proliferation rate will be measured by making
      comparisons of 1) percentage of positive cells containing the marker Ki-67, 2) PSA-levels, 3)
      CCP-score in the two groups. Tumor tissue from prostate biopsies taken during surgery (the
      end of the study) and the most recent biopsy taken before the beginning of the study will be
      collected. Blood samples will be taken at the beginning of the study, at the day before the
      surgery, and 3 months after surgery, and send to analysis of PSA (free and total). The
      absolute differences in PSA levels and the PSA doubling time will be calculated. In addition
      the investigators will measure the expression of AR, ERα and ERß in tumor tissue and the
      blood levels of hormones, testosterone, DHT, estradiol and 3ß-Adiol.

      Questionnaire: All patients will answer a password-protected questionnaire at baseline,
      surgery, and after 3 months, weight and height will be measured. Once during the 6-weeks
      period a 24-h recall interview will be performed, in which participants food intake during
      the preceding 24 h will be registered. The individual intake of energy and specific nutrients
      will be estimated by linking information from the questionnaire and diet record to the
      National Food Agency's nutritional database and our previously developed phytoestrogen
      database.

      Analysis of polymorphs:SNP in the ERß-gene will be analysed in blood samples, using the
      PCR-based method competitive allele specific PCR (KASP™). The allele-constitution will be
      identified and participants will be assigned to group TT, TC or CC. Analysis of Ki-67: The
      biopsy sample is fixed by immersion with 4 % paraformaldehyde in 0,1 M phosphate buffer
      during 24hours at +4°C. Then it is dehydrated with graded ethanol followed by xylene and
      paraffin embedding. Paraffin sections are heated for 30 minutes at 60ºC, pre-treated with
      citric acid buffer. Unspecific binding is blocked by donkey serum in phosphate buffered
      saline (PBS) containing Triton X-100 for 30 minutes. Incubating with Ki-67 antibody over
      night (4ºC) followed by incubation with the appropriate secondary biotinylated antibody. To
      enhance the signal, the sections are treated with avidin-biotin-complex solution, and to
      visualize the immunoreactivity Diaminobenzidine (DAB) is used. Stained tumor cells (Ki-67
      positivity) will be counted and the result will be reported as the ratio of positive nuclei
      divided by the total number evaluated × 100.

      Analysis of receptor-expression, CCP score, hormone levels and PSA: Tissue samples taken at
      surgery is placed in RNA-later before being frozen. The samples will be analysed using RNeasy
      plus Universal Mini Kits (QIAGEN), and Real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR). ERα, ERβ
      and AR mRNA expression will be determined using TaqMan assay. For analysis of CCP score, the
      pathologist select regions of carcinoma and RNA will be extracted as above; thereafter gene
      expression will be assessed according to the manufactures (Prolaris®) instruction. PSA-blood
      levels will be analysed according to standard clinical protocol.

      Power calculation: In the Västra Götaland healthcare region in 2012, 321 men had intermediate
      risk-level prostate cancer for which they received curative treatment. Calculation using the
      primary outcome (Ki-67) gives for a study group consisting of 118 patients an 80 % power for
      a two-sided test with a level of significance at 0,05 and effect size of 0,5. The
      investigators found in earlier studies that approximately 42 % of the male population are
      heterozygous or homozygous for the variant allele (TC/CC) of the ERβ promoter region SNP
      (rs2987983-13950 T/C) and 58 % homozygous for the wild type allele (TT). Since the
      investigators expect the effect of the intervention to be greater among subjects with the
      variant allele, while smaller among subjects with the wild type allele, this latter group
      ought to be large enough to be able to find a difference if one exists. Thus a total sample
      size of 118/58%=203 patients is needed.

      Statistical Considerations: The investigators will utilize the intention-to-treat method. In
      the design and data collection testing of drugs as the template have been made
      (randomization, placebo, blinding, no attrition, no differential measuring errors, correct
      analysis); for the deviations from the perfect situation the investigators use
      epidemiological theory for guiding the analyses and interpreting the results. Preliminary
      analyses, based on means, medians, standard deviations and interquantile range will be
      provided to properly describe the outcomes of interest and stratification will be performed
      to assess the performance of the randomization of the assigned diet. Box-plots will therefore
      be produced to graphically evaluate the temporal trends in the response. The distribution of
      the outcomes will be studied and appropriate transformations will be applied, if needed, to
      improve symmetry and normality. Due to the longitudinal structure of the data, correlation
      among observations will be incorporated and linear mixed effects models will be carried out
      to study if (i) there is a temporal trend (ii) if the linear trend differs between treated
      and untreated individuals (iii) if the treatment effect between the intervention group and
      the control group is modified according to ERß genotypes, both for the common and the
      variant. A key step in analysis of longitudinal data is to identify the appropriate
      covariance structure that describes the correlations among the data points: independent
      covariance (no correlation), exchangeable covariance (equal correlation) or autoregressive
      covariance with correlation between responses decreasing with time between measurements. The
      investigators will identify the most appropriate structure, verified empirically with help of
      an information theoretic approach. Both statistical tests and confidence intervals will be
      produced to assess the significance of the effects, partial F test procedures will therefore
      be used to study the joined effect of main and interaction variables and appropriate
      statistical methods will be applied to study model fitting.
