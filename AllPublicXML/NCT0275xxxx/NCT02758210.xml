      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effects that electromagnetic field exposure from
      using a tablet and smart phone have on a leadless pacemaker (MICRA device).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      With advancement in technology, people are exposed to new sources of electromagnetic field
      like tablets and smart phones. There are magnets in smart phones and tablets that could
      affect the functions of pacemakers. The main purpose of this study is to evaluate the effects
      of electromagnetic field exposure from using a tablet and a smart phone with participants
      that have a leadless pacemaker (MICRA device) implanted inside them. Participants will be
      asked to report any symptoms that they experience during the testing.

    <time_frame>Baseline (Before use of Smart Phone), During use of Smart Phone (an average of 5 minutes)</time_frame>
    <description>Ventricular pacing before and during use of a smart phone was monitored to assess the presence of inhibition of ventricular pacing due to electromagnetic field exposure. The programmed pacing of the MICRA device is specific for each participant. The individualized, initial programmed pacing settings of the MICRA device are compared to any changes during the smart phone usage.</description>
