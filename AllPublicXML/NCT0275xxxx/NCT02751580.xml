      This pilot clinical trial studies how well telehealth works in patients during post radiation
      therapy visits. A telehealth virtual office visit can be performed from the patient's home or
      workplace, decreasing time spent traveling to visit site, time spent in waiting room, and
      cost to patient. Studying telehealth may improve quality of life in patients during post
      radiation therapy visit.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To examine feasibility of conducting a trial comparing a telehealth visit and an in person
      office visit.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To examine patient satisfaction, patient assessment of physician communication during a
      telehealth visit.

      II. To examine patient distrust in the healthcare system following a telehealth visit.

      III. To examine physician ability to perform a patient assessment during a telehealth visit.

      IV. To examine physician perceptions of telehealth visits. V. To examine monetary and time
      cost to patients for telehealth visit. VI. To calculate clinic savings derived from
      telehealth visits.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients undergo their first post-treatment visit as a virtual telehealth visit using the
      JeffConnect application.
