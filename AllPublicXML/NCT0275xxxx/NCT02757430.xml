  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this registry is to assess and characterize the use and performance of the
      EnSite Precision™ Cardiac Mapping System and the EnSite Precision™ Software V2.0 in a variety
      of electrophysiological (EP) procedures and clinical settings. This registry will assess the
      clinical performance of the system in a controlled, real-world environment after commercial
      release.

      Up to 500 subjects will be enrolled in up to 50 sites worldwide.

      Data will be collected at enrollment/baseline, procedure and pre-discharge. There is no
      long-term follow-up required for this registry.

      The anticipated registry enrollment is about 6-7 months.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The use of the EnSite Precision™ Cardiac Mapping System will be assessed by collecting
      feedback from physicians/operators through specific questions.

      The performance of the EnSite Precision™ Cardiac Mapping System will be assessed by
      collecting procedure data and adverse events.

      A detailed Data Management Plan will be established to ensure consistency of the data. This
      document will include procedures used for data review, database cleaning, and issuing and
      resolving data queries. If appropriate, the Data Management Plan may be updated throughout
      the registry duration. All revisions will be tracked and document controlled.

      Case Report Form data will be captured in a validated electronic database management system
      hosted by St. Jude Medical.

      Centralized monitoring will occur through routine internal data review. This monitoring is
      designed to identify missing and inconsistent data, data outliers, and potential protocol
      deviations that may be indicative of site non-compliance. On-site monitoring may occur at the
      discretion of the sponsor.
