    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, placebo-controlled, single &amp; multiple dose escalation study to
      investigate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of SHR0534. The
      study will be conducted with starting dose of 5 mg followed by dose escalation groups up to
      100 mg. Healthy Chinese subjects will be randomized in each cohort to receive the study drug
      or placebo.
