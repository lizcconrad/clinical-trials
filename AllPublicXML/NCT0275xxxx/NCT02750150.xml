  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Knowledge and management of bleeding in severe trauma has changed. A specific coagulopathy is
      present in 40% of cases. It has a very early onset and this coagulopathy is associated with
      increased mortality. It must be detected and treated early, as illustrated by the military
      medical data, from the Iraq war and civilian medicine. However, fresh frozen plasma (FFP)
      requires a thawing step.The French army has encouraged the development of a freeze-dried
      plasma of innovative because viral inactivation and universal blood grouping, well tolerated,
      with a reduced risk of TRALI. This sophisticated therapeutic product can be administered
      after 6 minutes of reconstitution without the need for cross-matching. Nevertheless, its used
      is currently reserved for military purpose in overseas operations and needs to be evaluated
      for civil use. To this end, the investigators need to evaluate the impact on coagulopathy of
      an immediate availability of plasma.
