    <textblock>
      The study's primary objectives are to evaluate the safety and tolerability of BMN 250
      administered to subjects with MPS IIIB via an ICV reservoir and catheter and to evaluate the
      impact of BMN 250 on cognitive function in patients with MPS IIIB as assessed by the
      Development Quotient.
