      Right For Me is a study that aims to improve the conversations patients and health care
      providers have about birth control. Right For Me will test two different strategies for
      improving these conversations. The first strategy is to give patients a video to watch that
      encourages them to ask three specific questions in their health care visit, as well as a
      prompt card that reminds them of the three questions. The second strategy is to give health
      care providers a set of decision aids that describe available birth control methods, as well
      as training in how to use them with patients during the health care visit. Right For Me will
      test whether introducing one or both of these strategies leads to better conversations than
      providing health care as usual.

    <description>A brief video (available in English and Spanish) intended to be viewed by patients immediately before the health care visit. The video aims to enhance patients' motivation, skills, and self-efficacy to ask their health care providers three specific questions: (1) What are my options? (2) What are the pros and cons of those options? and (3) How likely are those pros and cons to happen to me?
A prompt card (available in English and Spanish) intended to be provided to patients when they view the video and kept. The card aims to remind patients of the three questions presented in the video.</description>

    <intervention_name>Decision Aids + Training</intervention_name>
    <description>Seven one-page decision aids on contraceptive methods (available in English and Spanish) intended to be used by health care providers with patients during the health care visit.
