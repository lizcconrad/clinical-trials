  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research is to study how red blood cells (RBCs) survive in a person's
      circulation, and how that survival may be different in red blood cells that are donated and
      stored prior to being transfused. Investigators will study this by collecting blood samples
      from participants, &quot;labeling&quot; RBCs with a naturally occurring vitamin, biotin. The RBCs will
      then be re-infused back into the participant and blood samples will be taken weekly for 10
      weeks to assess the number of labeled cells in the samples.

      The purpose of this research is to study how red blood cells (RBCs) survive in a person's
      circulation, and how that survival may be different in red blood cells that are donated and
      stored prior to being transfused.

      In this study, blood is collected from healthy subjects, processed into packed red blood cell
      units, and either immediately afterwards or 40-42 days later the packed red blood cells are
      labeled with biotin. The biotin-labeled red blood cells are then re-infused back to the donor
      (autologous transfusion). Blood samples are then taken from the subject every week for up to
      70 days (10 weeks) to track survival of the labeled red blood cells.

      This study also seeks to demonstrate that biotin-labeled RBCs can be safely transfused back
      to autologous subjects without any adverse reactions. All participants will be followed to
      watch for the development of antibodies against biotin-labeled RBCs.

    <description>500mL of blood will be drawn from each participant. The blood will be processed into a packed RBC unit.
For participants 1 and 2, the RBCs will be labeled with biotin at three pre-defined concentrations of biotin labeling reagent (2, 6, 18 µg/mL of RBCs) and the labeled RBCs will be re-infused into the participant on the same day of collection.
For participants 3 through 8, the RBCs will be stored at 2-6C for 40-42 days before being labeled with three pre-defined concentrations of biotin labeling reagent (2, 6, 18 µg/mL of RBCs) and re-infused into the participant.
Participants will have a 5 mL blood sample drawn within a few minutes of the re-infusion, the day after the re-infusion and then weekly for 70 days (10 weeks) to track the survival of the infused biotin labeled RBCs.</description>
