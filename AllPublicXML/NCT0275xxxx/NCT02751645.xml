      The investigators primary objective is to determine if acute normovolemic hemodilution (ANH)
      for pediatric cardiac surgical patients decreases the volume of blood products transfused
      during surgery and the immediate post-operative period as compared to usual care. This study
      will enroll 24 pediatric heart surgery patients, aged 6 months to 3 years old undergoing
      either ANH prior to initiating cardiopulmonary bypass or the standard of care procedures for
      the use of cardiopulmonary bypass.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Blood transfusion has been associated with worse outcomes in pediatric cardiac surgical
      patients. The major complications associated with it include increased blood loss during and
      after surgery, kidney disease requiring dialysis, abnormal coagulation profile, increased
      vasopressor use, and increased time spent on the ventilator and in the intensive care unit.
      One strategy to minimize blood product administration is acute normovolemic hemodilution
      (ANH). The investigators primary aim is to determine if ANH for pediatric cardiac surgical
      patients decreases the volume of blood products transfused during surgery and the immediate
      post-operative period, compared to usual care. The investigators designed a randomized,
      controlled, open label study that equally assigns 24 pediatric cardiac surgery patients aged
      6 months to 3 years into two groups to receive either ANH prior to initiating cardiopulmonary
      bypass or usual standard of care. Participants in the ANH arm of the study will have 10 ml/kg
      of blood removed following anesthetic induction. In order to maintain normal circulating
      volume, the collected blood will be replaced with an equal volume of 5% albumin. All
      participants will be treated with a standardized protocol aimed at blood conservation
      including the use of retrograde arterial and antegrade venous perfusion, small circuit size,
      intraoperative red blood cell salvage, and low hemoglobin targets to trigger transfusion.
