      This research study is evaluating the effectiveness of a 3-session behavioral intervention
      for insomnia in cancer survivors. This is a behavioral intervention study, and no medications
      are involved.

    <textblock>
      This study is being done to test the usefulness of a 3-session cognitive-behavioral
      intervention for improving insomnia in cancer survivors. In this study, the investigators are
      testing whether this 3-session intervention (Cognitive Behavior Therapy for Insomnia in
      Cancer Survivors: CBTI-CS) will improve insomnia in cancer survivors whose continue to have
      insomnia symptoms after receiving sleep hygiene education.

      In addition to the participants who will be offered sleep hygiene education and the 3-session
      CBTI-CS,10 additional participants will be recruited to participate in a pilot evaluation of
      the CBTI-CS intervention delivered via telehealth. This will be a pilot aspect of the study
      and data from these participants will be for descriptive purposes.

    <description>CBTI-CS is a multi-modal intervention designed to address both cognitive and behavioral factors that perpetuate insomnia. Cognitive factors are addressed via cognitive restructuring and psychoeducation. Behavioral factors are addressed by structured sleep restriction, stimulus control and sleep hygiene techniques. Cancer treatment late-effects affecting sleep are addressed as potential contributors to these cognitive and behavioral factors, and as symptoms that may benefit from referral for medical evaluation/management. Participants are instructed in these cognitive-behavioral strategies as a group, but using analysis of personal sleep-log data, symptom self-reports and targeted workbook exercises, they are helped to tailor the intervention to address their specific needs.</description>
