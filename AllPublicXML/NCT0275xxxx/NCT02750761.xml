  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a study to assess the pharmacokinetics (PK) of tedizolid phosphate and its active
      metabolite, tedizolid, and the safety of tedizolid phosphate following administration of a
      single IV (Part A) or oral suspension (Part B) administration to hospitalized participants
      ages 6 to &lt;12 years (Groups 1 and 3, respectively), and 2 to &lt;6 years (Groups 2 and 4,
      respectively).

      Part A (IV):

        -  Group 1 (Cohort 1 and Cohort 2) (6 to &lt;12 years)

        -  Group 2 (Cohort 1 and Cohort 2) (2 to &lt;6 years)

      Part B (Oral Suspension):

        -  Group 3 (6 to &lt;12 years)

        -  Group 4 (2 to &lt;6 years)

      In Cohort 1 of Group 1 (IV) participants received a single administration of tedizolid
      phosphate at 5 mg/kg of total body weight. After all participants in Cohort 1 of Group 1
      received study drug, a preliminary analysis of the safety and PK data was performed and
      results were used to select 4 mg/kg as the appropriate dose for Cohort 2 of Group 1 and Group
      3, and to select 6 mg/kg as the starting dose for the younger participants, Cohort 1 of Group
      2. After all participants in Cohort 1 of Group 2 receive study drug, another preliminary
      analysis of the safety and PK data will be performed and results will be used to confirm 6
      mg/kg as the appropriate dose for Cohort 2 of Group 2. Similarly, the Group 4 dose will be
      confirmed after data review of Group 3 results.
