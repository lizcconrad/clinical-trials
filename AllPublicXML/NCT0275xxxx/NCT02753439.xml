    <textblock>
      A prospective study examining bilateral 3rd molar extraction, by a split mouth protocol the
      investigators augment unilaterally and compare periodontal parameters in between.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      40 patients will undergo bilateral 3rd molar extractions, in each patient one side would be
      augmented by a &quot;Bio-Oss&quot; xenograft.

      Post operative, periodontal parameters such as pocket depth and mobility will be evaluated
      and compared.
