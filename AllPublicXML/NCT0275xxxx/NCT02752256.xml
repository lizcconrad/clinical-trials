      Evaluation of ischemic stroke patients receiving tissue plasminogen activator (rtPA) during
      air ambulance transfer

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of our study is to evaluate the effect of air ambulance transport on patients
      presenting with an ischemic stroke and receive tissue plasminogen activator (rtPA). Primary
      outcome will be the evaluation of air ambulance transfer and if it leads to protocol
      violations or significant delays in therapy. Protocol violations include inaccurate dosing or
      preparation at the outside hospital, uncontrolled blood pressure before and during the
      flight, unnecessary medication administration before and during the flight and adverse events
      (intracranial bleeding, allergic reaction) associated with transfer process. Additional
      evaluation will include the effects of vibration of the air ambulance and its effects on the
      lytic activity of rtPA. rtPA is not supposed to be significantly agitated after it is
      prepared in solution and there is significant vibration and agitation during air ambulance
      transfer.
