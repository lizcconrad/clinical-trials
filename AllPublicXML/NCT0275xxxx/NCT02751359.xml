  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this double-blind, placebo-controlled study is to determine the analgesic
      effects of cannabidiol (CBD), a chemical constituent found in cannabis that does not have
      intoxicating effects. The analgesic effects of CBD will be assessed using the Cold-Pressor
      Test (CPT), a laboratory model of pain which has predictive validity for the clinical use of
      analgesics.

    <textblock>
      This within-subject, double-blind, placebo-controlled study will assess the analgesic and
      subjective effects of a range of CBD doses (0, 200, 400, or 800 mg, po). Volunteers will
      participate in 4 outpatient laboratory sessions over the course of 4 weeks during which the
      analgesic effects of CBD will be assessed using the Cold-Pressor Test (CPT), a laboratory
      model of pain which has predictive validity for the clinical use of analgesics. The order of
      CBD dose will be randomized across participants. Secondary measures will include subjective
      and physiologic effects of CBD.
