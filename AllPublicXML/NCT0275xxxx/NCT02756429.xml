    <textblock>
      Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common cardiac arrhythmia. Because of its major impact
      on the general morbidity and risk of stroke, AF is a great concern for public health. Several
      mechanisms, including endothelial dysfunction and inflammatory processes, have been
      postulated as predisposing factors for AF, as well as for stroke.

      Both clinical and experimental studies highlight inflammation as a predisposing factor for AF
      and its complications. Nevertheless, the source of high inflammatory proteins in patients
      with AF is still unknown. We hypothesized that multilevel intracardiac and extracardiac (left
      femoral vein, coronary sinus, left atrium, pulmonary vein) measurements of several
      inflammatory proteins (VEGF) would help assessing the extent and the source of inflammation
      in AF patients.

      The measurement of von Willebrand factor (vWF) levels in multiple vascular sites would also
      help to define the site of endothelial dysfunction and of production of this thrombogenic
      factor.

      Although AF is associated with an increased risk of stroke, the risk is not homogeneous.
      Permanent and persistent AF are associated with similar thromboembolic risk to that of
      paroxysmal AF.

    <description>Patients with atrial fibrillation for whom electrophysiology exploration or ablation are programmed; All blood samples will be taken through the exploration catheter. For the peripheral blood sample, blood will be taken at the introduction of the catheter into the femoral vein. Then the blood samples in the coronary sinus and in the left atrium will be made at progressively exploration.</description>
