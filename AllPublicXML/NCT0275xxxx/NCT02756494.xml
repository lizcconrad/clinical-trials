    <textblock>
      Stroke is the fifth leading cause of death in the United States and the leading cause of
      disability. However, in China, stroke is one of the most frequent causes of death and chronic
      disability. Ischemic strokes in adults younger than 45 years of age were regarded as a
      relatively uncommon event in the proportion of &lt;5% of all ischemic strokes.

      Currently, stroke is the fifth leading cause of death in the United States and the leading
      cause of disability. However, in China, stroke is one of the most frequent causes of death
      and chronic disability. Ischemic strokes in adults younger than 45 years of age were regarded
      as a relatively uncommon event in the proportion of &lt;5% of all ischemic strokes. Our study
      aimed to evaluate some Biomarkers Underlying in Ischemic Stroke in Chinese Young Adults.
