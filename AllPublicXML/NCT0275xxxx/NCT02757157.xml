    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the metabolic load during a single session of
      moderate intensity walking in water compared to walking on land (over-ground) in people with
      chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) who are normal weight and obese, compared with
      peak exercise metabolic response.

      The hypothesis is that the metabolic load of walking at a moderate intensity in water will be
      greater than walking on land.

    <description>Participants will walk in the water for 15 minutes at an intensity rating of five on the modified Borg scale for dyspnoea or perceived exertion, whichever is the highest. Walking intensity will be measured every three minutes during each walking session. If the intensity level is reported as below five, participants will be encouraged to increase the intensity by increasing their walking speed.
During walking in water, VO2 and VE will be measured breath-by-breath using the Oxycon mobile. Every three minutes during the walking, heart rate, oxygen saturation, dyspnoea and exertion will be measured.</description>
