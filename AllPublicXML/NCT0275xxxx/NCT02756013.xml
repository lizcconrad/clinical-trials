    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the side effects and effectiveness of giving
      standard paclitaxel chemotherapy in doses based on actual body surface area in combination
      with standard dosed carboplatin chemotherapy for overweight women.

      Primary Objective The primary objective is to prospectively evaluate the Relative Dose
      Intensity (RDI) and toxicity of weight-based dose dense weekly paclitaxel and carboplatin in
      overweight patients with a BSA &gt; 2.0 compared to the Japanese Gynecologic Oncology Group
      trial (JGOG 2016) during 6 - 9 cycles of chemotherapy.

      Secondary Objective(s) The secondary objective is to evaluate progression-free survival in
      this patient population.

      Study Design This is a descriptive study to determine what the relative dose intensity of
      patients who are overweight with a BSA of greater than 2.0 can achieve.

    <description>To prospectively evaluate the Relative Dose Intensity (RDI) of weight-based dose dense weekly paclitaxel and carboplatin in overweight patients with a BSA &gt; 2.0 compared to the Japanese Gynecologic Oncology Group trial during 6 - 9 cycles of chemotherapy.</description>

    <description>Progression will be evaluated in this study using the new international criteria proposed by the revised Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) guideline (version 1.1). Changes in the largest diameter (unidimensional measurement) of the tumor lesions and the shortest diameter in the case of malignant lymph nodes are used in the RECIST criteria.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with a histologically confirmed or presumed diagnosis of gynecologic
             malignancy for whom chemotherapy with paclitaxel and carboplatin is planned.

          -  Body Surface area &gt;2.0

          -  Patients must have adequate:

               -  Renal function: Creatinine &lt;1.5 x Institutional upper limits of normal (ULN)
