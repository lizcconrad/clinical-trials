  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Surgical resection has offered the best option for prolonged survival in patients with
      colorectal liver metastases. Limiting factor for major liver resections is the size of the
      future liver remnant (FLR). In case of normal liver function, 30% of the total liver volume
      is considered to be sufficient to maintain adequate liver function after resection. In an
      attempt to further increase &quot;resectability&quot; criteria for patients with too small FLR surgical
      and interventional maneuvers such as portal vein embolization and portal vein ligation in
      two-stage hepatectomies have been implemented, but they need an interval of 4-8 weeks to
      achieve sufficient hypertrophy. In order to obtain adequate but rapid parenchymal hypertrophy
      a new surgical two-step technique, ALPPS, was introduced for oncological patients requiring
      extended hepatic resection with limited functional reserve. Both procedures can be performed
      with acceptable morbidity and mortality.

      The investigators conclude that it is time to perform a randomized study comparing the two
      surgical approaches in regard to oncological outcome.

    <measure>1 Year Disease-free Survival</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year after Randomization</time_frame>
    <description>The primary objective will be disease-free survival at one year after randomization as determined by PET-CT (Positron emission tomography - Computer tomography), when not available by CT (Computer tomography) Thorax/Abdomen. This will be assessed by two independent radiologists who will be blinded to which arm the patient was enrolled in.
Patients who died, are lost to follow up or are too sick to undergo imaging will be censored and counted as failures to reach the primary endpoint.
Patients may need resection of their primary tumor after the study intervention (liver first strategy). They may develop recurrence within the study period, systemic or in the liver. In these patients ablation, reoperation and chemotherapy are used as customary clinical routine. Whether they achieved tumor free survival however depends only on the PET-CT or CT Thorax Abdomen at one year.</description>

    <time_frame>Up to 1 year after Randomization</time_frame>
    <description>The percentage of patients, in which a complete curative two-staged surgical procedure was possible, will be assessed.
&quot;Complete&quot; is defined as successful completion of both surgical steps of the procedure, i.e.:
step 1: cleaning of tumorlesions in the future liver remnant (FLR) and portal vein ligation of the contralateral segments to induce hypertrophy of the FLR (with or without in situ split/transsection).
step 2: resection of the tumorbearing part of the liver, leaving a tumor-free FLR in situ.
&quot;Curative&quot; is defined as achieving a tumorfree FLR after step 2 with no signs of extrahepatic tumor existance.
(If patients have the primary tumor or potentially resectable lung metastases, which will be approached surgically in the future treatment of the patient in a curative intent, then the procedure does count as curative).</description>

    <description>ASSOCIATING LIVER PARTITION WITH PORTAL VEIN LIGATION FOR STAGED HEPATECTOMY (ALPPS)
Associating Liver Partition and Portal Vein Ligation for Staged Hepatectomy (ALPPS) is performed according to local practice in the respective centers. Preconditions to participation are experience with major liver resections and documentation of having performed at least 5 ALPPS cases prior to participation due to the learning curve with this quite complex procedure.
The amount of transsection (in-situ split/liver partition) in Step 1 is left to the participating center, no minimal % of transsection is specified.</description>

Two-Stage Hepatectomy is defined as:

Partial resection + secondary portal vein embolization (RES PVE). Followed by (extended) hemihepatectomy after an interval to induce hypertrophy of the liver.
Conventional Two- Stage Hepatectomies will be standard procedures of the centers participating in the study.</description>
