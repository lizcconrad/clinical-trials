    <textblock>
      The goal of this clinical research study is to learn if using a larger than the standard
      mapping grid currently used at MD Anderson during brain tumor surgery or a high-definition
      grid for electrocorticogram (ECoG) brain mapping can help better identify which areas of the
      brain are active during specific limb movement and speech. In this study, the result of two
      types of ECoG mapping grids will be analyzed.

      ECoG mapping will take place during your scheduled surgery. Before the procedure, you will be
      assigned one of the two types of mapping grids. The mapping grid will be placed directly on
      the surface of your brain during surgery. You will not be able to feel this. The grids
      contain electrodes attached to a computer to record brain activity. A wireless digital glove
      will be used with the high-definition grid. The glove records hand movements, while the grids
      shows the areas of the brain that are active during the hand movements.

      This is an investigational study. The fMRI, TMS procedure, and direct electrical stimulation
      are FDA-approved procedures. Both PMT and AdTech mapping grids are FDA-approved and
      commercially available.

      ECoG mapping utilizing the PMT grids during brain tumor surgery is FDA-approved and currently
      used at MD Anderson. The AdTech grid is FDA-approved and was previously used in MD Anderson.
      ECoG mapping utilizing these grids is currently being used for research purposes only and
      will be performed at no charge to you while you are on study.

      Up to 20 participants will be enrolled in this study. All will take part at MD Anderson.

      Before surgery:

        -  You will have 2 standard pre-surgical brain mapping procedures: functional magnetic
           resonance imaging (fMRI) and transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). For the fMRI, you
           will lie inside of a long scanner and be asked to perform several simple tasks. The scan
           will show areas of the brain that are active during specific tasks. During the TMS
           procedure, a magnetic coil is moved over certain areas of your head to stimulate the
           parts of the brain that cause muscles in your arms and legs to move. This will help the
           doctor learn which specific parts of your brain control your limbs.

        -  You will be trained to use the wireless digital glove that will be used in the ECoG
           mapping during your surgery.

        -  You will be assigned one of the three types of high definition mapping grids (PMT,
           AdTech or CorTec grid) to be used during your surgery.

      During surgery:

        -  The mapping grid will be placed on the surface of your brain.

        -  When the grid is in place, the anesthesiologist will wake you up and you will be asked
           to wear the special glove and perform hand movements. This should take about 20 minutes.

        -  The neurosurgeon will perform standard tests (direct electrical stimulation mapping) to
           learn which parts of the brain near the tumor control the arms and legs. These areas of
           the brain will be stimulated with a small-dose electrical current to see which limbs
           will move.

        -  After this procedure, the anesthesiologist will put you back to sleep.

      The results of the ECoG mapping will be used for research purposes only. They will not be
      used to make decisions about your surgery. The collected data will be de-identified and will
      be transferred to neural engineering laboratory of Dr. Ince located at the University of
      Houston for detailed computer based analysis.

      One (1) day after surgery, you will have a neurological exam (tests to check the functioning
      of your nerves, including tests of your balance and reflexes).

      Length of Study:

      Your participation on the study will be over after the follow-up visits.

      Follow-up Visits:

      At 1 and 3 months after your surgery, you will come back to the clinic for standard follow-up
      visits. At each visit, you will have a complete physical and neurological exam.
