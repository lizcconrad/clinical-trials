    <textblock>
      This is a phase I/II multicenter-study to investigate the feasibility safety and efficacy of
      interleukin (IL)-15 activated CIK cells in patients with acute leukemia or myelodysplastic
      syndrome (MDS) showing evidence of relapse after allogeneic stem cell transplantation (SCT).

      CIK cell infusions will be given with an interval of 4-6 weeks according to a dose escalation
      schedule in patients with impending relapse after allogeneic SCT. In presence of acute graft
      versus host disease (aGvHD) ≥ grade II, the next scheduled infusion will not be administered.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Acute leukemia and MDS patients with molecular relapse in peripheral blood (PB) or
             bone marrow (BM) samples obtained during monitoring for relapse after allogeneic SCT.

               -  Female patients of child-bearing potential not agreeing to use a highly effective
                  method of birth control resulting in a low failure rate (i.e. &lt; 1%) when used
                  consistently and correctly.

               -  Male patients with female partners of childbearing potential not agreeing to use
                  a highly effective method birth control resulting in a low failure rate (i.e. &lt;
                  1%) when used consistently and correctly.
