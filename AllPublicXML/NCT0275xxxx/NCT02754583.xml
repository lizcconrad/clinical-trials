    <textblock>
      SWIFT is a series of 3 cluster-randomized trials designed to assess several alternative
      strategies for trachoma control in communities that have been treated with many years of mass
      azithromycin distributions. The first trial (named WUHA) compares communities that receive a
      comprehensive Water, Sanitation, and Hygiene (WASH) package to those that receive no
      intervention. The second trial (named TAITU-A) compares communities randomized to targeted
      antibiotic treatment versus those randomized to mass antibiotics for trachoma, and the third
      trial (TAITU-B) compares communities randomized to targeted antibiotics versus those
      randomized to delayed antibiotics.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Trachoma is a blinding disease caused by ocular strains of Chlamydia trachomatis. The Carter
      Center and Proctor Foundation have been jointly conducting trachoma research in the Amhara
      region of Ethiopia for the past 10 years, through a series of clinical trials. We have found
      that repeated mass administration of oral azithromycin can greatly reduce the prevalence of
      trachoma, but mass antibiotics have been unable thus far to eliminate infection.

      The World Health Organization recommends not only antibiotics for control of trachoma, but an
      entire SAFE strategy (Surgery for in-turned eyelids, Antibiotics, Facial hygiene promotion,
      and Environmental improvements such as latrines and water points). The rationale for the SAFE
      strategy is based on many years of observational studies on trachoma. Cross-sectional studies
      have found that clinically active trachoma and ocular chlamydial infection are associated
      with several indicators of poor hygiene, including dirty faces, face-seeking flies, long
      distance to water supply, and lack of household latrine. There are few randomized trials
      testing the impact of WASH improvements on trachoma.

      In the past, the WHO has recommended targeted antibiotic treatments to those individuals with
      active disease, so this could be an alternative treatment strategy that would limit
      antibiotic use in the community and perhaps be cost-saving. However, little research has
      assessed targeted treatments as a strategy for trachoma elimination following repeated mass
      azithromycin distributions.

      Our long term goal is to eliminate trachoma even in the most hyperendemic communities. This
      cluster-randomized clinical trial will determine the role of a comprehensive package of
      sanitation measures for the elimination of trachoma. We will monitor clinical disease with
      photography, and monitor infection with a newer chlamydial polymerase chain reaction (PCR)
      test (Abbott m2000) that is more sensitive than earlier generation tests, and provides
      quantification. We will monitor other potential health benefits of a WASH intervention and
      test its overall cost effectiveness. We will also assess a competing strategy for minimizing
      antibiotic use: that of targeted azithromycin treatments to children testing positive for
      ocular chlamydia. We will model the long-term cost-effectiveness of these competing
      strategies for trachoma control after completion of several rounds of mass azithromycin
      distributions.

      As an ancillary trial, we will examine whether albendazole and oral azithromiacin
      distribution alters the intestinal microbiome. We will also examine the validity of using
      rectal swabs versus bulk stool samples for measuring soil transmitted helminths (STHs). For
      this ancillary trial, the randomization unit is the person not the community.
