  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this trial is to investigate the bioequivalence of one fixed dose
      combination tablet of empagliflozin/linagliptin (Test, T) compared with the free combination
      of one empagliflozin tablet and one linagliptin tablet (Reference, R) administered as single
      dose under fasted conditions.

        Exclusion criteria:

          -  Any finding in the medical examination (including Blood Pressure [BP], Pulse Rate [PR]

             investigator

          -  Gastrointestinal, hepatic, renal, respiratory, cardiovascular, metabolic,
             immunological or hormonal disorders

          -  Cholecystectomy and/or surgery of the gastrointestinal tract that could interfere with
             the pharmacokinetics of the trial medication (except appendectomy and simple hernia
             repair)

          -  Diseases of the central nervous system (including but not limited to any kind of
             seizures or stroke), and other relevant neurological or psychiatric disorders
