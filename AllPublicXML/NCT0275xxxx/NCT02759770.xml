  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Acute respiratory distress syndrome following cardiac surgery severely affects the prognosis
      of patients; the mortality is up to 40%. Although experience many years of research and
      exploration, the effective methods for the treatment of acute respiratory distress syndrome
      is still relatively limited at present, including lung protective mechanical ventilation
      respiratory support, fluid management, glucocorticoid and other integrated organ function
      maintenance measures. It is currently the research of acute respiratory distress syndrome
      aims at the early discovery and takes effective measures to prevent its occurrence, hoping to
      improve the prognosis of patients. According to risk factors is established through the
      analysis of lung injury score early warning system, the early identification of acute
      respiratory distress syndrome patients at high risk, before the occurrence of acute
      respiratory distress syndrome take corresponding preventive measures can effectively reduce
      the incidence rate and mortality. So far, domestic and foreign research on the establishment
      of acute respiratory distress syndrome scoring early warning system is less. Cardiac surgery
      has significant characteristics, type of operation, location, operation, intraoperative blood
      transfusion and oxygenation, postoperative factors, are likely to be the factors of acute
      respiratory distress syndrome. As far as investigators know, so far there are few specialized
      for acute respiratory distress syndrome predicting lung injury after cardiac surgery. This
      study will be completed after the implementation of individualized dynamic lung injury score
      evaluation of cardiac surgery patients, identification of high-risk acute respiratory
      distress syndrome patients, to assist clinicians in early decision, take preventive measures.
      This study will improve the prognosis of acute respiratory distress syndrome patients after
      cardiac surgery; it is of great significance to improve the level of intensive care after
      cardiac surgery.
