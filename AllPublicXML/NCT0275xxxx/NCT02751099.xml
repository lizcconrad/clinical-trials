      Bone disorder is a significant problem in chronic kidney disease (CKD), becoming almost
      universal in stage 5 CKD patients. Besides the healthcare costs, bone disorder is associated
      with life-threatening complications, including fractures and cardiovascular (CV) events.
      Kidney transplantation provides circa 68% decrease in mortality and improves co-morbidity.
      Still, bone disease persists after transplantation.

      The investigators hypothesize that bone-derived hormones can induce CV events in kidney
      transplanted patients. Therefore, early evaluation of the bone health is recommended, and
      prevention of its complications is required. Bone biopsy, an invasive and expensive method,
      is the gold standard for bone disorders diagnosis. Therefore, non-invasive predictors for
      bone disease are necessary. Classical biochemical markers of bone formation and resorption
      have shown a low sensitivity and low specificity. New markers, as fibroblast growth factor 23
      (FGF23), and its cofactor klotho, and sclerostin are promising new markers for predicting
      CKD-associated bone and CV disease after transplantation.

      This study assesses the phenotype of bone disease after transplantation (given by bone
      histology) and its correlation with serum FGF23, klotho and sclerostin, in order to evaluate
      its performance predicting CKD-associated bone and CV disease.

      BACKGROUND. Chronic kidney disease (CKD) affects millions of people worldwide. Cardiovascular
      (CV) events cause more than 50% of the mortality risk in CKD patients, and the relative
      excess mortality is observed in younger patients, below 45 years of age. Decreased renal
      function led to changes in biochemical parameters (calcium, phosphorus, PTH and vitamin D
      levels) and disturbed mineral metabolism, which translates into different bone disorders
      (related to bone turnover, mineralization, and volume) and all these are associated with
      extra-skeletal calcifications. Bone disease at any stage of CKD is associated with CV
      morbidity. This cross-talk between bone and vessels constitute a systemic syndrome known as
      CKD-mineral and bone disorder (CKD-MBD), that is thought to be one of the major
      non-traditional risk factors for the extremely high rate mortality observed in this disease.

      CKD-MBD is classified into four major histological groups (in terms of turnover,
      mineralization and volume): hyperparathyroid bone disease (high turnover disease, with normal
      mineralization and variable volume); adynamic bone disease (low turnover disease, with normal
      mineralization and decreased bone volume); osteomalacia (low turnover disease, with reduced
      mineralization and with normal or high bone volume); and mixed renal osteodystrophy (reduced
      mineralization with or without increased bone formation).

      Kidney transplantation is the treatment of choice for established stage 5 CKD. Even with
      correction of uremia, post-transplant MBD is frequent and reflects the pre-existing CKD-MBD,
      the effects of renal dysfunction after transplantation, and the effects and consequences of
      immunosuppression. Transplanted patients with CKD-MBD have reduced quality of life and
      require medical assistance for bone pain, fractures and CV events. Indeed, cardiovascular
      disease remains the leading cause of death after renal transplantation, still doubling risk
      of the general population.

      The gold standard for the diagnosis of CKD-associated bone disease is bone biopsy, an
      expensive and invasive procedure. Non-invasive markers of bone disease presently lack
      sufficient specificity and sensitivity to allow the differential diagnosis of renal
      osteodystrophy. New biomarkers are needed and, osteocyte-derived factors, as FGF23 and
      sclerostin, are promising answers.

      FGF23 acts as a phosphaturic hormone, a suppressor of vitamin D and has some non-consensual
      effect on parathyroid hormone (PTH). FGF23 has a specific receptor but needs a co-factor,
      klotho protein, to perform the majority of its functions. Serum klotho levels in CKD are low,
      influencing the resistance to FGF23 activity. What happens in transplanted patients is not
      yet totally understood; some studies pointed out for endothelial dysfunction and
      cardiovascular disease mediated by these factors in the transplant setting. Besides, graft
      loss and mortality were related with high serum levels of FGF23 and with bone mineral density
      loss but their relation with histological bone disease is unknown.

      Sclerostin is a glycoprotein product of the SOST gene in osteocytes and acts as a negative
      regulator of bone metabolism. Various observations have shown that CKD patients have high
      sclerostin serum levels, thus its potential role in renal osteodystrophy. The correlation
      between serum levels of sclerostin and histomorphometric parameters of bone turnover,
      osteoblast number and function in renal transplanted patients is not yet known. The impact of
      high sclerostin levels on CV disease and mortality is yet to be determined.

      Studies relating sclerostin levels with CV mortality in dialysis patients are inconsistent.
      Studies in renal transplanted patients are lacking.

      AIMS. The investigators will study the relationship of the new osteocyte-derived biomarkers
      of bone disease, FGF23 (and klotho) and sclerostin, with bone histologic changes and CV
      events at baseline and one year after transplantation. If an association is to be found, the
      performance of the biomarkers as predictors of CKD-MBD will be determined.

      METHODS. Prospective cohort study of a convenience, consecutive sample of de novo renal
      transplanted patients.

      At recruitment, data will be collected on aetiology of CKD, presence of diabetes,
      hypertension, hyperparathyroidism, hepatitis virus, ovulation status for woman (menopause or
      not), active pre-transplant medication (with emphasis in vitamin D analogues, calcimimetics,
      and phosphate binders), echocardiography (M mode and 2D), Teresa Adrag√£o score of vascular
      calcifications (hands and pelvis x-rays), HLA phenotype and mismatches, donor data (age,
      gender, cause of death), cold ischemia time.

      Patients will be followed-up for 1 year, during which data will be recorded on
      immunosuppressive regimens (cumulative doses), CV events (myocardial infarction, congestive
      heart failure, arrhythmia), fractures, rejection episodes, graft loss (and its cause), and
      death (CV [fatal myocardial infarction, sudden death and fatal congestive heart failure],
      infection, malignancy or other). At the end of follow-up, echocardiogram (M mode and 2D) and
      scoring of vascular calcifications will be performed.

      Serum creatinine, urea, ionogram, uric acid, calcium, phosphorus, magnesium, and bone
      alcaline phosphatase will be assessed using standard methods. PTH will be measured by
      immuno-chemiluminescence using a second-generation assay (Immulite 2000; Siemens Medical
      Solutions Diagnostics, Los Angels, CA). Vitamin D [25(OH)D and 1,25(OH)2D] will be measured
      with radioimmunoassay provided by IDS (Boldon, UK).

      Two bone biopsies are proposed to each patient (just before the renal transplantation
      procedure, already on general anaesthesia, and circa 12 months after transplantation, with
      local anaesthesia). Bone biopsies will be made using a 7G trocar (Osteobell T), by manual
      puncture. After processing the bone fragment (fixation, dehydration and methylmethacrylate
      impregnation), routine staining will be used: von Kossa, Goldner trichrome, acid phosphatase
      (selective staining of osteoclasts), and Perls. Cortical bone will be evaluated separately
      from trabecular bone. Cortical bone volume and cortical thickness will be measured. Bone
      biopsies will be described for: bone remodelling and degree of cellular activation (specific
      score); efficacy of mineralization; quantification of possible metal deposits. In order to
      evaluate the rate of bone formation and rate of mineral deposition, the patient will be
      prescribed tetracycline hydrochloride, 500mg, 12/12 hours for three days, one month and one
      week before the 2nd bone biopsy or, in the case of live donor transplantation, before the 1st
      and 2nd bone biopsy.

      At the same time point of the bone biopsies [at day 0 (pre-transplant) and nearly at month
      12] serum levels of FGF23, and its cofactor Klotho, and sclerostin will be measured in the
      immunology lab of our hospital, according to the manufacturer's instructions. C-terminal
      FGF23 will be measured by sandwich ELISA (Immunotopics, San Clement, CA). Alfa-klotho will be
      measured by ELISA (IBL America, MN, USA). Sclerostin will be assessed by TECO Sclerostin EIA
      kit, which is a 96-well immune-capture ELISA (Sissach, Switzerland).

      Comparisons between bone biopsies before and after transplantation will be assessed by paired
      t-test (if comparing scores) or by paired McNemar's test (after switching scores into
      categorical variables). Multivariable analysis adjusted for age, gender, diabetes,
      immunosuppressive regiments and/or its cumulative doses, and renal function will be performed
      to identify independent risk factors for the disease type and severity. In females, menopause
      will be considered as an effect modifier of bone volume.

      Comparisons between FGF23, Klotho and sclerostin pre and post-transplant will be made by
      paired t-test, assuming normal distribution. Associations between FGF23, Klotho and
      sclerostin levels with demographic data and biochemical parameters in the two time-points
      will also be accessed with t-test, with Pearson test and linear regression, whenever
      applicable. A multivariable analysis will be executed to control for confounders (age,
      gender, diabetes, PTH, renal function, immunosuppressive regiments). Associations between
      FGF23, Klotho and sclerostin with bone turnover, mineralization and volume will be explored
      with regression models. The potential effects of FGF23 or sclerostin with CV health will be
      explored using regression models.
