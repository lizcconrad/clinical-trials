  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      X-linked chronic granulomatous disease (X-CGD) is a rare genetic disorder, which affects
      boys. It is a primary immunodeficiency disorder which results from an inability of the white
      blood cells called phagocytic cells (or phagocytes) to kill invading bacteria and fungi.
      These cells have difficulty forming the free radicals (most importantly the superoxide
      radical due to defective phagocyte NADPH oxidase complex) which are important in the killing
      of ingested pathogens. In X-CGD (which accounts for two thirds of CGD patients), the defect
      lies in a gene which makes up a critical part of the NADPH-oxidase complex (the catalytic
      subunit; gp91-phox protein). Therefore they kill bacteria and fungi poorly, and the patients
      suffer from severe and recurrent infections. This also results in inflammation which can
      damage parts of the body such as the lung and gut.

      In many cases, patients can be adequately protected from infection by constant intake of
      antibiotics. However, in others, severe life-threatening infections break through. In some
      cases, inflammation in the bowel or urinary systems results in blockages which cannot be
      treated with antibiotics, and which may require the use of other drugs such as steroids.
      Development of curative treatments for CGD is therefore of great importance.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Male X-CGD patients &gt;23 months of age. Youngest patients (&gt;1 month and ≤ 23 months)
             may be enrolled at physician's appreciation; in this case mobilization of peripheral
             HSC may be replaced by two bone marrow harvests.

          -  Molecular diagnosis confirmed by DNA sequencing and supported by laboratory evidence
             for absent or reduction &gt; 70% of the biochemical activity of the NAHPD-oxidase.

          -  At least one ongoing or resistant or at high risk of relapse severe infection and/or
             inflammatory complications requiring hospitalisation despite conventional therapy.

          -  No HLA-matched donor available after 3 months search, unless the risk of waiting for a
             potential match or for performing an allogeneic transplant is considered unacceptable.

          -  No co-infection with Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) or hepatitis B virus (HBs Ag
             positive) or hepatitis C virus (anti-HCV Ab positive).

          -  Written informed consent for adult patient.

          -  Parental/guardian and where appropriate child's signed consent/assent.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  10/10 HLA identical (A, B, C, DR, DQ) family or unrelated.

          -  Contraindication for leukapheresis (anaemia Hb &lt;8g/dl, cardiovascular instability,
             severe coagulopathy).

          -  Contraindication for administration of conditioning medication and any component of
             the Investigational Medicinal Product (IMP) preparation.

          -  Administration of gamma interferon within 30 days before the infusion of transduced
             autologous CD34+ cells.

          -  Participation in another experimental therapeutic protocol within 6 months prior to
             baseline and during the study period.

          -  Any other condition that, in the opinion of the Investigator, may compromise the
             safety or compliance of the patient or would preclude the patient from successful
             completion of the study.

          -  Patient/Parent/Guardian unable or unwilling to comply with the protocol requirements.
