  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This multicentre, non-comparative design study will monitor the impact of long term
      management of DH with daily use of a sensitivity toothpaste on the quality of life of a
      population of sensitivity sufferers. Changes in oral health related quality of life will be
      monitored using the Dentine Hypersensitivity Experience Questionnaire (DHEQ). The study will
      be conducted in participants in good general health, with pre-existing self-reported and
      clinically diagnosed tooth sensitivity at screening.

      This will be multicenter, non-comparative design to monitor the impact of long term
      management of DH with daily use of a sensitivity toothpaste on the quality of life of a
      population of sensitivity sufferers, using the DHEQ. Changes in DH will be monitored
      clinically over the 24 week treatment period.

Section 2 had questions about the ways in which the sensations in the teeth affect participants in daily life. It was grouped into domains as follows: Restrictions (Section 2, Q1-4), Adaptation (Section 2, Q5-16), Social Impact (Section 2, Q17 to 21), Emotional Impact (Section 2, Q22 to 29), and Identity (Section 2, Q30 to 34).</description>
