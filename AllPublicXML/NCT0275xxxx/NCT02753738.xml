      Background:

      Conclusive evidence states that the serotonergic system mediates neuroplasticity from early
      embryonic development until brain maturation in adulthood. This study aims to demonstrate
      that selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) enhance learning-dependent
      neuroplasticity in vivo, hereby contributing to the investigators understanding of the
      mechanism of action of therapy with SSRIs.

      Objectives:

        1. To prove a positive influence of SSRIs on structural remodeling during learning,
           reflected by enhancements of gray and white matter microstructure, connectivity and
           functionality in brain regions involved in learning processes.

        2. To show that this effect is topologically specific, i.e. that enhancements of plasticity
           markers are found in different regions depending on their involvement during the
           performance of specific learning tasks.

      Study design:

      Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, longitudinal mono-center study. 80 healthy
      subjects will undergo three MRI scanning sessions: 1. baseline, at study entry, 2. after 3
      weeks of facial/emotional (n=40) or Chinese character-meaning learning (n=40) and 3. after 3
      weeks learning of new associations under administration of an SSRI or placebo.

      Methods:

      MRI measurements will be performed on a 3 Tesla PRISMA MAGNETOM MR scanner. Changes in gray
      matter microstructure will be assessed using high-resolution structural MRI and analyzed with
      voxel-based morphometry (VBM). Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) enables non-invasive
      investigation of neuroplasticity in the human brain based on the reduction in mean
      diffusivity associated with swelling of astrocytes after increased synaptic activity.
      Resting-state functional MRI (fMRI) will allow for the measurement of changes in functional
      coupling between brain regions, and fMRI during tasks will assess differential activity in
      brain regions during learning.

      Relevance and implications:

      This study aims to provide evidence that SSRIs facilitate cytoarchitectonical restructuring.
      In addition to expanding the investigators current knowledge on the trophic effects of SSRIs,
      the results of this study will also elucidate interactions between the serotonergic system
      and changes to neuronal networks during learning as well as their behavioral consequences. By
      probing the neurobiological correlates of the antidepressant and anti-anxiety effects of
      SSRIs, this study will provide a rationale for targeted interventions that harness the
      neuroplasticity enhancing properties of SSRIs to facilitate therapeutic processes.
