  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There is limited information on using the ultrasonography for block placement concerning
      lipoma excision. A new type of regional blockade, performed under ultrasound, can ensure
      proper block placement with accurate local anesthetics deposition. Investigators hypothesized
      that ultrasound guidance can reduce the number of needle passes to complete the block
      placement. Investigators will compare namely ultrasound guided regional blockade and
      traditional method regarding the number of needle passes to complete the block placement.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      50 patients between the ages of 18 and 60 years with American Society of Anesthesiologists
      (ASA) physical status I-III, scheduled for superficial subcutaneous lipoma (sized from 5 to 7
      cm) excision will be enrolled in prospective comparative randomized clinical study.

      Patients will be randomized into two groups: U (n = 25), in whom regional blockade was
      performed using US-guidance; and C (n = 25), in whom regional block was performed using the
      traditional method. Patients will be randomly assigned on a one-to-one ratio. Randomization
      will be performed by means of a computer generated random-numbers table. Group allocation
      will be concealed in sealed opaque envelopes that will not opened until patient consent had
      been obtained.

      All patients will be pre-medicated with oral diazepam (7.5 mg) 30 min before the procedure,
      and IV fentanyl (50 ug) will be administered 5 minutes before placement of the block. Before
      the procedure, an IV access and standard monitoring of electrocardiogram (ECG), noninvasive
      blood pressure (NIBP), and peripheral oxygen saturation (SPO2) will be established.

      Primary outcome includes the number of needle attempts (number of skin punctures and needle
      redirections) needed to complete the block placement. It will be documented by an
      investigator blinded to the aim of the study. Patient demographics, duration of surgery,
      patient's ASA physical status and other study outcomes will be documented by independent
      investigators who were not involved in the block placement procedure and were blinded to the
      group assignment.

    <description>The block success rate is assessed according to the adequacy of surgical anesthesia and is defined as complete loss of sensation to pinprick within 20 min of anesthetic administration and if no supplementation (sedative or analgesic) is required during surgery.Partial block is defined as inadequate sensory blockade after 20 min of anesthetic administration. The supplementation (additional LA infiltration or IV analgesic; fentanyl) is required to complete the proposed surgery. Failed block is considered if general anesthesia is required to complete the proposed surgery.</description>
