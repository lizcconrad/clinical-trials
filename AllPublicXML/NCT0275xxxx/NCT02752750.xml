      In this explorative longitudinal study 50 patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) and 50
      age-matched control subjects will be recruited for their 2 years follow-ups and undergo
      extensive cognitive testing and quantitative 3 Tesla magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).
      Regional differences of susceptibility and R2* relaxation rates in deep gray matter and the
      neocortex will be evaluated in AD patients and controls and related to the patients´
      cognitive status at baseline.

      Abnormally increased brain iron accumulation in deep gray matter is a common finding in
      Alzheimer's disease (AD) and amyloid protein precursor and tau proteins were linked to
      disrupted iron homeostasis. Validation studies showed that brain iron can be measured
      precisely by the novel magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) technique quantitative susceptibility
      mapping (QSM) in vivo, thus, enabling reliable and precise longitudinal investigations.

      It is hypothesized that pathologic brain iron accumulation can be assessed with higher
      sensitivity with QSM than with current MRI techniques such as R2* relaxation rate mapping and
      that regional QSM is a predictor for cognitive decline and disability.

      This explorative longitudinal study is including 50 patients with AD and age-matched control
      subjects which will be recruited for their 2 years follow-ups and undergo extensive cognitive
      testing and quantitative 3 Tesla MRI. Regional differences of susceptibility and R2* in deep
      gray matter and the neocortex will be evaluated in AD patients and controls and related to
      the patients´ cognitive status at baseline. Follow-up MRI and clinical data with multivariate
      regression analysis serve to investigate the dynamics of AD-related changes of
      susceptibility, and their relation to cognitive functioning.

      In conclusion, this explorative longitudinal study in a patient cohort aims to clarify
      whether regional QSM changes are potential biomarkers for AD progression.
