    <textblock>
      This is a Phase I trial in subjects with unresectable locally advanced or metastatic HER2-low
      expressing (IHC 1+ or 2+) breast cancer. The study will be conducted in two parts: the first
      part will involve dose escalation using a 3 + 3 design, and the second part will involve the
      expansion of the MTD or HTD to further evaluate safety, preliminary efficacy, and
      immunogenicity. In the first part, 3 to 6 subjects will be sequentially enrolled starting at
      dose cohort 1. Subjects will be assessed for dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs).

             such as azathioprine or cyclosporin A) are excluded on the basis of potential immune
             suppression. Subjects must have had at least 6 weeks of discontinuation of any steroid
             therapy (except that used as premedication for chemotherapy or contrast-enhanced
             studies) prior to enrollment.

         15. Subjects with known allergy or hypersensitivity to any component of the
             investigational product will be excluded.

         16. Subjects with acute or chronic skin disorders that will interfere with injection into
             the skin of the extremities or subsequent assessment of potential skin reactions will
             be excluded.

         17. Subjects vaccinated with a live (attenuated) vaccine (e.g., FluMist®) or a killed
             (inactivated)/subunit vaccine (e.g., PNEUMOVAX®, Fluzone®) within 28 days or 14 days,
             respectively, of the first planned dose of ETBX-021.
