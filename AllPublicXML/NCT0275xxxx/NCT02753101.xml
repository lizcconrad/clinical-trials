  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic pain can result from injured or inflamed nerves, as occurs in people suffering from
      sciatica and CRPS. These nerve injuries or regions of nerve irritation are often the cause of
      pain in these conditions, but the current diagnostic tools are limited in pinpointing the
      area of origin. Several studies have implicated involvement of sigma-1 receptors in the
      generation and perpetuation of chronic pain conditions, others are investigating anti sigma-1
      receptor drugs for the treatment of chronic pain. Using the sigma-1 receptor (S1R) detector
      and experimental radiotracer [18F]FTC-146 and positron emission tomography/magnetic resonance
      imaging (PET/MRI) scanner, the researchers may potentially identify the source of pain
      generation in patients suffering from complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS) and chronic
      sciatica. The ultimate goal is to assist in the optimization of pain treatment regimens using
      an [18F]FTC-146 PET/MRI scan.

      The study is not designed to induce any physiological/pharmacological effect.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Participants are either pain free (control) or will be recruited based on established
      criteria for sciatica or CRPS. A signed consent will be obtained from willing participants.

      For the PET/MRI scan, the participants will be injected with [18F]FTC-146 intravenously.
      After injection, simultaneous PET and MRI scans will be acquired using a hybrid PET/MRI
      scanner. Throughout scanning, participants will be monitored for blood pressure, temperature,
      heart rate and pulse oximetry. Participants will be asked to void their bladder as frequently
      as they can to reduce radiation exposure. Following the scan, participants will be contacted
      to check for adverse drug events, and any events will be recorded in the case report.

      Evidence in the literature points strongly toward an involvement of S1 receptors in nervous
      system inflammation, which is known to be an important biologic disease/disorder mechanism
      for maintenance and perpetuation of chronic pain.

      The main purpose of this research study is to image and identify activated pain pathways in
      human subjects using [18F]FTC-146 PET/MRI.

    <description>Biodistribution of [18F]FTC-146 will be analyzed by drawing regions of interest (ROI) for the reported organs on the PET/MRI images.
