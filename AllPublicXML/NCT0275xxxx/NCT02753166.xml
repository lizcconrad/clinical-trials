      To determine if a single dose of dexamethasone (5 mg) administered in the first 12 hours
      following a potentially traumatic event alters a) cortisol and FKBP5 RNA the next day in the
      periphery measured in saliva; b) FKBP5 methylation by 1 month; c) executive functioning and
      emotion regulation functioning; d) psychophysiological (heart rate, respiration, skin
      conductance) in response cued reminders of the trauma; e) enhances the likelihood of
      remission of PTSD symptom severity.

    <description>After six (6) hours of the accident, subject will take 5 mg of DEX in the Emergency Department (ED). Within twenty-four (24) hours, the subjects will send in a saliva sample. After sexen (7) days, subjects will participate in a phone interview. After thirty (30) days, subjects will participate in an online assessment and return for a one month follow-up visit. Subjects will then participate in online assessments at months 3,6,9, and 12 months.</description>
