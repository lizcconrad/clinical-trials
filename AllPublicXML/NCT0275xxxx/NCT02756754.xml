  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to evaluate the novel use of adrenal radiofrequency ablation on a
      prospective cohort of patients with primary aldosteronism and unilateral adrenal adenoma
      concerning the efficacy on blood pressure control. The safety of the procedure is one of the
      secondary outcomes.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The prevalence of hypertension dramatically increased. Although most cases of hypertension
      are idiopathic, some cases have an identifiable cause. Primary Aldosteronism (PA) is the most
      common cause of secondary hypertension and can be cured by surgery if PA is due to unilateral
      unique adrenal adenoma. Then this cause is worth identifying it. The surgery despite its
      minimally invasive nature is limited by the need for general anesthesia, the risk of vascular
      or visceral injuries, hematomas and all the adrenal gland is mostly removed. Imaged-guided
      percutaneous adrenal radiofrequency ablation (ARF) offers a less invasive alternative
      therapeutic option. This local therapy is employed to treat solid neoplasms whereas its
      application on functional adrenal adenoma is less documented and only a few case series with
      limited sample size are published. The impact on blood pressure control is not clearly
      reported. ARF ablation works by delivering a high-frequency alternating current through a
      needle electrode. An ionic agitation occurs and generates frictional heat for cell
      destruction at a predictable temperature and volume. Patients with a conventional documented
      PA due to unilateral adrenal nod who consented to the study were hospitalized. Patients with
      PA due to an aldosterone-producing adenoma are included in the study.

    <description>Radiofrequency ablation (RFA) is a minimally invasive technique for eliminating both primary tumors and metastases.
The needles that will be used are monopolar RFA, the LeVeen™ Needle Electrode Family with a generator &quot;RF 3000&quot; by Boston Scientific. The radiofrequency system will be used as the RFA generator device standard cycle of ablation will be applied in the patient. During RFA, blood pressure, pulse and oxygen saturation will be continuously monitored.</description>
