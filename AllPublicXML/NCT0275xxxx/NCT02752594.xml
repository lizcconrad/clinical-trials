  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Dental caries is a multifactorial disease effecting majority of the human population.One of
      the etiological factor causing dental caries is salivary mutans streptococci. Reducing the
      levels of this bacteria in the saliva can significantly reduce the incidence of dental
      caries. A non-invasive intervention, such as the administration of probiotics reduced the
      salivary mutans streptococci levels.

      40 candidates were selected from a pre-determined group and were randomly assigned to two
      groups. Group A (n=20) was administered probiotic drink and Group B (n=20) was administered
      placebo for 14 consecutive days. Saliva was collected on day 1 and day 15 to compare the
      salivary mutans streptococci levels.
