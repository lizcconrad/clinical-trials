  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Purpose of this study is to identify added value of Rotational thrombo-elastometry
      (ROTEM) intra-operative coagulation surveillance on reducing blood product use during major
      reconstructive spine surgery.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to evaluate the effectiveness of intra-operative ROTEM-based
      coagulation monitoring on reducing total blood product use during complex spine surgery.

      The primary outcome will include estimated blood losses and blood product utilization during
      and after surgery (48 hours).

      Secondary outcomes also include hospital length of stay, and cost analysis of the 2
      methodologies.
