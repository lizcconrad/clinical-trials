  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to evaluate the efficacy of the group-based intervention 'Honest
      Open Proud' among adolescents with mental illness.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Both due to fear of public stigma and due to self-stigma or shame, people with mental illness
      may decide to keep their condition a secret or even to withdraw from other people altogether
      in order to minimise the risk of being labelled. Secrecy can help on the short term to
      protect individuals from public stigma, but often it has negative long-term consequences such
      as social isolation, distress and unemployment. Disclosure, on the other hand, carries the
      risk to be discriminated by others, but can reduce the burden of secrecy, lead to support by
      others and reduce public stigma. In this study investigators aim to evaluate whether a group
      program run both by people with mental illness (peers) and professionals helps to reduce
      self-stigma and makes it easier for adolescents to handle the necessary choices related to
      secrecy versus disclosure.

    <description>five lessons in three modules, two for each two-hour session
Considering pros and cons of disclosing:
hurtful and helpful attitudes about mental illness
identify beliefs participants hold about themselves
explore five-step process to challenge their personally hurtful beliefs
weigh pros and cons of coming out in order to facilitate a decision on whether to disclose
Different ways to disclose:
different levels of (non-) disclosure and how to weigh the cons and pros
disclosure via social media versus disclosing face to face
how to find people that are better to disclose to than others and how to 'test them out'
participants will discuss how others might respond to their disclosure and how that will affect them
Telling your story:
how to tell one's story in a personally meaningful way, how to identify peers who might help with the coming out process, to review how telling one's story felt</description>

          -  Ability to provide written informed consent

          -  Fluid in German (needed for self-report measures)

          -  At least a moderate level of self-reported disclosure-related distress/difficulty
             (score 4 or higher on the screening item 'In general, how distressed or worried are
