      Investigators are seeking to learn how well different cooling temperatures along with
      different blood flow pathways to the brain reduce the risk of injury to the brain in
      participants planning to undergo elective aortic arch and hemiarch surgery. Participants will
      be randomized to receive a cerebral protection strategy of either: deep hypothermic
      circulatory arrest and retrograde cerebral perfusion (DHCA+RCP) or moderate hypothermic
      circulatory arrest and unilateral selective antegrade cerebral perfusion (MHCA+uSACP).
      Evidence of neurologic injury will be assessed with neurologic exams, neurocognitive tests,
      MRI imaging of the brain and measurement of plasma S-100 levels during post operative follow
      ups.

      The purpose of this study is to investigate the impact of the two most commonly employed
      methods of cerebral protection upon mitigating neurologic injury in participants planning to
      undergo elective aortic arch and hemiarch surgery. Participants will be recruited from
      patients undergoing ascending aortic and hemiarch replacement using hypothermic circulatory
      arrest at Emory University Hospital and Emory Saint Joseph's Hospital. Participants will be
      randomized to receive a cerebral protection strategy of either: deep hypothermic circulatory
      arrest and retrograde cerebral perfusion (DHCA+RCP) or moderate hypothermic circulatory
      arrest and unilateral selective antegrade cerebral perfusion (MHCA+uSACP). Evidence of
      neurologic injury will be assessed with neurologic exams, neurocognitive tests, MRI imaging
      of the brain and measurement of plasma S-100 levels during post operative follow up. Follow
      up visits will be conducted at Days 1, 3, 7, and 180 post operation.

    <time_frame>Post Operative Visit Day 1, Post Operative Visit Day 180</time_frame>
    <description>The finger-tapping test (FTT) is a neuropsychological test that examines motor functioning, specifically, motor speed and lateralized coordination. During administration, the participant's palm should be immobile and flat on the board, with fingers extended, and the index finder placed on the counting device. One hand at a time, participants tap their index finger on the lever as quickly as possible within a 10-s time interval, in order to increase the number on the counting device with each tap.</description>

    <time_frame>Post Operative Visit Day 1, Post Operative Visit Day 180</time_frame>
    <description>The Digit symbol substitution test (DSST) is a neuropsychological test sensitive to brain damage, dementia, age and depression. It consists of nine digit-symbol pairs followed by a list of digits.Under each digit the participant should write down the corresponding symbol as fast as possible. The number of correct symbols within the allowed time is measured.</description>

    <description>The Stroop effect is a demonstration of interference in the reaction time of a task. Participants will be asked the name of a color printed in a color not denoted by the name. Naming the color of the word takes longer and is more prone to errors than when the color of the ink matches the name of the color.</description>

    <measure>Change in Continuous Performance Test Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Post Operative Visit Day 1, Post Operative Visit Day 180</time_frame>
    <description>The continuous performance test measures a participant's sustained and selective attention. Sustained attention is the ability to maintain a consistent focus on some continuous activity or stimuli, and is associated with impulsivity. Selective attention is the ability to focus on relevant stimuli and ignore competing stimuli. This skill is associated with distractibility.[1]</description>

    <intervention_name>DHCA+RCP</intervention_name>
    <description>During deep hypothermic circulatory arrest and retrograde cerebral perfusion (DHCA+RCP) the participant is placed on cardiopulmonary bypass (heart-lung machine) and their body temperature is lowered to a range of 14-18 °C. Once the goal temperature has been achieved, the circulation is stopped and aortic arch replacement is performed in a bloodless surgical field. Blood will be pushed to the brain through arterial vessels, much like the natural blood flow pattern. Once the aortic arch repair is complete, cardiopulmonary bypass is reinstituted, the participant is rewarmed, and separated from cardiopulmonary bypass.</description>

    <description>During moderate hypothermic circulatory arrest and unilateral selective antegrade cerebral perfusion (MHCA + SACP) the participant is placed on cardiopulmonary bypass (heart-lung machine0 and the native blood flow to the brain is temporarily suspended. The body is cooled to temperatures of ≤28°C and blood is administered to the brain via an artery in the neck during the period of arch reconstruction. Once the aortic arch repair is complete, cardiopulmonary bypass is reinstituted, the participant is rewarmed, and separated from cardiopulmonary bypass.</description>
