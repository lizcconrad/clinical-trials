    <textblock>
      Long-term maintenance of physical activity behaviour change post-intervention remains
      challenging. This study is investigating the feasibility of a behaviour change intervention
      based on Self-Determination Theory in people recovering from colorectal cancer and its
      effects on behaviour change 6 months post-intervention.

      This study was a randomized controlled feasibility trial consisting of a 3-months active
      lifestyle intervention and a 3-months follow-up period. Participants were allocated to an
      active lifestyle programme (ALP) or the standard (SC) care group. ALP was offered 12
      supervised exercise sessions over 3 months and six supportive behaviour change workshops. SC
      was encouraged to continue with their usual lifestyle. The intervention was informed by
      Self-Determination Theory.

      The supervised exercise sessions took place in small groups of maximum 7 participants and
      lasted approximately 1 hour. Exercise included aerobic and resistance exercises. The
      behaviour change workshops were delivered in a motivational interviewing style, also in small
      groups of maximum 7 participants.

      Participants were followed-up at 6 months. There was no contact with participants during the
      post-intervention and follow-up period.

    <description>Supervised exercises for 3 months and motivational interviewing to facilitate physical activity behaviour change. Supervised exercise sessions took place twice per week for the first four weeks. This was tapered off to once per week for the second four weeks. During the last month of the intervention participants continued with the exercise at home and were encouraged to achieve 150min of moderate to vigorous PA per week.</description>
