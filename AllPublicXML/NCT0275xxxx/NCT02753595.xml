      The primary objective for the study is as follows:

      For the Phase 1b - to determine safety tolerability and recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) of
      eribulin mesylate in combination with PEGylated recombinant human hyaluronidase (PEGPH20) in
      participants with Human Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (HER2)-negative metastatic breast
      cancer (MBC) previously treated with up to two lines of systemic anticancer therapy in the
      metastatic setting.

      For the Phase 2 - to evaluate objective response rate (ORR) of eribulin mesylate in
      combination with PEGPH20 in participants with HER2-negative, High-Hyaluronan (HA)-high, MBC
      previously treated with up to 2 lines of systemic anticancer therapy in the metastatic
      setting.

      Phase 1b will occur in two parts:

      Part 1: Run-in safety cohort(s) (dose levels 1, 0, and -1, as necessary) of 6 participants
      each will be conducted until the RP2D is determined. The purpose of the run-in safety
      cohort(s) is to study the safety of the 2-drug combination and determine a RP2D. Dose
      limiting toxicity (DLT) will be assessed in the first cycle to determine the RP2D of eribulin
      mesylate in combination with PEGPH20.

      Part 2 (Phase 1b &quot;Expansion Part&quot;): A total of 12 additional participants will be enrolled at
      the RP2D determined in Part 1 (using Phase 1b criteria, i.e., participants previously treated
      with up to 2 lines of systemic anticancer therapy) in order to assess the safety profile of
      the combination and identify any potential safety signals and the incidence of thromboembolic
      events in this population.

      In Phase 2, participants will be stratified by triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) status
      and randomized 1:1 to receive eribulin mesylate and PEGPH20 at the established RP2D level or
      eribulin mesylate alone at 1.4 milligrams per square meters (mg/m^2).

    <description>Recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) will be assessed in the below dose levels:
RP2D level 1: PEGPH20 (3.0 microgram per killogram (μg/kg)) plus eribulin mesylate (1.4 milligrams per square meter (mg/m2)) or
RP2D level 0: PEGPH20 (1.6 μg/kg) plus eribulin mesylate (1.4 mg/m2) or
RP2D level -1: PEGPH20 (1.6 μg/kg) plus eribulin mesylate (1.1 mg/m2)
Dose level 1 can be selected as the RP2D if no more than 1 out of 6 participants has a DLT; otherwise, Dose level 0 will be assessed in a second cohort of 6 subjects and will be selected as the RP2D if no more than 1 subject has a DLT. Otherwise, Dose level - 1 will be assessed in a third cohort of 6 subjects. If no more than 1 of 6 subjects in this third cohort has a DLT, the Phase 2 part will proceed with dose level -1 as the RP2D. Otherwise, alternative doses will be explored prior to the start of Phase 2.</description>
