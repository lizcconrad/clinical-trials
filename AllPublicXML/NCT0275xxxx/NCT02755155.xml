      Primary purpose : mortality at Day 28

      Secondary purposes :

        -  Daily SOFA (Sequential Organ Failure Assessment) score lessening within Intensive Care
           Unit (ICU)

        -  Duration of increasing doses of norepinephrine infusion to maintain target mean arterial
           pressure

        -  Number of care-related infections within ICU

      According to currently available literature on therapeutic albumin infusion in critically ill
      patients, there is room for new approaches to delineate an optimal use of this expansive
      treatment. Indeed, many authors suggest that the present clinical use of albumin is
      questionable in critically ill patients as far as changes in morbidity or mortality are
      concerned and with regards to cost-effectiveness.

      It has been reported that protein misfolding and aggregation are a hallmark of several
      inflammatory diseases. In vitro studies show that very small amounts of albumin are able to
      restore the physiologic activities of endogenous circulating proteins that had been
      aggregated in multimeric form during oxidative stress. Recently, the investigators have
      reported that in vitro albumin restores antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory effects of some
      chromogranin A-derived peptides. The investigators therefore search to test in vivo, in
      critically ill patients with severe systemic inflammation requiring norepinephrine infusion,
      whether therapeutic albumin infused at a low and continuous dosage may modify mortality
      (primary purpose) and morbidity (secondary purposes) in comparison with intermittent high
      dosage albumin infusion.
