  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Though the pathogenesis of prostate cancer (PCa) is still obscure, it has been reported, by
      investigators previous studies and some other researches, that PCa is often combined with
      tissue inflammation which is closely related to prostate specific antigen (PSA) level.
      Inflammation could play an important role in the process of occurrence and development of
      PCa, however the mechanism is unknown. Inflammatory cytokines could not only mediate
      inflammatory reactions, but also participate in the growth, proliferation, invasion and
      progression of tumor cells. It has been found that non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs
      (NSAIDs), such as aspirin, can effectively prevent several inflammation related tumor, and
      coincidentally, PCa is also closely associated with inflammation. Moreover, latest researches
      demonstrated that hormone therapy could induce tissue inflammation in PCa, in which a large
      quantity of immune B cells were attracted into the focal and then a lot of cytokines, such as
      IKK-β, NF-κB, were released. These cytokines could inhibit apoptosis and promote the growth
      of tumor cells, which might be a possible mechanism for long-term inflammatory infiltration
      inducing the occurrence of PCa and the transformation to castration-resistant prostate cancer
      (CRPC). Based on these proofs, investigators presume it could be possibly an effective way to
      prevent the occurrence of PCa and the transformation from androgen-dependent prostate cancer
      to CRPC by means of long-term oral aspirin. In this study, investigators intend to explore
      the possible effect of anti-inflammatory therapy on the progress of transformations from
      inflammation to PCa and from androgen-dependent prostate cancer to CRPC. Investigators plan
      to conduct both clinical trials in four groups, including the control group, the NSAIDs
      group, the antibiotics group and the NSAIDs+antibiotics group, and a basic experiment in
      vitro to assess the effectiveness of anti-inflammatory drugs and elucidate the specific
      molecular mechanism.
