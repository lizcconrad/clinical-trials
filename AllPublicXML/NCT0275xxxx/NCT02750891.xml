          1. Patients meeting any of the conditions a) to c) below:

               1. Have a diagnosis of diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma on the basis of imaging
                  findings on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and clinical course

               2. Have histologically or cytologically confirmed glioblastoma

               3. Not meeting a) and b) above, but have histologically or cytologically confirmed
                  grade III or IV glioma

          2. Patients who will be able to be hospitalized from the initial dose of DSP-7888 until
             the end of the post-initial dose observation (In Phase 1 part only, patients may be
             permitted to have a temporary overnight leave during the hospitalization.)

          3. Patients aged &lt; 20 years at the time of informed consent

          4. Patients for whom either the legally acceptable representative or the patient (if aged

             after fully receiving and understanding the information about this study, including
             study objectives, contents, expected pharmacological actions and effects, and
             foreseeable risks

          5. Patients for whom standard therapy failed or no standard therapy is established

          6. Diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma patients must received radiotherapy-based treatment
             or chemotherapy (if radiotherapy is not indicated) at least one cycle and subsequently
             had tumor enlargement accompanied by tumor-related symptomatic worsening (except for
             worsening due to dose reduction of steroid therapy for brain edema)

          7. Glioblastoma patients and grade III or IV glioma patients must had radiologically
             evident tumor re-enlargement or recurrence

          8. Patients with an ECOG PS score of 0 to 2 at enrollment. Patients with a PS score of 3
             or 4 due to neurological symptoms associated with the primary disease may be eligible
             if appropriate in the opinion of the investigator or subinvestigator.

          9. Patients with a life expectancy of 2 months (60 days)

         10. Patients with a HLA type of HLA-A*24:02 or A*02:01/06

             basis of laboratory data within 28 days before enrollment:

             Neutrophil count: 1000/μL Platelet count: 5.0 ×104/μL Hemoglobin: 9.0 g/dL Serum
             creatinine: 2-fold the upper limit of the normal range of the study site (ULN) Total
             bilirubin: 2-fold the ULN AST, ALT: 3-fold the ULN

             weeks (28 days) before enrollment

         13. Female patients of childbearing potential and male patients with female partners of
             childbearing potential must agree to use appropriate contraception from the time of
             consent until 180 days after the last dose of the study drug to avoid pregnancy

          6. Patients with uncontrollable complications

          7. Patients who underwent allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant

          8. Patients who received any of the following treatments within the specified period

               -  Surgery, blood transfusion, erythropoiesis-stimulating drugs, endocrine therapy,
                  immunotherapy (including biological response modifier [BRM] therapy): &lt;14 days

             (prednisolone-equivalent dose of 30 mg/m2) and steroid replacement therapy at a
             physiologic dose will be acceptable.
