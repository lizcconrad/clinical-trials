  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The proposed study is a multicenter, open-label phase I trial, conducted in locally advanced
      or metastatic breast cancer HER2 negative patients and divided into 2 parts:

        -  STEP 1: a dose escalation part (n= up to 30) to evaluate the safety profile and
           pharmacokinetics and to define the MTD and RP2D to recommend in a phase II.

        -  STEP 2: an expansion cohort part to confirm the safety and tolerability of ribociclib
           and capecitabine association on a longer follow-up, and to obtain preliminary evidence
           of anti-tumor activity on two expanded cohorts of HR positive and HR negative patients.
           Up to 14 patients in each cohort, taking into account patients already included in step
           one at this DL, may be enrolled, for a total of 28 at the RP2D.
