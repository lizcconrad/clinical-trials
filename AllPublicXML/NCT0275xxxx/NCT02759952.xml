    <textblock>
      Mutations in the PDE6A gene - encoding the -subunit of the rod cGMP-phosphodiesterase -
      account for 1% of autosomal recessive retinitis pigmentosa (arRP) through impaired regulation
      of cGMP levels in the rod outer segment. This study aims for a detailed clinical
      characterization of patients with PDE6A mutations in preparation of a clinical gene
      replacement study (phase I/II safety trial).

      Retinitis pigmentosa (RP) is a clinically and genetically heterogenous group of hereditary
      retinal disorders, being one of the most common types of retinal degenerations with a
      prevalence of 1:4000. More than 45 genes have been associated with RP so far, whose defects
      cause a progressive loss of rod photoreceptor function, followed by cone photoreceptor
      dysfunction often leading to complete blindness. Mutations in the PDE6A gene - encoding the
      -subunit of the rod cGMP-phosphodiesterase - account for 1% of autosomal recessive retinitis
      pigmentosa (arRP) through impaired regulation of cGMP levels in the rod outer segment.

      With the help of improved genetic and functional diagnostic tools an early recognition and
      differentiation has become possible. Still, up to date no established therapy is available,
      therefore, social and professional consequences are essential tasks to deal with. The modern
      ophthalmological functional diagnostic tools enable a precise characterisation and early
      recognition of such retinal diseases. The detailed results and information can help to extend
      the understanding of the pathological mechanisms involved in these diseases.

      In this study the investigators intend to investigate patients with a genetically confirmed
      diagnosis of Retinitis pigmentosa due to PDE6A mutations hereby assessing the function and
      structure of the retina with an extensive battery of tests.
