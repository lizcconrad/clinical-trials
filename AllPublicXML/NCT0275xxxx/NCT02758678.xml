      Purpose:

      Selectins are vascular cell adhesion molecules involved in adhesive interactions of
      leukocytes and platelets and endothelium within the blood circulation.

      Plasma soluble P selectin (sP-selectin), is a one of member of selectin family, an adhesion
      molecule and component of the membrane of the platelet alpha granulate has been proposed as a
      one marker of platelet activation. In this study we evaluate of expression of P selectin on
      platelets of blood between serum samples from lung cancer and healthy individuals.

      Material and Methods:

      The investigators enrolled patients with lung cancer which divided on 3 group: 1- 23 patients
      with operating tumor; 2-ten patients with advanced and metastatic disease who received
      palliative RT (RT - radiotherapy); 3-five patients with advanced inoperable disease, who
      received radical RT or RT + CT (CT- chemotherapy).

      In 1 group the specimens of blood we collected before surgery and 1-2 month after. In 2 group
      - before palliative treatment and in group 3 before radical treatment and one month after
      completion treatment. To compare to serum specimens from patients with lung cancer was
      obtained plasma from healthy volunteers.

      Serum separation and Raman spectroscopy analysis:

      A single 2 ml heparinised peripheral blood sample was centrifuges to get serum specimens. The
      Raman spectra (RS) of the solid residues from serum samples were measurement by placing 10µl
      of serum from the aliquots onto an aluminium substrate and allowed to dry for at least 30
      min. The Raman system (Renishaw inVia Microscope integrated with Leica microscope) was
      calibrated with a silicon standard using the Raman peak at 520 cm-1. Multiple scans were
      conducted on the solid residue by moving the substrate on an X - Y stage. The wavelength of
      excitation was 785 nm and the laser beam was focused on the surface of the sample with a 50x
      objective. The radius on the beam was 3.0 µm and the laser power irradiation over the sample
      was 5mW. Each spectrum was taken with an exposure of 30s, 10 accumulation and collected in
      the region from 400 to 1540 cm-1.

    <description>1- 23 patients with operating tumor; In 1 group the specimens of blood will be collected day before surgery and 1-2 month after surgery. Will be collected: histopathology outcomes - type carcinoma, tumore volume and before surgery: morphology and coagulation system.

Will be compared concentration of P-selectin in 3 groups of patients.
