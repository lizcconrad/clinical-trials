  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study was designed to investigate efficacy of suction drains in arthroscopic knee
      surgery, rather than anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction. two groups were
      randomised, and suction drain was applied to one group, and the other group as the control
      group without a suction drain.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The groups were compared in terms of patellar shock, knee effusion, knee scoring systems,
      range of motion, loss of labour, hospitalization time. Also different arthroscopic procedures
      such as meniscectomy, meniscus repair, synovectomy and microfracture were evaluated in terms
      of need for a suction drain. The controls was at 1st and 15th day, 6th week and 3rd month.
