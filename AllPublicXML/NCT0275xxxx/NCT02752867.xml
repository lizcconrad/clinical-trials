      The purpose of this study is to explore the pathogenesis of cognitive impairment after acute
      cerebral infarction by applying the multimodal function MRI to dynamically observe the
      changes of the value of NAA,Cho,Cr,FA in a certain region in the brain and the function of
      the brain ,and to provide a visual instrument for evaluating the therapeutical effects of
      Chinese medicine through the application of multimodal function MRI to observe the changes of
      the neurotransmitter in certain area in the brain before and after the treatment.

      The present study is designed to assess the efficacy and safety of Jianpi Yishen Huatan
      granules with cognitive impairment after Acute Cerebral Infarction by fMRI and
      neuropsychology scales,as well as observe the symptoms,syndrome characteristics and
      neuropsychological changes of patients with cognitive dysfunction after acute cerebral
      infarction.And explore the pathogenesis of cognitive impairment after acute cerebral
      infarction by applying the multimodal function MRI to dynamically observe the changes of the
      value of NAA,Cho,Cr,FA in a certain region in the brain and the function of the brain ,and to
      provide a visual instrument for evaluating the therapeutical effects of Chinese medicine
      through the application of multimodal function MRI to observe the changes of the
      neurotransmitter in certain area in the brain before and after the treatment.

      The sample size is 40 of which 20 are from the intervention group and 20 are from the control
      group.
