  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Speech intelligibility in quiet. Discrimination [%]</measure>
    <time_frame>One week.</time_frame>
    <description>The data, serving as primary outcome, are collected in a series of lab appointments. The speech intelligibility in quiet will be assessed with the aid of the German rhyme test &quot;Einsilber-Reimtest nach von Wallenberg und Kollmeier&quot; (WaKo). The result is the speech intelligibility in percent. Descriptive statistics will be executed in the form of determining the median and quartiles. Interference statistics will be executed by applying the appropriate parametric or non-parametric test, depending on the data's distribution. A significance level of 5% is pursued.</description>

    <measure>Speech intelligibility in noise. Speech Reception Threshold [dB SNR]</measure>
    <time_frame>One week.</time_frame>
    <description>The data, serving as primary outcome, are collected in a series of lab appointments. The speech intelligibility in noise will be assessed with the aid of the German Oldenburger sentence test. The result is the Speech Reception Threshold [dB SNR]. Descriptive statistics will be executed in the form of determining the median and quartiles. Interference statistics will be executed by applying the appropriate parametric or non-parametric test, depending on the data's distribution. A significance level of 5% is pursued.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Phoneme Perception Test, test no. 1.</measure>
    <time_frame>Four weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Free field audiometry using narrow band high frequency signals to measure detection thresholds [dB]. Descriptive statistics will be executed in the form of determining the median and quartiles. Interference statistics will be executed by applying the appropriate parametric or non-parametric test, depending on the data's distribution. A significance level of 5% is pursued.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Phoneme Perception Test, test no. 2.</measure>
    <time_frame>Four weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Free field audiometry using high frequency phonemes to capture their recognition thresholds [dB]. Descriptive statistics will be executed in the form of determining the median and quartiles. Interference statistics will be executed by applying the appropriate parametric or non-parametric test, depending on the data's distribution. A significance level of 5% is pursued.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Phoneme Perception Test, test no. 3.</measure>
    <time_frame>Four weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Free field audiometry using high frequency phonemes to capture the subjects' distinction capabilities [confusion matrix]. Descriptive statistics will be executed in the form of determining the median and quartiles. Interference statistics will be executed by applying the appropriate parametric or non-parametric test, depending on the data's distribution. A significance level of 5% is pursued.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Diary to describe hearing impressions in everyday life</measure>
    <time_frame>Six weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Subjects are asked to describe their subjective experiences in different listening situations, in daily life, with the aid of quantitative questionnaires. the results are &quot;Yes/No&quot; replies and open-ended.</description>
