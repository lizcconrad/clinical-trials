      Background:

      Cellular senescence is the aging of cells. It is a complex process that may be connected with
      aging and age-related diseases. It is unknown if these cells appear around wound sites in
      humans a few days after skin injury and if there are differences in young and old
      individuals. This study is being done to look at how cells in your body respond to small skin
      wounds. This information may help treat age-related diseases.

      Objective:

      To study how cells in the body respond to small skin wounds.

      Eligibility:

      Healthy adults ages 20-39 or 70+

      Design:

      Participants will be screened with medical history, physical exam, and blood sample. They
      will fast before the screening visit. Women will have a urine pregnancy test.

      Participants will have 3 study visits over about 3 weeks.

      Visits 1 and 2: Participants will fast before and have blood taken. Women will have a urine
      test. All participants will have 2 skin biopsies. A spot on the upper arm will be numbed. Two
      small pieces of skin will be removed. They will keep the area covered until the next visit.

      Visit 3: Participants will have their vital signs taken. Their biopsy wounds will be measured
      and photographed.

      This pilot protocol is designed as a proof-of-concept study to examine whether senescent
      cells can be induced in response to a cutaneous wound in humans and whether there are
      differences in the emergence of skin senescent cells between young and old individuals and
      between different ethnicities. The development of this technique and its standardization is
      important so that the technique can be used to assess future interventions that may affect
      cellular senescence, and may be an invaluable method for assessing novel treatments of type 2
      diabetes involving senescent cells.
