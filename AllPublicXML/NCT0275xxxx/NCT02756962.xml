  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators will prospectively determine whether the relapse-free and overall survival
      in patients who have cleared their leukemia-associated mutations treated with standard
      consolidation chemotherapy is superior to what is expected based on historical controls. The
      investigators will also prospectively determine the relapse-free and overall survival of
      patients who have not cleared their mutations. Because the relapse rate of patients with
      persistent mutations is expected to be high, treatment with either standard of care
      consolidation therapy alone or alloSCT will be permitted, at the discretion of the treating
      physician.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Age 18-60 years.

          -  Considered to be suitable intensive (cytotoxic) induction candidates.

          -  Has previously untreated, de novo, non-M3 AML with intermediate-risk disease
             (Intermediate-I or Intermediate-II) as defined by ELN criteria OR normal cytogenetics
             (after analysis of 20 or more metaphases) with mutated NPM1 without FLT3-ITD.
             Monoallelic CEBPA mutations are not considered favorable risk and are therefore
             eligible.

          -  Has undergone cytotoxic induction therapy

          -  In a morphologic complete remission with incomplete blood count recovery, or
             morphologic complete remission post-induction after no more than 2 induction cycles as
             defined by revised IWG criteria

          -  Women of childbearing potential and men must agree to use adequate contraception
             (hormonal or barrier method of birth control, abstinence) prior to study entry and for
             the duration of study participation. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is
             pregnant while participating in this study, she must inform her treating physician
             immediately.

          -  Able to understand and willing to sign an IRB approved written informed consent
             document.

          -  Willing to comply with the treatment assignment:

               -  Intent to proceed with HiDAC consolidation for LAM VAF &lt;2.5%

               -  Intent to proceed with either HiDAC consolidation or allogeneic stem cell
                  transplantation, at the discretion of the treating physician, for LAM ≥2.5%

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Diagnosis acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) with t(15;17)(q22;q12); PML-RARA.

          -  Therapy-related AML (defined as occurrence of AML due to prior exposure to
             chemotherapy or radiation for malignancy).

          -  Secondary AML (defined as development of AML in patients with an antecedent
             hematological malignancy).

          -  Has a medical or psychosocial conditions that would prevent study compliance.

          -  Known seropositivity for or active viral infection with human immunodeficiency virus
             (HIV), hepatitis B virus (HBV), or hepatitis C virus (HCV). Patients who are
             seropositive because of hepatitis B vaccine are eligible.

          -  History of allergic reaction to compounds of similar chemical or biologic composition
             to cytarabine.

          -  Pregnant and/or breastfeeding. Women of childbearing potential must have a negative
             pregnancy test within 3 days of signing consent.
