  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will investigate the longitudinal efficacy of two experimental oral rinses, one
      containing 1.5% weight/weight (w/w) dipotassium oxalate monohydride (KOX) /0 Parts per
      Million (ppm fluoride) and the other 2.0% w/w KOX /45ppm fluoride, for the relief of dentinal
      hypersensitivity (DH), compared to a placebo oral rinse, when used as an adjunct to twice
      daily brushing with a standard fluoride toothpaste.

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Schiff Sensitivity Score of Experimental Oral Rinses 1 and 2 Against a Placebo Oral Rinse at Week 8</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 8</time_frame>
    <description>The examiner assessed the participant's response to an evaporative air stimulus for each selected two teeth using the Schiff Sensitivity Scale scored as follows - 0: Participant does not respond to air stimulation; 1: responds to air stimulus but does not request discontinuation of stimulus; 2: Participant responds to air stimulus and requests discontinuation or moves from stimulus; 3: Participant responds to stimulus, considers stimulus to be painful, and requests discontinuation of the stimulus. A reduction in Schiff Sensitivity score indicate improvement in sensitivity.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Tactile Threshold (Gram [g]) of Two Experimental Oral Rinses 1, 2 and a Placebo Oral Rinse at Week 4</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 4</time_frame>
    <description>The examiner assessed the response to tactile sensitivity using a Yeaple probe which allowed application of a known force to the dentin surface, starting at 10g and rising in increments of 10g until the tactile threshold or maximum force has reached. The tactile threshold for each tooth was determined by asking the participant whether the sensation caused discomfort. The pressure setting at which the participant gave two consecutive 'yes' responses was recorded as the tactile threshold. The higher the tactile threshold, the less sensitive the tooth. At baseline, the maximum force used was 20g; at all subsequent visits, it was 80g. However, in situations where participants did not give a 'yes' response at force of 80g, the tactile threshold was recorded as &gt;80g. For analysis purposes values recorded as &gt;80g were treated as 90g values.</description>

    <description>Participants rated the intensity of their response to the evaporative (air) stimulus using a 10 point VRS. The Participants were asked to rate their pain on a scale of 1 (No Pain) to 10 (intense Pain). A reduction in the score is indicative of an improvement in sensitivity.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Tactile Threshold (Gram [g]) of Two Experimental Oral Rinses 1, 2 and a Placebo Oral Rinse at Week 4</title>
        <description>The examiner assessed the response to tactile sensitivity using a Yeaple probe which allowed application of a known force to the dentin surface, starting at 10g and rising in increments of 10g until the tactile threshold or maximum force has reached. The tactile threshold for each tooth was determined by asking the participant whether the sensation caused discomfort. The pressure setting at which the participant gave two consecutive 'yes' responses was recorded as the tactile threshold. The higher the tactile threshold, the less sensitive the tooth. At baseline, the maximum force used was 20g; at all subsequent visits, it was 80g. However, in situations where participants did not give a ‘yes’ response at force of 80g, the tactile threshold was recorded as &gt;80g. For analysis purposes values recorded as &gt;80g were treated as 90g values.</description>

        <population>ITT population included all participants who are randomized, received the study treatment at least once and provided at least one post-baseline assessment of efficacy.</population>
