      The purpose of this study is to assess the safety of RefortrixTM (Tdap) when administered
      during pregnancy in a maternal immunization program in Brazil.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In this retrospective cohort study the safety of RefortrixTM (Tdap) administered during
      pregnancy as part of the National immunization program in Brazil will be assessed by
      comparing the risk of pre-defined adverse events before and after introduction of the
      RefortrixTM (Tdap) maternal immunization program.
