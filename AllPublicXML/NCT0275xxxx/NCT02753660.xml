  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study was to compare the successful spinal puncture among patients with
      pendant position in comparison with those who used traditional sitting position for caesarean
      section.

      Approval from Ethical Committee of Faculty of Medicine University of Indonesia was acquired
      prior conducting the study. Subjects were given informed consent before enrolling the study.
      Subjects were divided into Group A for traditional sitting position (n=154) and Group B for
      pendant position (n=154). The outcome parameters recorded were the number of attempt for the
      successful spinal puncture, the number of spinal needle-bone contact and the duration to
      perform spinal puncture. Data were analyzed by using Statistical Package for Social Scientist
      (SPSS) version 21.0. Numerical data was served in median with minimal and maximal value.
      Numerical data was analyzed by using Mann-Whitney test. Categorical data was served by using
      relative risk (RR) with 95% confidence interval (95% CI) and was analyzed by using Chi-Square
      test.
