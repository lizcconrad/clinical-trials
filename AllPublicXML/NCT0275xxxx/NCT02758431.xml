    <textblock>
      This study plans to learn more about heart and vascular aging in men. In some men as they get
      older, testosterone levels fall below the normal range for young men. Also, as men get older
      cardiovascular health worsens. This can lead to high blood pressure and heart disease. In
      this study we want to find out what causes cardiovascular health to worsen in older men. Also
      we want to find out what happens when testosterone levels are lowered for a short time.
      Specifically, we want to see if the reduction in cardiovascular health in older men with low
      testosterone levels is because of damage to mitochondria. Mitochondria are the main power
      supply of the cells in our body. The results from this study will help to understand why
      cardiovascular health declines in older men with low testosterone levels compared to younger
      men and older men who have higher testosterone levels. Knowing this information will help to
      develop therapies to prevent heart disease in men.

    <textblock>
      Cardiovascular (CV) aging, featuring large artery stiffening, endothelial dysfunction, and
      impaired left ventricular (LV) diastolic function, is a major risk factor for the development
      of cardiovascular diseases (CVD). Male aging is associated with a gradual and variable
      decline in serum testosterone (T) and low T is associated with accelerated CV aging. The
      purpose of this research is to determine the key functional mechanisms underlying accelerated
      CV aging in older men with low T. The overall hypothesis is that mitochondrial dysfunction
      and oxidative stress are mechanisms underlying the apparent accelerated CV aging in older men
      with low T. To test this hypothesis Aim 1 will use cross-sectional comparisons of young and
      older men with normal T (≥400 ng/dl), and older men with chronically low T (&lt;300 ng/dl). To
      better isolate the effects of low T from factors that change with aging and chronic low T,
      Aim 2 will expand on the cross-sectional comparisons by assessing measures of CV function,
      oxidative stress burden and mitochondrial function in older men with normal T before and
      after randomization to short-term (28 d) gonadal suppression (gonadotropin releasing hormone
      antagonist, GnRHant) + placebo (PL), GnRHant+T alone, or GnRHant+T+aromatase inhibitor (AI).
      AI will control for the effects of aromatization of T to estradiol (E2), and thereby isolate
      T effects while suppressing E2, a potent modulator of CV function. The results from this
      research should provide new mechanistic insight into the processes that mediate the
      impairment in CV function at the cellular and systemic level in older men with low T. These
      studies will lead to a better understanding of the independent role of T in age-related
      changes in CV function and the mechanisms of action, which will help guide future
      sex-specific therapies for the prevention of CVD.

    <description>Subcutaneous adipose biopsy samples will be obtained under local anesthesia. Arterioles will be dissected free from the surrounding fat and will be pre-contracted with 3 μm phenylephrine and exposed to increasing doses of acetylcholine (Ach) alone and co-incubation with the nitric oxide synthase inhibitor L-NG-Nitroarginine methyl ester (L-NAME). To assess whether endothelial dysfunction is related to mitochondrial oxidative stress, arterioles will be exposed to both Mito-TEMPOL (1 mmol/L), and MitoQ for 30 minutes (with adequate wash-out between measures) and Ach-induced vasodilation will be reassessed.</description>

    <measure>Dietary Analysis and Estimation of Physical Activity Levels</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Because marked changes in diet over the intervention/control period could influence outcomes, dietary composition and caloric intake will be determined from 3-day food intake records. This information will be used to construct dietary meals for the subjects to consume for two days prior to the main experiments at baseline and at follow-up. To document the habitual physical activity status of our subjects at baseline and the last week of respective interventions, daily energy expenditure will be estimated using ActivPal monitors.</description>
