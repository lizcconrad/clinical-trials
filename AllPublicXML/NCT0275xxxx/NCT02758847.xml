  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The use of drug coated balloon (DCB) in patients with critical limb ischemia (CLI) and tissue
      loss has recently raised some concerns after the IN.PACT deep trial using paclitaxel coated
      balloon angioplasty in the tibial arteries was terminated. The investigators objective is to
      establish the safety and efficacy of drug coated balloon (DCB) for femoropopliteal occlusive
      disease in patients with critical limb ischemia (CLI) and tissue loss.

      The investigators objective is to establish the safety and efficacy of drug coated balloon
      (DCB) for femoropopliteal occlusive disease in patients with critical limb ischemia (CLI) and
      tissue loss.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Although the association between the drug coated balloon (DCB) therapy and limb outcomes
      could not be clearly linked to the use of antiproliferative agents, the findings of
      paclitaxel crystals downstream of the treated lesions, although in small amounts, has raised
      concerns about the safety of such therapy in patients with critical limb ischemia (CLI) and
      tissue loss.

      These concerns, however, may not translate to patients with femoropopliteal occlusive disease
      as the amount of paclitaxel reaching the foot may be even smaller after being filtered by the
      calf musculature.

      Since the use of DCB angioplasty in the Superficial Femoral Artery (SFA) and popliteal has
      been shown to deliver significantly more durable outcomes compared to standard angioplasty
      alone, with reported primary patency rates of almost 90% at one year, this therapy may even
      be more needed in patients with tissue loss where prolonged patency is essential for wound
      healing.
