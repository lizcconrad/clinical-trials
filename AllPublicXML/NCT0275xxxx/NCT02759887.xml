  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In order to treat individuals with Down syndrome (DS) better and more efficiently and to gain
      more insights on its relation to Alzheimer's disease (AD), a comprehensive understanding is
      needed for its progression in the early or preclinical phase using various biomarkers. DS is
      a significant risk factor for the early development of AD, with plaques and tangles typically
      developing by age 35. A better understanding is needed of early markers of the disease in DS
      patients. Additionally the DS population represents a unique group - due to this elevated
      risk for AD - to examine biomarkers that may translate in general outside of the DS
      population to individuals at risk for developing late onset AD. In this proposal, the
      researchers will assess the longitudinal changes of various biomarkers in a cohort of
      individuals similar in design to the cross-sectional sectional study in the preliminary data.

      This study will recruit from three experimental groups: (1)The DS (adult) group will consist
      of 15 DS subjects aged 21 and older who do not qualify for the diagnosis of dementia at the
      beginning of the study. (2)The DS/AD group will consist of 15 DS subjects aged 40 and older
      who do qualify for the diagnosis of dementia by Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental
      Disorders, Fourth Edition (DSM-IV) criteria. Diagnoses will be by standard consensus review
      of all cases. (3)Normal control (NC) adult will consist of 10 cognitively normal, non-DS
      individuals, age-matched to the DS group. Blood will be collected to assess apolipoprotein E
      (ApoE) genotype. Participation in the dried blood spot collection (DBSC) will be an optional
      sub-study. Only participants and/or their caregivers/legally authorized representatives
      indicating they wish to have DBSC performed on the consent will provide specimens.

    <measure>Florbetapir PET - change between timeframes</measure>
    <time_frame>Year 1, Year 2-3</time_frame>
    <description>The researchers will use multi-modal partial least squares (MMPLS) to integrate the volumetric MRI, tau PET, FDG PET and florbetapir PET data and investigate the potential for increased sensitivity to examine the longitudinal changes related to both brain structure and fibrillar amyloid depositions. The MMPLS based subject scores, which is free from multiple comparisons, will be the primary measure integrating information from imaging modalities. The combined primary measures will be used each to compute the number of DS or DS/AD patients in the treatment and in the placebo arms needed for a 60 month clinical trial with 80% power, two-tailed p=0.05 and assumed treatment effects of 25%. These estimated samples are indicative of each biomarker for their sensitivity.</description>

        Exclusion Criteria: (for all groups)

          -  Previous or current diagnosis of a neurodegenerative disorders other than AD or DS,
             including, but not limited to Parkinson's disease, Pick's disease, fronto-temporal

             experiencing behavioral disturbances that may require treatment with psychotropic
             medications may be entered only after discussion and with the approval of the

             lactating at screening. Women must avoid becoming pregnant, and must agree to refrain
             from sexual activity or to use reliable contraceptive methods for 30 days prior to and

             form of contraception (oral contraceptives for at least three months or an IUD
             (intrauterine device) for at least two months prior to the start of the screening

             therapy (e.g., immunotherapy, secretase inhibitor) may not be enrolled unless it can
             be demonstrated that the subject received only placebo in the course of the trial.

          -  Current clinically significant medical comorbidities, as indicated by history,
             physical exam, or laboratory evaluations, that might pose a potential safety risk,
             interfere with the absorption or metabolism of the study medication, or limit
             interpretation of the trial results. These include but are not limited to clinically
             significant hepatic, renal, pulmonary, metabolic or endocrine disease, and cancer.

          -  Subjects who have received a radiopharmaceutical for imaging or therapy within the
