    <description>Treatment patterns will be collected during the follow-up period. Data will be directly extracted from medical charts of the arrhythmia unit.
Anticoagulation use will be reported as drug class: Vitamin K antagonist, antiplatelet, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. The following data on anticoagulation use will be collected:
Type of treatment, start &amp; stop dates, dosage, administration schedule, method of administration, reason for discontinuation if applicable
Type of therapy utilized (monotherapy/combination therapy)
Total number of therapy changes or switches through the course of treatment
Monitoring visit (visits per month) for International normalized ratio (INR) control by Time in Therapeutic Range(cTTR)
Routine care (visits per month) by anticoagulation regimen</description>
