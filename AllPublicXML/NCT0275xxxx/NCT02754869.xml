  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This project involves the development, validation and application of a novel test using MRI
      to assess gastrointestinal motility a vital process that mixes the contents of our digestive
      tract. This process frequently becomes deranged in conditions like chronic constipation,
      Parkinson's and Crohn's disease.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Gastrointestinal motility refers to the contractile actions in the gut that serve to mix our
      food and propel it through out digestive tract. Although known to be involved in a range of
      conditions like chronic constipation, Parkinson's and Crohn's disease, investigator have
      never had effective tests with which to study the process. Advances in medical imaging
      technologies now make it possible to both see and quantify this process non-invasively using
      MRI. In this study the investigator first of all validate that our MRI based analysis is
      robust and valid, producing predictable results against range of known stimuli. The
      investigator then apply the technique to a cohort of participants with Chronic Intestinal
      Pseudo-Obstruction. These participants are known to have hypo-motile small bowels and
      demonstration with our MRI technique would serve as further validation. The investigator also
      investigate two cohorts of people with and without gastrointestinal diseases to better
      understand how the technique may work in the clinical setting.

      By the end of this project The investigator will have generated robust initial evidence to
      validate our MRI technique and clinical data to inform use further research.

    <description>The first part of this investigation is an interventional blinded cross over study with two dosing dates spread at least one week apart. Each volunteer will receive baseline scans before drug/placebo which will be used to assess intra--‐patient variation over the two study dates after which the drug or saline placebo will be administered with each volunteer acting as their own control to assess software ability to quantify changes in bowel motility.</description>

    <description>The second component of this study will be exactly the same for the participants with dysmotility except the time to repeat scan will be reduced with a follow up time aimed at around 1--‐3 days reducing patient time off medication</description>

    <description>The third component of this study will assess basal small bowel motility in larger numbers of healthy controls, dysmotility subjects and irritable bowel syndrome to establish reference ranges to inform future clinical investigations and guide clinical decision making using global motility scoring. Each scan will last around 20 minutes and will not involve follow up or use of pharmaceutical agents.</description>
