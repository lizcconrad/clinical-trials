  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Emergence agitation (EA) is common phenomenon in pediatric patients undergoing general
      anesthesia by inhalation agents. The incidence of EA was reported to range from 18% to 80%.
      Sevoflurane now is the inhalational anesthetic agent of choice for pediatrics, Different
      strategies have been suggested to decrease the incidence and severity of EA. No gold standard
      technique for treating EA after sevoflurane anesthesia is currently available. The main
      question is can caudal dexmedetomidine be used for this purpose?

      The purpose of this prospective comparative randomized clinical study will be to compare the
      effects of caudal dexmedetomidine on EA in children undergoing lower abdominal operations
      under general sevoflurane anesthesia. In addition, characteristics of anesthesia recovery and
      incidence of adverse effects will be compare. A total of (48) children aged 1-5 years old,
      The American society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) physical status classification system between
      I-II of both sex who will be enrolled from April 2016 to April 2017 undergoing for lower
      abdominal surgeries will be included in the study. Patients will be randomized by
      computer-generated random numbers in a double blinded fashion to get enrolled into 2 equal
      groups: Group BD patients (n = 24) will be received single dose caudal epidural analgesia
      using dexmedetomidine with bupivacaine, whereas Group B patients (n = 24) will be received
      single dose caudal epidural analgesia with bupivacaine only. The dexmedetomidine used for
      this study will be prepared in a 1 ml syringe wrapped in aluminum foil by an investigator who
      will not be involved in the anesthesia process and another 1 ml syringe filled with saline
      will be prepared too.
