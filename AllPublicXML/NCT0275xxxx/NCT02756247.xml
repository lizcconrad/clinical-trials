  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to find out if the combination of buparlisib and ibrutinib will
      lead to better treatment results in patients with relapsed or refractory Follicular lymphoma,
      (FL) Mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) or Diffuse Large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). The investigators
      are using buparlisib and ibrutinib because both drugs seem to block different proteins that
      allow cancer cells to keep growing. Blocking these proteins may help by making the cancer
      cells undergo cell death, which will stop uncontrolled tumor growth.

    <description>In the Phase I part the standard 3+3 dose escalation scheme will be used and all disease subtypes will be combined. If none of the initial cohort of 3 has a DLT the dose level will be escalated. If one has a DLT that dose level will be expanded with 3 more patients. Dose escalation will stop if 2 or more DLTs are seen at a dose level. The MTD is defined as the highest dose level at which at most 1 of the 6 patients treated at that level has a DLT. Three dose levels plus a &quot;-1&quot; dose level are planned for this study.</description>

    <description>This is a two stage protocol comprised of a single institution phase Ib dose escalation trial. The first stage is a standard 3+3 phase I dose escalation trial to assess the safety of buparlisib and ibrutinib. The second stage is a single center expansion cohort in MCL, FL and DLBCL respectively evaluating the efficacy of buparlisib and ibrutinib combination.
Treatment will be with ibrutinib orally daily and buparlisib orally daily. A cycle is defined as 4 weeks of therapy. Therapy will continue until disease progression, intolerable toxicities or death with a maximum duration of treatment of 3 years on therapy.</description>
