  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Anxiety and depressive disorders are common in adolescents, however they are often
      unrecognized. Rational emotive behavioral therapy (REBT), a form of cognitive behavioral
      therapy (CBT) is efficient for children and adolescents. School settings are appropriate
      environments to deliver such interventions for vulnerable youths. Given youth's access and
      predilection to use technology, a video-based prevention program was developed. The present
      study aims to investigate the efficacy of a transdiagnostic REBT prevention program for
      internalizing symptoms in adolescents, implemented in a school setting.

      Classes from different Romanian public schools will be randomized in either intervention or
      wait list group.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The prevention program will be group-based, delivered in 6 sessions, over 3 weeks.

      Each of the six modules aimed a different component: Psychoeducation, Relaxation,
      Relationship between cognitive distortions/irrational beliefs and emotions, Cognitive
      restructuring, Exposure/ behavioral activation and problem solving, Maintenance of gainings.
      Despite specific activities, for each session a video cartoon on that subject will be viewed
      and discussed. Homework would be given at every session.

      REBT prevention programs delivered in school settings represent ecological modalities to
      target vulnerable groups. Technology components added to traditional programs may lead to
      greater motivation and satisfaction with treatment.

      Adolescents will complete assessments at four time-points: T1 (baseline), T2
      (post-intervention), T3 (3 months follow-up) and T4 (12 months follow-up).
