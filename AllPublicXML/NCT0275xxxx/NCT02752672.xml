  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Dithranol (known in the U.S.A. as anthralin and in Germany as cignolin) is one of the oldest
      and safest topical anti-psoriatic treatments. However, despite explorative investigations,
      the skin disease-clearing mechanisms of dithranol remain poorly understood (Painsi et al,
      JDDG 2015). The purpose of this study is to investigate the therapeutic mechanisms of
      dithranol in psoriasis.

      Skins biopsies from psoriatic skin and blood samples will be taken before (day 0) and at
      several time points after start (day 4, week 2-3, and week 6-7) of dithranol therapy to be
      subjected to an explorative analysis (see outcome measures). A total of maximal 15 psoriasis
      patients will be enrolled. Normal lesion-adjacent skin from 10 patients undergoing surgery
      for non-inflammatory conditions will serve as control.
