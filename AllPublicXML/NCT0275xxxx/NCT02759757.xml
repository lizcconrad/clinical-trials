  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Objectives: To test if the Kinesio Tex Gold ® is able to change the electromyographic signal
      of iliocostalis and longissimus muscles in patients with chronic nonspecific low back pain.

      Study design: Three-arm, randomized controlled trial with a blinded assessor.

      Location of study: Physical therapy Clinic of the Universidade Cidade de São Paulo (UNICID)

      Patients: Sixty-three patients with chronic nonspecific low back pain.

      Intervention: Patients allocated to the Kinesio Taping® group will receive the tape as
      described by the manufacturer's manual. The patients assigned to the placebo group will
      receive a Micropore tape and the control group will not receive any intervention. All groups
      will be assessed before and 30 minutes after intervention

      Measures: The following outcomes will be measured: 1) Muscle activity and 2) pain intensity.

      Limitations: Therapists will not be blinded.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients who are seeking care for low back pain at the physiotherapy clinic from Universidade
      São Paulo will be invited to participate in the study and informed about the objectives of
      the study and evaluation procedures.

      Patients who agree to participate will sign a consent form.

      Patients will be assessed at baseline and immediately after the interventions.

      Investigators will collect data with regards to personal and anthropometric data, as well as
      pain intensity (measured by a 0-10 numerical rating scale in all follow up points) and
      disability (measured by the 0-24 point Roland Morris Disability Questionnaire at baseline
      only).

      Finally, muscle activation will be evaluated by surface electromyography and the maximum
      voluntary contraction of the trunk at 30 degrees position for a lumbar dynamometer that will
      be adjusted to the anthropometric profile of patients. The average and maximum values of
      muscular strength will be obtained by maximum voluntary contraction. The electromyography
      will capture the muscle activity in an integrated manner to electrogoniometers and will
      transmit the data via Bluetooth to a desktop with a MWX8 software (Biometrics) that will
      analyze the data. Before instrumentation patients will be instructed to perform the trunk
      extension movement the therapist's commands to become familiar with the equipment. Soon after
      will be held instrumentation (placement of electromyography electrodes and electrogoniometers
      and lumbar dynamometer) maximal voluntary contraction will be collected in trunk extension
      without Kinesio taping

    <description>Patients from this group will receive the kinesio Taping® Tex Gold tape according to the manufacturer's instructions.
