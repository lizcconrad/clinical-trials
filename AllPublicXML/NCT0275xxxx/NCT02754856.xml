  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this clinical research study is to learn if tremelimumab in combination with
      MEDI4736 can help to control colorectal cancer that has spread to the liver. The safety of
      these drugs will also be studied.

      This is an investigational study. MEDI4736 and tremelimumab are not FDA approved or
      commercially available. They are currently being used for research purposes only.

      The study doctor can explain how the study drugs are designed to work.

      Up to 35 participants will take part in this study. All will be enrolled at MD Anderson.

      Study Drug Administration:

      If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, you will receive tremelimumab by
      vein over about 1 hour and MEDI4736 by vein over about 4 hours during Week 11. After Week 11,
      you will receive MEDI4736 alone by vein over about 1 hour during Weeks 21, 25, 29, and 33.

      Between Weeks 15 and 17, you will have your already scheduled liver surgery. This means you
      will receive tremelimumab before your surgery and MEDI4736 after your surgery.

      Study Visits:

      During Week 1:

        -  You will have a physical exam.

        -  Blood (about 6 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests and for testing related to
           your immune system.

        -  If you can become pregnant, part of the above routine blood sample will be used for a
           pregnancy test. Urine may also be collected for this test.

      During Week 4 :

        -  You will have a physical exam.

        -  Blood (about 6 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests and for testing related to
           your immune system.

        -  You will have a CT scan.

        -  If you can become pregnant, part of the above routine blood sample will be used for a
           pregnancy test. Urine may also be collected for this test.

      Between Weeks 4 and 8:

        -  You will have a physical exam.

        -  Blood (about 4 tablespoons) will be drawn for tests related to the immune system.

        -  You will have liver surgery as part of your standard care. You will sign a separate
           consent form for this procedure.

      After your liver surgery

      Between 0-2 weeks after your liver surgery:

        -  You will also have a physical exam.

        -  Blood (about 7 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests, to check the status of the
           disease, and for tests related to your immune system.

      During Week 1:

        -  You will have a physical exam.

        -  Blood (about 4 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests.

        -  If you can become pregnant, part of the above routine blood sample will be used for a
           pregnancy test. Urine may also be collected for this test.

      During Weeks 5 and 9:

        -  You will have a physical exam.

        -  Blood (about 4 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests.

      During Week 13 and every 14 weeks after that until 2 years:

        -  You will have a physical exam.

        -  Blood (about 8 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests and to check the status of the
           disease.

        -  You will have a CT scan or MRI.

      At Week 17, instead of coming into the clinic, the study staff may call you to ask how you
      are doing. If you are called, it should last about 5-10 minutes.

      Length of Study:

      You may receive tremelimumab and MEDI4736 for 1 week and MEDI4736 alone for up to an
      additional 4 weeks. You will no longer be able to take the study drugs if the disease gets
      worse, if intolerable side effects occur, or if you are unable to follow study directions.

      Your participation on this study will be over after follow-up.

      Follow-Up:

      If you stop treatment for any reason, you will be asked to come to the hospital so your study
      doctor may check your health and follow up any ongoing side effects or discomfort until they
      get better.

      If the disease has gotten better or remained the same, your doctor will continue to check on
      the status of the disease as part of your standard of care, which may include imaging scans
      and/or blood draws for routine tests.

      The study staff will call you 2 times every year starting about 2 years after surgery to ask
      you how you are doing. These calls should last about 5-10 minutes.

      Follow-up will continue for 5 years or until you withdraw from the study, whichever happens
      first.

          1. Patients must have histologically or cytologically confirmed colorectal cancer with
             liver metastases deemed resectable by a general or liver surgeon (resectability may
             involve the use of ablative techniques to some but not all liver metastases). Those
             patients with known disease outside of the liver are not eligible (except for patients
             with primary lesions in place that are planned for resection or nonspecific lung
             metastases &lt;1cm).

          2. Patients must have measurable disease, defined as at least one lesion that can be

             resections of metastatic disease will be included.

          4. Age =/&gt;18 years. Because no dosing or adverse event data are currently available on
             the use of tremelimumab in combination with durvalumab in patients &lt;18 years of age,
             children are excluded from this study.

          5. Life expectancy of greater than 6 months.

          6. ECOG performance status =/&lt;1 (Karnofsky =/&gt;70%).

          9. Evidence of post-menopausal status or negative urinary or serum pregnancy test for
             female pre-menopausal patients. Women will be considered post-menopausal if they have
             been amenorrheic for 12 months without an alternative medical cause. The following
             age-specific requirements apply: Women &lt;50 years of age would be considered
             post-menopausal if they have been amenorrheic for 12 months or more following
             cessation of exogenous hormonal treatments and if they have luteinizing hormone and
             follicle-stimulating hormone levels in the post-menopausal range for the institution
