    <textblock>
      This study is a proof of concept that will assess the Predictor's kit performances. The test
      will be performed by several technicians, in immunological laboratories of several sites in
      France.

      In this study, &quot;couples&quot; of donor / recipient in the frame of a graft of CSH will be
      included.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The Hematopoietic Stem Cell (HSC) graft is the only curative treatment for lots of
      hematologic diseases, malignant or not, particularly leukemias.

      The acute Graft versus Host (aGvH) reaction is the most frequent complication, and could
      concern until 50% of recipients. It is mainly linked to immune characteristics of the donor
      which will act versus the graft recipient.

      There is a huge need of a technology that could predict the risk of aGvH, especially in order
      to select a donor in case of several possibilities, in order to reduce morbidity and
      mortality of graft.

      The Predictor' kit allows to predict acute and severe forms of Graft versus Host disease
      before the graft of peripheral hematological stem cells, by the assesment of iNKT cells
      expansion.

    <description>The performance of the test will be assessed via the observation of the number of aGvH 6 months after the graft, reported to the the expansion of iNKT cells.

    <measure>Assessment of the reproductibility of the test</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The reproductibility of the test will be assessed by comparing the results obtained by 2 distinct operators : the immunology lab technician, and the referent operator at Imagine Institute research lab.
The 2 operators will perform the test in parallel on the blood of the same donor, in similar conditions, and both by using a Predictor's kit.</description>

    <description>Each couple will be treated the same way :
An additional blood sample of the donor will be taken prior GCSF mobilization. This blood sample will then be analyzed via Predictor's kit, by the immunology laboratory of the hospital where the graft will be done.
Whatever the result given by the Predictor' kit, the graft will be done for the recipient patient. No change will be done on the usual graft process.</description>
