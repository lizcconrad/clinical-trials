  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Protocol 0000498 is a multi center, open label study to evaluate the safety, tolerability and
      fat absorption of sustained Relizorb (immobilized lipase cartridge) use for patients with
      cystic fibrosis and exocrine pancreatic insufficiency who receive enteral tube feeding.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      At study entry (Day -14), blood and urine will be collected at screening to assess baseline
      plasma and erythrocyte membrane concentrations of docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and
      eicosapentaenoic (EPA), plasma concentrations of other long chain fatty acids, fat-soluble
      vitamins, serum protein and urinary leukotriene concentrations. Body weight and body mass
      index will be obtained. During an initial 7 day observation period (Day -14 to Day -8),
      subjects will follow their usual enteral nutrition regimen, including use of pancreatic
      enzyme replacement therapy (PERT). During the 7 day run in period (Day -7 to Day -1),
      subjects will use Peptamen 1.5 at their normal volume of administration from 500 mL to 1,000
      mL per feeding and follow their normal PERT regimen.

      On baseline Day 1, subjects will receive Impact Peptide up to a maximum volume of 1,000 mL
      per feeding for the 90 day treatment period with Relizorb. Blood and urine will be collected
      to repeat the screening concentration measurements. Standard use of PERT is allowed with
      daily meals but not permitted with use of Relizorb during enteral feedings. Safety and
      tolerability will be assessed using a gastrointestinal symptom diary, adverse events and
      unanticipated adverse device effects.
