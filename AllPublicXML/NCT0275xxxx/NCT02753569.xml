  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This feasibility study will aim to assess the potential for functional imaging biomarkers
      (18FDG PET-CT and DW-MRI) to differentiate immunotherapy induced inflammation, indicative of
      response from non-response in patients with stage IV non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      30 patients, recruited from within the PEAR Study (Phase 1 dose escalation of palliative
      radiotherapy with anti-PD1 antibody pembrolizumab in thoracic tumours) will be scanned both
      before and after receiving immunotherapy for NSCLC. Immunotherapy induced changes in tumour
      ADC on DW-MRI (a surrogate of apoptotic tumour cell death) will be compared with changes in
      near contemporaneous, anatomically co-registered 18FDG PET-CT SUV (a non-specific marker for
      GLUT expression and hence metabolic activity in both tumour and tumour infiltrating
      lymphocytes). For treatment response, an increase in ADC (reflecting apoptosis within the
      tumour) is expected, while 18FDG uptake is expected to decrease compared with baseline tumour
      uptake. In the presence of significant inflammatory cell recruitment, the investigators
      hypothesise a similar increase in ADC on DW-MRI but without associated reduction in 18FDG
      PET-CT SUV. Thus the relationship between the ADC change on DW-MRI and the 18FDG change
      should distinguish between response and non-response in the presence of inflammation.

    <measure>Assess for differences in tumour volume using DW-MRI</measure>
    <time_frame>Duration of Study - 2 year</time_frame>
    <description>Assess for differences in tumor volume evaluated using DW-MRI. This will be used as a comparison against other modalities for assessing differences in tumour volume e.g. 18FDG PET-CT. CT is the current standard for radiotherapy target volumes in the chest and with the greater soft tissue delineation facilitated by MRI, comparison of the modalities is warranted.</description>

    <time_frame>Duration of Study - 2 year</time_frame>
    <description>Assess the correlation between 18FDG PET Standardised Uptake Values and DW-MRI derived ADC values. Correlations between ADCmax and SUVmax; ADCmean and SUVmean; plus total lesion ADC and total lesion glycolysis will be explored. Recent reports of imaging biomarkers for defining radiotherapy 'dose painting' schedules have focussed on PET imaging and correlation of these parameters with DW-MRI is not yet established.</description>
