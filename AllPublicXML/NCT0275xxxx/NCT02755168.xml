  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Caesarean section is one the most common operations worldwide, its rates are globally
      increasing. A multitude of efforts had been done aiming at reduction of Caesarean section
      related maternal morbidities; most of them are related to technical modifications of how to
      open and how to close the abdominal and uterine incisions . The comparative studies of blunt
      versus sharp extension of the uterine incision showed a reduction of the incidence of
      unintended extension from 8.8% to 4.8% .

      The vulnerability of the lower uterine segment for tears are related to stage of labor. The
      frequency of unintended extension was reported to be 15.5%, and 35.0% in cases operated in
      first and second stages of labor respectively.

      The original techniques of fetal head extraction entail the introduction of the obstetricians
      hand or other instruments into the lower uterine segment . This puts the lower uterine
      segment at risk of damage and incision extensions with its consequences of increased blood
      loss, increased operative time, infection adhesions and blood transfusion. Adherence to the
      available the generated good quality evidence bases practice in Caesarean section is
      anticipated to decease such morbidities.

      The idea of the present technique was derived from the fact that during vaginal delivery the
      main task of obstetrician is to support the perineum while the fetal head extends to get out
      through birth canal.

    <description>During fetal head extraction, the obstetrician puts four fingers of his right hand on the lower segment at uterovesical pouch. The palmar aspect of the fingers will be resting on the uterovesical peritoneal reflection not on directly on the fetal head. While the palmar aspect of the fingers was facing the lower segment they were pushed deep below the fetal head.</description>
