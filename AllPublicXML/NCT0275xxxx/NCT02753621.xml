  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall objective of this study is to observe the effect of group Vocal performance
      training and performance experience on patients' reported symptoms and quality of life. The
      effectiveness of PD medications varies significantly in different patients depending on their
      symptoms. By using music-based interventions to improve symptoms that may be inadequately
      treated by medications, the investigators hope to improve quality of life in PD patients.
      &quot;Parkinsonics: A controlled study of group singing for quality of life and voice outcomes in
      Parkinson disease&quot; (PD) is a controlled crossover behavioral intervention study of once
      weekly choral classes for patients with idiopathic PD (progressing toward a group
      performance) and once weekly discussion/support group meetings.
