             consent

          2. Patients must be willing to comply with the specified follow-up evaluation schedule

          3. Patients who sign an informed consent (signed and dated) prior to any study-related
             evaluation or procedure.

          4. Patients who are willing to undergo a follow-up coronary angiogram and Endovascular
             Imaging via Optical Coherence Tomography

          5. Patients willing to be maintained on Aspirin and Clopidogrel bisulfate (Plavix) for
             ninety (90) days post procedure.

          6. Patients with a de novo coronary lesion causing angina and/or a positive function test

          7. Patients who are eligible for percutaneous coronary interventions

          8. Low risk NSTEMI defined as patients with ACS, unstable angina, positive cardiac
             biomarkers and hemodynamically stable as assessed by the Investigator.

          9. Patients with an acceptable risk for coronary bypass graft surgery (CABG)

        Intra-Procedure Angiographic Criteria:

          1. Single de novo target lesion &gt;50% diameter stenosis by angiography

          2. Single target vessel 2.75 to 3.25 mm diameter

          3. Lesion length of 14 to 20mm which is suitable for Palmaz Mach-5 Grooved Coronary Stent
             System or the Palmaz Bare Metal Coronary Stent System.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Known allergy or sensitivity to cobalt chromium (CoCr) alloy or its components.

          2. Known sensitivity or allergy to aspirin, radiographic contract agents (that cannot be
             pre-treated adequately).

          3. Patients unable to tolerate anticoagulant therapy or antiplatelet therapy.

          4. History of bleeding or known coagulopathy.

          5. Patients with thrombocytopenia and or neutropenia.

         14. Women who are currently pregnant. (A negative pregnancy test for female subjects of
             child bearing potential is required within 24 hours of procedure.)

         15. Known or suspected active systemic infection.

         16. Evidence of severe or uncontrolled systemic diseases, including chronic renal
             insufficiency, or any condition which in the Investigator's opinion makes it
             undesirable for the patient to participate in the trial or which would jeopardize
             compliance with the protocol.
