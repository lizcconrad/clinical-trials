      This study is a multicenter, prospective cohort study of patients diagnosed with cystic
      fibrosis, the clinical information of recruited patients, including clinical manifestations,
      lung function, chest imaging, quality of life and other indicators, will be followed for 10
      years.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      All new cases of cystic fibrosis which was confirmed or probably diagnosed at each center
      from the beginning of the study are made the investigation of the clinical manifestations,
      sweat test and CFTR mutations by the standard diagnostic process.Then all the patients'
      following clinical data will be followed for 10 years (once per six month): clinical
      manifestations, lung function, chest imaging (once per year), quality of life and other
      indicators.
