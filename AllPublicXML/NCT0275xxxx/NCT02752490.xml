  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to determine if a strategy of indicated compared to liberal
      oxygen administration in labor decreases the rate of cesarean delivery. The hypothesis is
      that women who undergo a strategy of indicated compared to liberal oxygen administration in
      labor will have lower rate of cesarean delivery and fetal acidemia at birth.

      This is a single-site before and after study comparing the strategy of liberal versus
      indicated use of maternal oxygen in the first and second stages of labor in the setting of a
      category 2 fetal heart rate tracing (FHR) tracing, as defined by American Congress of
      Obstetrics and Gynecology (ACOG) and National Institute of Child Health and Human Development
      (NICHD) guidelines. All patients who are at term and are undergoing labor at Memorial Hermann
      Hospital in Houston, Texas during the time frame of the study will be included in the study.
      The study will be conducted over 18 weeks. It will involve two 8 week time periods during
      which all patients will under either a strategy of liberal administration of oxygen use
      (current practice) in the &quot;before&quot; portion of the study and indicated administration of
      oxygen in the &quot;after&quot; portion of the study (new practice). There will be a transition period
      where training, education, and audit + feedback will be done to prepare for a strategy of
      indicated administration of oxygen.

    <description>The Apgar score is based on a total score of 1 to 10. The higher the score, the better the baby is doing after birth. A score of 7, 8, or 9 is normal and is a sign that the newborn is in good health. A score of 10 is very unusual, since almost all newborns lose 1 point for blue hands and feet, which is normal for after birth.</description>

          <description>Administration of maternal oxygen, 100% fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) at 10 liters/min via nonrebreather face mask only in the setting of a category 2 tracing with recurrent late fetal heart rate decelerations, prolonged fetal deceleration, fetal tachycardia, or minimal to absent fetal heart rate variability lasting 30 minutes or greater. Maternal oxygen is discontinued once these conditions have resolved and may be readministered if they recur.</description>
