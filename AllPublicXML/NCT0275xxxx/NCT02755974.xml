    <textblock>
      The London COPD exacerbation (EXCEL) cohort builds on an established cohort started in 1995
      and designed to study COPD exacerbations and their impact on health-status and disease
      progression.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Our intentions are to phenotype Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) patients on the
      basis of factors that a related to (a) exacerbation frequency which will include (b) lung
      function to assess disease severity, (c) baseline therapy, (d) airway and systemic
      inflammatory markers, (e) health status, (f) gene expression, (g) airway bacterial and viral
      load and (h) co-morbidity including cardiovascular disease, diabetes and psychological
      disease, (i) psychological factors,(j) mortality, (k) nasal susceptibility to rhinovirus
      infection, (l) heart rate variability (m) exhaled hydrogen sulphide.
