      endTB Clinical Trial a Phase III, randomized, controlled, open-label, non-inferiority,

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase III, randomized, controlled, open-label, non-inferiority, multi-country trial
      evaluating the efficacy and safety of new combination regimens for MDR-TB treatment.

      Regimens examined combine newly approved drugs bedaquiline and/or delamanid with existing
      drugs known to be active against Mycobacterium tuberculosis (linezolid, clofazimine,
      moxifloxacin or levofloxacin, and pyrazinamide). The study will enroll in parallel across 5
      experimental and 1 standard-of-care control arms. Randomization will be outcome adapted using
      Bayesian interim analysis of efficacy endpoints. Experimental regimens will contain
      bedaquiline and/or delamanid and up to 4 companion drugs. Control-arm treatment may contain
      one of the following (bedaquiline or delamanid) and companion drugs, constructed and
      delivered according to local standard of care and consistent with WHO guidelines. Trial
      participation in all arms will be for 104 weeks post randomization. In the experimental arms,
      treatment will be for 39 weeks (participants in the experimental arms will be allowed up to
      47 weeks to complete the 39-week treatment course) and post-treatment follow up for up to 65
      additional weeks. In the control arm, treatment will be delivered according to local standard
      of care (in consistence with WHO guidance); duration will be variable, for approximately 86
      weeks. Non-inferiority will be established for any experimental arm if the lower bound of the
      one-sided 97.5% confidence interval around the difference in favorable outcome between the
      control and experimental arms is greater than or equal to -12%.

               -  A confirmed QTc interval of greater than or equal to 450 ms. Retesting to
                  reassess eligibility will be allowed once using an unscheduled visit during the
                  screening phase;

               -  Evidence of ventricular pre-excitation (e.g., Wolff Parkinson White syndrome);

               -  Electrocardiographic evidence of complete or clinically significant incomplete
