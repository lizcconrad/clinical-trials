  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this clinical research study is to learn if venetoclax given in combination with
      ibrutinib can help to control CLL or SLL. The safety of the drug combination will be also
      studied.

      This is an investigational study. Ibrutinib is FDA approved and commercially available for
      the treatment of patients with mantle cell lymphoma and in patients with CLL who have
      received at least 1 prior treatment. Its use in this study is investigational. Venetoclax is
      FDA approved and commercially available for the treatment of patients with CLL who have have
      received at least 1 prior treatment. The combination of venetoclax and ibrutinib is
      investigational.

      The study doctor can describe how the study drugs are designed to work.

      Up to 160 participants will be enrolled in this study. All will take part at MD Anderson.

      Study Drug Administration:

      If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, you will receive the study drugs
      in study cycles that are 4 weeks (28 days) long.

      You will take 3 capsules of ibrutinib 1 time every day while you are on study with about 1
      cup (8 ounces) of water.

      If you miss a dose of ibrutinib, it can be taken as soon as possible on the same day with a
      return to the normal schedule the following day. You should not take extra capsules on the
      following day to make up the missed dose.

      Beginning on Day 1 of Cycle 4, you will also take tablets of venetoclax 1 time every day for
      the rest of the study. Each dose of venetoclax will be taken at about the same time as
      ibrutinib with about 1 cup (8 ounces) of water, within 30 minutes after you finish eating a
      low-fat breakfast.

      In order to lower the risk of side effects, you will start taking venetoclax at a low dose
      and then it will be increased each week as directed by your doctor until you are taking the
      full dose.

      If you vomit within 15 minutes of taking venetoclax and all the tablets are still intact,
      another dose may be taken. Otherwise, you should not take another dose. In cases where a dose
      of venetoclax is missed or forgotten, you should take the dose as soon as possible, as long
      as it is within 8 hours after the dose was planned to have been taken.

      You will also be given standard drugs to help decrease the risk of side effects beginning 3
      days before your first dose of venetoclax. You may ask the study staff for information about
      how the drugs are given and their risks.

      If the study doctor thinks it is in your best interest, Cycle 4 may be delayed. In this case,
      you will continue taking ibrutinib, but you will not start taking venetoclax until the study
      doctor thinks that it is safe for you to do so.

      Tumor Lysis Syndrome Monitoring:

      Starting about 3 days before receiving your first dose of venetoclax at the beginning of the
      study and then at any time that the dose increases (and continuing for at least 5 weeks of
      treatment), you will be given a drug to lower the risk of a serious side effect called Tumor
      Lysis Syndrome (TLS). TLS happens when cancer cells break down rapidly. The break-down
      products enter the bloodstream and are not flushed out quickly enough.

      You will have blood tests (about 2 tablespoons each time) before your dose and may have blood
      tests (about 2 tablespoons) 4, 8, 12 and 24 hours after your dose. Based on your test
      results, your study doctor may have more instructions for you, and you may need to meet with
      a kidney doctor while you are in the hospital. You will be hospitalized after your first dose
      of venetoclax to check for or treat TLS. You may need to receive fluids by vein.

      Study Visits:

      Every week during Cycle 1, then every 2 weeks in Cycles 2 and 3, blood (about 2 tablespoons)
      will be drawn for routine tests.

      On Days 1 and 15 of Cycle 1, then on Day 1 of Cycles 2 and 3, you will have a physical exam.

      At the end of Cycles 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 21, and 27, then every 6-12 months after that:

        -  You will have a bone marrow aspiration/biopsy to check the status of the disease.

        -  You will have CT or PET scans.

      Every week during Cycle 4, then every 2 weeks in Cycles 5 and 6, blood (about 2 tablespoons)
      will be drawn for routine tests.

      Every week during Cycle 4, then on Day 1 of Cycles 5 and 6, you will have a physical exam.

      On Day 1 of Cycles 7 and beyond:

        -  You will have a physical exam (every 3 cycles only).

        -  Blood (about 2 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests. After the first year of the
           study, this can be done every 3 cycles.

      Physical exams and blood draws may be done more often if the doctor thinks it is needed.

      Length of Treatment:

      You may receive venetoclax for up to 2 years. You may continue receiving ibrutinib for as
      long as the study doctor thinks it is in your best interest. You will no longer be able to
      take the study drugs if the disease gets worse, if intolerable side effects occur, or if you
      are unable to follow study directions.

             least one prior therapy will be eligible (Cohort 1). Untreated patients with high-risk
             features (del(17p), or mutated TP53, or del(11q), or unmutated IGHV, or &gt;/= 65 years
             of age) are eligible (Cohort 2) provided they have active disease requiring treatment
             as defined by the International Working Group for CLL (IWCLL)

          2. Age 18 years or older

          3. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Performance Status &lt;/=2

             upper limit of normal (ULN) or &lt;/=3 x ULN for patients with Gilbert's disease (In pts
             with elevated total bilirubin due to increased indirect bilirubin, pts with direct
             bilirubin &lt;/= 1.5 x ULN are eligible), -- Creatinine clearance &gt;50 mL/min (calculated
             according to institutional standards or using Cockcroft-Gault , MDRD, or CKD-EPI
             formula), -- alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and alanine aminotransferase (AST) &lt;/=3.0
             x ULN, unless clearly due to disease involvement

          5. Platelet count of greater than 20,000/mul, with no platelet transfusion in 2 weeks
             prior to registration. This criteria is waived if the thrombocytopenia is due to bone
             marrow involvement with the disease

          6. Women of childbearing potential must have a negative serum or urine beta human
             chorionic gonadotropin (Beta-hCG) pregnancy test result within 7 days prior to the
             first dose of study drugs and must agree to use an effective contraception method
             during the study and for 30 days following the last dose of study drug. Women of non-
             childbearing potential are those who are postmenopausal greater than 1 year or who
             have had a bilateral tubal ligation or hysterectomy. Men who have partners of

             breast, who are eligible even if they are currently treated or have been treated
             and/or diagnosed in the past 2 years prior to study enrolment. If patients have
             another malignancy that was treated within the last 2 years, such patients may be
             enrolled if the likelihood of requiring systemic therapy for this other malignancy
             within 2 years is less than 10%, as determined by an expert in that particular
             malignancy at MD Anderson Cancer Center, and after consultation with the Principal
             Investigator.

          8. Patients or their legally authorized representative must provide written informed
             consent

             Patients who are HBsAg negative/HBsAb positive but HBcAb positive are eligible,
             provided HBV DNA is negative. NOTE - definitions for abbreviations: HBV - hepatitis B
             virus; DNA - deoxyribonucleic acid; HBe - hepatitis B e; anti-HBs - hepatitis B
             surface antibody; anti-HBc - hepatitis B core antibody; HBsAg - hepatitis B surface

             with study participation or investigational product administration or may interfere
             with the interpretation of study results and/or would make the patient inappropriate
