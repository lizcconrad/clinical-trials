      Investigators propose this study in order to answer the following research question: An
      educational intervention and breastfeeding support at postpartum will increase the frequency
      and total breastfeeding duration in the intervention group? This is a randomized (with
      control and intervention groups) study, open and parallel (1: 1 ratio between study groups)
      with 200 pregnant women in the second or third trimester, according to their body mass index
      (BMI, kg / m2) with excess weight (BMI&gt; 29 pre-pregnancy weight) and that will address their
      pregnancy in the public health services and hospitals belonging to the Health Ministry of 5
      districts: Coyoacán, Magdalena Contreras, Tlalpan, Xochimilco and Alvaro Obregón in Mexico
      City.

      The intervention group and the control group will have the same characteristics for
      eligibility.

      The main phases to develop the study are PHASE 1. INTERVENTION DESIGN PHASE 2. IMPLEMENTATION
      OF THE INTERVENTION. PHASE 3. FOLLOW-UP The intervention will be offered at 3 times: 1)
      Educational intervention (a workshop) to pregnant obese women. The workshop will be held by
      an International Board Certified Lactation Consultant (IBCLC) to promote exclusive
      breastfeeding and to encourage a better breastfeeding performance in accordance with the WHO
      recommendations. The workshop will be held at convenient times and will be conducted for
      groups of 8 to 10 participants; 2) Immediate breastfeeding support at hospital by an IBCLC
      and; 3) The women will be exposed to early telephonic follow-up during the first week of
      their children´s life and each month until six months of life. Then, if the breastfeeding
      continues, each two months until the first year of their children´s life.

      At the first month postpartum, investigators will visit participants at home, both the
      control group and the intervention group, for collecting information on breastfeeding
      practices, for taking a breast milk sample to estimate its fatty acids content, and a blood
      sample (serum) to obtain the C-Reactive Protein. Also, the investigators will take
      anthropometric measurements of the children to evaluate their growth (weight, length, and
      skinfold thickness). Investigators will ask for breastfeeding practices and diet of the
      participants through a 24 hours recall.

      The results of this intervention group will be compared with the control group: pregnant
      obese women without the educational intervention or telephonic follow-up.

    <textblock>
      BACKGROUND Maternal obesity alters the composition of the breast milk beyond the influence of
      diet on it: lower concentrations of polyamines, an altered pattern of saturated and trans-
      fatty acids, and reduced mono- and polyunsaturated fatty acids. In addition, altered
      bioactive components are also observed such as regulatory factors and growth hormones,
      regulatory metabolic adiponectin, immunologic factors, cytokines, among others. There is a
      relationship between indicators of infant growth and body composition; as in the case of
      leptin that concentrates more on women with obesity. There has been found that those
      breastfed infants of obese women have a greater weight gain than breastfed infants of normal
      weight women.

      Biological factors are: breastfeeding is a bit delayed in primiparous women and more in
      mothers with obesity. Obesity delays copious production of breast milk (Lactogenesis stage
      II) and it concurs with the synthesis of prolactin (PRL), in response to the decreased
      sucking of the child.

      In addition to this attenuated neurological response, a low chronic inflammation level
      (particular of obesity) and with the production of cytokines by the proinflammatory adipose
      tissue there is zinc sequestration at the endoplasmic reticulum and lysosomes of epithelial
      cells of mammary gland, activating the process of premature recession, compromising the
      establishment of the copious milk production and causing premature weaning. Another
      biological alterations that mothers with obesity suffer are that they have an altered glucose
      management, which compromises their milk production.

      In addition to these biological alterations,obese mothers have a higher risk of complications
      in the delivery; where it is common to experience great physiological stress and having a
      high probability of caesarean, which metabolically does not interfere with breastfeeding but
      delays its establishment. Physical factors such as an excess of subcutaneous fat in the area
      of the areola of mothers with obesity cause discomfort and stress in the mother and crying in
      the infant, hindering the correct latch of the infant to the nipple, weakening the
      neurological stimulus that triggers Prolactin production.

      In addition, psychosocial factors complicate breastfeeding in overweight women; obese mothers
      have reported an increased feeling of insufficient milk, compared with non-obese mothers. In
      addition to this, women with obesity report lower self-efficacy than their pairs without
      obesity.

      Despite the implementation of educational interventions to promote the establishment of
      breastfeeding in obese women, the results have not been favorable to increase the prevalence
      of breastfeeding.

      To help to improve this practice in women with obesity, it raises the following research
      question:

      An intervention specifically designed to lessen the problems in establishing breastfeeding in
      women with obesity, which includes: an educational intervention with support during the
      pregnancy, the immediate postpartum period and the first year of life; increases the
      frequency of exclusive and predominant breastfeeding during the first month of life, and the
      total duration of breastfeeding?

      METHODOLOGY PHASE 1 INTERVENTION DESIGN The intervention will be made with information
      derived from a focus group (FG). The main objective is to identify the barriers of a mother
      with obesity for breastfeeding (discomfort, delay in producing the milk copiously, flat
      nipple, among others) and to explore the ideas to overcome them. For this purpose, an FG will
      derive the elements to design a communication component according to real experiences to aim
      the problems for breastfeeding of obese women. The communication theory that will be used is
      Communication in Health as a strategy for structuring the activities. Investigators will
      develop a guide to lead the FG discussion that allows the investigators to identify the
      factors that influence the performance of breastfeeding in obese pregnant women. The main
      characteristic of women participating in the FG is pregnant women with obesity, the
      distinction between primiparous and not primiparous women and those who have breastfed before
      at least for 6 months.

      Validation of messages Investigators will perform a comparison of the messages derived from
      the analysis of the FG with the group of mothers who participated in the FG to ensure that
      the messages are relevant and clear.

      Workshop Design.

      With an expert on learning techniques as a collaborator, investigators will design the
      workshop with the validated messages derived from the FG and it will be complemented by using
      the experience of an IBCLC. The workshop will be divided into three stages:

        -  First stage: Basics of breastfeeding and its significance for the health of the baby and
           mother.

        -  Second stage: discussion of the problems that may arise, particularly in mothers with
           obesity. Recommendations and appropriate techniques to solve these problems will be
           given trough Games and communication activities will be driven.

        -  Third stage: Treatment of the most common problems and the counseling for solving them.

      PHASE 2. IMPLEMENTATION OF THE INTERVENTION. Step 1. Enrollment. This stage is scheduled to
      take place within 5 months and it has two strategies: 1) with previous authorization of the
      Health Ministry of Mexico City, investigators will request information from the censuses of
      each health jurisdiction where there are all the pregnant women identified, or; 2)
      investigators will approach to pregnant women at the time they attend to their medical
      consultation.

      Once investigators have identified the pregnant women,they will ask for the pregnant women
      informed consent (adult) / written assent (adolescent) to obtain information about them since
      the eligibility criteria will be evaluated. These criteria are: age ≥15 years old, presence
      of obesity (IMC &gt;28 for adolescents and &gt;29 for adults), weeks of gestation (between 22 and
      33 w), absence of chronic illnesses contraindicated for breastfeeding (HIV or AIDS,
      hepatitis, etc., except diabetes), not consuming drugs contraindicated during lactation, and
      in case of multiple pregnancies, there will be considered only the eldest child of twins (if
      there are more than two babies the pregnant women will be excluded from the study), absence
      of breast reduction surgery, and they may continue be living in Mexico City after delivery.

      In this step, investigators estimate the necessity of screening approximately 3,700 women as
      potential participants.

      Once that the pregnant women who met the criteria has been identified, investigators will ask
      for another informed consent or written assent for explaining in detail the whole study, and
      invite them to participate. Also, sociodemographic data and a self-efficacy questionnaire (a
      questionnaire about the feeling of the participant to be capable of breastfed her baby) will
      be collected. The aim is to recruit 200 women. Then, investigators will assign randomly each
      one of the women to a study group (intervention group or control group).

      Step 2. Basal phase. Once women were assigned to a study group it is the beginning of the
      intervention and it is considered as the baseline of the study.

      Activities for Control group: The women who were assigned to this group will be monitored by
      telephone to ask about their breastfeeding performance. Investigators will call them once a
      month until the 6 months of age of their baby then, every two months until the child´s first
      year old.

      Women assigned to this group will have the option (they will make the choice) to take the
      courses standardly organized by their health center.

      To encourage the pregnant to reach these courses, the staff of the educational programs in
      each health center invite physicians, nurses, and social workers; to let them know the
      existence of these groups and the importance of invite all pregnant women to take them.

      Also, these courses are promoted for the staff of each health center. Some of the topics in
      these courses are directed to the care of the mother and others on the newborn's care.

      At immediate postpartum: Investigators will identify the arrival of a woman of the study to
      any of the five hospitals selected for the study. For the women of the control group,
      investigators will only collect data of self-efficacy, birth and health conditions, both baby
      and mother after delivery.

      &lt;Activities for the Intervention group&gt;

      The intervention will be set at different times:

        1. During pregnancy: with a workshop where there will be particularly designed to solve
           doubts about the problems of breastfeeding, and for showing the health benefits for the
           infant and mother health. The workshop will be based mainly on the material developed in
           the FC and with the assistance of an International Board Certified Lactation Consultant
           (IBCLC) of Mexico. It will ensure to cover the educational material, communication and
           practical, recommended by the WHO Baby Friendly Hospital Initiative. For this group,
           there will be asked another self-efficacy questionnaire at the end of the workshop.

        2. At immediate postpartum: Investigators will identify the arrival of a woman of the study
           to any of the five hospitals selected for the study. For the intervention group, in
           addition to the collection of data of health conditions of the mother and her baby, one
           of the IBCLC will attend and provide immediate support for the establishment of
           breastfeeding within the first few hours old of the baby. The IBCLC may solve all doubts
           of the mothers; give support, supervise and guide the initiation of breastfeeding,
           explain the proper grip, suggest the ideal positions to breastfeeding for both the
           mother and the newborn, this support it is supposed to be intensive. All these
           activities must be coordinated with the physicians and nurses from each of the five
           hospitals in order to follow the rules and requirements that each hospital has
           established.

        3. After delivery and until the first year of life of the children: the intervention will
           consist of two steps.

             1. During the first 7 days of the life of the infant. An IBCLC will call the mother
                daily.

             2. A telephonic follow-up at 2 weeks old of the baby and then, a phone call each month
                until reaching 6 months; then, every two months until the baby will have one year
                of life. With the calls, investigators pretend to collect information about the
                duration and type of feeding. There is the possibility that the support will be
                held via &quot;Skype&quot; if the women prefer it.

                &lt;Activities for both groups (intervention and control)&gt; Investigators will deliver
                written relevant information about the recommended alimentation of the women at
                postpartum as well as some ideas for physical activity, such as going for a walk,
                doing some household chores that involve physical exertion. This technical
                information is derived from the literature and will be expressed in a simple and
                accessible way. Each issue will be sent separately, ie, will be three times for
                sending the information. For those women who leave the study before the first year
                of her child, investigators will send them the information at once.

                *Baseline measurements in women* Measurements shall be made in mothers in both
                control and intervention groups. Investigators will develop and pre-test
                quantitative instruments to measure the following variables: Self-efficacy and
                breastfeeding problems related to the infants and women.

                Sociodemographic characteristics: Through a questionnaire investigators will ask
                about household members, the household head, marital status and education of the
                participants, housing characteristics (number of rooms, flooring material and roof
                material) and possession of household goods ( TV, radio, computer, vehicle, etc.).
                In addition, investigators will ask if the participant has a formal employment and
                if she receives a payment and the type of work performed.

                General characteristics of the infant: sex, gestational age at birth, and type of
                birth (birth or caesarean section).

                Infant anthropometry: During women's hospital stay, length and weight data will be
                measured to calculate Z-score of weight / age, length / age, weight / length
                indicators.

                Diagnosis of the infant: evaluations that are made to the newborn by protocol,
                these include Apgar score at one and five minutes, Silverman Andersen after 10
                minutes and neonatal complications, and any clinical disease condition, which are
                obtained from the medical record or medical report.

                Initial food: the first time and elapsed time since the baby was born until was
                fed.

                PHASE 3. FOLLOW-UP At a month postpartum, investigators will visit participants at
                home, both the control group and the intervention group, for information on
                breastfeeding practices. Also from the mother, a breast milk sample will be taken
                to determine the composition of fatty acids of it, a blood sample to determine
                C-Reactive Protein and also investigators will collect dietary information. Then
                from the child measures on infant growth (weight, length, and skinfold thickness)
                will be taken. The project staff will be standardized for newborn anthropometric
                measurement, following the technique of Lohman.

                Measurements obtained from the mother:

                -Breastfeeding practices: Through a questionnaire she will be asked for the type of
                food the infant received. Investigators will ask for the time the infant received
                breastfeeding, exclusive or not.

                A sample of breast milk for determination of fatty acids and C-reactive protein in
                serum as a marker of inflammation will be determined.

                -Infant Measurements Infant growth: During the home visits, weight, length and head
                circumference of the infant measurements will be taken with the specified
                techniques above. In addition, skinfold (triceps, biceps, and subscapularis) shall
                be measured to calculate the indicators: triceps skinfold / age and subscapular
                skinfold / age and head circumference. For this measurements, the project staff
                will also be trained and standardized.

                Sample size and statistical power Investigators will study 200 obese pregnant
                women, 100 per study group. This sample size was calculated to detect a difference
                in the prevalence of exclusive breastfeeding (at one month postpartum) in 10
                percent (12 to 22%), with a statistical power of 90%, a level of significance
                &gt;0.05, a nonresponse rate of 50% and 15% of abandonment postpartum. To achieve the
                sample size, recruitment will be held for 5 months, hoping to incorporate to the
                study, at least, two women daily. This calculation was performed using information
                on the number of women who could meet the inclusion criteria of the study.

                To achieve this sample size, investigators estimated to screen a total of 3,700
                women in the primary care level health services in order to identify women who meet
                the inclusion criteria as described above.

                According to similar studies, to calculate the number of women needed to get 200
                women (100 in each group) investigators did as it follows:

                All pregnant women attending health centers n= 3,700 It is expected that at least
                34% of women have a body mass index (BMI)&gt; 29 n= 1,258 It is expected that 40% meet
                inclusion criteria n= 503 Only 50% agree to participate n= 251 Approximately 80%
                give birth in the reference hospital n= 200

                Data management Study participants will be assigned a unique identification number.
                A subject identification list will be created, including the subjects
                identification number, personal information and contact information of each subject
                participating in the study. Only the main investigator will have access to this
                list in order to make it possible to trace and identify an individual subject. This
                list will also help to carry out medical auditing. For all the analysis and data
                management, the identification number will be used in order to ensure
                confidentiality and privacy of the subjects.

                Once data is collected by fieldworkers, the completed questionnaires will be
                brought to the headquarters of the study, where supervisors will check for
                potential mistakes or missing information. Investigators will use a case report
                form per participant, where a checklist of all information to be collected from
                them and the quality of it, will be recorded. The case report form will be filled
                out by the field supervisor every time is checking the file of each subject. The
                purpose of the case report form will be for monitoring the quality of the
                information collected, and to check that all the information is being collected on
                time.

                Data entry will be performed continuously during the course of the study. Data will
                be entered in duplicate for quality control. In case there are missing data or
                errors in data collection, the field workers will go back to participants and
                recover the information when possible. Regular backup of databases procedures will
                be conducted.

                Statistical processing and analysis STATA version 13.1 is the statistical package
                that will be used to process information to describe the study population
                characteristics, making tests of the results between the two groups, explore the
                trends and to obtain the average length of BF by intervention group.

                Evaluate the change in measurements of growth of infants from birth to 12 months of
                life.

                Analysis Plan Descriptive statistics (summary measures, according to variable type
                and measurement scale) will be a descriptive analysis including means, medians,
                standard errors and variances for each of the stages of data collection (baseline
                and follow-up), as applicable. To analyze baseline differences between the study
                groups, comparisons between groups will be made by the difference of proportions
                test for categorical variables and t tests for continuous variables. The statistics
                tests will include design information, adjusting the standard errors and applying a
                continuity correction.

                For the analysis of sociodemographic information, a cluster analysis will be used
                to identify groups of interest considering some characteristics of women.

                Analytical or inferential statistics (test to be applied by type of variable: if
                necessary, statistical hypotheses and test procedures).

                To evaluate the effect of the intervention data will be analyzed as panel data
                comparisons of means and variances. ANOVA, ANCOVA MANOVA and for comparing the
                groups: analysis of variance with and without intervention between and within
                groups.

                To evaluate the relationship between obesity and breastfeeding performance
                investigators will use regression models were conducted and sociodemographic and

                On the other hand, regression models will be conducted to analyze the relationship
                between the composition of breast milk and the infant's growth at one month and at
                12 months.

                All the analysis will be done with intent to treatment. Qualitative analysis For
                the analysis of the educational intervention, qualitative analysis will be carried
                out through satisfaction surveys and open-ended questionnaires.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Pregnant Women &lt;18 years old with a BMI &gt;=28, and women &lt;18 years old with a BMI &gt;=27,
             utilizing their pre-pregnancy weight.

          -  Pregnant women within the second or early third trimester (week 20 through week 34 of
             gestation).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Pregnant women under 15 years old.

          -  Pregnant women diagnosed with HIV or AIDS, Hepatitis B and C, or the Human T
             lymphotropic virus. In the presence of these, women have the contraindication to feed
             their children with breast milk.

          -  Pregnant women with medical conditions that could interfere with breastfeeding, as
             severe infections transmitted through breast milk.

          -  Pregnant women with previous breast surgery (as breast reduction) because the
             lactiferous ducts end up damaged and may lead to poor or no milk production at all.

          -  Pregnant women that are taking medications that prevent carrying out breastfeeding.

          -  Pregnant women with a multiple pregnancy (in case of twins, the first born should be
             taken for the study).

        Exit criteria:

          -  Newborns with less than 35 weeks of gestational age.

          -  Newborns dispatched to the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) from the first day of
             life.

          -  Newborns who present major congenital malformations, severe enough to prevent the
             breastfeeding.

        Elimination criteria:

          -  Newborns with hypertrophy (large for gestational age), because they may present
             hypoglycemia and therefore some should require to remain in fast even after starting
             oral feeding and especially on the first day of life.

          -  Newborns that enter to the Intermediate Care Unit for a neonatal or maternal adverse
             event even if the breastfeeding was already initiated.
