    <textblock>
      This study intends to measure the effects of valsartan/sacubitril compared to baseline
      standard medical heart failure therapy on reverse remodeling using echocardiographic
      endocardial surface analysis techniques to assess changes in ventricular volume, function,
      and shape. Furthermore, Metaiodobenzylguanidine (MIBG) scintigraphy and the heart to
      mediastinum ratio will be used to assess Left Ventricle (LV) volume regression and risk
      reduction. The investigators also intend to measure the effects of valsartan/sacubitril on
      exercise capacity as assessed by the 6 minute walk test and peak Volume of Oxygen (V02) on
      cardiopulmonary exercise testing. Additionally, the investigators will examine the impact of
      valsartan/sacubitril on functional status and quality of life using the Kansas City
      Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire (KCCQ) and Qualia Health (a novel iPhone application that
      incorporates Fitbit technology to provide a &quot;real time&quot; daily 6 minute step count and
      assesses quality of life using a series of short targeted questions. The investigators will
      also measure Brain Natriuretic Peptide (BNP), N-terminal of the Prohormone Brain Natriuretic
      Peptide (NT-proBNP), and Rho-kinase (a biomarker associated with heart failure) levels at
      multiple time-points throughout the study period.
