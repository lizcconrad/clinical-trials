    <measure>Overall Comfort</measure>
    <time_frame>7-Day Follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>Overall comfort was assessed using the Contact Lens User Experience™ (CLUE) questionnaire. CLUE is a validated patient-reported outcomes (PRO) questionnaire to assess patient-experience attributes of soft contact lenses (comfort, vision, handling, and packaging) in a contact-lens wearing population in the US, ages 18-65. Derived CLUE scores using Item Response Theory (IRT) follow a normal distribution with a population average score of 60 (SD 20), where higher scores indicate a more favorable/positive response with a range of 0-120. Please note this was a 2 treatment by 3 period study design. Therefore, some subjects were randomized to receive one of the study lenses twice, hence the number of observations were summarized per lens type. For the senofilcon A lens 132+136+132=400 (Observations- 1 per subject per period) from period 1, 2 and 3 respectively. For the stenfilcon A lens 136+132+136=404 (observations) from period 1, 2 and 3 respectively.</description>

    <measure>Individual Patient Reported Outcomes (Items 1-5)</measure>
    <time_frame>7-Day Follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>Individual patient reported outcomes questions were used to assess patient-experience attributes of soft contact lenses (e.g. comfort and vision). Items were assessed at the 7-Day follow-up using a 5-point scale of either (1) Strongly Disagree, Disagree, Neither Agree nor Disagree, Agree, Strongly Agree or (2) Poor, Fair, Good, Very Well, Excellent. Subject's responses for each item were dichotomoized into top-two-box (T2B) response where T2B=1 if a subject responded positively to the question which is dependent on the response set) and T2B=0 otherwise. The percentage of T2B for each item and lens was reported. The following items were asked: ([] indicate the question was abbreviated due to space)1.&quot;These Lenses Were Very Comfortable At The End Of The Day&quot; 2.&quot;The Comfort of these lenses decreased throughout the day&quot; 3. The lenses were very comfortable from the time I got up to the time I went to bed&quot; 4. &quot;Overall Comfort&quot; 5. &quot;Comfort throughout the Day&quot;</description>

        <title>Overall Comfort</title>
        <description>Overall comfort was assessed using the Contact Lens User Experience™ (CLUE) questionnaire. CLUE is a validated patient-reported outcomes (PRO) questionnaire to assess patient-experience attributes of soft contact lenses (comfort, vision, handling, and packaging) in a contact-lens wearing population in the US, ages 18-65. Derived CLUE scores using Item Response Theory (IRT) follow a normal distribution with a population average score of 60 (SD 20), where higher scores indicate a more favorable/positive response with a range of 0-120. Please note this was a 2 treatment by 3 period study design. Therefore, some subjects were randomized to receive one of the study lenses twice, hence the number of observations were summarized per lens type. For the senofilcon A lens 132+136+132=400 (Observations- 1 per subject per period) from period 1, 2 and 3 respectively. For the stenfilcon A lens 136+132+136=404 (observations) from period 1, 2 and 3 respectively.</description>

        <title>Individual Patient Reported Outcomes (Items 1-5)</title>
        <description>Individual patient reported outcomes questions were used to assess patient-experience attributes of soft contact lenses (e.g. comfort and vision). Items were assessed at the 7-Day follow-up using a 5-point scale of either (1) Strongly Disagree, Disagree, Neither Agree nor Disagree, Agree, Strongly Agree or (2) Poor, Fair, Good, Very Well, Excellent. Subject's responses for each item were dichotomoized into top-two-box (T2B) response where T2B=1 if a subject responded positively to the question which is dependent on the response set) and T2B=0 otherwise. The percentage of T2B for each item and lens was reported. The following items were asked: ([] indicate the question was abbreviated due to space)1.&quot;These Lenses Were Very Comfortable At The End Of The Day&quot; 2.&quot;The Comfort of these lenses decreased throughout the day&quot; 3. The lenses were very comfortable from the time I got up to the time I went to bed&quot; 4. &quot;Overall Comfort&quot; 5. &quot;Comfort throughout the Day&quot;</description>

          <description>Individual patient reported outcomes questions were used to assess patient-experience attributes of soft contact lenses (e.g. comfort and vision). Items were assessed at the 7-Day follow-up using a 5-point scale of either (1) Strongly Disagree, Disagree, Neither Agree nor Disagree, Agree, Strongly Agree or (2) Poor, Fair, Good, Very Well, Excellent. Subject's responses for each item were dichotomoized into top-two-box (T2B) response where T2B=1 if a subject responded positively to the question which is dependent on the response set) and T2B=0 otherwise. The percentage of T2B for each item and lens was reported. The following items were asked: ([] indicate the question was abbreviated due to space)1.&quot;These Lenses Were Very Comfortable At The End Of The Day&quot; 2.&quot;The Comfort of these lenses decreased throughout the day&quot; 3. The lenses were very comfortable from the time I got up to the time I went to bed&quot; 4. &quot;Overall Comfort&quot; 5. &quot;Comfort throughout the Day&quot;</description>

          <description>Individual patient reported outcomes questions were used to assess patient-experience attributes of soft contact lenses (e.g. comfort and vision). Items were assessed at the 7-Day follow-up using a 5-point scale of either (1) Strongly Disagree, Disagree, Neither Agree nor Disagree, Agree, Strongly Agree or (2) Poor, Fair, Good, Very Well, Excellent. Subject's responses for each item were dichotomoized into top-two-box (T2B) response where T2B=1 if a subject responded positively to the question which is dependent on the response set) and T2B=0 otherwise. The percentage of T2B for each item and lens was reported. The following items were asked: ([] indicate the question was abbreviated due to space). 15.&quot;Clarity of vision during daily activities&quot; 16.&quot;Clarity of vision in dim or low lighting conditions&quot; 17. &quot;Clarity of visions when driving at night&quot;.</description>
