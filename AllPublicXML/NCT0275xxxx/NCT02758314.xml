  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Several reports have examined Programmed Death 1 (PD-1) expression on tumor-infiltrating
      T-cells, and its correlation with prognosis has been discussed. However, Programmed Death 1
      (PD1)/Programmed Death Ligand 1 (PDL1) expression on the peripheral blood T-cells of cancer
      patients, particularly in those with lung cancer, has not been sufficiently studied. The
      purpose of this study is evaluate the expression of PD1 and PDL1 in subpopulations of
      peripheral blood and tumor cells patients with lung cancer non-small cell (NSCLC),
      associating with clinicopathological features of the patients studied.

      This is a prospective cohort study including patients with NSCLC stages IIIA, IIIB and IV
      lung cancer clinic of the National Cancer Institute (INCAN)

      Clinical samples. Prior and informed consent before receiving any treatment, sample be
      obtained 15 ml peripheral blood of each subject included in the study (patients and
      controls). mononuclear peripheral blood cells (PBMC) from different groups of subjects
      separated by centrifugation gradient (Polymorphprep, Accurate Chemical) are used. The cells
      are resuspended in dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) and 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) to 90% at a
      concentration of 1 million cells per ml and kept in liquid nitrogen until use.

      Evaluation of PD-1, PD-L1 by flow cytometry. The following monoclonal antibodies directed
      against cell surface antigens of human are used: anti-PD-1, anti-PD-L1, anti-PD-L2, anti-
      cluster of differentiation (CD) 3, anti-CD4, anti-CD8, anti-CD14, anti-CD16, anti-CD56,
      anti-CD19, anti-CD20.

      Immunolocalization of PD-1, PD-L1 in lung tumor tissue of patients with NSCLC.
      Immunohistochemical staining (IHC). Lung biopsy is obtained paraffin blocks, and are
      processed by IHC technique for antitumor expression of PD1 / PDL1.V PD-L1 immunostaining was
      classified into two groups according to intensity and extent: (a) negative, when no staining
      or positive staining was detected in &lt;5% of the cells; and (b) positive, when membranous
      staining was present in P5% of the cells.
