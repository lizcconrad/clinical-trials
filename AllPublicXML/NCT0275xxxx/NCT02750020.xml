      Current study is the fourth wave of the policy-related survey on tobacco control in Hong
      Kong. It aims to investigate the level of public support on current and future tobacco
      control measures and taxation policies and to address the timely impacts of smoke-free
      policies, substantiate public support on further tobacco control measures and assist COSH in
      shaping policy direction for government. In total, 5000 subjects will be randomly selected
      for a telephone interview. The subjects will be categorized into three groups, i.e. never
      smokers (1667), ex-smokers (1667) and current smokers (1667). They will be required to answer
      a questionnaire via telephone. All data shall be collected using a Computer Assisted
      Telephone Interview (CATI) system, which allows real-time data capture and consolidation. All
      interviews shall be conducted anonymously. Analysis of survey data will aim to identify
      current opinion on tobacco control policies and implications for future policies. Analyses
      will be controlled for confounding variables as required by stratification into sub-groups
      based on important pre-defined characteristics and/or by multivariate analysis. Comparison
      with past trends and, where possible, extrapolation of future trends will be explored.
      Weights will be applied to adjust for the sex and age of Hong Kong population, and to handle
      the over-sampling issues of current smokers. The data analysis will be conducted by
      statisticians.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      From 2013 to 2015, investigators conducted three waves of the policy-related survey on
      tobacco control. The surveys gathered information such as second hand smoking (SHS) exposure
      at home, in the workplace, and in various public places (e.g. bars/restaurants, door way of
      the buildings, streets, and bus stops), use of smoking cessation services, knowledge of
      smoking and quitting, and smoking prevalence; measured the impact of tobacco control policies
      such as tax increase in 2011 and 2014, expansion of smoke-free areas in 2009 and 2010, and
      pictorial health warnings on behavioral change of smokers and ex-smokers; collected the
      opinions on current policies such as smoke-free areas, pictorial health warnings and point of
      sale displays, and the opinions towards future policies such as tax increase, plain
      packaging, and tobacco endgame. The results of the three waves have been used by the Hong
      Kong Council On Smoking and Health (COSH) to advocate plain packaging, banning on point of
      sale displays, and increasing tobacco tax by 100% in the past 3 years.

      In order to collect further information on issues related to tobacco control which should be
      addressed in future tobacco control measures in Hong Kong, COSH commissioned School of Public
      Health, HKU to conduct a fourth wave of the survey (2015/16). The current survey sought to
      use the Hong Kong data to update information on the prevalence of SHS and active smoking and
      its health effects, use of E-cigarettes, awareness of smoking cessation services and to
      identify the level of public support for current and future tobacco control measures as well
      as estimating the impact of existing policies.
