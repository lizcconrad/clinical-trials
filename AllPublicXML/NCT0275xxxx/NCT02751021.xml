  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Little is known about potential relationships between sleep apnea, plasma aldosterone and
      diastolic dysfunction which is a very frequent finding among patients requiring permanent
      cardiac pacing. Sleep apnea is often under diagnosed by clinical examination. Confirmation
      tests are expensive and access is limited. A specific algorithm available in a recent
      pacemaker allows assessing breathing variations using minute ventilation sensor, with a good
      agreement between the respiratory disturbance index and polysomnography results for the
      diagnosis of severe sleep apnea.

      The purpose of the study is to examine the diagnostic accuracy of a new pacemaker algorithm
      for the diagnosis of obstructive sleep apnea in patients presenting with diastolic
      dysfunction. The investigators also aim to highlight a correlation between plasma aldosterone
      levels and the severity of sleep apnea, with a reversal effect of ventilation therapy in this
      specific population.
