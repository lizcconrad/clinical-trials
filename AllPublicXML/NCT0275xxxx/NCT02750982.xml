    <textblock>
      This is a prospective investigation of the effects of Laughter therapy (LT) on perceived
      stress, self-efficacy, mood and other wellness measures in people with the following
      neurological conditions: Alzheimer's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, brain injury,
      Huntington's Disease, multiple sclerosis, Parkinson's Disease, post-stroke, spinal cord

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Laughter therapy (LT) has potential benefits in treating illness. It combines laughter with
      breathing and body exercises to stimulate laughter, both real and artificial, in a group
      setting. Laughter therapy may help treating illness by strengthening breathing muscles,
      improving mood, and providing pain and stress relief. EvergreenHealth has presented laughter
      therapy classes to patients with Parkinson's disease and Multiple sclerosis and other
      neurological conditions. The therapy will be led by a certified laughter therapist and mental
      health professional.
