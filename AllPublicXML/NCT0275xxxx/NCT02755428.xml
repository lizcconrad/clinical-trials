      This project intends to transplant human embryonic stem cells derived retinal pigment
      epitheliums into subretinal space of patients to treat dry age-related macular
      degeneration(dry-AMD).And we will assess the safety and efficacy of RPE transplants to treat
      dry AMD.

      This project intends to transplant human embryonic stem cells derived retinal pigment
      epitheliums into subretinal space to treat age-related macular degeneration(AMD).

      Through the statistical analysis EDTRS, BCVA, OCT, ERG, Fluorescein angiography, Ophthalmic
      AB ultrasound changes between before and after the treatment to assess the efficacy and
      safety of RPE transplants to treat AMD disease.
