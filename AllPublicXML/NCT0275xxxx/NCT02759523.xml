  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Increased portion sizes of foods high in energy density (calories per gram of food) have been
      implicated in the obesity epidemic. Numerous studies show that children and adults eat more
      from larger portions of food than they do from smaller portions, a response known as the
      portion size effect. Despite the robust and consistent nature of these findings, the
      mechanisms underlying the portion size effect are not known. The long-term goal of this
      research is to identify the neural mechanisms involved in the portion size effect so that
      this information can be used to develop effective weight-management strategies. Differences
      in neural response to food cues, as demonstrated by functional magnetic resonance imaging
      (fMRI), can help clarify the factors that determine susceptibility to large portions. The
      goal of this study is to identify brain regions activated in response to portion size and
      energy density and relate these neural responses to laboratory eating behaviors in children.

      The investigators hypothesize that high relative to low energy density food images will be
      associated with increased activation in regions of the brain involved in reward- and sensory-
      processing and that large relative to small portion size food images will be associated with
      increased activation in regions of the brain involved in cognitive control. In addition, the
      investigators hypothesize that these brain responses will influence the relationship between
      portion size served and energy intake at laboratory meals.

      What this study will add to the literature: The response to food images that vary by portion
      size using fMRI has not been previously reported. Furthermore, how the brain response to food
      portion size and energy density is related to energy intake has not been previously reported.
      The goal of this study is to identify brain regions activated in response to portion size and
      energy density and relate these neural responses to laboratory eating behaviors in children.
