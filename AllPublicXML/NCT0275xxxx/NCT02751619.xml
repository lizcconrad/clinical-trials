  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Thoracotomy is one of the most painful surgical incision. Uncontrolled acute post-thoracotomy
      pain reducing deep breathing exercises and secretion clearance increased the incidence of
      postoperative pulmonary complications including atelectasis, hypoxemia, and postoperative
      pulmonary infections. Thus, an effective analgesia is crucial in order to reduce
      perioperative morbidity and hospitalization time and also to prevent chronic post-thoracotomy
      pain.

      Thoracic epidural analgesia and thoracic paravertebral analgesia are currently the standard
      strategies for thoracic surgery but the difficult of performing them in all patients and
      their potential complications are all factors that limit their use. Systemic administration
      of opioids is the simplest and common strategy to provide analgesia but it may be associated
      with several undesirable effects, such as respiratory depression, sedation, nausea,
      constipation and vomiting.

      In the recent years, preventive analgesia is become one of the most promising strategy of
      postoperative pain control. It is based on the concept of administering analgesic drugs
      before the occurrence of nociceptive input in order to prevent central sensitization. The
      efficacy of preemptive analgesia is unclear and there is no a consensus on its efficacy on
      controlling pain after thoracic procedure.

      Pain following thoracotomy has a multifactorial genesis including surgical incision,
      intercostal nerve injury, pleural inflammation, and damage of pulmonary parenchyma and of
      diaphragm. Thus, a multimodal analgesia that intercepts the signalizing at numerous locations
      could be more effective than a single strategy targeting one site along the pain pathway.

      Thus, in the present study, the clinical hypothesis was that the preemptive analgesia of the
      skin using a new tool as the Lidocaine patch 5% would improve the analgesic effects of
      systemic morphine analgesia for controlling post-operative pain following thoracotomy.

      This was an unicenter, double-blinded, placebo controlled, parallel-group, prospective study
      conducted at Thoracic Surgery Unit and Anesthesia and Intensive Care Unit of Second
      University of Naples from January 2013 to May 2015.

      All consecutive patients undergoing undergoing anatomical resection by standard lateral
      thoracotomy for treatment of non small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) were randomly assigned to
      Lidocaine or Placebo group in 1:1 ratio and no changes to methods after trial commencement as
      type of randomization or eligibility criteria were attended.

      For patients assigned to active group, Lidocaine patch 5% (Lidoderm®, Endo Pharmaceuticals
      Inc, Malvern, PA, USA) measuring 10 x 14 cm and containing 700 mg of Lidocaine, was applied
      to cover the planned skin incision, marked with a pen by surgeon. Patch was applied for 12
      hours during the night, removed for the subsequent 12 hours during the day, and then a new
      patch was applied at the same level the night after. This process was continued for 3 days
      before thoracotomy. In the control group, a placebo patch, that was identical in appearance
      to the active patch but did not contain Lidocaine, was applied in the same manner for the
      same time. The pain service, surgical team, and patients were all blinded to treatment group
      assigned.

      All patients received the same anesthetic protocol. All operations were performed in the
      early morning just after that the patch was removed. The general anesthesia was inducted with
      i.v. midazolam 0.05 mg/kg, i.v. fentanyl 1-1.4 µg/Kg, i.v. propofol 2.5 mg/kg, i.v. and
      rocuronium bromide 0.6 mg/kg. The patient was maintained with desflurane 4-6%, sulfentanil
      0.5-1 micro/Kg, rocuronium bromide 0.6-0.8 mg/Kg, based on heart rate and blood pressure
      stability. A selective ventilation was performed with a double-lumen endobronchial tube in
      all cases and no additional analgesics were injected during surgery.

      All patients had the same length of skin incision and a standard muscle-sparing lateral
      thoracotomy. The latissimus dorsi muscle and the underlying serratus anterior muscle were
      spared and the chest was entered over the top of the unresected and unshingled sixth rib. A
      standard Finocchietto chest retractor was then placed and slowly opened to avoid rib
      fracture. After completion of the appropriate anatomical lung resection, a single 28 F chest
      drainage was systematically placed in pleural cavity. The same chest closure was performed in
      all patients in a standard manner using intracostal sutures.

      Patient was extubated in the operating room and transferred to the surgical ward. The
      postoperative analgesia was performed with intravenous morphine administered through Patient
      Controlled-Analgesia (Automed 3300, AceMedical Co.) delivery. Morphine 1 mg was given for
      each request and continuous infusion was at a rate of 1 mg/h. Both groups had a 10 min
      lockout period and a safe higher limit of 20 mg in 4 hours. If VAS scores exceeded 4/10
      scores, rescue analgesia was intravenously administered according to a standardized
      institutional protocol for pain treatment until the pain was relieved to a level falling
      below a VAS score &lt; 4. Patient Controlled Analgesia (PCA) was continued for up to 2 days,
      until patients could tolerate oral opioid medications and/or anti-inflammatory analgesics.
      However, these medications were not considered in the analysis.

      The intergroup differences were assessed in order to evaluate whether the pre-emptive
      analgesia obtained with Lidocaine patch would have effects on pain scores (primary
      end-point), consumption of analgesics, recovery of respiratory function and peripheral
      painful pathways (secondary end-points).
