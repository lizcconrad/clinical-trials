  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine plasma phytosterols half-lives in preterm infants
      who received intravenous soy oil-based lipid emulsions.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Several studies reported the relationship between plasma phytosterol concentrations and
      parenteral nutrition-associated cholestasis (PNAC). Information on plasma phytosterols
      half-lives in very-low-birth-weight (VLBW) preterm infants on lipid parenteral nutrition (PN)
      are lacking. In a prospective cohort study, plasma phytosterols (campesterol, stigmasterol
      and sitosterol) of VLBW preterm infants on routine PN will be measured by gas
      chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) during PN administration and after only lipid
      stopping. Plasma phytosterols half-lives will be calculated from the monoexponential decay
      curves. Blood samples will be weekly collected from 1st to 7th week of life during routine
      metabolic tolerance analysis or gas-analysis in order to avoid burden of additional
      phlebotomy. Samples will be collected in ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid-tubes and
      immediately centrifugated. Plasma will be stored in pyrogallol added-tubes at -20°C until
      analysis. Saponification reaction will be done using 5-alpha-cholestane as internal standard.

    <measure>Change of plasma phytosterol concentrations in preterm infants during parenteral nutrition and after only lipid stopping.</measure>
    <time_frame>7, 14, 21, 28, 35, 42 and 49 days</time_frame>
    <description>Plasma campesterol, stigmasterol and sitosterol concentrations will be measured at 7, 14, 21, 28, 35, 42 and 49 days from PN started. Plasma phytosterol concentrations will be measured by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Calibration curves will be used to calculate the phytosterol plasma concentrations (mg/L).</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Normal liver function of preterm infants will be define by conjugated bilirubin values from blood samples under 1 mg/dl.</measure>
    <time_frame>7 days and 42 days of life</time_frame>
    <description>Eligibility of preterm infants will be related to a normal liver function. Conjugated bilirubin value from blood sample is a good sign of hepatic function. The threshold value was defined to 1 mg/dl. Preterm infants who will have conjugated bilirubin values more of 1 mg/dl will be excluded from the study. The measure of conjugated bilirubin from blood samples will be routinely done at 7 and 42 days of life.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Plasma phytosterols half-lives</measure>
    <time_frame>After the collection of 3 or more blood samples collected when the lipid infusion is stopped.</time_frame>
    <description>Plasma phytosterol half-lives (days) will be measured using 3 or more plasma phytosterol concentrations calculated after only lipid stopping. Half-life of plasma phytosterols will be calculated from monoexponential decay curves.</description>
