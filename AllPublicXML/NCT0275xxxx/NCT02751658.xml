  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The bacteria live in community and in some cases it is the combination of several
      microorganisms that facilitates transmission and pathogenicity. The concept of pathobiome
      follows from this finding. Investigators hypothesize that the microbial community water point
      is a pathobiome influencing installation and transmission of pathogens associated with care

      Goals :

      Key: To study the impact of bacterial communities on the risk of transmission of waterborne
      pathogenic bacterium Pseudomonas aeruginosa in patients hospitalized from a contaminated
      water source by this bacterium.

      secondary:

        1. Assess the role of communities on installing the water points in P. aeruginosa by
           comparing contaminated and uncontaminated water sources.

        2. To evaluate the effect of the quality of water and the conditions of use of water points
           network on the composition of bacterial communities associated or not with P.
           aeruginosa.

      Experimental Study conducted from 6 points of water, contaminated deliberately experimental
      backs onto the project to assess conventional and alternative measures decontamination
      network and water points

    <time_frame>Entrance hospitalization (Day 1)</time_frame>
    <description>The presence of Pseudomonas aeruginosa will be made from a buccal swab in all patients admitted to the hospital entrance.
Mark of Pseudomonas aeruginosa will be done with and without trypticase soy broth enrichment and isolation on selective agar cetrimide Pseudomonas aeruginosa . The enrichment will detect a port at very low inoculum knowing that the purpose of the analysis is to detect passing of Pseudomonas aeruginosa from the environment to the patient regardless of the associated infectivity. The identification of certainty will be carried out by MALDI-TOF. If several morphotypes are visualized on agar Cetrimide they will all be identified and kept under custody broth at -20 ° C.</description>
