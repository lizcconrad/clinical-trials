      Introduction:

      The pregnancy brings about physiological and hormonal modifications which cause sleep
      disorder. The sleeplessness, snoring and a bad sleepquality are frequent during the
      pregnancy. Also a limited breathing airflow happens very often during the pregnancy. The
      limited airflow causes micro-awakenings that enter in the frame of the high resistances
      airways syndrome. To our knowledge there is no study about the outcome of micro-awakenings at
      pregnant women.

      Objectives:

      To compare the prevalence of the high resistances airways syndrome (RERA) in pregnant woman
      with or without gestational diabetes

      Methods :

      It is a monocentrical prospective study at pregnant women after the 30th amenorrhea week who
      consul the gynecologie and obstetrics department of the CHU NORD in Marseille. We are going
      to compare the breathing disorder during sleep of a control group with a group of women with
      gestational diabetes. A polysomnograph will be run at the included patients' home.

      Expected results :

      The physiological and hormonal modifications during the pregnancy could favor nocturnal sleep
      events (snoring, SAHOS and RERA) and its complications as gravidic HPN And gestational
      diabetes cause maternal and f≈ìtal and morbidity and mortality. We put the hypothesis that
      limited airflow in association with micro-awakenings in the RERA have a negative impact on
      the glucose metabolism and favor the gestational diabetes.
