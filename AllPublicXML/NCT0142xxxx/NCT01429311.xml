  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a chronic skin disorder characterized by recurrent viral skin
      infections. A small subset of patients with AD suffer from disseminated viral infections,
      e.g., eczema herpeticum (ADEH+), after herpes simplex infection (HSV) or eczema vaccinatum
      (EV) after smallpox vaccination. Interferon gamma (IFNγ) plays a critical role in the innate
      and acquired immune responses by activating macrophages, enhancing natural killer cell
      activation, and promoting T cell differentiation, as well as regulating B cell isotype
      switching to immunoglobulin (Ig) G2a. Recent studies have demonstrated that IFNγ generation
      was significantly decreased after stimulation with HSV ex vivo. The purpose of this study is
      to determine if deficient IFNγ induction leads to susceptibility to HSV infection in ADEH+
      patients.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators hypothesize that defective IFNγ responses in peripheral blood mononuclear
      cells (PBMCs) from ADEH+ patients results from aberrant pattern recognition receptors (PRR)
      signaling in antigen-presenting cells (APCs) resulting in low level production of IL-12, an
      essential cytokine for IFNγ generation. This study will compare results from 40 ADEH+, 40
      ADEH-, and 40 non-atopic participants.

      Study procedures will typically be completed in one visit; however, participants may be asked
      to return for additional unscheduled visit(s) occurring as frequently as every 3 months for
      the duration of the study to provide an additional blood sample for further characterization
      of immune mechanisms leading to reduced IFNγ responses in ADEH+.
