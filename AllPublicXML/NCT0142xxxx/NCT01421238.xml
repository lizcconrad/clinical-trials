      The purpose of this study is to study how people make decisions regarding delivery room
      management for infants born extremely premature when survival and long term outcomes are
      uncertain. The hypothesis is that the way in which information is presented will impact
      decisions.

      There have been many advances in neonatal care in recent decades. However, the investigators
      do not know if these children will grow up to be healthy or if they will have problems with
      mental retardation, behavior or physical handicaps. In these circumstances, where the medical
      profession cannot predict what sort of life a child will have, parents have a choice of
      having intensive care started or of allowing the baby to die naturally. The age most often
      cited by physicians at which this care is optional and under parental discretion is 23 weeks
      gestation.

      The purpose of this study was to ask people, recruited through the world wide web, what they
      would want for the doctor to do in the case of a hypothetical 23 week premature delivery in
      order to evaluate the decision process and the presence of autonomous choice. This study had
      two parts. The first part, presented outcome information in 2 different ways -either as
      survival and lack of severe disability or as mortality and presence of severe disability. The
      results of the first part have been published (Message Framing and Perinatal Decisions,
      Pediatrics, 2008). The second part, investigated whether the way in which the way in which
      delivery room management options were presented- either as agreeing with a course of action
      or opting out- impacted resuscitation decisions. This part was administered as a separate
      survey to a different sample of participants at a later date. The remainder of the
      questionnaires asked demographic and opinion questions as a means to assess variables that
      may influence how people respond to the information they receive.

    <description>Participants were randomized to one of two survey groups. In one arm (resuscitation default arm), resuscitation was presented as the course of action that would be followed unless the participant objected. In the other arm (comfort care default arm), comfort care was presented as the course of action that would be followed unless the participant objected.</description>
