  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study will evaluate the
      safety and pharmacokinetics of subcutaneous lebrikizumab in healthy Japanese volunteers.
      Healthy Japanese and Caucasian volunteers will be randomized to receive a single subcutaneous
      dose of either lebrikizumab or placebo.
