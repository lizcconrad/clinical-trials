  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Treatment of keloid disorder is an area of unmet medical need. Current treatments for keloid
      partially address small and localized keloids, yet there are no wholly satisfactory or
      effective treatments for patients with extensive keloids. Such patients may benefit from
      effective systemic treatments.

      Sorafenib has the potential to regulate the three known dysregulated biological pathways in
      keloid tissue.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Dysregulation of several intracellular pathways have been reported by various investigators.

      [A] Dysregulated apoptosis pathway: p53 mutations have been found in both hypertrophic scar
      and keloids fibroblasts from cultured cells to various extents. p53 plays a central role in
      the DNA damage response by inducing cell cycle arrest and/or apoptotic cell death. Time
      course experiments making cell cultures at different times to investigate the phenomenon of
      apoptosis and its involvement in the process of pathological scarring in both hypertrophic
      scars and keloid indicate to dysregulation of apoptotic pathways in Keloid tissue.

      [B]Dysregulated TGF- β signaling: Transforming growth factor- β1 (TGF- β1) is well known as
      the crucial fibrogenic cytokine promoting ECM production and tissue fibrosis in keloid
      forming [9]. TGF- β1 is an essential profibrotic cytokine for collagen synthesis, and it is
      well known to increase mRNA expression of procollagen I. Administration of TGF- β1 resulted
      in a dramatic increase in intracellular collagen I levels in keloid fibroblasts. Due to the
      close relationship between TGF- β signaling and the production of collagen, blocking TGF- β
      signaling has the potential of repressing fibroblast proliferation and collagen synthesis,
      thereby preventing the formation of keloids.

      [C]Dysregulated VEGF signaling pathway: VEGF (Vascular endothelial growth factor), one of the
      most widely studied secreted factors involved in angiogenesis, has been implicated as crucial
      to normal and pathological wound healing [18]. Gira et al. [19] indicated that VEGF
      production is abundant in the underlying dermis of keloids. In vitro studies have indicated
      that VEGF is expressed at higher levels in keloid-derived Fibroblasts than in normal skin
      Fibroblasts.

      Sorafenib is an orally active multikinase inhibitor and has been reported to be an effective
      inhibitor of apoptosis, TGF-β signaling and VEGF pathway signaling, making it an ideal drug
      to test in the setting of extensive keloid disorder.

    <description>Treatment will be administered on an outpatient basis. All patients will keep a drug diary in order to record compliance with their drug regime. Sorafenib will be taken orally.

In absence of Grade 2 toxicity, the dose will be increased on a monthly basis and will stop at 400 mg twice daily.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Clinical Diagnosis of a keloid.

          2. Presence of extensive keloid disease as defined in section 1.3

          3. Age 18 to 50

          4. A signed informed consent document (ICD)

          5. Able and willing to receive sorafenib

          6. Patients must have normal end organ and marrow function

        Women of child-bearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test during screening. The
        effects of sorafenib on the developing human fetus are unknown. For this reason, women of
        child-bearing potential, and men, must agree to use adequate contraception (hormonal or
        barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study entry and for the duration of
        study participation and three months beyond the last dose of sorafenib. Should a woman
        become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while participating in this study, she should
        inform her treating physician immediately.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Diastolic Blood pressure of 90 mm Hg or above

          2. History of any degree of hypertension, even medically controlled hypertension

          3. History of any form of cardiovascular disease or stroke

          4. History of any form of thromboembolic event

          5. History of renal dysfunction or proteinuria,

          6. History of any form of liver dysfunction

          7. History of recent (past 12 month) or planned (next 9 months) major surgery,

          8. Men and women who plan to have children within 3 months of their last treatment

          9. Psychological Illness that may result in non compliance with treatment

         10. Patients receiving any other investigational agents.

         11. Patients with a history of serious allergic reactions to eggs (sorafenib is formulated
             using egg phospholipids).

         12. HIV-positive patients receiving combination anti-retroviral therapy are excluded
             because of possible pharmacokinetic interactions with the investigational agent.

         13. Patients who cannot swallow pills for whatever reason will be excluded.

         14. Patients having any history or current evidence of a bleeding diathesis.

         15. Patients who are taking, or have taken anticoagulants in past 12 months for any
             reason.

         16. Pregnancy and Breast Feeding Pregnant women are excluded from this study because
             sorafenib has the potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects. Because there is
             an unknown but potential risk of adverse events in nursing infants secondary to
             treatment of the mother with sorafenib, breastfeeding is not allowed during the course
             of the study.

        Female patients will be advised not to get pregnant during the first 3 months from last
        administered dose of sorafenib. Men will be advised to continue using barrier method
        contraception and not father a child during the first 3 months from last administered dose
        of sorafenib
