  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      For patients with advanced heart failure, Cardiac Resynchronization Therapy (CRT) has been a
      major improvement. The treatment improves symptoms and prolongs life in selected patients
      with heart failure. However, with the current selection criteria and methods for implanting
      the pacemaker, only 60-70% of the patients derive significant benefit from the treatment.

      New imaging techniques, including advanced ultrasound and computed tomography, in combination
      with new versatile multi-pole electrodes, have made an individually tailored therapy
      possible. Using these techniques in combination, the study will investigate the effect of
      individually based &quot;optimal&quot; placement of the pacemaker electrodes vs. standard care. The
      optimal LV electrode position is defined as pacing a viable segment with the latest
      mechanical delay, targeting a specific segment of the coronary sinus as visualised on cardiac
      CT. The hypothesis is that this will increase the number of positive responders from 65% to
      85%.

    <description>The primary efficacy endpoint will evaluate the effect of echocardiography and cardiac CT guided placement of the left ventricular lead vs standard care (i.e. position of the left ventricular lead at the discretion of the treating physician).
Number of patients with positive response to CRT (YES or NO). A positive response is defined as survival in combination with either a reduction in end systolic left ventricular volume ≥ 15% by echocardiography (&quot;volume responder&quot;) and / or improvement ≥ 1 NYHA class and ≥10% improvement in 6 minute hall walk test (&quot;clinical responder&quot;).</description>
