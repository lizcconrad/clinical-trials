    <textblock>
      This trial intends to gather very basic clinical information about keloid, its patterns of
      presentation, family history, ethnic background and correlation with the type of keloid, as
      well as prior treatment results that patients have had received.

      This will be a web based study, whereby patients will have to read and acknowledge the
      consent form online. Once patients agree and acknowledge the terms of the consent form, they
      will gain access to the questionnaire pages.

      For those who are under age of 18, a parent or a legal guardian must sign the consent form
      and answer the online questions on behalf of the patient.

    <description>Prevalence of different phenotypes of keloid will be measured in the study population and reported. Prevalence of familial keloid in the study population will also be determined and reported. Data will be analyzed to determine the distribution of keloid among different ethic groups. Data will be analyzed to report the percentage of patients who have had one or more treatments and the percentage of patients who have had successful treatments.</description>
