  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Rationale: Food choice is influenced by postprandial mood; the feelings of well-being after a
      meal. Postprandial mood can be measured by subjective responses. Physiological responses may
      play an important role in the generation of postprandial mood. However, the relationship
      between subjective and physiological responses after a meal is not clear yet. To investigate
      this relationship, moderate alcohol consumption will be used as a mood modulator, because of
      its well-studied effects on mood. Postprandial mood depends on the current mood state.
      Therefore the investigators will manipulate the current mood state by changing the ambiance
      to measure the influence of moderate alcohol consumption with a meal on postprandial mood in
      a pleasant or unpleasant ambiance.

      Objective: To determine whether moderate alcohol consumption with a meal in different
      ambiances affects postprandial mood, evaluated by subjective and physiological parameters.

      Study design: Randomized, placebo-controlled, single-blind, cross-over trial

      Study population: 28 apparently healthy, normal weight (BMI 18.5-27 kg/m2) women (18-45 y),
      taking oral contraceptives.

      Intervention: 4 times having dinner at TNO Zeist with either 3 glasses of sparkling white
      wine (~30g alcohol) or alcohol-free sparkling white wine in either a pleasant or unpleasant
      meal ambiance.

      Hypothesis: It is hypothesized that moderate alcohol consumption with a meal in different
      ambiances changes the response of subjective and physiological parameters of mood.

        -  Ho: there is no effect of alcohol consumption and ambiance on mood

        -  H1: there is an effect of alcohol consumption and ambiance on mood
