  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Pharmacokinetic profile of LNG and EE</measure>
    <time_frame>Sampling will occur at 0 hour, 3, 6, 12, 24, 48, 72, 120, 144, 168 hours and after patch removal at 174, 180, 192, 216, 240 hours.</time_frame>
    <description>Pharmacokinetic (PK) sampling will be done after exposure to each anatomic location. PK results will be reported in pg/mL.
Log-transformed PK parameters (AUCs Cmax and Css) will be analyzed with an analysis of variance (ANOVA) model.</description>

    <measure>Safety</measure>
    <time_frame>Adverse Events will be collected from first dose through 30 days post-dosing</time_frame>
    <description>Safety evaluations are based on the number of discontinuations due to Adverse Events, changes in physical and gynecological examination, and treatment-emergent changes in vital signs and body weight.</description>
