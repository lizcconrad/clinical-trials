  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with rotator cuff tendinopathy make up a large part of the population in
      physiotherapy practice. The rotator cuff, a shoulder muscle group, plays an important role in
      causing pain. Tendons suffer large compression and friction, which can lead to degeneration
      of these tendons. Rehabilitation often leads to unsatisfying results.

      In Achilles and patella tendinopathy, a new training program called eccentric training has
      shown very good results. Eccentric training contains exercises during which a force has to be
      resisted while the muscle lengthens instead of shortens. This would have a larger influence
      on tendon tissue. Some small studies also show promising results of eccentric training in
      patients with rotator cuff tendinopathy but the mechanisms behind these results remain
      unclear.

      To investigate this, 30 patients with rotator cuff tendinopathy and 30 healthy subjects will
      be evaluated before and immediately after performing the exercise. Three measurements will be
      done: ultrasonographic measurement of tendon thickness, power Doppler imaging and measurement
      of microcirculation around the tendon with Oxygen to see. All measurements are non-invasive,
      pain free and without risks for the human body.
