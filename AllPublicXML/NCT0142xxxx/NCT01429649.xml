  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      With the advent of CT screening for lung cancer, there is an increase in the detection of
      pulmonary lesions with focal pure ground-glass opacity (pGGO). The pure Ground-glass
      opacities can be caused by normal expiration, partial filling of air spaces, partial collapse
      of alveoli, interstitial thickening, inflammation, oedema, fibrosis, and lepidic
      proliferation of neoplasm. Precise details of the natural history of focal pure GGO are still
      largely unclear. A number of differential diagnoses are possible, including inflammatory
      disease, focal scar, atypical adenomatous hyperplasia (AAH), and adenocarcinoma in situ. Some
      of pGGOs remained stable over a considerable time. A long doubling time for pGGOs is already
      known. Therefore, the strategy of treatment for focal pure GGO lesions is still undecided.
      The major issue is whether or not the doctors should treat these patients at all or wait
      until the first sign of a solid lesion developes which may take many years.

      The purpose of this study is to determine if the ablation therapy is safe and effective for
      the pulmonary pGGO.
