      Specific Aims &amp; Hypothesis Primary Aim: To evaluate laparoscopic bariatric surgery versus
      intensive medical weight management on indices of insulin resistance and resolution of type 2
      diabetes among patients with BMI 30-35.

      Hypothesis: Bariatric surgery is the most effective treatment to induce diabetes remission in
      obese diabetic patients BMI 30-35.

      The primary outcomes will be assessed at 6 months: (1) within-patient change in insulin
      resistance after either bariatric surgery or initiation of intensive medical weight
      management, and (2) remission of diabetes, (i.e., fasting glucose &lt;126mg/dL and glucose
      &lt;200mg/dL two hours after a standard 75g oral glucose load without the use of
      anti-hyperglycemic medications). Insulin resistance will be assessed at randomization and at
      6 months with the homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA IR) based on
      insulin and fasting glucose, as well as oral glucose tolerance tests with
      area-under-the-curve (AUC) measurement for insulin values. Medication discontinuation will be
      derived from electronic health records and patient self-report at 6 months. Secondary
      outcomes will include changes in HBA1c, weight, blood pressure, waist circumference, and
      levels of fasting lipids.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        Patients eligible for study are adults (age â‰¥ 18) with type 2 diabetes who have a BMI
        30-35, and are insured by Metroplus insurance, but otherwise meet NIH Consensus Criteria
        specifically (1) overweight for at least 5 years, (2) failure to lose weight with
        non-surgical means, (3) absence of medical or psychological contraindications, and (4)
        patient understanding of the procedure and its risks, and strong motivation to comply with
        the post-surgical regimen. Patients must have permission from their physician to
        participate in the study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Exclusions include being deemed unable to comply with the study protocol (either
        self-selected or by indicating during screening that s/he could not complete all requested
        tasks), participation in other obesity- or diabetes-related clinical trials, or diagnosis
        of cognitive dysfunction or significant psychiatric comorbidity.
