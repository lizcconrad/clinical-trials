  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The minimally invasive extracorporeal carbon dioxide removal may decrease the respiratory
      load during chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) exacerbation, reducing the need to
      advance the respiratory care toward invasive mechanical ventilation in patients refractory to
      non-invasive ventilatory support (NIV), or decreasing the need of ventilatory support in
      patients already invasively ventilated, thereby accelerating the weaning process.

      The investigators intend to perform a multi-center experimental non randomized single arm
      prospective study to investigate the efficacy of the Decap Smart in reducing the intubation
      rate or the duration of invasive mechanical ventilation in patients with COPD treated either
      with NIV or invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV) for severe respiratory failure and
      hypercapnia. The results of the study will be compared to the data available in the
      literature.

    <description>The application of the extracorporeal carbon dioxide removal will be initiated by using a modified continuous veno-venous hemofiltration system equipped with a membrane lung with a total membrane surface of 1,35 m2 (Decap® Smart).
Femoral vein is accessed via a double lumen catheter (14 F) inserted with the Seldinger technique and connected with the extracorporeal circuit. Blood flow is driven through the circuit by a roller nonocclusive low-flow pump (0- 450 ml/min) through a membrane lung (Euroset) that is connected to a fresh gas flow source delivering 100% oxygen at a constant rate of 8 l/min. Exiting the membrane lung, blood is driven to a hemofilter (Medica D250). The resulting plasmatic water is recirculated through the membrane lung by a peristaltic pump (0-155 ml/min).</description>
