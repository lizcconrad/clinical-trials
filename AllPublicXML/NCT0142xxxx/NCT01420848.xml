      Although researches on stress have a strong focus on stress at work,it is very important the
      evaluation of the stress and its consequences in Nursing students. This allows to understand
      which stress factors experienced in a negative way could interfere on the adaptive success in
      school activities. Students can experience symptoms of the alarm phase of stress such as
      tachycardia, muscle tension, skin and cold extremities, and also the second phase of stress
      such as headache, sleepiness, irritability and difficulty concentrating. High levels of
      stress have a substantial effect on attention and can lead to errors, lack of concentration
      and fluctuations in the level of attention. The auriculotherapy may have an important role as
      a coping strategy for stress and anxiety. It is a fast, relatively simple, easily performed,
      safe and without major side effects.

    <description>The State-Trait Anxiety Inventory consists of 2 scales, each one containing 20 items. One of the scales evaluates state anxiety, characterized by subjective feelings of tension and apprehension, followed by autonomic nervous system responses at a given moment. Trait anxiety, assessed by the other scale, refers to a relatively stable tendency to perceive situations at threatening and react anxiously to them. The scores are divided into low, moderate, high and very high and are determined by the sum of 20 symptoms from a 5-point Likert-type scale.The range of scores is 20-80, the higher the score indicating greater anxiety for both the Trait and State Anxiety.</description>

        <title>Students Anxiety Levels</title>
        <description>The State-Trait Anxiety Inventory consists of 2 scales, each one containing 20 items. One of the scales evaluates state anxiety, characterized by subjective feelings of tension and apprehension, followed by autonomic nervous system responses at a given moment. Trait anxiety, assessed by the other scale, refers to a relatively stable tendency to perceive situations at threatening and react anxiously to them. The scores are divided into low, moderate, high and very high and are determined by the sum of 20 symptoms from a 5-point Likert-type scale.The range of scores is 20-80, the higher the score indicating greater anxiety for both the Trait and State Anxiety.</description>
