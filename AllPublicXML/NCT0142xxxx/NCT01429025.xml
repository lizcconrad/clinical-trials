      RATIONALE: Monoclonal antibodies, such as rituximab, can block cancer growth in different
      ways. Some find cancer cells and help kill them or carry cancer-killing substances to them.
      Others interfere with the ability of cancer cells to grow and spread. Drugs used in
      chemotherapy, such as bendamustine hydrochloride, also work in different ways to kill cancer
      cells or stop them from dividing. Lenalidomide may stop the growth of non-Hodgkin lymphoma by
      blocking blood flow to the cancer. Giving lenalidomide together with rituximab and
      bendamustine hydrochloride may kill more cancer cells.

      PURPOSE: This phase I trial studies the side effects and the best dose of giving lenalidomide
      together with rituximab and bendamustine hydrochloride in treating patients with refractory
      or relapsed indolent non-Hodgkin lymphoma.

    <textblock>
      This is a pilot/feasibility study of bendamustine, rituximab, and lenalidomide combination
      with a goal of assessing maximum tolerated dose, safety and feasibility of this combination.
      Patients receive rituximab IV over 5-8 hours on day 1, bendamustine hydrochloride IV over
      30-60 minutes on days 1-2, and lenalidomide orally (PO) on days 1-10. Treatment repeats every
      28 days for up to 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.
      Ancillary treatment is available per the protocol (eg, supportive care for rituximab
      infusions).

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  To establish the maximum-tolerated dose of lenalidomide in combination with bendamustine
           and rituximab chemotherapy

      Secondary

        -  To evaluate the toxicity profile of lenalidomide in combination with bendamustine and
           rituximab chemotherapy

        -  To assess progression-free survival

        -  To assess the overall and complete response rates of lenalidomide in combination with
           bendamustine and rituximab in patients with relapsed/refractory indolent non-Hodgkin
           lymphoma (NHL)

      Patients may undergo blood sample collection at baseline and periodically during treatment
      for correlative studies. Tumor tissue samples may also be collected.Patients are followed up
      for up to 5 years post-registration.

             be higher if the patient is on the agent for other reasons. If aspirin is
             contraindicated, the patient may be considered for the study after consultation with
             the study chair regarding other alternatives including the possible use of warfarin or
             low molecular weight heparin. Patients unable to take any prophylaxis are not

               -  Pregnant women

               -  Nursing women (lactating females are eligible provided that they agree not to
                  breast feed while taking lenalidomide)

             that requires therapy

          3. Co-morbid systemic illnesses or other severe concurrent disease which, in the judgment
             of the investigator, would make the patient inappropriate for entry into this study or
             interfere significantly with the proper assessment of safety and toxicity of the
             prescribed regimens.

          4. Prior AIDS-defining conditions. Note: HIV positive patients without history of AIDS-
             defining conditions are eligible

               -  Current treatment with zidovudine (AZT) (which may cause overlapping adverse
                  events, primarily myelosuppression). Patients receiving anti-retroviral therapy

               -  Psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study
                  requirements

          6. Receiving any other agent which would be considered as a treatment for the lymphoma.

             Note: Prior use of rituximab is allowed.

          7. Another active malignancy requiring concomitant active therapy such as radiation,
             chemotherapy, or immunotherapy. Exceptions to this are as follows:

               -  Localized non-melanotic skin cancer

               -  Cancers that are inactive that are being treated with hormonal therapy

               -  Any cancer that in the judgment of the investigator will not interfere with the
                  study treatment plan and response assessment and require concomitant anticancer
                  therapy for the duration of this study

             Contact the study chair regarding any questions related to eligibility of patients
             with concomitant active malignancy

             thrombosis/embolism and are not on or unwilling to receive anticoagulation

               -  Patients with history of DVT or life threatening or recurrent thrombosis/embolism
                  (PE) may enter the study but must receive anticoagulation with low molecular
                  weight (LMW) heparin or therapeutic warfarin during the protocol treatment and
                  for ≥6 months afterwards. Patients with strong family history of thrombosis
                  should be considered for thrombophilia work up and/or anticoagulated at the
                  discretion of treating MD.

               -  Patients with a prior history (&gt;6 months prior to study entry) of a non-life
                  threatening, provoked thrombosis (e.g. history of catheter related thrombus or
                  similar) and without known thrombophilia can participate in the study and receive
                  standard prophylaxis with ASA (aspirin) or LMW heparin/warfarin at the discretion
                  of treating MD. Active smokers should be advised on thrombosis risk and smoking
                  cessation and may participate in the study if prophylaxis with ASA (aspirin) or
                  LMW heparin/warfarin (at the discretion of treating MD) is given. Patients on
                  estrogen birth control pills should be advised of the risks.

         10. Known myelodysplastic syndrome

         11. Receiving erythroid stimulating agents (EPO: Procrit, Aranesp). Note: Use of erythroid
             stimulating agents is not allowed during the study treatment.
