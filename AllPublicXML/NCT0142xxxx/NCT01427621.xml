  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pulmonary dysfunction after cardiac surgery with CPB remains to be a problem complicating the
      postoperative course of the patients. The investigators hypothesized that RIPCcom, combined
      intervention of remote ischemic preconditioning and remote ischemic postconditioning, would
      confer beneficial influence on inflammatory response and resultant postoperative pulmonary
      dysfunction after CPB in patients undergoing complex valvular heart surgery who are at
      increased risk of postoperative pulmonary dysfunction.The aim of this study was to evaluate
      the lung-protective effect of combined remote ischemic pre- and post-conditioning in patients
      undergoing complex valvular heart surgery.

    <description>RIPCcom group: combined intervention of remote ischemic pre- and postconditioning consisted of three 10-minute cycles of right lower limb ischemia, which was induced with an automated cuff-inflator placed on the right upper leg and inflated to 250 mmHg, with an intervening 10 minute of reperfusion during which the cuff was deflated. This intervention were performed at 10 minutes after induction of anesthesia and then 10 min after weaning from CPB.</description>
