  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well giving fluocinonide cream works in treating symptoms of
      vaginal dryness and painful sexual intercourse in patients with breast cancer undergoing
      hormone therapy. Fluocinonide cream may prevent or lessen vaginal dryness and painful sexual
      intercourse in patients undergoing hormone therapy.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To estimate the decrease in symptoms of vaginal dryness and dyspareunia with the use of
      fluocinonide 0.05% cream in breast cancer subjects and subjects at increased risk for breast
      cancer on endocrine therapy. Estimates of decrease will be obtained utilizing patient survey
      instruments.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To estimate the decrease in symptoms of vaginal itching and the total vaginal index score
      with the use of fluocinonide 0.05% cream in breast cancer subjects and subjects at increased
      risk for breast cancer on endocrine therapy. Estimates of decrease will be obtained utilizing
      patient survey instruments.

      II. To explore toxicities reported by subjects using fluocinonide 0.05% cream via vaginal
      application.

      III. To explore correlation between subject reported compliance, as well as compliance via
      measurement of the amount of fluocinonide 0.05% cream used, and response rates with the use
      of fluocinonide 0.05% cream.

      IV. To explore the correlations between patient characteristics and response rates with the
      use of fluocinonide 0.05% cream.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients apply topical fluocinonide cream twice daily (BID) in weeks 1-2 and once daily (QD)
      in weeks 3-4.

    <time_frame>Baseline and 4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Change in symptom scores of vaginal dryness, itching, and dyspareunia will be evaluated by the Mayo/North Central Cancer Treatment Group (NCCTG) patient questionnaire which has patients grade how much vaginal dryness, vaginal itching, and vaginal discomfort during intercourse they are currently experiencing on an ordinal scale of zero to four (none, mild, moderate, severe, and very severe, respectively). Analyzed using Wilcoxon signed rank test with 2.5% significance level to account for two co-primary endpoints.
Outcome measures median change in score from baseline to end of study. Scale is explained above for the scoring of symptoms at each time point. The median change (i.e. median difference) can range from -4 to +4; negative values indicate improved symptoms, zero no change, and positive values indicate worsened symptoms.</description>

        <description>Change in symptom scores of vaginal dryness, itching, and dyspareunia will be evaluated by the Mayo/North Central Cancer Treatment Group (NCCTG) patient questionnaire which has patients grade how much vaginal dryness, vaginal itching, and vaginal discomfort during intercourse they are currently experiencing on an ordinal scale of zero to four (none, mild, moderate, severe, and very severe, respectively). Analyzed using Wilcoxon signed rank test with 2.5% significance level to account for two co-primary endpoints.
Outcome measures median change in score from baseline to end of study. Scale is explained above for the scoring of symptoms at each time point. The median change (i.e. median difference) can range from -4 to +4; negative values indicate improved symptoms, zero no change, and positive values indicate worsened symptoms.</description>

        <description>Association of response in symptoms with characteristics of the subject population (Dryness and Age)
Determine if there is an association between response in symptoms of vaginal dryness, itching, and/or dyspareunia with characteristics of the subject population.
Response in symptoms is calculated as change in symptom score from baseline to week 4 (end of study). Change in symptom scores of vaginal dryness, itching, and dyspareunia will be evaluated by the Mayo/North Central Cancer Treatment Group (NCCTG) patient questionnaire which has patients grade how much vaginal dryness, vaginal itching, and vaginal discomfort during intercourse they are currently experiencing on an ordinal scale of zero to four (none, mild, moderate, severe, and very severe, respectively).The median change (i.e. median difference) can range from -4 to +4; negative values indicate improved symptoms, zero no change, and positive values indicate worsened symptoms.</description>

        <title>Change in Vaginal Itching Symptom Scores by Age Characteristics</title>
        <description>Association of response in symptoms with characteristics of the subject population (Itching and Age)
Determine if there is an association between response in symptoms of vaginal dryness, itching, and/or dyspareunia with characteristics of the subject population.
Response in symptoms is calculated as change in symptom score from baseline to week 4 (end of study). Change in symptom scores of vaginal dryness, itching, and dyspareunia will be evaluated by the Mayo/North Central Cancer Treatment Group (NCCTG) patient questionnaire which has patients grade how much vaginal dryness, vaginal itching, and vaginal discomfort during intercourse they are currently experiencing on an ordinal scale of zero to four (none, mild, moderate, severe, and very severe, respectively).The median change (i.e. median difference) can range from -4 to +4; negative values indicate improved symptoms, zero no change, and positive values indicate worsened symptoms.</description>

Change in symptom scores of vaginal dryness, itching, and dyspareunia will be evaluated by the Mayo/North Central Cancer Treatment Group (NCCTG) patient questionnaire which has patients grade how much vaginal dryness, vaginal itching, and vaginal discomfort during intercourse they are currently experiencing on an ordinal scale of zero to four (none, mild, moderate, severe, and very severe, respectively).The median change (i.e. median difference) can range from -4 to +4; negative values indicate improved symptoms, zero no change, and positive values indicate worsened symptoms.</description>

        <description>Association of response in symptoms with characteristics of the subject population (Itching and current endocrine therapy)
Determine if there is an association between response in symptoms of vaginal dryness, itching, and/or dyspareunia with characteristics of the subject population.
Response in symptoms is calculated as change in symptom score from baseline to week 4 (end of study). Change in symptom scores of vaginal dryness, itching, and dyspareunia will be evaluated by the Mayo/North Central Cancer Treatment Group (NCCTG) patient questionnaire which has patients grade how much vaginal dryness, vaginal itching, and vaginal discomfort during intercourse they are currently experiencing on an ordinal scale of zero to four (none, mild, moderate, severe, and very severe, respectively).The median change (i.e. median difference) can range from -4 to +4; negative values indicate improved symptoms, zero no change, and positive values indicate worsened symptoms.</description>

        <description>Association of response in symptoms with characteristics of the subject population (Itching and prior cytotoxic therapy)
Determine if there is an association between response in symptoms of vaginal dryness, itching, and/or dyspareunia with characteristics of the subject population.
Response in symptoms is calculated as change in symptom score from baseline to week 4 (end of study). Change in symptom scores of vaginal dryness, itching, and dyspareunia will be evaluated by the Mayo/North Central Cancer Treatment Group (NCCTG) patient questionnaire which has patients grade how much vaginal dryness, vaginal itching, and vaginal discomfort during intercourse they are currently experiencing on an ordinal scale of zero to four (none, mild, moderate, severe, and very severe, respectively).The median change (i.e. median difference) can range from -4 to +4; negative values indicate improved symptoms, zero no change, and positive values indicate worsened symptoms.</description>

        <description>Association of response in symptoms with tube weight based compliance (Dryness)
Determine if there is an association between response in symptoms of vaginal dryness, itching, and/or dyspareunia with compliance determined by % of tube used by weight.
Response in symptoms is calculated as change in symptom score from baseline to week 4 (end of study). Change in symptom scores of vaginal dryness, itching, and dyspareunia will be evaluated by the Mayo/North Central Cancer Treatment Group (NCCTG) patient questionnaire which has patients grade how much vaginal dryness, vaginal itching, and vaginal discomfort during intercourse they are currently experiencing on an ordinal scale of zero to four (none, mild, moderate, severe, and very severe, respectively).The median change (i.e. median difference) can range from -4 to +4; negative values indicate improved symptoms, zero no change, and positive values indicate worsened symptoms.

        <title>Change in Vaginal Itching Symptom Scores by Tube Weight Based Compliance Characteristics</title>
        <description>Association of response in symptoms with tube weight based compliance (Itching)
Determine if there is an association between response in symptoms of vaginal dryness, itching, and/or dyspareunia with compliance determined by % of tube used by weight.
Response in symptoms is calculated as change in symptom score from baseline to week 4 (end of study). Change in symptom scores of vaginal dryness, itching, and dyspareunia will be evaluated by the Mayo/North Central Cancer Treatment Group (NCCTG) patient questionnaire which has patients grade how much vaginal dryness, vaginal itching, and vaginal discomfort during intercourse they are currently experiencing on an ordinal scale of zero to four (none, mild, moderate, severe, and very severe, respectively).The median change (i.e. median difference) can range from -4 to +4; negative values indicate improved symptoms, zero no change, and positive values indicate worsened symptoms.
Groups are made by % of tube used by weight.</description>
