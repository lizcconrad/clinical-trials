    <textblock>
      Hyponatremia, defined as a serum sodium &lt; 135 mmol/l, in patients without edema has undergone
      significant changes where it is now evident that even mild hyponatremia should be treated
      because of its association with symptoms, especially a fourfold increase in falls over the
      age of 65 years. There is an unresolved controversy over the relative prevalence of the
      syndrome of inappropriate secretion of antidiuretic hormone (SIADH) and cerebral/renal salt
      wasting (C/RSW). Resolution of this diagnostic dilemma becomes urgent because of divergent
      therapeutic goals, to water-restrict in SIADH or to give salt and water supplementation in
      C/RSW. The dilemma is compounded by recent reports of C/RSW occurring in patients without
      cerebral disease, thus adding further confusion in defining the relative prevalence of both
      syndromes. Because of overlapping laboratory and clinical findings in both syndromes, only
      differences in the state of extracellular volume differentiates one syndrome from the other,
      being high normal to increased in SIADH and decreased in C/RSW. The investigators have used
      fractional excretion (FE) of urate to categorize patients with hyponatremia. The increased
      FEurate that is observed in hyponatremic patients with SIADH and C/RSW can be used to
      differentiate both syndromes by correcting the hyponatremia and determining whether FEurate
      normalizes as in SIADH or remains increased in C/RSW. The present studies have been designed
      to determine total body water by deuterium and extracellular water by sodium bromide in
      patients with nonedematous hyponatremia with normal and increased FEurate to differentiate
      more conclusively whether the patient has normal or decreased water volumes. The
      investigators will also correct serum sodium rapidly with judicious administration of
      hypertonic saline over approximately three days and determine whether FEurate normalizes as
      in SIADH or remains increased as in C/RSW. In another group of patients, The investigators
      have data to suggest that those with normal sodium and increased FEurate is consistent with
      C/RSW. The investigators intend to do the same water volume studies to determine whether an
      increased FEurate with normonatremia would have decreased total and extracellular water that
      these patients have C/RSW without the need to correct a prior hyponatremia.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators have demonstrated that a normal FEurate in a nonedematous hyponatremic
      patient is highly consistent with the diagnosis of reset osmostat (RO). Since as much as 36%
      of patients with SIADH have RO, the investigators will evaluate these patients by either
      noting dilute urines in spontaneously excreted urines or after a modified water-loading test.
      The investigators have found that a normal FEurate in a nonedematous hyponatremic patient is
      highly consistent with RO.

      The investigators intend to treat euvolemic patients with hyponatremia with tolvaptan, the V2
      ADH receptor blocker, to determine the effectiveness of this form of therapy in a group of
      patients in whom correction of hyponatremia has been difficult to achieve by usual methods.

      Nonedematous hyponatremic patients with serum sodium &lt; 135 mmol/l will be recruited from
      Winthrop-University Hospital and from our outpatient practice.

      It is anticipated that the present studies will provide valuable information on the relative
      prevalence of SIADH and C/RSW in patients with nonedematous hyponatremia. One possible
      drawback to these studies is our inability to determine total and extracellular water volumes
      in patient who are admitted to the neuro/neurosurgical ICU where the acute illnesses require
      parenteral therapy that will create a nonsteady state situation where total and extracellular
      water volumes cannot be accurately determined. This is an important possible omission because
      volume studies in this population of studies have indicated more that two thirds of patients
      having decreased volumes that were consistent with C/RSW, yet the medical literature states
      that C/RSW is rare. Studies in hyponatremics elsewhere in the hospital should shed important
      light on the methods to differentiate SIADH from C/RSW, data which can assist us in
      differentiating both syndromes in the neuro/neurosurgical ICU, where the investigators intend
      to perform FEurates.

      It is anticipated that volume studies in patients with Alzheimer's disease with normal serum
      sodium and increased FEurate will demonstrated decreased volumes and confirm our earlier
      observations that many of these patients are renal salt wasters. It would be interesting to
      test whether volume repletion with saline will improve them mentally and physically.

    <description>We will attempt to categorize the etiology of nonedematous hyponatremia by the following parameters in decreasing order of importance, total and extracellular water determinations, fractional urate excretion, plasma renin and aldosterone levels, urinary sodium concentration and urine osmolality. We will also determine total and extracellular water in a group suspected of having renal salt wasting by virtue of having increased fractional urate excretion and normal serum sodium concentrations.</description>
