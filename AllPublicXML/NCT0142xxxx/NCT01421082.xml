  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The PneumRx Lung Volume Reduction Coil (LVRC) has been shown to effectively improve quality
      of life, exercise capacity, and static lung volumes, in patients with emphysema. The
      mechanism of action for these effects is believed to be related to the restoration of elastic
      recoil to lung parenchyma that has been damaged by emphysema. The objective of this study is
      to evaluate several physiologic parameters which should provide measures directly related to
      the mechanism of action by which the coils produce these outcomes.
