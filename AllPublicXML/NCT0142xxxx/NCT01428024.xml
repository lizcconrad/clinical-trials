  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to demonstrate the efficacy and safety of two new Restylane Lip
      products, Restylane Lip Volume and Restylane Lip Refresh, and to collect information on the
      injection technique.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Restylane Lip Volume is intended to be used for lip enhancement and Restylane Lip Refresh is
      intended to restore hydrobalance and improve skin structure of the lips (referred to as lip
      rejuvenation in this protocol), respectively. The lidocaine content is designed to reduce the
      subject's pain during treatment. The objectives of this open, multicenter study are to
      evaluate efficacy and safety of the products for the studied indications and to collect
      information on injection techniques used.
