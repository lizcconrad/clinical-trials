    <textblock>
      This phase I trial studies the side effects and the best way to give dasatinib and
      cyclosporine in treating patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) refractory or
      intolerant to imatinib mesylate. Dasatinib may stop the growth of cancer cells by blocking
      some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Cyclosporine may help dasatinib work better by
      making cancer cells more sensitive to the drug. Giving dasatinib together with cyclosporine
      may be an effective treatment for CML.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To define the safety and tolerability of cyclosporine A in combination with dasatinib in
      adults with Bcr-Abl+ chronic myelogenous leukemia in chronic phase, or when used in specified
      patients with accelerated phase CML.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess pharmacokinetic parameters of dasatinib when combined with cyclosporine.

      II. To assess whether the combination of dasatinib and cyclosporine alters T cell number and
      function.

      III. To assess the feasibility of determining phosphorylation of Src in peripheral blood
      mononuclear cells by flow cytometry as a surrogate measure of dasatinib activity.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive dasatinib orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-28 and cyclosporine PO twice
      daily (BID) on days 8-28. Treatment repeats every 28 days for 4 months in the absence of
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients undergo peripheral blood sample collection at baseline and periodically during
      treatment for pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic studies and T-cell number and function by
      flow cytometry.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 4 weeks.

                  should occur prior to enrollment in this trial

               -  OR chronic phase Ph+ CML, without complete molecular remission after 3 months of
                  treatment with imatinib, nilotinib or dasatinib

               -  OR accelerated phase Ph+ CML, for which allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell
                  transplantation is being planned, and for which no cytotoxic chemotherapy is

                  a minimum of one month prior to transplantation

               -  OR accelerated phase Ph+ CML, for which allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell
                  transplantation is not a therapeutic option (due to age or lack of acceptable

             of imatinib insensitive mutations, or 1 log increase in BCR-ABL transcript level from
             best molecular response documented on 2 samples at least one month apart (Baccarani et
             al., 2009)

          -  Intolerance of TKI therapy shall be defined by non-hematologic toxic effects of any
             grade leading to intermittent or chronic non-compliance with, repeated dose reduction
             or delays in continuous dosing, or discontinuation of Imatinib

          -  Accelerated phase CML shall be defined as the presence of &gt;= 15-29% blasts, &gt;= 20%

             (Kantarjian et al., 1993)

          -  Prior Therapy

               -  Patients must have discontinued imatinib, nilotinib or dasatinib at least 7 days
                  prior to starting study therapy; this washout period may be omitted at the
                  discretion of the PIs, if it is determined that the washout may adversely affect
                  patient care

               -  Patients must discontinue hydroxyurea or interferon at least 7 days prior to
                  starting study therapy

          -  Life expectancy of greater than 1 month

          -  ECOG performance status =&lt; 2 (Karnofsky &gt;= 60%)

          -  Leukocytes &gt;= 3,000/mcL

          -  Absolute neutrophil count &gt;= 1,000/mcL

          -  Absolute CD4+ count &gt;= 350/mcL

          -  Creatinine within normal institutional limits OR creatinine clearance &gt;= 60
             mL/min/1.73 m^2 for patients with creatinine levels above institutional normal

          -  The effects of dasatinib on the developing human fetus are unknown; for this reason
             and because PTK inhibitors are known to be teratogenic, women of childbearing
             potential must have a negative pregnancy test within 7 days of study entry; women of
             child-bearing potential and men must agree to use adequate contraception (hormonal or
             barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study entry and for the duration
             of study participation and for a minimum of 30 days following discontinuation of study
             therapy; should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while she or her
             partner is participating in this study, she should inform her treating physician
             immediately; lactating women must agree not to nurse a child while on this trial or
             within 30 days of discontinuation of study therapy

          -  Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Chemotherapy or radiotherapy within 4 weeks (6 weeks for nitrosoureas or mitomycin C)
             prior to entering the study or failure to recover from adverse events (except
             alopecia) to Grade =&lt; 1 or to baseline (if there is persistent, chronic, stable Grade
             2), due to agents administered more than 4 weeks earlier

          -  Patients may not be receiving any other investigational agents

          -  Known brain metastases exclude patients from this clinical trial because such patients
             have a poor prognosis and because they often develop progressive neurologic
             dysfunction that would confound the evaluation of neurologic and other adverse events;
             in addition, patients who have active brain metastases may benefit from other
             concurrent therapy such as radiation or radiosurgery, and should be considered for the
             most appropriate clinical therapy that may provide symptom relief

          -  History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic
             composition to dasatinib or cyclosporine

          -  Patients who require concurrent treatment with any medications or substances that are
             potent inhibitors or inducers of CYP3A4 are ineligible; efforts should be made to
             switch patients with a seizure disorder who are taking enzyme-inducing anticonvulsant
             agents to other medications

          -  Patients who require concurrent treatment with proarrhythmic potential

          -  QTc prolongation (defined as a QTc interval &gt;= 480 msec) or other significant ECG
             abnormalities

          -  Use of antithrombotic and/or anti-platelet agents (e.g., warfarin, heparin, low
             molecular weight heparin, aspirin, and/or ibuprofen); exception: patients with CML who
             have significantly elevated platelet counts taking anagrelide are eligible; patients
             who require &lt; 2 mg of warfarin per day for central venous catheter prophylaxis are
             allowed on this study

          -  Patients with any condition (e.g., gastrointestinal tract disease resulting in an
             inability to take oral medication or a requirement for IV alimentation, prior surgical
             procedures affecting absorption, or active peptic ulcer disease) that impairs their
             ability to swallow and retain dasatinib tablets are excluded; tablets may not be
             crushed prior to administration

          -  Patients may not have any clinically significant cardiovascular disease, defined as
             NYHA class III or higher and as follows:

               -  Myocardial infarction or ventricular tachyarrhythmia within 6 months

               -  Prolonged QTc &gt;= 480 msec (Fridericia correction)

               -  Ejection fraction less than institutional normal

               -  Major conduction abnormality (unless a cardiac pacemaker is present)

          -  Patients with any cardiopulmonary symptoms of unknown cause (e.g. shortness of breath,
             chest pain, etc.) should be evaluated by a baseline echocardiogram with or without
             stress test as needed in addition to electrocardiogram (EKG) to rule out QTc
             prolongation; the patient may be referred to a cardiologist at the discretion of the
             principal investigator; patients with underlying cardiopulmonary dysfunction should be
             excluded from the study

          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, the following:
             ongoing or active infection; history of significant bleeding disorder, including
             congenital (von Willebrand's disease) or acquired (anti-factor VIII antibodies)
             disorders; large pleural effusions; or psychiatric illness/social situations that
             would limit compliance with study requirements

          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study because animal studies with dasatinib have
             shown embryolethality and fetal skeletal alterations at non-toxic maternal doses;
             because there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing human
             infants secondary to treatment of the mother with dasatinib, breastfeeding should be
             discontinued if the mother is treated with dasatinib

          -  HIV-positive patients on combination antiretroviral therapy are ineligible because of
             the potential for pharmacokinetic interactions with dasatinib; in addition, these
             patients are at increased risk of lethal infections when treated with
             marrow-suppressive therapy; appropriate studies will be undertaken in patients
             receiving combination antiretroviral therapy when indicated

          -  Known congenital or acquired immunodeficiency

          -  CD4+ count less than 350/µl

          -  Mutation in Bcr-Abl known to confer resistance to dasatinib; (N.B. patients for whom
             Bcr-Abl mutations have not been assessed, will have this assessment in screening; they
             will be allowed to enroll and initiate therapy; if screening analysis reveals Bcr-Abl
             mutation known to confer resistance to dasatinib, the patient will be discontinued
             from study participation)

          -  Prior hematopoietic stem cell transplantation
