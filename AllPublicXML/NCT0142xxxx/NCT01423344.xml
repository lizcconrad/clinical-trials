  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background: in patients with multiple myeloma there is a raised level of a protein, named
      M-protein. This M-protein is normally used to monitor disease status and evaluate response to
      treatment, as a decrease in M-protein is taken as evidence of therapeutic efficacy. However,
      the M-protein has a long half life in serum, approximately three weeks, which tend to be a
      practical problem, since the investigators can first determine hereafter if the treatment is
      effective.

      A new assay has the possibility only to measure part of this protein, namely &quot;the light
      chains&quot;, which also is measured in a blood sample. The half life of these light chains is
      much shorter, namely 2-6 hours. In theory, this means a more rapid measure of the effect of a
      given treatment, thereby being able to determine earlier if the treatment should continue or
      changed to another strategy.

      Purpose: the purpose of this study is to evaluate the clinical value of the use of the serum
      free light chain (sFLC) assay in comparison to the M-protein in monitoring patients under
      treatment for multiple myeloma.

      Method: the investigators measure sFLC in patients receiving there 1st treatment, either at
      the time of diagnosis or in the relapse setting. sFLC is measured on a regular basis, and the
      results are compared to the M-protein.
