    <textblock>
      The purpose of this prospective exploratory study is to compare sleep quality and sleep-wake
      patterns in parents of children with type 1 diabetes (T1D) before and several weeks after
      initiating using real-time continuous glucose monitoring (RT-CGM) of their children.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Few weeks before scheduled initiation of RT-CGM use of a child with T1D, the 'dominant
      parent' (the main caregiver during the nighttime in the family) will obtain an informed
      consent. This will be done during a routine visit in the diabetes clinic. The participants
      will complete a sleep quality questionnaire (PSQI) and instructions on care of the actigraph
      and how to keep complete the daily sleep diary will be given. The participants will be
      instructed to wear the actigraph for 7 consequences nights. Four to eight weeks after
      initiation of RT-CGM use, the 'dominant parent' will be asked to wear the actigraph for 7
      consequences nights and to complete the sleep quality questionnaire and the daily sleep
      diary.
