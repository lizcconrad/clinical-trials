      The purpose of this study is to see if pralatrexate extends response and survival following
      CHOP-based chemotherapy (CHOP: cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone)
      and if pralatrexate improves response in patients with partial response following CHOP-based
      chemotherapy. Patients will either receive pralatrexate or be under observation. All patients
      will receive vitamins B12 and folic acid and attend regular clinic visits to evaluate their
      disease and health.
