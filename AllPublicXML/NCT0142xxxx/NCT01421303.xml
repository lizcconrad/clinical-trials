        <title>Work Productivity and Activity Impairment Questionnaire – Ankylosing Spondylitis (WPAI-AS) Scale Scores at Baseline</title>
        <description>WPAI-AS is 6-question participant rated questionnaire to determine the amount of absenteeism, presenteeism, work productivity loss and daily activity impairment attributable to ankylosing spondylitis for a period of 7 days prior to each visit. It yields 4 sub-scores: work time missed (absenteeism), impairment while working (presenteeism or reduced on-the-job effectiveness), overall work impairment (work productivity loss or absenteeism plus presenteeism) and activity impairment (daily activity impairment). These sub-scores are transformed to impairment percentages (range from 0 to 100), with higher numbers indicating greater impairment and less productivity.</description>

It yields 4 sub-scores: work time missed (absenteeism), impairment while working (presenteeism or reduced on-the-job effectiveness), overall work impairment (work productivity loss or absenteeism plus presenteeism) and activity impairment (daily activity impairment). These sub-scores are transformed to impairment percentages (range from 0 to 100), with higher numbers indicating greater impairment and less productivity.</description>
          <population>FAS consisted of all participants enrolled in the study, who were seen at baseline, started the treatment with etanercept and had at least 1 visit during follow-up. Here 'n' signifies those participants who were evaluable for the given sub-scale items at Month 12.</population>

        <title>Correlation Between Work Productivity and Activity Impairment Questionnaire – Ankylosing Spondylitis (WPAI-AS) Scale Scores and Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Index (BASDAI) Total Score at Baseline</title>
        <description>WPAI-AS: 6-question participant rated questionnaire to determine amount of absenteeism, presenteeism, work productivity loss, daily activity impairment attributable to AS for a period of 7 days prior to each visit. It yields 4 sub-scores: work time missed (absenteeism), impairment while working (presenteeism), overall work impairment (work productivity), activity impairment (daily activity impairment). These sub-scores are transformed to impairment percentages (range from 0 to 100), with higher numbers indicating greater impairment and less productivity. BASDAI: validated self-assessment tool to determine disease activity in participants with AS. Utilizing a scale of 0-10 (0=none and 10=very severe), participants answered 6 questions measuring discomfort, pain, fatigue. The BASDAI total score averages the individual assessments and ranges from 0-10 (0=none, 10=very severe). Correlation coefficient between WPAI-AS and BASDAI score at baseline was reported.</description>

          <title>Correlation Between Work Productivity and Activity Impairment Questionnaire – Ankylosing Spondylitis (WPAI-AS) Scale Scores and Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Functional Index (BASFI) Total Score at Month 6 and 24</title>
          <description>WPAI-AS:6-question participant rated questionnaire to determine amount of absenteeism, presenteeism, work productivity loss, daily activity impairment due to AS for a period of 7 days prior to each visit. It yields 4 sub-scores: work time missed(absenteeism), impairment while working(presenteeism), overall work impairment(work productivity), activity impairment(daily activity impairment). These sub-scores are transformed to impairment percentages(range 0 to 100), with higher numbers indicating greater impairment, less productivity. BASFI:validated self-assessment tool to determine degree of functional limitation in AS. Utilizing a scale of 0-10(0=easy, 10=impossible),participants answered 10 questions assessing ability in completing normal daily activities/physically demanding activities. BASFI total score=mean score of 10 questions (range: 0 to 10, higher score=more severity). Correlation coefficient between change from baseline in WPAI-AS and BASFI score at Month 6, 24 was reported.</description>

These sub-scores are transformed to impairment percentages(range 0 to 100), with higher numbers indicating greater impairment, less productivity. BASMI is an objective measure of spinal mobility. The BASMI score is composed of 5 measures: cervical rotation, intermalleolar distance, modified Schober's test, lateral flexion and tragus to wall distance. Final score ranges from 0 to 10: the higher the BASMI score, the more severe the participant’s limitation of movement due to their AS.

        <description>WPAI-AS:6-question participant rated questionnaire to determine amount of absenteeism, presenteeism, work productivity loss, daily activity impairment due to AS for a period of 7 days prior to each visit. It yields 4 sub-scores: work time missed(absenteeism), impairment while working(presenteeism), overall work impairment(work productivity), activity impairment(daily activity impairment). These sub-scores are transformed to impairment percentages(range 0 to 100), with higher numbers indicating greater impairment, less productivity. BAS-G is used to indicate the effect of disease on participant's well-being. This scale is composed of 2 items ranging from 0 = very good to 10 =very bad. Total score ranges from 0 to 10: the higher the BAS-G score, the worse the participant’s health status. Correlation coefficient between WPAI-AS and BAS-G score at baseline was reported.</description>

        <description>WPAI-AS:6-question participant rated questionnaire to determine amount of absenteeism, presenteeism, work productivity loss, daily activity impairment due to AS during 7 days prior to each visit. It yields 4 sub-scores: work time missed(absenteeism), impairment while working(presenteeism), overall work impairment(work productivity), activity impairment(daily activity impairment). These sub-scores are transformed to impairment percentages(range 0 to 100), with higher numbers=greater impairment, less productivity. EQ-5D:participant rated questionnaire to assess health-related quality of life in terms of single utility score. Health state profile component assesses level of current health for 5 domains: mobility,self-care,usual activities,pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression; Scale range 1 to 3 (1=better health state [no problems], 3=worst health state [confined to bed]).

          <description>WPAI-AS:6-question participant rated questionnaire to determine amount of absenteeism, presenteeism, work productivity loss, daily activity impairment due to AS during 7 days prior to each visit. It yields 4 sub-scores: work time missed(absenteeism), impairment while working(presenteeism), overall work impairment(work productivity), activity impairment(daily activity impairment). These sub-scores are transformed to impairment percentages(range 0 to 100), with higher numbers=greater impairment, less productivity. EQ-5D:participant rated questionnaire to assess health-related quality of life in terms of single utility score. Health state profile component assesses level of current health for 5 domains: mobility,self-care,usual activities,pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression; Scale range 1 to 3 (1=better health state [no problems], 3=worst health state [confined to bed]). Correlation coefficient between WPAI-AS and EQ-5D total score at baseline was reported.</description>
