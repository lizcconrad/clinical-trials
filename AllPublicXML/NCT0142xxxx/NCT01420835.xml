      The purpose of this study is to assess stress levels and quality of life in the nursing team
      of Samaritan Hospital and evaluate the effectiveness of Chinese auriculotherapy used with and
      without closed protocol on reducing the stress levels and improvement of life quality.

    <textblock>
      Based on the positive results achieved in a preliminary study conducted in January and
      February 2010, entitled &quot;Applicability of auricular needles or seeds for the reduction of
      stress in nursing professionals&quot; at the University Hospital, emerged from this research
      project in order to extend the first study, with a more representative sample and with a
      design that would allow further discussions on the effectiveness of Chinese auricular needles
      semi-permanent to reduce stress and thereby improving the quality of life of nursing
      professionals. This clinical trial aims, above all, compare the results of the technique with
      the use of closed protocol and a group without protocol. The latter, however, shall be based
      on energy evaluation according to Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) and the course of
      treatment will be performed similarly to the clinical practice commonly performed by
      traditional practitioners, that is, individually, not necessarily repetitive and whose
      continuation is achieved depending on the answers to each treatment.

      Discussions are justified about protocol and no protocol research in complementary and
      integrative practices, since the methodologies proposed and accepted by the scientific
      community does not always seem to be appropriate tools for evaluating therapies like those
      coming from the East. The transfer of the Western conception of research according to
      positivist principles are not always consistent with the principles underlying the
      complementary and alternative therapies, and in particular the practice from China.
