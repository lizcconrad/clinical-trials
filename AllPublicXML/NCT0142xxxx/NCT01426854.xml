      The purpose of this study was to demonstrate that Nepafenac Ophthalmic Suspension, 0.1% is
      superior to Nepafenac Vehicle (placebo) for the prevention and treatment of ocular
      inflammation and pain associated with cataract surgery in Chinese subjects.

    <measure>Proportion of Subjects With Clinical Cure at Day 14</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 14 postoperative</time_frame>
    <description>Ocular inflammation was assessed by the Investigator during slit lamp examination. Aqueous cells were scored on a 5-unit scale from 0 (none) to 4 (&gt;30 cells), and aqueous flare (protein escaping from dilated vessels) was scored on a 4-unit scale from 0 (no visible flare when compared with the normal eye) to 3 (severe - very dense flare). To be considered cured, the patient must have had a score of 0 for both aqueous cells and aqueous flare. The proportion of subjects with a clinical cure is reported as percentage.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Proportion of Subjects Who Were Pain-Free at All Postoperative Visits</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to Day 14</time_frame>
    <description>Ocular pain is defined as a positive sensation of the eye, including foreign body sensation, stabbing, throbbing, or aching. The Investigator scored ocular pain based on the description of pain by the subject. Pain was scored on a 6-unit scale ranging from 0 (none, absence of positive sensation) to 5 (severe, subject reports intense ocular, periocular or radiating pain requiring prescription analgesic). To be considered pain-free at all post operative visits, the patient must have had a score of 0 at Days 1, 3, 7, and 14 and any unscheduled visit. The proportion of subjects who were pain-free at all post-operative visits is reported as percentage.</description>

        <title>Proportion of Subjects With Clinical Cure at Day 14</title>
        <description>Ocular inflammation was assessed by the Investigator during slit lamp examination. Aqueous cells were scored on a 5-unit scale from 0 (none) to 4 (&gt;30 cells), and aqueous flare (protein escaping from dilated vessels) was scored on a 4-unit scale from 0 (no visible flare when compared with the normal eye) to 3 (severe - very dense flare). To be considered cured, the patient must have had a score of 0 for both aqueous cells and aqueous flare. The proportion of subjects with a clinical cure is reported as percentage.</description>

        <title>Proportion of Subjects Who Were Pain-Free at All Postoperative Visits</title>
        <description>Ocular pain is defined as a positive sensation of the eye, including foreign body sensation, stabbing, throbbing, or aching. The Investigator scored ocular pain based on the description of pain by the subject. Pain was scored on a 6-unit scale ranging from 0 (none, absence of positive sensation) to 5 (severe, subject reports intense ocular, periocular or radiating pain requiring prescription analgesic). To be considered pain-free at all post operative visits, the patient must have had a score of 0 at Days 1, 3, 7, and 14 and any unscheduled visit. The proportion of subjects who were pain-free at all post-operative visits is reported as percentage.</description>
