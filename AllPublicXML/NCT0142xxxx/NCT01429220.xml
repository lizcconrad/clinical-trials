  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the utility of a portable motion sensor-based system
      designed to assist with deep brain stimulation (DBS) programming sessions for Parkinson's
      disease patients.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Hoehn and Yahr stage 2 or worse when off medications

          -  Average tremor and/or bradykinesia Unified Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) score greater
             than 2 off meds

          -  L-dopa responsive with clearly defined &quot;on&quot; periods, UPDRS motor III average tremor
             and bradykinesia improves by 25%

          -  Stable on medical therapy for at least one month prior to study enrollment

          -  Clinical approval to undergo unilateral DBS surgery targeting the STN or GPi

          -  Available to participate for six months following DBS surgery

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  &quot;Parkinson's plus&quot; syndromes, secondary, or atypical Parkinson's syndromes (e.g.
             progressive supranuclear palsy, striato-nigral degeneration, multiple system atrophy,
             post-stroke, post-traumatic, or post-encephalitic Parkinson's. These patients have
             cardinal symptoms characteristic of PD but with additional symptoms indicating other
             organic brain dysfunction, such as gaze palsies, autonomic dysfunction, lack of
             response to L-dopa, these individuals tend not to improve with standard treatments for
             PD)

          -  previous Parkinson's Disease surgery

          -  medical contraindications to surgery or stimulation (e.g. uncontrolled hypertension,
             advanced coronary artery disease, other implanted stimulation or
             electronically-controlled devices including cardiac demand pacemaker, aneurysm clips,
             cochlear implants, or a spinal cord stimulator) (Note: for the subject who receives
             either a pacemaker and/or defibrillator after this study enrollment, he/she will be
             allowed to continue the study if the neurostimulator system can be adequately
             programmed to permit system compatibility)

          -  contraindication to magnetic resonance imaging (e.g. indwelling metal fragments or
             implants that might be affected by MRI)

          -  neuropsychological dysfunction (e.g. dementia) that would contraindicate surgery

          -  intracranial abnormalities that would contraindicate surgery (e.g. stroke, tumor,
             vascular abnormality affecting the target area)
