  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      1. Background: In recent years an increasing trend in excessive lengths of stay has been
           recorded at the Parma University Hospital, compared with regional mean values. Excessive
           lengths of stay have been demonstrated to constitute not just an economic problem, but
           also a clinical and public health issue. Since the measures taken at our institution so
           far have not proven effective, the investigators carried out a literature review, which
           mostly detected observational studies, restricted to the assessment of the impact of a
           single intervention.

        2. Objectives: This project intends to evaluate the effectiveness of a multifaceted
           strategy aiming to empower clinicians on the issues associated with excessively long and
           avoidable hospital stays, and enable them to identify corrective measures (according to
           the principles of clinical governance).

        3. Study design: cluster-randomized, parallel group, open-label, community trial

        4. Methods: trained personnel will periodically record causes for excessive lengths of stay
           in all participating wards using an ad hoc data collection sheet. In the wards
           randomized to the experimental group, interventions aimed to clinician empowerment -
           provision of reminders and periodical audits - will be implemented.

        5. Expected results: A reduction in the experimental vs. the control arm unnecessary
           lengths of stay is expected, although the introduced measures will also presumably lead
           to improvement in the wards where they are not implemented.

    <description>The strategy comprises two integrated components:
Distribution of two monthly reports, one consisting in the list of patients who, through data collection performed, are classified to be present on the ward although their clinical status is considered compatible with discharge; the other featuring individual length of stay profiles for each physician operating in the intervention arm (information taken from administrative data), allowing comparisons with the rest of the medical staff;
Audits performed by professionals of each ward of the intervention arm designed to discuss cases judged to be compatible with discharge. The organization of this work are left to the wards, without any interference from the project team.</description>
