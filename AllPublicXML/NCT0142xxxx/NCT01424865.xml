      RATIONALE: Studying samples of tissue from patients with cancer in the laboratory may help
      doctors learn more about changes that occur in DNA and identify biomarkers related to cancer.

      PURPOSE: This research trial studies biomarkers as a predictor of response to trastuzumab in
      samples from patients with breast cancer previously treated in the NSABP-B-31 trial.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  To determine if stem cellness identifies a poor prognostic subgroup of women with
           early-stage breast cancer who have been uniformly treated with either adjuvant
           doxorubicin hydrochloride &amp; cyclophosphamide followed by paclitaxel (the &quot;control arm&quot;
           of B31), or the same chemotherapy plus trastuzumab.

      Secondary

        -  To conduct exploratory analyses to assess, to the extent possible, if co-localization of
           stem cellness, as determined by ALDH1 positivity, and HER2 identifies a group of
           patients previously considered to have HER2-negative cancers (using classical
           definitions) who benefit from adjuvant trastuzumab.

      OUTLINE: Archived breast cancer stem cells samples and terminally differentiated cells from
      tissue samples are analyzed for HER2 and ALDH1 expression by dual-staining quantitative
      immunofluorescence using Automated Quantitative Analysis (AQUA) , IHC, and fluorescence in
      situ hybridization (FISH).
