  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Haemophilus influenzae is an important pathogen which can cause primary infection and
      respiratory viral infection in infants and leaded to secondary infections. The infection of
      haemophilus is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in infants and children. At present,
      the developed conjugant Hib vaccine is proved to be safe and effective. Because Hib vaccine
      can prevent meningitis, pneumonia, epiglottis inflammation and other serious infection caused
      by Hib bacteria, the WHO suggested that Hib vaccine should be included in the infant's normal
      immune programming.

      Since the use of meningitis aureus polysaccharide vaccine, incidence of a disease in recent
      years is declined and maintain to the level of 0.5 per 1/100 thousand. But meningitis aureus
      polysaccharide vaccine with a relatively poor immune response in the infants under the age of
      two, and the remaining 60% with a low antibody level and a short duration.

      According to the present immunization schedule, to reach the median level of antibody levels
      there are at least 4 doses in need. So it is meaningful to improving vaccine immunogenicity,
      to provide high levels of long-term protection and to reduce the number of injections.

      After the phase I study which was conducted in August, 2011, the safety profile of this
      vaccine is proved to be acceptable. The phase III study is aimed to further evaluate the
      safety and the immunization of the vaccine. The objective of this study is to evaluate the
      safety of the group A, C polysaccharide meningococcal and type b haemophilus influenzal
      conjugate vaccine.
