  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The immune system of a patient can attack the liver or the kidney received from a donor
      (organ rejection). This can be prevented by treating these patients long-life with
      immunosuppressive drugs. Unfortunately, these drugs lead to numerous side effects and fail to
      prevent the rejection occurring months later after the transplantation (chronic rejection).
      Recently, it has been shown that a particular type of cells present in the bone marrow,
      namely Mesenchymal Stem Cells (MSC), when injected to a patient, suppress its immune system
      and increase success rates of blood cells transplantation. This outcome opens doors to
      investigate the potential of these cells to provide a valuable tool for improving solid organ
      transplantation without the need of high concentration of immunosuppressive drugs. The
      present project aims at evaluating the safety and tolerability of MSC administration after
      liver or kidney transplantation.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The present project aims at evaluating the safety and tolerability of third party MSC
      administration after liver or kidney organ transplantation. Ten patients undergoing liver
      transplantation and 10 patients undergoing kidney transplantation will be included in the
      experimental arm to receive a single infusion of MSC. The outcome of each of these 2
      subgroups will be compared with that of similar control patients undergoing liver or kidney
      transplantation but who will not receive MSC.

      Liver and kidney transplanted patients will receive standard immunosuppressive therapy,
      TAC-MMF-steroïds and TAC-MMF-steroïds plus an IL-2-R antibody respectively. Patients enrolled
      in the experimental arms will be infused with a single dose of 1,5-3,0 10E6 MSC/kg, 3(+/-2)
      days after the transplantation.

      Weaning of immunosuppression will be attempted from month 6 in liver transplant patients who
      did not present a rejection episode and show normal graft function and graft biopsy.

      Kidney transplant patients will continue standard immunosuppressive therapy indefinitely.

      Male or female (&gt;18 years) individuals unrelated to the recipient or the graft donor will be
      MSC donors. MSC donors need to fulfill generally accepted criteria for allogeneic HSC
      donation.
