  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This randomized, open-label, multicenter study will evaluate the efficacy and safety of
      navitoclax in addition to bendamustine and rituximab in patients with relapsed diffuse large
      B-cell lymphoma. Patients will be randomized to receive navitoclax in addition to
      bendamustine and rituximab or bendamustine and rituximab alone for 6 cycles.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Histologically documented diagnosis of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma

          -  Patients must have relapsed or developed progressive disease following salvage
             therapy, or must have relapsed or progressed following initial therapy and in the
             opinion of the investigator are medically unfit to receive high dose chemotherapy with
             autologous stem cell transplant (SCT) or other salvage therapy of higher priority

          -  Eastern cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status 0, 1 or 2

          -  Patients who have undergone STC must be more than 100 days from autologous stem cell
             infusion prior to first dose of study drug, must have recovered from any transplant
             related toxicity and must have adequate bone marrow function as defined by protocol
             independent of any growth factor support

          -  Patients who have not undergone SCT must have adequate bone marrow function as defined
             by protocol independent of any growth factor support

          -  Adequate coagulation, renal and hepatic function

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Refractory DLBCL

          -  History of other malignancies within 2 years prior to initiation of study treatment

             skin carcinoma, low-grade localized prostate cancer treated surgically with curative
             intent or one that carries a good prognosis, in situ ductal carcinoma of the breast
             treated with lumpectomy (with and without radiation) with curative intent

          -  Active infection requiring parenteral antibiotics or antiviral or antifungal agents

          -  Inherited or acquired bleeding diathesis, anticoagulant drugs or drugs that inhibit
             platelet function, underlying conditions that predisposes to abnormal bleeding, or
             refractoriness to platelet transfusions

          -  Clinically significant cardiovascular disease, New York Heart Association Grade II or
             greater congestive heart failure, or ventricular tachyarrhythmias requiring medication
