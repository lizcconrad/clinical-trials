  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to find out more about darbepoetin alfa in children less than 1
      year of age with anemia (a decrease in red blood cells) due to kidney failure. This study
      will see if darbepoetin alfa is safe and well tolerated and whether it causes any side
      effects by taking blood samples and checking vital signs (heart rate, body temperature, and
      blood pressure tests) at specific times throughout the study. In addition, the study will
      evaluate the amount of darbepoetin alfa in the blood over time and look at special markers in
      the blood to evaluate how darbepoetin alfa works on anemia.

      Darbepoetin alfa is approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and
      European Medicines Agency (EMA) for use in adults, but not for all ages of pediatric
      subjects. Therefore, studies need to be conducted in pediatric subjects (children) to
      determine the appropriate dose to use in younger children.
