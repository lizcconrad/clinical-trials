  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In moderate to high risk patients, cardiovascular complications after surgery account for
      almost 60% of death after surgery. This study will randomize 140 patients into routine postop
      care with Holter monitoring versus routine postop care + remote ST monitoring + Holter
      monitoring. The response time to electrocardiographic (ECG) ST changes as well as the total
      ischemia time will be studied.

      This proposal aims to improve the process and quality of care in the postoperative period by
      early detection of ischemia and prompt use of accepted therapies in order to prevent
      postoperative myocardial infarctions (PMI) in patients undergoing non-cardiac surgery.
      Specifically, it aims to validate the safety and efficacy of wireless remote real-time ECG
      ST-monitoring in the reduction of the incidence of PMI. It extends two pilot feasibility
      studies into the postoperative period using wireless remote ST-monitoring for early detection
      of myocardial ischemia followed by preventative strategies. It is anticipated that this
      research will improve postoperative care by adopting generalizable and practical strategies.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Age ≥ 55 years, undergoing non-cardiac surgery with an expected LOS ≥ 2 days, who
             fulfills at least one of the six criteria for increased risk:

               1. History of CAD as defined by any of the following 6 criteria i. history of angina
                  ii. prior myocardial infarction iii. prior positive exercise stress test iv.
                  prior documentation of cardiac ischemia on nuclear stress testing v. prior
                  coronary artery arteriographic evidence of atherosclerotic stenosis &gt; 50% of
                  vessel diameter vi. ECG with pathological Q waves in two contiguous leads

               2. PVD as defined by any one of the following 3 criteria:

                  i. intermittent claudication (i.e. leg pain on walking that disappears in&lt; 10
                  minutes on standing) that is known or likely to be due to atherosclerotic disease
                  ii. an ankle/arm systolic BP ratio &lt; 0.90 in either leg at rest iii. angiographic
                  or Doppler study demonstrating &gt;70% stenosis

               3. History of stroke (i.e. deficit that persisted for at least 1 week after onset)
                  thought due to atherothrombotic disease (i.e. NOT a lacunar stroke, hemorrhagic
                  stroke, nor embolic stroke secondary to atrial fibrillation)

               6. Any 3 of the following 7 risk factors i. high risk type of surgery (eg. Open
                  Intrathoracic, intraperitoneal, or major orthopedic surgery) ii. any history of
                  congestive heart failure iii. diabetes and currently on oral hypoglycemic agents
                  or insulin iv. preoperative serum creatinine &gt;175 micromol/L v. age &gt; 70 years
                  vi. history of TIA (i.e. that lasted less than 24 hours) vii. urgent / emergent
                  surgery

             strain; pacemaker dependency interfering with ST analysis; hemodialysis; digoxin; CABG
             or PCI within 5 years without any recurrence of CAD by symptoms or cardiac
             investigations; surgery with low physiological trespasses such as digit
             re-implantation, nerve repair, etc.; COPD / asthma requiring bronchodilators within
