      The Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease Assessment Test is a new questionnaire that has
      been developed recently to improve communication between doctors and patients. It is known to
      have good relationship with other measures of quality of life. For the wider application to
      practice, it has been translated into a local language in many countries.
