    <textblock>
      The goal of this clinical research study is to learn if intensive chemotherapy combined with
      ponatinib, followed by maintenance therapy, can help to control ALL with the Ph chromosome
      and/or BCR-ABL. The safety of this treatment will also be studied.

      Ponatinib may cause a blood clot to form in an artery or in a vein. Depending on the location
      of the clot, this could cause a heart attack, a stroke, severe damage to other tissue, or
      death. A blood clot may occur within 2 weeks after you start taking the drug. About 25% (1 in
      4) of patients taking the drug form an abnormal clot. Blood clots can occur in patients that
      do not have other known risk factors for forming clots. If you develop a blood clot, you will
      need to stop taking ponatinib. In some cases, emergency surgery could be needed to remove the
      clot and restore blood flow.

      This is an investigational study. Ponatinib is FDA approved to treat patients with certain
      types of leukemia. Its use in this study is investigational.

      All other drugs used in this study are FDA approved and commercially available. Their use
      together in this study is investigational.

      Up to 100 patients will take part in this study. All will be enrolled at MD Anderson.

      Study Drugs:

      The intensive chemotherapy used in this study includes a combination of 7 chemotherapy drugs.
      These drugs include cyclophosphamide, vincristine, Adriamycin (doxorubicin), dexamethasone,
      methotrexate, cytarabine (Ara-C), and ponatinib. This is called hyper-CVAD. You may also
      receive rituximab. These chemotherapy drugs are designed to interfere with the multiplication
      of cancer cells, which may slow or stop their growth and spread throughout the body. This may
      cause the cancer cells to die.

      The maintenance therapy used in this study includes a combination of 3 chemotherapy drugs.
      These drugs include vincristine, prednisone, and ponatinib.

      Cytarabine is designed to insert itself into DNA (the genetic material of cells) and stop the
      DNA from repairing itself.

      Cyclophosphamide is designed to interfere with the multiplication of cancer cells, which may
      slow or stop their growth and spread throughout the body. This may cause the cancer cells to
      die.

      Ponatinib is designed to block a protein that cancer may need to grow, survive, or spread.

      Dexamethasone, doxorubicin, methotrexate, and prednisone are each designed to stop or slow
      the growth of cancer cells, which may cause the cells to die.

      Vincristine is designed to interfere with the multiplication of cancer cells, which may slow
      or stop their growth and spread throughout the body. This may cause the cancer cells to die.

      Rituximab is designed to attach to leukemia cells, which may cause them to die.

      Study Drug Administration:

      If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, you will receive intensive
      chemotherapy therapy and ponatinib followed by maintenance therapy. You will receive 2 kinds
      of intensive chemotherapy regimens (hyper-CVAD therapy and methotrexate plus cytarabine) that
      will alternate about every 3 weeks for a total of 8 cycles (4 courses of each regimen). Each
      study cycle is about 3-4 weeks. It is possible that you may be enrolled in this study if you
      have already received 1-2 courses of Hyper-CVAD from an outside facility. If this is the
      case, the cycles of Hyper-CVAD you have already received will be counted as part of the 8
      cycles.

      Intensive Chemotherapy:

      You may receive up to 8 cycles of intensive chemotherapy in the hospital (about 4 or 5 days
      as inpatient). For participants 60 years and older, you will receive the entire first course
      in the hospital (about 21 days), in a protected environment, until you have healthy recovery
      of your blood counts.

      Hyper-CVAD: Cycles 1, 3, 5, and 7:

      On Days 1-3 of Cycles 1, 3, 5, and 7, you will receive cyclophosphamide by vein over about 3
      hours 2 times a day about every 12 hours. While you are receiving cyclophosphamide, you will
      receive mesna as a continuous infusion by a central venous catheter (CVC) starting about 1
      hour before you receive cyclophosphamide and ending about 12 hours after the last dose of
      cyclophosphamide. Mesna is given to lower the risk of side effects. A CVC is a sterile
      flexible tube that will be placed into a large vein while you are under local anesthesia.
      Your doctor will explain this procedure to you in more detail, and you will be required to
      sign a separate consent form for this procedure.

      On Days 1 and 11 of Cycles 1, 3, 5, and 7 (+/- 2 days), you will receive vincristine by vein
      over about 30 minutes.

      On Day 4 of Cycles 1, 3, 5, and 7, you will receive doxorubicin by a CVC over 24-48 hours.

      On Days 1-4 and 11-14 of Cycles 1, 3, 5, and 7 (+/- 2 days), you will take dexamethasone by
      mouth 1 time a day or by vein over 30 minutes.

      On Days 1-14 of Cycle 1 and every day during Cycles 2-8, you will take ponatinib by mouth 1
      time a day.

      If the doctor thinks it is needed, on Days 1 and 11 of Cycles 1 and 3 and on Days 1 and 8 for
      Cycles 2 and 4, you may also receive rituximab by vein over several hours.

      You will also receive methotrexate alternating with cytarabine by a spinal tap
      (intrathecally) to help lower the risk of the disease coming back in the fluid surrounding
      your brain. A spinal tap (also called a lumbar puncture) is when fluid surrounding the spinal
      cord is removed by inserting a needle into the lower back. The affected area is numbed with
      local anesthetic during the procedure. It can also be used to give chemotherapy. The number
      of doses you receive will depend on how many doses the study doctor thinks is needed. If you
      start with leukemia in the brain, it will be given 2 times a week until there is no leukemia
      present and then 1 time a week for 4 weeks. Occasionally, a sample of the fluid obtained from
      the spinal taps may be tested for leukemia. A sample will also be tested to see if it reaches
      the fluid around the brain.

      On Day 2 of Cycles 1, 3, and 5 (+/- 2 days), you will receive intrathecal methotrexate.

      On Day 7 of Cycles 1, 3, and 5 (+/- 2 days), you will receive intrathecal cytarabine.

      Methotrexate alternating with cytarabine by vein: Cycles 2, 4, 6, and 8 On Day 1 of Cycles 2,
      4, 6 and 8, you will receive methotrexate by vein over about 24 hours (+/- 3 hours).

      On Days 1-3 of Cycles 2, 4, 6, and 8, you will receive methylprednisolone by vein over less
      than 30 minutes about every 12 hours.

      On Days 2 and 3 of Cycles 2, 4, 6, and 8, you will receive cytarabine by vein 2 times a day
      over about 3 hours each time.

      On Days 2-5 of Cycles 2, 4, 6, and 8, you will receive leucovorin by vein over about 1 hour
      or by mouth every 6 hours beginning about 12 hours (+/- 2 hours) after you finish receiving
      methotrexate. Leucovorin is given to lower the risk of side effects such as mouth sores and
      kidney damage.

      On Day 5 of Cycles 2, 4, and 6 (+/- 2 days), you will receive intrathecal cytarabine.

      On Day 8 of Cycles 2, 4, and 6 (+/- 2 days), you will receive intrathecal methotrexate.

      You will also receive filgrastim or pegfilgrastim after all cycles of Hyper-CVAD and
      methotrexate plus cytarabine. You will receive it either as injection just under your skin
      every day, or only once after chemotherapy, until you have healthy recovery of your white
      blood cells, which will be determined by the study doctor.

      If the disease is responding to therapy and you have not had any intolerable side effects,
      you will continue on intensive chemotherapy for up to 8 courses, and you will then go to the
      maintenance therapy phase. You will be taken off this study if the disease gets worse or you
      have any intolerable side effects.

      Maintenance Therapy:

      Maintenance therapy, which will last for up to 2 years, will be given after you complete all
      8 courses of intensive chemotherapy. Each maintenance cycle will be about 28 days.

      On Day 1, you will receive vincristine by vein over about 30 minutes.

      On Days 1-5, you will take prednisone by mouth.

      You will take ponatinib as a single dose every day by mouth. You may continue to take
      ponatinib every day for as long as you are receiving benefit and you are not having
      intolerable side effects.

      Post-Remission Therapy:

      During Months 6 and 13, you may receive another course of hyper-CVAD, depending on how you
      are feeling and the status of the disease.

      Your doses of all chemotherapy that is given in this study may be increased or decreased
      depending on your organ function and side effects. Throughout intensive chemotherapy and
      maintenance therapy, you will also receive other drugs, fluids, or blood products (such as
      antibiotics, antiemetics, antacids, saline, platelets, and plasma), including allopurinol (by
      mouth) or rasburicase (by vein), to help protect your body against tumor lysis syndrome. This
      is a condition brought on by the death of large tumors, which causes damage to kidneys.

      Study Visits:

      At each study visit, you will be asked how you are feeling and about any drugs you may be
      taking.

      Before Day 1 of Cycle 2, you will have an ECG (+/- 2 days).

      On Day 1 of Cycles 2, 4, 6, and 8, you will have a chest x-ray.

      Blood (about 1 tablespoon) will be drawn for routine tests 1-2 times each week during Cycle
      1, every 1-3 weeks during Cycles 2-8, and every 4-8 weeks during Maintenance cycles.

      You will have a bone marrow aspiration and/or biopsy (about 1 teaspoon) to check the status
      of the disease on Days 14 and 21 (+/- 5 days) of Cycle 1, and every 2-3 cycles during
      consolidation, then every 3-6 months during Maintenance until you have been on the study for
      about 5 years, then once a year after that as long as you have no sign of disease.

      During Maintenance, blood (about 2 teaspoons) will be drawn every 3 months for routine tests
      and to check the status of the disease.

      Beginning with Cycle 3, you will have an ECHO or MUGA scan once every 3 months.

      The blood draws for routine tests, bone marrow aspirations/biopsies, and ECGs may be repeated
      more often anytime the doctor thinks it is needed.

      Length of Treatment:

      You may receive the intensive chemotherapy for up to 8 cycles (about 8 months) and then
      maintenance therapy for up to 2 years. You may continue to take ponatinib as long as you are
      receiving benefit. You will no longer be able to take the study drugs if the disease gets
      worse, if intolerable side effects occur, or if you are unable to follow study directions.

      Your participation on the study will be over once you have completed the follow-up.

      Follow-up:

      You will have a follow-up visit 30 days after your last dose of the study drugs. At this
      visit, you will be asked about any side effects you may be having. If you cannot make it to
      the clinic for this visit, it can be done over the phone with a member of the study staff.
      The phone call should last about 10 minutes.

      Long-Term Follow-Up:

      Every 6 months (+/- 1 month) for as long as you allow, the study staff may call you to ask
      about any side effects you may be having. These phone calls should last about 10 minutes. If
      you are already having these follow-up calls for another related study (a follow-up study
      called DR09-0223), you will not be called as part of this study.

      Ponatinib may cause a blood clot to form in an artery or in a vein. Depending on the location
      of the clot, this could cause a heart attack, a stroke, severe damage to other tissue, or
      death. A blood clot may occur within 2 weeks after you start taking the drug. About 41%
      (about 2 in 5) of patients taking the drug form an abnormal clot. Blood clots can occur in
      patients that do not have other known risk factors for forming clots. If you develop a blood
      clot, you will need to stop taking ponatinib. In some cases, emergency surgery could be
      needed to remove the clot and restore blood flow.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Diagnosis of one of the following: a) Previously untreated Ph-positive ALL [either
             t(9;22) and/or bcr-abl positive] (includes patients initiated on first course of
             hyper-CVAD before cytogenetics known); b) Previously treated Ph-positive ALL, after
             1-2 courses of chemotherapy with or without other TKIs 1) If they achieved CR, they
             are assessable only for event-free and overall survival, or 2) If they failed to
             achieve CR, they are assessable for CR, event-free, and overall survival.

          2. Age &gt;/= 18 years

          3. Performance status &lt;/= 2 (ECOG Scale, Appendix E)

          4. Adequate liver function as defined by the following criteria: a) Total serum bilirubin
             &lt;/= 1.5 x upper limit of normal (ULN), unless due to Gilbert's syndrome, b) Alanine
             aminotransferase (ALT) &lt;/= 2 x ULN, c) Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) &lt;/= 2.5 x ULN)

             prior to randomization

          7. Female and male patients who are fertile must agree to use an effective form of
             contraception with their sexual partners from randomization through 4 months after the
             end of treatment

          8. Adequate cardiac function as assessed clinically by history and physical examination.

          9. Signed informed consent

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Active serious infection not controlled by oral or intravenous antibiotics

             less than 1 year

          6. Active Grade III-V cardiac failure as defined by the New York Heart Association
             Criteria

          7. Clinically significant, uncontrolled, or active cardiovascular disease, specifically
             including, but not restricted to: Any history of myocardial infarction (MI), stroke,
             or revascularization; Unstable angina or transient ischemic attack prior to
             enrollment; Congestive heart failure prior to enrollment, or left ventricular ejection

             systolic &gt;140mmHg). Patients with hypertension should be under treatment on study
             entry to effect blood pressure control.

          9. Patients currently taking drugs that are generally accepted to have a risk of causing
             Torsades de Pointes (unless these can be changed to acceptable alternatives)

         10. Taking any medications or herbal supplements that are known to be strong inhibitors of
             CYP3A4 within at least 14 days before the first dose of ponatinib

         11. Prior history of treatment with ponatinib

         12. Treatment with any investigational antileukemic agents or chemotherapy agents in the
             last 7 days before study entry, unless full recovery from side effects has occurred or
