      The goal of this study is to measure lens fluorescence in normal subjects at various
      chronological ages that could serves as a guide to clinicians in determining changes in eye
      health. A measure of lens fluorescence can be used by clinicians as an indication of
      degenerative changes occurring in the lens of the eye.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Persons between the ages of twenty-one (21) and seventy (70). Best efforts shall be
             made to include as many patients as possible between the ages of thirty-five (35) and
             sixty (60).

          -  Subject must be able to read or understand and give informed consent.

          -  Pass the medical health history and comprehensive ophthalmic examination (which is
             determined by the investigator if the test subject has a normal ophthalmic examination
             and is in overall good health). Ophthalmic examination includes a clinical evaluation
             of the subject's eyes and a complete manifest refraction producing a best aided visual
             acuity of &lt;20/40.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subject has had the crystalline lens removed from the study eye or has had the
             crystalline lens removed and replaced with an intraocular lens (IOL) implant in the
             left eye.

          -  Subject has been clinically diagnosed with cataracts in the study eye.

          -  Subject has had a fluorescence angiogram within the last six months.

          -  Subject has undergone a treatment using photodynamic drugs within the last year.

          -  Subject has Type I or II diabetes or is not deemed healthy from Demographic and Health
             Questionnaire or the comprehensive eye exam.

          -  Subject was fit with contact lens within the last 30 days.

          -  Subject has ocular surface (dry eye) disease.

          -  Subject is unable to cooperate with or understand clinical instructions.

          -  Subject is unable to complete test sequence
