  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this trial is to assess the safety and effectiveness of the Penumbra System as
      an adjunctive treatment to intravenous (IV) recombinant human tissue plasminogen activator
      (rtPA)in patients with acute ischemic stroke from large vessel occlusion in the brain. IV
      rtPA is the only drug approved for the treatment of acute ischemic stroke but it does not
      work very well in cases where the stroke is caused by a large vessel occlusion. The
      hypothesis being tested is to determine if the addition of a treatment by a mechanical
      thrombectomy device like the Penumbra System can improve the clinical outcome of the patient
      over just using IV rtPA alone.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Current therapies for acute stroke are limited to the intravenous administration of a
      intravenous (IV) recombinant human tissue plasminogen activator (rtPA) for thrombolysis of
      the affected cerebral arteries within 3-4.5 hours from symptom onset, and the use of
      intra-arterial (IA) endovascular mechanical clot retrieval devices within 8 hours from ictus,
      all of which have limitations as mono therapies. For example, IV rtPA may not be very
      efficacious in large vessel occlusion and the long term effects of mechanical thrombectomy
      devices on patient functional outcome is unknown. This is a randomized, concurrent controlled
      study to assess the safety and effectiveness of the Penumbra System as adjunctive therapy to
      IV rtPA in the acute intervention of acute ischemic stroke. Patients presenting with symptoms
      of acute ischemic stroke who have evidence of a large clot burden (clot length &gt; 8mm) in the
      anterior circulation will be assigned to either IV rtPA therapy alone (0.9mg/kg to a maximum
      of 90mg) or a combined IV rtPA therapy (0.9mg/kg to a maximum of 90mg) and intra-arterial
      (IA) adjunctive treatment with the Penumbra System. Each treated patient will be followed and
      assessed for 3 months after enrollment.
