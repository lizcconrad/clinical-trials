  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This trial was conducted in Asia, Europe and South America. The aim of this trial was to
      confirm efficacy of subject driven titration (individually adjusted) of biphasic insulin
      aspart 30 (BIAsp 30) twice daily in terms of glycaemic control assessed by change in
      glycosylated haemoglobin (HbA1c).

    <description>A hypoglycaemic episode was defined as treatment emergent if the onset of the episode was on or after the first day of trial product, and no later than one day after product administration. Severe hypoglycaemic episodes were defined as requiring assistance to administer carbohydrate, glucagon, or other resuscitative actions. Minor hypoglycaemic episodes were defined as able to treat her/himself and plasma glucose below 3.1 mmol/L.</description>

             (screening)

          -  Stable treatment (no change in dose or regimen) with a total daily dose of at least

             allowed. The last sample was to be conclusive)

          -  Impaired kidney function with serum creatinine above or equal to 133 micromol/L (1.5
             mg/dL) for males and above or equal to 124 micromol/L (1.4 mg/dL) for females (one
             re-test within one week of screening visit was allowed. The last sample was to be

             systolic blood pressure higher or equal to 180 mmHg and/or diastolic blood pressure
             higher or equal to 100 mmHg)

          -  Previous use of pre-mixed insulin products (pre-mixed insulin analogues or pre-mixed
             human preparations) or bolus insulin. Previous use of pre-mixed or bolus insulin
             products was allowed only in case of hospitalisation or a severe condition requiring
             intermittent use of pre-mixed or bolus insulin products for less than 14 consecutive

          <description>The subjects performed the titration of biphasic insulin aspart 30 (BIAsp 30) dose and administered subcutaneously (under the skin) using FlexPen® twice daily for 20 weeks. The starting dose of BIAsp 30 was subject’s previous basal insulin analogue dose split into two equal daily doses, immediately before breakfast and immediately before dinner. Directions for use were given to each subject at each dispensing visit. Subjects continued on their pre-trial metformin dose. Any previous basal insulin analogue and OAD (oral anti-diabetes drug) treatments (except for metformin) were discontinued. Metformin was allowed to be continued at the pre-trial dose with a total daily dose of at least 1500 mg or maximum tolerated dose (minimum 1000 mg) as prior to randomisation.</description>

The starting dose of BIAsp 30 was subject’s previous basal insulin analogue dose split into two equal daily doses, immediately before breakfast and immediately before dinner. Directions for use were given to each subject at each dispensing visit. Subjects continued on their pre-trial metformin dose. Any previous basal insulin analogue and OAD (oral anti-diabetes drug) treatments (except for metformin) were discontinued. Metformin was allowed to be continued at the pre-trial dose with a total daily dose of at least 1500 mg or maximum tolerated dose (minimum 1000 mg) as prior to randomisation.</description>

        <description>From the 20 TRIM-D items, an overall score was derived. The scores were transformed to a 0 - 100 scale with higher scores indicating a better health state.</description>
        <time_frame>Week 4</time_frame>
        <population>Full analysis set (FAS) - analysis included endpoint derived after 20 weeks of treatment and missing data was imputed using last observation carried forward (LOCF) where any post-baseline measurements were available. 20 subjects did not contribute to data.</population>

            <description>The subjects performed the titration of biphasic insulin aspart 30 (BIAsp 30) dose and administered subcutaneously (under the skin) using FlexPen® twice daily for 20 weeks. The starting dose of BIAsp 30 was subject’s previous basal insulin analogue dose split into two equal daily doses, immediately before breakfast and immediately before dinner. Directions for use were given to each subject at each dispensing visit. Subjects continued on their pre-trial metformin dose. Any previous basal insulin analogue and OAD (oral anti-diabetes drug) treatments (except for metformin) were discontinued. Metformin was allowed to be continued at the pre-trial dose with a total daily dose of at least 1500 mg or maximum tolerated dose (minimum 1000 mg) as prior to randomisation.</description>
