      The study will determine the performance of the Infinium HD Test.

        -  The primary objective of the study is to assess the performance of the Infinium HD Test
           using banked DNA samples extracted from whole blood patient samples derived from the
           intended use population.

        -  The secondary objective of the study is to determine the background number of
           chromosomal abnormalities per person in the general population based on the resolution
           of the Infinium HD Test.

        Method Comparison - Sample Inclusion Criteria

        The following are criteria for inclusion of extracted genomic DNA samples in the method
        comparison sample pool:

          1. Sample is from a patient referred for post-natal cytogenetic testing.

          2. Sample gender is known.

          3. Sample quantity available for testing is ≥ 1 microgram of genomic DNA at a
             concentration of 60-80 nanograms per microliter (60-80ng/µl).

          4. Sample is extracted genomic DNA from EDTA or heparin-anticoagulated whole blood.

          5. Sample has been stored at 2 to 8°C or -15 to -25°C for no greater than three years
             from the date of extraction.

          6. Sample has been tested by a reference method. Acceptable reference methods include
             karyotype, FISH, qPCR, MLPA, and methylation analysis.

        Method Comparison - Sample Exclusion Criteria

          1. Sample is from a patient not referred for post-natal cytogenetic testing.

          2. Sample is from a patient referred for cytogenetic oncology testing.

          3. Sample quantity &lt; 1 microgram of genomic DNA or less than 60 nanograms per microliter
             (60ng/µl).

          4. Sample was improperly stored or was extracted from a sample that was improperly
             stored.

          5. Sample was tested by an Illumina array during standard of care testing.

        Clinical Specificity - Sample Inclusion Criteria

        The following are criteria for inclusion of extracted genomic DNA samples in the clinical
        specificity sample pool:

          1. Sample gender is known.

          2. Sample is from a patient not referred for post-natal cytogenetic testing.

          3. Sample quantity available for testing is ≥ 1 microgram of genomic DNA at a
             concentration of at least 60-80 nanograms per microliter (60-80ng/µl).

          4. Sample is extracted genomic DNA from EDTA or heparin-anticoagulated whole blood.

          5. Sample has been stored at 2 to 8°C or -15 to -25°C for no greater than three years
             from the date of extraction.

        Clinical Specificity - Sample Exclusion Criteria

          1. Sample is from a patient referred for post-natal cytogenetic testing.

          2. Sample quantity &lt; 1 microgram of genomic DNA or less than 60 nanograms per microliter
             (60ng/µl).

          3. Sample was improperly stored or was extracted from a sample that was improperly
             stored.
