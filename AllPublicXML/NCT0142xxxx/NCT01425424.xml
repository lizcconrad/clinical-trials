  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multi-site study is to reverse modest
      elevations of fasting blood sugar (prediabetes) and resting blood pressure(Prehypertension)
      or both co existing prediabetes and prehypertension by increasing blood levels of vitamin D.
      This may reduce the chances of developing diabetes or high blood pressure or both later in
      life.

  <detailed_description>

      Study visits will measure temperature, fasting glucose, resting blood pressure, respiratory
      rate, height, weight and waist circumference. A brief medical History will be taken, followed
      by an abbreviated physical exam. A blood test to check your vitamin D level and routine
      chemistry including a complete lipid profile, liver and kidney function will be completed.

      Based on your fasting glucose and/or resting blood pressure you will be in one of the three
      arms: prediabetes (arm 1), prehypertension (arm 2) or co-existing prediabetes and
      prehypertension (arm 3). After determining the arm of the study you are in, you will be
      randomly assigned to receive either a placebo or vitamin D supplementation.

      If you are in the first arm with prediabetes (fasting glucose 100-125 mg/dL), the primary
      outcome measure will change in fasting glucose at 8 weeks, 16 weeks and every 3 months until
      you are in the study up to 5 years. If you are in the second arm with prehypertension
      (resting blood pressure 120-139/80-89 mm Hg), the primary outcome measure will change in
      resting blood pressure at 8 weeks, 16 weeks and every 3 months until you are in the study up
      to 5 years. If you are in third arm with prediabetes and prehypertension, both these measures
      will be taken at 8 weeks, 16 weeks and every 3 months until you are in the study up to 5
      years. A repeat blood test to check vitamin D levels will be done at 8 and 16 weeks (and
      periodically as necessary) during the study.

      Other measures will be taken as are routine in your doctor's office.

    <description>An analysis of the fasting glucose, resting blood pressure and/or both will be performed. A blood test to check your vitamin D level and routine chemistry including a complete lipid profile, liver and kidney function will also be done. At the end of 8 weeks fasting blood glucose and resting blood pressure will be measured. If the desired results (fasting glucose less than 100 mg/dL and/or resting blood pressure less than 120/80 mm Hg) are not seen these measures will be repeated at 16 weeks. You will be asked to stay in the study for up to 5 years.</description>
