      THE STUDY WILL BE A TWO-PART RESEARCH

      PART A and PART A extended:

        1. To implement a &quot;common&quot; MRI acquisition protocol in multiple centers across Europe
           (Pharma-COG partners).

        2. Apply the common MRI protocol on phantoms and human subjects to characterize, compare
           and minimize test-retest variability across the MR sites of WP5 for all the quantitative
           metrics that will be later assessed on patients.

      PART B: By collecting clinical, biochemical, neuroimaging, neuropsychological and
      neurophysiological data in Mild Cognitive Impairment patient, we aim to:

        1. To develop a biomarker MATRIX (made of a combination of biological secondary endpoints)
           which is more sensitive than the changes observed in the loss of hippocampal volume
           (primary endpoint) and correlate with the neuropsychological progression and conversion
           (clinical secondary endpoints).

        2. To develop a biomarker MATRIX (made of a combination of biological secondary endpoints)
           at baseline which is more predictive of the loss of hippocampal volume (primary
           endpoint) and neuropsychological progression (clinical secondary endpoint) in MCI
           patients.

        3. To harmonize the biomarker MATRIX collection and qualify multiple centres across Europe

    <measure>Part A: Magnetic Resonance Imagery protocol</measure>
    <time_frame>Two times: One measure at day 1</time_frame>
    <description>The Magnetic Resonance Imagery protocol comprises a localiser or scout run, 4 structural-volumetric MRI sequences (i.e. 2 MP-RAGE, 1 FLAIR and 1 T2*), a resting state functional MRI acquisition (i.e. rsfMRI), a diffusion tensor scan (i.e. DTI) that will be conducted at the magnetic field strength of 3T and a quantitative assessment of brain perfusion changes with a sequence of Arterial Spin Labelling (i.e. ASL) . The field map will be used for geometric distortion correction of the fMRI data.
The main parameter of &quot;efficacy&quot; will be the reliability of the acquired MRI data (in terms of their correct acquisition and limited variability).</description>
