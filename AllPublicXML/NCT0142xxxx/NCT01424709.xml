  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Gemcitabine, docetaxel, CPT-11 and cisplatin are effective in 1st line treatment of advanced
      non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Platinum-based doublets including gemcitabine, docetaxel
      or CPT-11 are standard 1st regimens. BRCA1 and RRM1 expression levels are reported to be
      associated with sensitivity of the tumor cells to cytotoxic agents. Some Phase II or III
      trials did prove feasibility of customized chemotherapy based upon expression levels of one
      or two biomarkers in the NSCLC patients. The investigators think customized chemotherapy may
      further improve efficacy of chemotherapy in advanced NSCLC. But there is no randomised trial
      to compare efficacy of standard chemotherapy with individualized chemotherapy in this
      setting. So, the investigators plan to initiate this phase II trial to compare efficacy
      between standard chemotherapy of gemcitabine/cisplatin versus customized chemotherapy in
      chemonaive NSCLC patients.
