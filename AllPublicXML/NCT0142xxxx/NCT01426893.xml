  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The correct use of inhalation devices is an inclusion criterion for all studies comparing
      inhaled treatments. In real life, however, patients may make many errors with their usual
      inhalation device, which may negate the benefits observed in clinical trials. In real life,
      many errors seem to be made, but no wide-scale evaluation has been performed. The correct use
      of inhalation devices is essential to ensure the effectiveness of the treatment. It has been
      recently demonstrated that inhaler misuse is associated with decreased asthma control in
      asthmatics treated with an inhaled corticosteroid. The aim of our observational study was to
      evaluate the inhaler device usage in patients with asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary
      disease (COPD).
