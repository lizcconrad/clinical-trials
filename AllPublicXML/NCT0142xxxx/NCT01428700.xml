  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Acute cellular rejection is relatively common after liver transplantation, typically does not
      affect graft survival, and is not associated with the development of chronic rejection. Acute
      cellular rejection is diagnosed when liver enzymes and/or liver function tests are elevated
      when compared to baseline. The only means of differentiating acute rejection from other liver
      pathologies is with a liver biopsy. However, even with this invasive diagnostic procedure, it
      may be difficult to distinguish acute rejection from another disease process, such as injury
      caused by the hepatitis C virus (HCV) from the native liver. This study will evaluate whether
      certain patterns of biomarkers in the peripheral blood and/or liver tissue of a liver
      transplant recipient can be used to determine if the transplanted liver is being rejected by
      the recipient or sustaining HCV injury. Diagnostic biomarkers that are specific for acute
      rejection and informative of the severity of HCV recurrence could allow for modulation of
      immunosuppression therapy and treat the clinical condition without the need for invasive
      liver biopsies.
