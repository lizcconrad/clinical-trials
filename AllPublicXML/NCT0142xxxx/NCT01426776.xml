  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sleep disordered breathing, especially central sleep apnea, is common in patients with
      chronic heart failure. Heart valve replacement could have some effect on central sleep apnea.
      The aim of the study is to investigate effect of heart valve replacement on Cheyne-Stokes
      respiration in patients with rheumatic heart disease.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Sleep apnea, especially central sleep apnea, has a high prevalence in patients with chronic
      heart failure. Although sleep disordered breathing (SDB) have been described in patients with
      heart disease, the prevalence is not known because: ①There are various forms of SDBs,
      including obstructive sleep apnea(OSA), central sleep apnea (CSA), and mixed forms of sleep
      apnea syndromes that have variable prevalence; ②Patients suffering from rheumatic valve
      disease usually have varying degrees of heart failure, and this variability affects estimates
      of prevalence; ③There are no international patient registries and SDB is underdiagnosed in
      many parts of the world.

      The previous studies are most focusing on nonvalvular disease. We ①investigate the prevalence
      and the risk factors of Cheyne-Stokes respiration in patients with heart valve diseases,
      ②compare the changes of parameters of Cheyne-Stokes Respiration and heart function (like
      apnea hypopnea index, pulse oxygen saturation, blood pressure, echocardiogram,
      electrocardiogram, 6-minute walk test) before heart valve replacement and 3, 6, and 12 months
      after the surgery.

      With nocturnal polysomnography (PSG) examination 30 patients typical CSR are going to be
      screened out from 300 patients with heart valve disease and waiting for cardiac surgery. The
      Comparison of 30 patients undergoing heart valve replacement will be performed before and 3,
      6, and 12 months following heart valve replacement. We shall analyze the changes of CSR
      before and after valve replacement as well as the correlation among cardiac function and PSG
      parameters.

    <description>The secondary goal of this study is to determine the association of PSG parameters(index of CSR, apnea hypopnea index, pulse oxygen saturation, electrocardiogram, etc)and cardiac function (LVEF, 6-minute walk test, etc) before and 3, 6, 12 months following the cardiac valve replacement surgery. Qualities of life and sleep will also be masured before and 3, 6, 12 months after surgery. (The quality of life is assessed by reference to &quot;The Medical Outcomes Study 36item Short-Form Health Survey&quot;(SF-36) generic questionnaire, and sleep quality is assessed by Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index(PSQI).)</description>
