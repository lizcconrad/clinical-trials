  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a 2 -year NIDA funded grant (Co-PIs: Joseph P. Newman, John Curtin, and Carl Lejuez)
      that examines whether recent progress in characterizing the cognitive deficits associated
      with psychopathic and externalizing offenders may be used to develop better therapeutic
      interventions to treat their substance abuse and other self-control problems. Inmates with
      externalizing or psychopathy will receive one of two computer-based interventions to
      remediate the core cognitive skills that have been linked to self-regulation deficits in the
      two groups. One intervention (ACC) targets the affective cognitive control deficits
      associated with externalizing offenders whereas the other intervention (ATC) targets the
      attention to context deficits associated with psychopathic offenders. The specific components
      of the project include: selection and randomization of inmates; pre- and post-treatment
      behavioral and brain-related (ERP and Startle) measures to evaluate the impact and
      specificity of the ACC and ATC treatments; and 6 sessions of behavioral (e.g. computerized)
      and verbal training in ACC or ATC.

    <description>We will measure electrophysiology (EEG), startle responses (EMG measured in microvolts), and behavioral responses on six tasks that measure such processes as affective regulation, distress tolerance, cognitive control, selective attention, and attending to context.</description>
