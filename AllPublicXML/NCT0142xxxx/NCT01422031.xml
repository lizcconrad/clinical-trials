    <textblock>
      The aim of this study was to find out the utilization rate and pattern of primary health care
      services, and the process and outcomes of primary care consultations of the general
      population in Hong Kong, and whether having a family doctor would make any difference.

      The study objectives were to determine

        1. the rates and pattern of utilization of different primary health care services and
           self-care

        2. Patient self-reported outcomes (global rating on change in health, satisfaction and
           patient enablement) of primary care consultations;

        3. the process of care in consultations including drug and non-drug managements,
           investigations, preventive care and referrals;

        4. the effect of having a regular family doctor on service utilization rate and pattern,
           health promotion practice, and process and outcomes of primary care consultations.

      Study Design: A Cross-sectional general population survey and a longitudinal study (12-weeks
      follow up)

      Method: Two phases, corresponding to Summer and Winter, respectively, of cross-sectional
      telephone survey on the Hong Kong general population using a structured questionnaire to
      collect information on the choice primary care doctors, illness rates, primary care service
      utilization rates and self-reported process and outcomes of consultations. A longitudinal
      study for 12 weeks was carried out on a sub-sample of the cross-sectional study subjects to
      collect data to cross-validate cross-sectional data. Univariate and multivariate regression
      analyses were used to determine whether there was any difference in service utilization
      rates, process and outcomes among people using different types of primary care doctors.

        5174 eligible households were contacted by telephone but 1532 refused to be interviewed and
        494 did not complete the interview. 3148 (60.8%) subjects, with 1616 and 1532 in the first
        and second phases, respectively, completed the cross-sectional survey. 1131 people (480 by
        additional telephone sampling) were invited to the longitudinal study but only 708
        eventually agreed to take part and 327 returned the diaries (all by completion). 319
        subjects had complete cross-sectional and longitudinal data for the final analysis.
