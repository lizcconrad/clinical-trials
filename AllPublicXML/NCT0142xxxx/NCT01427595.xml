  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Many, but not all, girls with high levels of the male hormone testosterone go on to develop
      polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) as adults. Women with PCOS often have irregular menstrual
      periods, excess facial and body hair, and weight gain. PCOS is also a leading cause of
      difficulty becoming pregnant. The investigators do not understand why some girls with high
      hormones develop PCOS and others do not. In a previous study by our group, some girls with
      high levels of male hormones had abnormalities in the secretion of another hormone, called
      luteinizing hormone (LH), that are often seen in women with PCOS. However, another group had
      normal LH secretion. The girls with the abnormal LH secretion had higher levels of another
      hormone, called insulin, than the girls with normal LH secretion. The investigators will test
      whether metformin, an insulin-sensitizing agent, changes the effects of high male hormone
      levels in adolescent girls, specifically by looking at their LH secretion response following
      metformin treatment.

      A better understanding of the factors that make adolescent girls more or less susceptible to
      the adverse neuroendocrine effects of elevated androgens will hopefully lead to improved
      prevention and treatment strategies for PCOS. In this study, we propose to explore the role
      of hyperinsulinemia on neuroendocrine function in hyperandrogenic adolescent girls by
      assessing the effect of the insulin sensitizer Metformin on hypothalamic progesterone
      sensitivity. Other differences between the progesterone sensitive and progesterone
      insensitive subgroups, including racial and ethnic differences between the two populations
      and a trend towards older gynecologic age in the progesterone insensitive population, are
      being pursued through other ongoing studies (IRB-HSR# 8588 and 12160).
