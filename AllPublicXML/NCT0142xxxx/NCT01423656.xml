    <textblock>
      The principal aim of this study is to obtain safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetic data
      when LEO 29102 is administered cutaneously as single and multiple doses to healthy subjects.

      The study is divided into one single dose part, one part to compare pharmacokinetics between
      gender and one multiple dose part.
