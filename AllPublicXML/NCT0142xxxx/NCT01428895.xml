  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Bone is a common site of metastasis for a range of malignancies. Bone metastases have the
      potential to cause significant morbidity including pain, impairment of ambulation and reduced
      functional independence. Previous research has shown that pathological fractures are observed
      in 9 to 29 percent of patients with long bone metastases, and a high proportion of these
      require surgical intervention to relieve pain and restore function.

      The goal of this study is to describe the clinical outcomes of patients with femoral
      metastases at high risk of pathological fracture. Patients referred for treatment of femoral
      metastases at high risk of fracture will be followed prospectively after undergoing with
      surgery (± post-operative radiotherapy), or radiotherapy alone. Patient and disease
      characteristics, ambulatory status and limb function will be documented before treatment.
      These Clinical outcomes of participants in each treatment group will be measured 6 weeks
      after treatment, and 3- and 6 months after enrolment, with particular reference to
      patient-reported outcomes relating to pain, ambulatory status, limb function and quality of
      life.
