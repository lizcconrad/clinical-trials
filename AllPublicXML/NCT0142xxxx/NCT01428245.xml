  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) is a hormone that regulates the ability of the
      pituitary to secrete two hormones, luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone
      (FSH). LH and FSH control the production of female hormones (such as estrogen and
      progesterone) and the development of eggs by the ovary. Progesterone and estrogen then
      decrease the number of GnRH pulses produced by the brain (and therefore the number of LH
      pulses from the pituitary). The ability to decrease GnRH pulses seems to be very important
      for normal menstrual function in adult women. The purpose of this study is to learn more
      about how GnRH and LH pulses are controlled during puberty. The information gathered in this
      study will hopefully allow us to learn more about how menstrual cycles are normally
      established in girls during puberty.

      In this study, the investigators will aim to discover the effect of 7 days of estrogen and
      progesterone on GnRH pulses in girls in early and mid puberty. Ultimately, if the
      investigators understand these normal processes, the investigators may be able to better
      understand abnormalities of puberty.
