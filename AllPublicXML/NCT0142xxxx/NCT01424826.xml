    <textblock>
      This study seeks to address the question of whether intermittent dosing of rifampicin
      influences the pharmacokinetics of raltegravir when co-administered. This study aims to look
      at what happens when rifampicin is taken 3 times a week with the standard dose and an
      increased dose of raltegravir. This is to find out the best dose of raltegravir to take when
      taking rifampicin 3 times a week. The study will be conducted in 18 healthy volunteers.

    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to optimise the dosing of raltegravir when coadministered
      intermittently with rifampicin. The co-administration of rifampicin and antiretrovirals
      (ARVs) is both complicated and problematic due to the potent induction of metabolism by
      rifampicin. Rifampicin induces cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes, which results in reduced plasma
      concentrations of two groups of ARVs, the protease inhibitors (PIs) and the non-nucleoside
      reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs). This pharmacokinetic interaction precludes the use
      of PIs and severely compromises the effectiveness of the NNRTI, nevirapine, as it potentially
      results in the loss of antiviral activity due to sub-therapeutic concentrations which will
      also lead to antiretroviral resistance.

      Rifampicin also induces phase II enzymes including UDP-glucuronosyl transferase. The HIV
      integrase inhibitor, raltegravir, is primarily metabolised by UGT1A1 and therefore, there is
      the potential for a pharmacokinetic drug interaction with rifampicin. In fact, previous
      studies have shown a decrease in raltegravir AUC, CMAX, and C12 when co-administered with
      daily rifampicin. During directly observed therapy (DOTs) for TB, rifampicin is often given
      intermittently (e.g. 3 times a week). Although several studies have examined the interaction
      between raltegravir and daily rifampicin, currently there are no data regarding the
      pharmacokinetics of raltegravir when rifampicin is co-administered intermittently.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  The ability to understand and sign a written informed consent form, prior to
             participation in any screening procedures and must be willing to comply with all study
             requirements.

          -  ≥ 18 years

          -  Male or female subjects

          -  A female may be eligible to enter and participate in the study if she:

          -  Is of non-child-bearing potential defined as ether post-menopausal (12 months of
             spontaneous amenorrhea and ≥ 45 years of age)or physically incapable of becoming
             pregnant with documented tubal ligation, hysterectomy or bilateral oophorectomy or

          -  Is of child-bearing potential with a negative pregnancy test at screening and agrees
             to use one of the following methods of contraception to avoid pregnancy

          -  Complete abstinence from intercourse from 2 weeks prior to administration of IP,
             throughout the study and for at least 4 weeks after discontinuation of all study
             medication
