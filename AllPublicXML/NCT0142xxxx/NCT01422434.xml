    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare the efficacy of LEO 90105 ointment applied once daily
      with Dovonex® ointment applied twice daily and with Rinderon®-DP ointment applied once daily
      in Japanese subjects with psoriasis vulgaris.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      LEO 90105 ointment contains both calcipotriol and betamethasone dipropionate. It has been
      approved for the treatment of psoriasis in more than 60 centres, including most European
      countries, the US, China, Korea and Taiwan. This trial will investigate its safety and
      efficacy in the treatment of Japanese subjects with psoriasis.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in Modified Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (mPASI)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to Week 4</time_frame>
    <description>The primary response criterion was the percentage change in m-PASI from baseline to Week 4.
The extent of and severity of redness, thickness and scaliness of psoriasis were recorded for each of three regions (arms, trunk and legs) and these were used to calculate mPASI using the following formula:
Arms: 0.2(R+T+S)E = X Trunk: 0.2(R+T+S)E = Y Legs: 0.2(R+T+S)E = Z where R = score for redness (using a scale from 0 to 4, where o is non signs and 4 is the most severe signs) T = score for thickness (using a scale from 0 to 4, where o is non signs and 4 is the most severe signs) S = score for scaliness (using a scale from 0 to 4, where o is non signs and 4 is the most severe signs) E = score for extent (using a scale from 0 to 6, where 0 is no involvement and 6 is 90-100% involvemnet) The sum of X + Y + Z gave the total m-PASI, which could range from 0 to 64.8.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in Target Lesion Assessment</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to Week 4</time_frame>
    <description>Percentage change in composite severity score of the target lesion from baseline to Week 4.
At Visit 1, the investigator selected a target lesion. Location was recorded as trunk, limb excluding elbow and/or knee.
At Visits 1-4, the investigator assessed the severity of the target lesion for each sign (redness, thickness and scaliness) on a scale from 0 to 8 where 0 is no signs of redness, thickness or scaliness and 8 is the most severe signs of redness, thickeness or scaliniess.
The individual scores for redness, thickness and scaliness were added together to give a single composite score for severity of the target lesion which could range from 0 to 24. The percentage change in the composite severity score from baseline to each visit was also calcutated.</description>

    <measure>Physician's Global Assessment of Psoriasis</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 4</time_frame>
    <description>Subjects with 'clear' or 'almost clear' disease by physician's global assessment on the following 6 point scale: clear, almost clear, mild, moderate, severe, very severe.
The assessment represents the average lesion severity on the trunk and limbs. The assessment was based on the condition of the disease at the time of evaluation, and not in relation to the condition at a previous visit.</description>

    <description>The extent of and severity of redness, thickness and scaliness of psoriasis were recorded for each of three regions (arms, trunk and legs) and these were used to calculate mPASI.

             of not more than 30% body surface area (BSA).

          -  A target lesion of a minimum of 5 cm at its longest axis and preferably not located on
             an elbow or knee, scoring at least 3 for each of redness, thickness and scaliness, and
             at least 10 in total by the physician's assessment of severity of the target lesion -
             A physician's global assessment of disease severity of psoriasis on trunk/limbs of

        <title>Change From Baseline in Modified Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (mPASI)</title>
        <description>The primary response criterion was the percentage change in m-PASI from baseline to Week 4.
The extent of and severity of redness, thickness and scaliness of psoriasis were recorded for each of three regions (arms, trunk and legs) and these were used to calculate mPASI using the following formula:
Arms: 0.2(R+T+S)E = X Trunk: 0.2(R+T+S)E = Y Legs: 0.2(R+T+S)E = Z where R = score for redness (using a scale from 0 to 4, where o is non signs and 4 is the most severe signs) T = score for thickness (using a scale from 0 to 4, where o is non signs and 4 is the most severe signs) S = score for scaliness (using a scale from 0 to 4, where o is non signs and 4 is the most severe signs) E = score for extent (using a scale from 0 to 6, where 0 is no involvement and 6 is 90-100% involvemnet) The sum of X + Y + Z gave the total m-PASI, which could range from 0 to 64.8.</description>

At Visit 1, the investigator selected a target lesion. Location was recorded as trunk, limb excluding elbow and/or knee.
At Visits 1-4, the investigator assessed the severity of the target lesion for each sign (redness, thickness and scaliness) on a scale from 0 to 8 where 0 is no signs of redness, thickness or scaliness and 8 is the most severe signs of redness, thickeness or scaliniess.
The individual scores for redness, thickness and scaliness were added together to give a single composite score for severity of the target lesion which could range from 0 to 24. The percentage change in the composite severity score from baseline to each visit was also calcutated.</description>

The m-PASI could range from 0 to 64.8. The least severe outcome is 0 and the most severe outcome is 64.8</description>
