    <textblock>
      This trial consists of 4 treatment arms: 3 LY2623091 dose levels and eplerenone. Each patient
      will participate in 2 treatment periods, with a minimum wash-out period of 28 days between
      dosing in the 2 treatment periods. Dosing days will be numbered 1-21 in each of the 2
      treatment periods. Patients will receive different treatments in periods 1 and 2. Patients
      will be housed as inpatients during the days of the controlled diet administration and the
      oral potassium challenge and until at least 24 hours after its completion (Days -3 to 1; Days
      19 to 22, in each treatment period). Otherwise the study will be done on an outpatient basis,
      with patients returning to the clinic for evaluations during each treatment period (Days 3 or
      4, 7, and 14).
