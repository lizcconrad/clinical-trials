    <textblock>
      Dolutegravir (DTG, GSK1349572 is an integrase inhibitor that is currently in Phase 3 clinical
      development for the treatment of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. DTG is
      primarily metabolized by UDP-glucuronosyltransferase (UGT1A1) with cytochrome P450 (CYP)3A4
      pathway as a minor route. Corticosteroids have demonstrated induction effects on UGTs and
      CYP3A4. Corticosteroids are often used in HIV-infected subjects and have the potential to
      reduce DTG exposure due to enzyme induction when co-administered. The primary objective of
      this study is to determine whether concomitant prednisone administration can affect the
      pharmacokinetics (PK) of DTG.

      The study is a two part, two period, open label study. Part 1 will evaluate the effect of a
      high prednisone dose on DTG PK with the potential for an additional Part 2 depending on the
      results from Part 1. In Part 1, approximately 12 healthy subjects will receive DTG 50mg q24h
      for 5 days in Period 1. Subjects will then be administered DTG 50mg q24h in combination with
      prednisone 60mg for 5 days followed by a 5 day taper (total duration of 10 days) in Period 2.
      PK data of DTG will be obtained from Part 1 and used to inform decision making on the need
      for Part 2. If DTG exposure is reduced by more than 50% in Part 1, Part 2 will be carried out
      where a second cohort of subjects will receive DTG 50mg q24h DTG for 5 days in Period 1
      followed by DTG 50mg q24h in combination with prednisone 20mg for 5 days followed by a 5 day
      taper (total duration of 10 days) in Period 2. Safety evaluations and serial PK samples for
      DTG will be collected during each treatment period. A follow-up visit will occur 7-14 days
      after the last dose of study drug. All doses of study drugs will be taken following a
      moderate fat meal. This study will be conducted at one center in the United States, with
      healthy adult male and female subjects.
