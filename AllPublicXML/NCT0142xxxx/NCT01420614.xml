  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Prospective, randomized, multi-center trial comparing the safety and efficacy in the
      prevention of net adverse clinical outcomes (NACE) of transfemoral vs. transradial approach
      for the treatment of patients with ST-elevation acute coronary syndrome (STEACS) undergoing
      primary angioplasty
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Prospective, randomized, double arm study. The study population will include all consecutive
      patients presenting with a ST-elevation Acute Coronary Syndrome and candidates for primary
      percutaneous coronary intervention, who agree and provide written informed consent for the
      study.

      Before arterial stick for percutaneous access, patients will be randomized according to
      sealed numbered envelopes. Subsequently, arterial access will be obtained and the
      diagnostic/interventional procedure will be performed according to routine clinical practice,
      leaving ancillary medications, choice of devices and means of hemostasis at the physician's
      discretion.

      In the randomization process all participating centers will be equally stratified to avoid
      statistical unbalance.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Subject is &gt;18 years old with recent acute ST-elevation acute coronary syndrome
             (STEACS) requiring emergent coronary angiography.

          2. Patient has no contraindication to percutaneous arterial access by both and
             transfemoral route.

          3. Subject has been informed of the nature of the study and agrees to its provisions and
             has provided written informed consent as approved by the Institutional Review
             Board/Ethics Committee of the respective clinical site.

          4. Patient and the treating physician agree that the subject will comply with all
             follow-up evaluations.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Subject's age is &lt;18 years and he has no acute ST-elevation myocardial infarction (ST
             elevation of a least 0.1 mV in ≥2 extremity leads or at least 0.2 mV in ≥2 precordial
             leads).

          2. Subject has had a recent stroke or TIA (&lt;4 weeks), irrespective of age.
