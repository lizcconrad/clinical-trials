  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Two of AHRQ 's consumer-focused guides, &quot;Pills for Type 2 Diabetes&quot; and &quot;Premixed Insulin for
      Type 2 Diabetes&quot; could be of great use to underserved ethnic and racial minority adults. The
      presentation of content and delivery mechanisms of these Guides, however, needs to be
      modified to increase their use and impact among these difficult-to-reach populations.

      To achieve this goal, a long-standing collaboration among African American and Latino
      community organizations, health care centers and systems, public health organizations, and
      academics (the REACH Detroit Partnership) is joining with leading experts in the development
      of personally and culturally tailored health decision aids (University of Michigan's Center
      for Health Communications Research [CHCR] and Center for Behavioral and Decision Sciences in
      Medicine [CBDSM]).

      The investigators will develop and evaluate a computer tailored online diabetes medication
      decision aid that will enable community health workers (CHWs) to provide personalized patient
      education materials to underserved diabetic African American and Latino adults in Detroit,
      Michigan.

      The Specific Aims of this study are:

      Aim 1: To use the information in the two diabetes medications consumer CERSGs to build an
      interactive, computer tailored diabetes medication guide that will enable patients to assess
      their treatment goals, personal preferences, and side-effect concerns and generate a
      personally tailored assessment of their current diabetes treatments with, as appropriate,
      options for improving their diabetes care;

      Aim 2: To determine the extent to which this personally tailored diabetes medication guide
      compared with the print consumer guides reduces Latino and African American diabetes
      patients' decisional conflict, through improved knowledge of anti-hyperglycemic medications
      and satisfaction with information received.

      Aim 3: To examine the computer tailored program's effects on participants' changes in
      medications (medication intensification), self-reported medication adherence and beliefs and
      A1C levels between baseline and follow-up compared to participants receiving the print
      consumer guides.

    <description>We will be measuring subjects' perceptions of: a) uncertainty in choosing options; b) modifiable factors contributing to uncertainty such as feeling uninformed, unclear about personal values and unsupported in decision making; and c) effective decision making such as feeling the choice is informed, values-based, likely to be implemented and expressing satisfaction with the choice.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Medication adherence and intensification</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline and 3 month post intervention</time_frame>
    <description>Self-reported medication adherence will be assessed through three well-validated measures. We will assess changes in anti-hyperglycemic medication dosages and/or numbers of medications by patient report and medical record review.</description>

    <description>CHWs will provide and review with patients language-appropriate versions of the AHRQ consumer guides. CHWs will highlight key points on each page, review information on each medication and elicit and address questions. They will use the autonomy enhancing, motivational-interviewing based skills. As with the first arm, CHWs will schedule follow-up clinic appointments for participants who note a specific treatment change they would consider and will call participants two times after the session at three and six weeks to address additional questions and to follow up on any goals the participant set.</description>

    <description>Participants randomized to this arm will be scheduled within 3 weeks of enrollment to have a one-hour face-to-face session with a CHW who will deliver the ipad platform personally tailored diabetes medication decision aid. Participants will receive a printed tailored preference summary at the completion of this visit. If participants note a specific treatment change they would like to discuss with their providers, the CHW will facilitate scheduling a clinic visit within the next month. Finally, CHWs will call participants two times after the session at 3 and 6 weeks to assess if the participant has additional questions and to follow up on any treatment or other goals the participant set during their session.</description>
