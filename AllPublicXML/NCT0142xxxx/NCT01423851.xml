        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Primary myelofibrosis, post-PV MF, or post-ET MF that requires therapy

          -  MF patients must have received prior JAK2 inhibitor therapy, and been found to be
             intolerant, or refractory/relapsed from prior JAK2 inhibitor therapy, based on
             investigator assessment

          -  ≥18 years old

          -  ECOG Performance Status of ≤ 3

          -  Estimated life expectancy of ≥12 weeks

          -  Male or non-pregnant, non-lactating female patients

          -  Serum creatinine of ≤1.5 × the upper limit of normal (ULN)OR estimated creatinine
             clearance (CrCl) ≥ 40 ml/min/1.73 m2

          -  Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) ≤3 × the upper
             limit of normal (ULN) and total bilirubin ≤1.5 × ULN. If the total bilirubin is
             elevated between 1.5 x and 3 x ULN, patients with a direct bilirubin ≤ 1.5 X ULN are
             eligible during the Phase II portion.

          -  No MF-directed treatment for at least 2 weeks prior to initiation of NS-018, including
             any use of corticosteroids for Myelofibrosis symptom or blood count management. Low
             dose corticosteroids ≤ 10 mg/day prednisone or equivalent is allowed for
             non-myelofibrosis purposes.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Active, uncontrolled systemic infection

          -  Patients with any unresolved toxicity greater than Grade 1 from previous anticancer
             therapy

          -  Potentially curative therapy is available

          -  Currently taking medication that is substantially metabolized by cytochrome P450 (CYP)
             1A2 or CYP3A4 or taking medication known to be strong inhibitors or inducers of CYP3A4

          -  Patients with a serious cardiac condition within the past 6 months

          -  Pregnant or lactating

          -  Radiation therapy for splenomegaly within 6 months prior to study entry

          -  Splenectomy (Phase 2 portion of the study only)

          -  Known HIV positive status

          -  Known active hepatitis, a history of viral hepatitis B or hepatitis C
