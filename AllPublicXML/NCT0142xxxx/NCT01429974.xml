  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Meconium constitutes the bowel contents of the fetus and is normally expelled only after
      birth. However, it may be secreted into the amniotic fluid of 20% of all fetuses. Meconium
      Stained Amniotic Fluid had been recognized from ancient times as an obstetric hazard which
      complicates delivery and is associated with increased newborn morbidity and mortality. At
      present there is no viable diagnostic test for Meconium prior to the onset of labor and the
      rupture of membranes. The system developed for the detection of Meconium, based on
      recognizing a characteristic fluoroscopic spectral pattern emitted by Meconium under light
      excitation at a specific wavelength. The diagnostic test being developed does not require
      penetration into the amniotic sac and is safe, painless and simple to perform.
