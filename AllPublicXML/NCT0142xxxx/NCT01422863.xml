    <textblock>
      The overall goal of this study is to determine the efficacy of a lifestyle intervention,
      consisting of a weight loss diet and exercise on sleep apnea in older adults. The
      investigators will conduct a 3-month intervention in men and women who are sedentary with
      suspected sleep apnea. The investigators hypothesize that the intervention will lead to
      marked improvements in sleep apnea severity and cardiovascular risk markers.

      Frailty, a condition characterized by a decrease in physiological reserve and increased risk
      for adverse health-related outcomes, is an increased risk of aging, especially in the
      presence of co-morbid conditions. Sleep apnea is also highly prevalent with increasing age.
      Both conditions share common pathologies, suggesting that sleep apnea may increase the risk
      of developing or exacerbate the consequences of frailty. Lifestyle interventions as
      strategies for treating sleep apnea and associated co-morbidities, thereby highlighting a
      feasible approach by which to reduce the incidence or progression of frailty. The specific
      aims of this study are to: 1) determine the effectiveness of a lifestyle intervention (LI),
      consisting of a weight loss diet and supervised exercise, on reducing sleep apnea in older
      adults, and 2) determine whether this intervention is effective at improving parameters that
      are common to both sleep apnea and frailty, such as poor physical functional capacity and
      body composition, impaired or abnormal cardiometabolic function and increased levels of
      inflammation.

    <description>Participants undergo 3 months of monitored exercise, consisting of aerobic and resistance training (3 days per week for 1 hour). Participants will also meet with a registered dietician, who will prescribe an American Heart Association low fat diet. The goal is to achieve a 1-2 lb weight loss per week.</description>
