             evaluation including [medical history, physical examination, laboratory tests and
             cardiac monitoring. A subject with a clinical abnormality or laboratory parameters
             outside the reference range for the population being studied may be included at the
             discretion of the Investigator only if the finding is unlikely to introduce additional
             risk factors and will not interfere with the study procedures.

          -  Male or female between 18 and 65 years of age inclusive, at the time of signing the
             informed consent.

          -  A female subject is eligible to participate if she is of: Non-childbearing potential
             defined as pre-menopausal females with a documented tubal ligation, oophorectomy, or
             hysterectomy; or postmenopausal defined as 12 months of spontaneous amenorrhea.

        Male subjects with female partners of child-bearing potential must agree to use one of the
        contraception methods listed in the protocol. This criterion must be followed from the time
        of the first dose of study medication until the follow up visit.

          -  Body weight greater than or equal to 50 kilogram (kg) for men and 45 kg for women.
             Body mass index (BMI) between 18.5-30 inclusive will be allowed.

          -  Capable of giving written informed consent, which includes compliance with the
             requirements and restrictions listed in the consent form.

          -  Subject has demonstrated an adequate echocardiographic window.

          -  QTcB less than 450 milliseconds (msec).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  A positive pre-study Hepatitis B surface antigen,positive Hepatitis C antibody, or a
             positive test for HIV antibody result within 3 months of screening.

          -  Current or chronic history of liver disease, or known hepatic or biliary abnormalities
             (with the exception of Gilbert's syndrome or asymptomatic gallstones).

          -  A positive pre-study drug/alcohol screen.

          -  History of regular alcohol consumption within 6 months of the study.

          -  The subject has participated in a clinical trial and has received an investigational
             product within the following time period prior to the first dosing day in the current
             study: 30 days, 5 half-lives or twice the duration of the biological effect of the
             investigational product (whichever is longer).

          -  Use of prescription or non-prescription drugs, including vitamins, herbal and dietary
             supplements (including St John's Wort) within 7 days (or 14 days if the drug is a
             potential enzyme inducer) or 5 half-lives (whichever is longer) prior to the first
             dose of study medication, unless in the opinion of the Investigator and GSK Medical
             Monitor the medication will not interfere with the study procedures or compromise
             subject safety.

          -  History of sensitivity to any of the study medications, or components thereof or a
             history of drug or other allergy that, in the opinion of the investigator or GSK

             in excess of 500 mililiters within a 56 day period.

          -  Pregnant females as determined by positive [serum or urine] hCG test at screening or

             to the first dose of study medication.

          -  Left ventricular ejection fraction less than 55% at screening.

          -  The subject's systolic blood pressure is outside the range of 90-140, or diastolic
             blood pressure is outside the range of 45-90 or heart rate is outside the range of
             50-100beats per minute for female subjects or 45-100 beats per minute for male
             subjects.

          -  Exclusion criteria for screening ECG (a single repeat is allowed for eligibility
             determination):

        Males-Heart rate less than 45 and greater than 100 beats per minute (bpm). Females-Heart
        rate less than 50 and greater than 100 bpm Evidence of previous myocardial infarction (Does
        not include ST segment changes associated with repolarization).

        Any conduction abnormality (including but not specific to left or right complete bundle
        branch block, AV block [2nd degree or higher], Wolf Parkinson White [WPW] syndrome). Sinus
        Pauses greater than 3 seconds. Any significant arrhythmia which, in the opinion of the
        principal investigator and GSK medical monitor, will interfere with the safety for the
        individual subject. Non-sustained or sustained ventricular tachycardia ( greater than or
        equal to 3 consecutive ventricular ectopic beats).
