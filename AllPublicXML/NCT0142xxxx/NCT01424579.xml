  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Subacromial Impingement Syndrome (SIS) is the most common cause of shoulder pain with high
      lifetime prevalence (one in three) in general population. In occupational population is the
      most common upper extremity disorder. Symptoms include pain, a variable degree of mobility
      limitation and a more or less pronounced functional impairment. Conservative treatment is
      usually the first therapeutic option and some physiotherapeutic techniques have proved its
      efficacy but nevertheless treatment remains challenging.

      According to the investigators clinical experience, Diacutaneous Fibrolysis has a beneficial
      effect on patients suffering from SIS, but no one published clinical trial has evaluated this
      manual technique previously. The investigators hypothesis is that adding Diacutaneous
      Fibrolysis to a protocolized physiotherapeutic treatment can provide better outcomes. The
      investigators objective was to assess the effect of Diacutaneous Fibrolysis on pain, mobility
      and functional status in patients suffering from SIS.

      A double-blind (patient and evaluator) randomized clinical trial was carried out in two
      public centres of Primary Health Care of the Spanish National Health System. The study
      protocol was approved by the Clinical Research Ethics Committee from the Jordi Gol Institute
      of Research in Primary Health Care and all the patients provided written consent.

      A hundred and twenty patients with clinical diagnosis of SIS were included and randomly
      allocated to one of three groups. All groups received the same daily protocolized treatment
      based on therapeutic exercises, analgesic electrotherapy and cryotherapy during three weeks.
      Additionally, intervention group received six sessions (two a week) of actual Diacutaneous
      Fibrolysis; placebo group received six sessions (two a week) of placebo Diacutaneous
      Fibrolysis, while control group received only the protocolized treatment.

      Pain intensity (VAS), active range of motion (flexion, abduction, extension, external and
      internal rotation) and functional status (Constant-Murley score) were measured in baseline,
      after the three weeks of treatment and three months after the end of treatment.

    <description>Diacutaneous Fibrolysis is a non-invasive physiotherapeutic technique applied by means of a set of metallic hooks ending in a spatula with bevelled edges that allow a deeper and more precise application, which could not be achieved manually. Appropriate hook is applied following the intermuscular septum between the muscles with an anatomical or functional relationship with the painful structure, in a centripetal direction towards the pain location, in order to release adherences between musculoskeletal structures.</description>
