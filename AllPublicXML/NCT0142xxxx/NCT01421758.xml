  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study was designed to determine whether participation in an online social network
      intervention increases perceived social support for physical activity versus a minimal
      education control group by conducting a randomized controlled trial with 140 female
      undergraduate students. The investigators hypothesize that participants in the physical
      activity centered online social network intervention group will have greater increases in
      perceived social support for physical activity compared to minimal web based physical
      activity education controls.
