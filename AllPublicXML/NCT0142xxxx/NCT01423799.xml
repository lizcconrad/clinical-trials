      The purpose of this study is to compare the health-related quality of life following dietary
      supplementation with an immunonutrition formulation vs an isocaloric/isoprotein control diet
      supplement in patients suffering from upper digestive tract neoplasia undergoing oncological
      treatment.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Histologically proven GI cancer.

          -  Age ≥ 18 years.

          -  Life expectancy more than 3 months.

          -  Female patients of child-bearing potential must be willing to employ effective
             contraception during the study period.

          -  Female patients of child-bearing potential must have a negative serum Beta Human
             Chorionic Gonadotrophin (βhCG) test at Visit 0.

          -  The patient is able to communicate effectively with study personnel and is considered
             reliable, willing, and cooperative in terms of compliance with the protocol
             requirements.

          -  The patient voluntarily gives written informed consent to participate in the study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Severe concomitant clinical conditions other than the previously untreated digestive
             tract cancer that jeopardise the protocol follow-up.

          -  The patient is pregnant or is a lactating woman.

          -  Currently participating or having participated in another interventional clinical
             trial related to nutritional support during the 30 days prior to the beginning of the
             study product intake, except if this other interventional trial is testing new drug or
             surgical intervention. (Note: participation in a prior or concurrent clinical trial
             not related to nutritional support does not exclude the patient from participation.)

          -  Other malignancies in the last 5 years (except for successfully treated in situ
             basocellular skin and in situ cervical uterine tumours).

          -  Patients with more than 20% weight loss over a 6 months period.
