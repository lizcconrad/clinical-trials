    <textblock>
      In the proposed study, the investigators plan to evaluate the efficacy and safety of
      Cefotaxime sodium and sulbactam sodium for injection (2:1)for the treatment of respiratory
      and urinary tract acute bacterial infection under the widely used in clinical conditions.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cefotaxime is a third-generation cephalosporins.Cefotaxime sodium and sulbactam sodium for
      injection (2:1)plays a therapeutic role by the former inhibiting bacterial cell wall
      synthesis by irreversible competitive inhibition of β-lactamase.The antimicrobial effect of
      cefotaxime can be enhanced by the two combined.The compound specifically aims to the
      mechanism of bacterial resistance, extending the life of cefotaxime in the
      treatment-resistant pathogen infections.
