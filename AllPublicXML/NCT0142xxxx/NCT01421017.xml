  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is to find an optimal dose of Imiquimod (IMQ) in the first part (Phase I) and test
      the effectiveness of the combination treatment of IMQ, cyclophosphamide (CTX), and
      radiotherapy (RT) in patients with skin metastases from breast cancer in the second part
      (Phase II). Currently this trial is in its Phase II part.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      By harnessing the cytocidal and immunostimulatory properties of two local treatment
      modalities, RT and IMQ, an effective, adaptive immune response can be generated, resulting in
      systemic control of metastatic breast cancer after local treatment of cutaneous metastases.
      Additionally, based on investigators' recent preclinical data, the investigators intend to
      estimate in patients with metastatic breast cancer, if the addition of immunomodulatory
      cyclophosphamide can increase anti-tumor responses.

      This trial originally had one treatment arm IMQ/RT(patients were treated with IMQ and RT).
      Recent evidence has emerged that the addition of immunomodulatory cyclophosphamide (CTX)
      increased anti-tumor responses, therefore the IMQ/RT arm is closed and the trial will
      continue with two additional cohorts (CTX/IMQ/RT and CTX/RT) which include cyclophosphamide.

Weeks 1-2: RT given to one metastatic skin site at 6 Gy on days 1, 3, 5, 8 and 10 (M-W-F-M-W)
Weeks 1-8: day 1-5 of each week: imiquimod 5% cream applied to all skin sites overnight, starting on day 1 after RT, day 6-7 of each week: rest period.
Week 9: response assessment
Patients may continue to receive additional cycles (same schedule, RT given to a different site), provided that patients wish to continue, are without clinically significant progression and further treatment may be beneficial in the opinion of the investigator.</description>

          6. Concurrent systemic cancer therapy (hormones, biologics or chemotherapy) can be
             continued if distant metastases are non-responsive (i.e. no complete response or
             partial response) on that regimen for &gt;= 8 weeks as assessed by the investigator.

          7. Patients with known immunodeficiency or receiving immunosuppressive therapies.

          8. History of allergic reactions to imiquimod or its excipients.
