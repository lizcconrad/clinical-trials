  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To facilitate the development of a personalized approach to the treatment of patients with
      major depression, this study is designed to elaborate the clinical and neurobiological
      phenotype of depressed patients with increased inflammation. The data obtained in this
      proposal will allow the investigators to test the hypothesis that depression and inflammation
      interact to elaborate a relatively discreet phenotype that warrants an individualized
      approach to diagnosis and treatment of patients with depression. Moreover, the identification
      of specific environmental risk factors for inflammation will foster the elaboration of
      preventative strategies for patients at risk.

      One hundred and thiry-five patients with major depression diagnosed based on DSM-IV TR
      criteria between the ages of 21 and 65 (males, females and minorities) will be recruited.
      Forty-five patients with high inflammation as defined by a CRP &gt;3 mg/L will be enrolled along
      with 45 depressed patients with medium inflammation (CRP=1-3mg/L) and 45 depressed patients
      with low inflammation (CRP&lt;1mg/L) will complete a 2 night inpatient stay in Emory University
      Hospital's research unit, the Atlanta Clinical and Translational Science Institute (ACTSI).
      Participants will undergo psychiatric and neurocognitive assessments, sleep studies and blood
      and cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) sampling.
