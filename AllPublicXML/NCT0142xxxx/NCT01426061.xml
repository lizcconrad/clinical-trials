  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There is a lack of scientific evidence that homeopathy and reflexology is effective treatment
      of asthma. Systematic reviews have found that many clinical trials testing homeopathy and
      reflexology have major flaws, such as small number of participants, lack of control groups or
      inadequate allocation concealment.

      The aim of the present study was to assess the effect of reflexology and individualised
      homeopathy as an adjuvant treatment in asthma. In order to address this issue, the
      investigators conducted an investigator-blinded, randomized, controlled parallel group study.

    <time_frame>Assesment of quality of life was perfomed at baseline, at week 26 and at week 52.</time_frame>
    <description>AQLQ is self-administered questionnaire which consists of 32 questions in 4 domains (symptoms, activity limitation, emotional function and environmental stimuli). Patients responded to each question on a seven point scale (7=no impairment 1=maximal impairment) and recalled their experiences during the previous 2 weeks. The overall AQLQ score was the mean of all 32 questions. A change in score of ≥0.5 indicates the minimal important difference (MID) in AQLQ.</description>

    <description>Patients in the homeopathy group received homeopathic treatment in addition to usual care of asthma.Homeopathic treatment was decided on an individual basis by the homeopath and prescribed as an oral treatment. Patients received homeopathic product with potency between C30 (dilution by a factor 10030 =1060) and M10 (dilution by a factor 100010 =1030). The number of homeopathy sessions attended was six to twelve during one year.</description>
