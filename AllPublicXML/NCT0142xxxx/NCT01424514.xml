  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the pharmacodynamic (PD) effects (Total Symptom Score
      (TSS) and its individual components: rhinorrhoea, nasal congestion, post-nasal drip) of
      intranasal, repeat dose SB-705498 in non-allergic rhinitis (NAR) patients elicited by a cold
      dry air challenge in an environmental exposure chamber (EEC). SB-705498 is a selective
      antagonist of the transient receptor potential vanilloid-1 (TRPV1) ligand gated ion channel.
      TRPV1 is a cation permeable ion channel that can be activated by several physiological
      factors, such as heat, protons (pH), osmotic stress, eicosanoid derivatives, anandamide, and
      by products of inflammation, such as histamine, prostaglandins and bradykinin. In the nose,
      the local TRPV1 expressing sensory C-fibres are thought to play a key role in the development
      of nasal hyper-responsiveness to environmental provocateurs. It has been proposed that
      blocking the nasal sensory nerve stimulation may control nasal hyper-responsiveness and
      therefore prevent the induction of rhinitis symptoms. In this context, preclinical evidence
      supports that targeting TRPV1 by SB-705498 may be an attractive option.

      In this study NAR patients will be randomised, in a double blind, placebo controlled cross
      over design to receive 14 day repeat doses of 12mg intra-nasal SB-705498 once daily. Whilst
      dosing at home, subjects will record symptom scores to document their symptoms. In addition,
      during visits to the clinical unit, acoustic rhinometry, quality of life questionnaires and
      safety assessments will be monitored.

    <measure>Mean Total Symptom Score (TSS) Elicited by a 1 Hour (h) Cold Dry Air (CDA) Challenge, 1 h and 24 h on Day 14 to Compare the Effect of 14 Day Repeat Dosing of Intranasal SB-705498 12 mg With Placebo</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 14 to Day 15 of each period (Day 14, 24 h post- dose was done on Day 15)</time_frame>
    <description>TSS was calculated based on a CDA challenge, done for 1 h in a controlled environmental exposure chamber which was validated for 14+/-5 degree Celsius (C), &lt;15% relative humidity and 5+/-3 feet per second (ft/sec) air velocity, 1 h and 24 h post dose on Day 14 (Day 15). TSS was calculated as the sum of the response for 3 components of nasal congestion, rhinorrhoea and post nasal drip. It was rated on a 4-point scale ranging from 0 to 3, where: 0=absent, 1=mild, 2=moderate, and 3=severe (symptom hard to tolerate). TSS score ranges from 0-9 with 0 representing an absence of symptoms and higher scores reflecting more severe symptoms. Weighted mean (WM) for TSS was calculated over the time interval 0 to 60 minute (m) after start of CDA challenge by calculating area under the curve (AUC) of the TSS via the linear trapezoidal method then dividing by the total duration that the participant took to complete CDA challenge assessments. WM is reported as least square (LS) mean.</description>

    <measure>Mean Change From Baseline to Day 14 of Acoustic Rhinometry (AR) Following Repeat Dosing of SB-705498 at 2 h and 25 h Post-dose</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Day 1 pre-dose), Day 14 and Day 15 of each period (Day 14, 25 h post dose on Day 14 was evaluated on Day 15)</time_frame>
    <description>Overall AR score was obtained by adding minimal cross-sectional area (MCA) for right and left nostril. MCA1 was captured within the nose at a distance of 0 and 2.2 cm and MCA2 at 2.2 and 5.5 cm. MCA1 and MCA2 were captured simultaneously for each nostril, 3 measurements were obtained from each nostril which resulted in 12 data points. Absolute MCA for all regions in left or right nostril was calculated using the 3 acceptable measurements, calculating average of each of right and left MCA's and also by selecting minimum value from these averages to obtain minimum MCA for left and right nostril. Baseline is defined as the value on Day 1 pre- dose. Change from baseline was calculated by subtracting the baseline (Day 1 pre-dose) values from individual post-randomization values done immediately following CDA challenge. In case of missing baseline or post randomization value, the change from baseline was set to be missing. Adjusted mean is reported as LS mean.</description>

    <description>The RQLQ is a 28-item, disease-specific quality of life questionnaire that measures the functional (physical, emotional, and social) problems troublesome to adults with allergies. The RQLQ has 28 questions in 7 domains (activities, sleep, non-nose/eye symptoms, practical problems, nasal symptoms, eye symptoms and emotional). All 28 questions were evaluated by the participant in an assessment diary over 2 weeks of treatment period and was rated on a 7-point severity scale ranging from 0 to 6, where 0=least severe to 6=extremely severe. Overall mean was calculated by summing all 28-item scores and dividing by total number of items in the questionnaire. RQLQ score ranges from 0-6 with 0 representing an absence of symptoms and higher scores reflecting more severe symptoms. Baseline was defined as the value on Day 1 pre- dose. Change from baseline was calculated by subtracting baseline (Day 1 pre-dose) values from individual post-randomization values. Adjusted mean is reported as LS mean.</description>

                  menopausal status is in doubt will be required to use one of the contraception
                  methods in Section 8.1 if they wish to continue their HRT during the study.
                  Otherwise, they must discontinue HRT to allow confirmation of post-menopausal
                  status prior to study enrollment. For most forms of HRT, at least 2-4 weeks will
                  elapse between the cessation of therapy and the blood draw; this interval depends
                  on the type and dosage of HRT. Following confirmation of their post-menopausal
                  status, they can resume use of HRT during the study without use of a
                  contraceptive method.

               -  Child-bearing potential and agrees to use one of the contraception methods listed
                  in Section 8.1 for an appropriate period of time (as determined by the product
                  label or investigator) prior to the start of dosing to sufficiently minimize the
                  risk of pregnancy at that point. Female subjects must agree to use contraception
                  until 84 days post-last treatment administration.

          5. Male subjects with female partners of child-bearing potential must agree to use one of
             the contraception methods listed in Section 8.1. This criterion must be followed from
             the time of the first dose of study medication until 84 days post-last treatment
             administration.

          6. Body weight ≥ 50 kg (males) and ≥45kg (females) and BMI within the range 19 - 29.9
             kg/m2 (inclusive).

          7. Capable of giving written informed consent, which includes compliance with the
             requirements and restrictions listed in the consent form.

          8. Available to complete all the required study measurements.

          9. Single QTc, &lt; 450 msec; or QTc &lt; 480 msec in subjects with Bundle Branch Block.

         10. The subject must demonstrate at screening TSS ≥ 4 (on a 9 point scale) at screening
             visits 1 and 2.

         11. AST and ALT &lt; 2xULN; alkaline phosphatase and bilirubin less than or equal to 1.5xULN
             (isolated bilirubin &gt;1.5xULN is acceptable if bilirubin is fractionated and direct
             bilirubin &lt;35%).

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Deviations from exclusion criteria are not allowed because they can potentially jeopardise
        the scientific integrity of the study, regulatory acceptability or subject safety.
        Therefore, adherence to the criteria as specified in the protocol is essential.

        A subject will not be eligible for inclusion in this study if any of the following criteria
        apply:

          1. Nasal abnormalities likely to affect the outcome of the study, i.e. nasal septal
             perforation, nasal polyps, other nasal malformations.

          2. History of frequent nosebleeds.

          3. A positive pre-study Hepatitis B surface antigen or positive Hepatitis C antibody

             (with the exception of Gilbert's syndrome or asymptomatic gallstones).

          5. Positive pre-study drug/alcohol/smoking screen. A minimum list of drugs that will be
             screened for include amphetamines, barbiturates, cocaine, opiates, cannabinoids,
             benzodiazepines and methadone

          6. A positive test for HIV antibody.

          7. History of regular alcohol consumption within 6 months of the study defined as:

             • An average weekly intake of &gt;14 drinks for males or &gt;7 drinks for females. One drink
             is equivalent to 12 g of alcohol: 12 ounces (360 ml) of beer, 5 ounces (150 ml) of
             wine or 1.5 ounces (45 ml) of 80 proof distilled spirits.

          8. The subject has participated in a clinical trial and has received an investigational
             product within the following time period prior to the first dosing day in the current
             study: 30 days, 5 half-lives or twice the duration of the biological effect of the
             investigational product (whichever is longer).

                  been completely resolved for more than 3 weeks prior to screening.

         11. History of sensitivity to any of the study medications, or components thereof or a
             history of drug or other allergy that, in the opinion of the investigator or GSK
             Medical Monitor, contraindicates their participation.

         12. Where participation in the study would result in donation of blood or blood products
             in excess of 500 mL within a 56 day period.

        <title>Mean Total Symptom Score (TSS) Elicited by a 1 Hour (h) Cold Dry Air (CDA) Challenge, 1 h and 24 h on Day 14 to Compare the Effect of 14 Day Repeat Dosing of Intranasal SB-705498 12 mg With Placebo</title>
        <description>TSS was calculated based on a CDA challenge, done for 1 h in a controlled environmental exposure chamber which was validated for 14+/-5 degree Celsius (C), &lt;15% relative humidity and 5+/-3 feet per second (ft/sec) air velocity, 1 h and 24 h post dose on Day 14 (Day 15). TSS was calculated as the sum of the response for 3 components of nasal congestion, rhinorrhoea and post nasal drip. It was rated on a 4-point scale ranging from 0 to 3, where: 0=absent, 1=mild, 2=moderate, and 3=severe (symptom hard to tolerate). TSS score ranges from 0-9 with 0 representing an absence of symptoms and higher scores reflecting more severe symptoms. Weighted mean (WM) for TSS was calculated over the time interval 0 to 60 minute (m) after start of CDA challenge by calculating area under the curve (AUC) of the TSS via the linear trapezoidal method then dividing by the total duration that the participant took to complete CDA challenge assessments. WM is reported as least square (LS) mean.</description>

          <title>Mean Individual Component of TSS of Rhinorrhoea (Runny Nose), Nasal Congestion and Post-nasal Drip Elicited by a 1 h CDA Challenge, 1 h and 24 h on Day 14 to Compare the Effect of 14 Day Repeat Dosing of Intranasal SB-705498 12 mg With Placebo</title>
          <description>The individual components of TSS was calculated based on a CDA challenge, done for 1 h in a controlled environmental exposure chamber which was validated for 14+/-5 degree C, &lt;15% relative humidity and 5+/-3 ft/sec air velocity, 1 h and 24 h post dose on Day 14 (Day 15). The individual component of TSS nasal symptoms were nasal congestion, rhinorrhoea (runny nose), and post nasal drip It was rated on a 4-point scale ranging from 0 to 3, where: 0=absent, 1=mild, 2=moderate, and 3=severe (symptom hard to tolerate). The scores of the individual components of TSS ranges from 0-3 with 0 representing an absence of symptoms and higher scores reflecting more severe symptoms. WM for TSS was calculated over the time interval 0 to 60 m after start of CDA challenge by calculating AUC of the TSS via the linear trapezoidal method then dividing by the total duration that the participant took to complete CDA challenge assessments.

        <title>Mean Total Symptom Score (TSS) Elicited by a 1 Hour (h) CDA Challenge, 1 h Post-dose on Day 1 to Compare the Effect of a Single Dose of 12 mg Intranasal SB-705498 With Placebo</title>
        <description>TSS was calculated based on a CDA challenge, done for 1 h in a controlled environmental exposure chamber which was validated for 14+/-5 degree C, &lt;15% relative humidity and 5+/-3 ft/sec air velocity, 1 h and 24 h post dose on Day 1. TSS was calculated as the sum of the response for 3 components of nasal congestion, rhinorrhoea and post nasal drip. It was rated on a 4-point scale ranging from 0 to 3, where: 0=absent, 1=mild, 2=moderate, and 3=severe (symptom hard to tolerate). TSS score ranges from 0-9 with 0 representing an absence of symptoms and higher scores reflecting more severe symptoms. WM for TSS was calculated over the time interval 0 to 60 m after start of CDA challenge by calculating AUC of the TSS via the linear trapezoidal method then dividing by the total duration that the participant took to complete CDA challenge assessments. WM is reported as LS mean.</description>

          <title>Mean Total Symptom Score (TSS) Elicited by a 1 Hour (h) CDA Challenge, 1 h Post-dose on Day 1 to Compare the Effect of a Single Dose of 12 mg Intranasal SB-705498 With Placebo</title>
          <description>TSS was calculated based on a CDA challenge, done for 1 h in a controlled environmental exposure chamber which was validated for 14+/-5 degree C, &lt;15% relative humidity and 5+/-3 ft/sec air velocity, 1 h and 24 h post dose on Day 1. TSS was calculated as the sum of the response for 3 components of nasal congestion, rhinorrhoea and post nasal drip. It was rated on a 4-point scale ranging from 0 to 3, where: 0=absent, 1=mild, 2=moderate, and 3=severe (symptom hard to tolerate). TSS score ranges from 0-9 with 0 representing an absence of symptoms and higher scores reflecting more severe symptoms. WM for TSS was calculated over the time interval 0 to 60 m after start of CDA challenge by calculating AUC of the TSS via the linear trapezoidal method then dividing by the total duration that the participant took to complete CDA challenge assessments. WM is reported as LS mean.</description>

        <description>TSS was calculated as the sum of the response for 3 components of nasal congestion, rhinorrhoea and post nasal drip. It was rated on a 4-point scale ranging from 0 to 3, where: 0=absent, 1=mild, 2=moderate, and 3=severe (symptom hard to tolerate). TSS score ranges from 0-9 with 0 representing an absence of symptoms and higher scores reflecting more severe symptoms. For Day 1 to 14 of each study period, participants were asked to keep a diary to record their symptoms whilst at home provided by the clinical unit. Reflective rating represented the symptoms over the proceeding 12 h which was performed once daily in the evening (PM). The PM reflective rating was done approximately 12 h after dosing, but before bedtime. If any of the individual components were missing then the TSS was set to be missing for that participant at that timepoint.</description>

        <title>Mean Individual Component of TSS of Rhinorrhoea (Runny Nose), Nasal Congestion and Post-nasal Drip From Day 7 to Day 14 Following Repeat Doses of SB-705498</title>
        <description>The individual component of TSS nasal symptoms of nasal congestion, rhinorrhoea (runny nose) and post nasal drip was scored on a 4-point scale ranging from 0 to 3, where: 0=absent, 1=mild, 2=moderate, and 3=severe (symptom hard to tolerate). The scores of the individual components of TSS ranges from 0-3 with 0 representing an absence of symptoms and higher scores reflecting more severe symptoms. For Day 1 to 14 of each study period, participants were asked to keep a diary to record their symptoms whilst at home on a diary card provided by the clinical unit. Reflective rating represented the symptoms over the proceeding 12 h which was performed once daily in the PM. The PM reflective rating was done approximately 12 h after dosing, but before bedtime.</description>

        <title>Mean Sneezing Elicited by a 1 h CDA Challenge at 1 h Post-dose on Day 1, 1 and 24 h Post-dose on Day 14 to Compare the Effect of Intranasal SB-705498 12 mg With Placebo</title>
        <description>The assessment of sneezing was done based on a CDA challenge, for 1 h in a controlled environmental exposure chamber which was validated for 14+/-5 degree C, &lt;15% relative humidity and 5+/-3 ft/sec air velocity, 1 h post dose on Day 1 and 1 h and 24 h post dose on Day 14 (Day 15). Sneezing was scored on a 4-point scale ranging from 0 to 3, where: 0=absent, 1=mild, 2=moderate, and 3=severe (symptom hard to tolerate). The score ranges from 0-3 with 0 representing an absence of symptoms and higher scores reflecting more severe symptoms. It was used to derive the WM CDA challenge value calculated over the time interval 0 to 60 m after start of CDA challenge and the maximum score. WM is reported as LS mean.</description>

        <title>Mean Change From Baseline to Day 14 of Acoustic Rhinometry (AR) Following Repeat Dosing of SB-705498 at 2 h and 25 h Post-dose</title>
        <description>Overall AR score was obtained by adding minimal cross-sectional area (MCA) for right and left nostril. MCA1 was captured within the nose at a distance of 0 and 2.2 cm and MCA2 at 2.2 and 5.5 cm. MCA1 and MCA2 were captured simultaneously for each nostril, 3 measurements were obtained from each nostril which resulted in 12 data points. Absolute MCA for all regions in left or right nostril was calculated using the 3 acceptable measurements, calculating average of each of right and left MCA’s and also by selecting minimum value from these averages to obtain minimum MCA for left and right nostril. Baseline is defined as the value on Day 1 pre- dose. Change from baseline was calculated by subtracting the baseline (Day 1 pre-dose) values from individual post-randomization values done immediately following CDA challenge. In case of missing baseline or post randomization value, the change from baseline was set to be missing. Adjusted mean is reported as LS mean.</description>

        <title>Mean Change From Baseline in Rhinoconjunctivitis Quality of Life Questionnaire (RQLQ) Following Repeat Doses of SB-705498 on Day 14</title>
        <description>The RQLQ is a 28-item, disease-specific quality of life questionnaire that measures the functional (physical, emotional, and social) problems troublesome to adults with allergies. The RQLQ has 28 questions in 7 domains (activities, sleep, non-nose/eye symptoms, practical problems, nasal symptoms, eye symptoms and emotional). All 28 questions were evaluated by the participant in an assessment diary over 2 weeks of treatment period and was rated on a 7-point severity scale ranging from 0 to 6, where 0=least severe to 6=extremely severe. Overall mean was calculated by summing all 28-item scores and dividing by total number of items in the questionnaire. RQLQ score ranges from 0-6 with 0 representing an absence of symptoms and higher scores reflecting more severe symptoms. Baseline was defined as the value on Day 1 pre- dose. Change from baseline was calculated by subtracting baseline (Day 1 pre-dose) values from individual post-randomization values. Adjusted mean is reported as LS mean.</description>

        <title>Mean Total Ocular Symptom Score (TOSS; Red, Itchy and Tearing Eyes) Elicited by a 1 h CDA Challenge at 1 h Post-dose on Day 1, 1 and 24 h Post-dose on Day 14 to Compare the Effect of Intranasal SB-705498 12 mg Compared With Placebo</title>
        <description>The assessment of TOSS was done based on a CDA challenge, for 1 h in a controlled environmental exposure chamber which was validated for 14+/-5 degree C, &lt;15% relative humidity and 5+/-3 ft/sec air velocity, 1 h post dose on Day 1 and 1 h and 24 h post dose on Day 14 (Day 15). TOSS was calculated as the sum of the symptom scores for 3 ocular symptoms of itching/burning eyes, tearing/watering eyes, and redness of eyes. It was rated on a 4-point severity scale ranging from 0 to 3, where: 0=absent, 1=mild, 2=moderate and 3=severe (symptom hard to tolerate, interferes with daily activities/sleeping). TOSS score ranges from 0-9 with 0 representing an absence of symptoms and 9 representing severe symptoms. These values were used to derive the WM (s) of the CDA challenge value and the maximum score. WM is reported as LS mean.</description>

        <title>Pharmacokinetic Parameter of Area Under the Plasma Concentration-time Curves From Time Zero (Pre- Dose) to 3 h and 24 h (t) on Day 1 and Day 14 (AUC [0-3], AUC [0-t])</title>
        <description>Blood samples for pharmacokinetic assessment were collected at pre-dose (0 h), 1, 2, 3 and 24 h post-dose on Day 1 and Day 14 of each period. The area under the plasma concentration-time curves from time zero (pre- dose) to 3 h, AUC (0-3) and the last quantifiable concentration, AUC (0-t) (24 h) was determined using the linear trapezoidal rule for increasing concentrations and the logarithmic trapezoidal rule for decreasing concentrations. The AUC of non-calculable (NC) due to non-quantifiable concentration measured as below lower limit of quantification (NQ) values were imputed by 0.5 x lowest observed AUC (i.e., AUC [0-3]: 0.5 x 6.4; AUC[0-t]: 0.5 x 6.3). Coefficient of variation (CVb [%]) was calculated as, CVb (%) = SQRT (exp [SD2-1]) x 100, where SQRT is the square root, exp is the exponent and SD is the standard deviation of the logarithmically transformed data. Analysis was done on the number of participants with non-missing observations (including imputed NC values).</description>

          <description>Blood samples for pharmacokinetic assessment were collected at pre-dose (0 h), 1, 2, 3 and 24 h post-dose on Day 1 and Day 14 of each period. The area under the plasma concentration-time curves from time zero (pre- dose) to 3 h, AUC (0-3) and the last quantifiable concentration, AUC (0-t) (24 h) was determined using the linear trapezoidal rule for increasing concentrations and the logarithmic trapezoidal rule for decreasing concentrations. The AUC of non-calculable (NC) due to non-quantifiable concentration measured as below lower limit of quantification (NQ) values were imputed by 0.5 x lowest observed AUC (i.e., AUC [0-3]: 0.5 x 6.4; AUC[0-t]: 0.5 x 6.3). Coefficient of variation (CVb [%]) was calculated as, CVb (%) = SQRT (exp [SD2-1]) x 100, where SQRT is the square root, exp is the exponent and SD is the standard deviation of the logarithmically transformed data. Analysis was done on the number of participants with non-missing observations (including imputed NC values).</description>
          <population>Analysis was done on Pharmacokinetic Population, defined as participants in the ‘All Subjects’ population for whom a pharmacokinetic sample was obtained and analysed. Imputed NC values were derived for AUC (0-3), on Day 1 for 3 participants and for AUC (0-t) on Day 1 for 2 participants.</population>
