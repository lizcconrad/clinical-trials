    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There is consensus that psychological and social factors can lead to physical health problems
      of individuals and coping strategies in stressful situations may be crucial for the mental,
      physical and social development of people. Taking care of professionals who provide health
      services is a key strategy, since good results depend on the service, especially in work
      teams healthy and, therefore, able to promote the humanization of service.

The scale is constructed by 8 different &quot;domains&quot;: confrontation, distancing, self-control, social support, acceptance of responsibility, escape avoidance, problem solving and positive reappraisal.The questions are scored by Likert scale: 0 (not used this strategy); 1 (used somewhat); 2 (used enough) and 3(used in large quantities) to the 66 items (Folkman and Lazarus Coping Strategy Inventory). It performed a summation of items and defined the scores: 0-4 points (not use this strategy), 5-9 (use this strategy a bit), 10-14 ( use this strategy quite) 14-18 (use strategy plenty).</description>
