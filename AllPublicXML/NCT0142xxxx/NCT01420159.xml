    <textblock>
      This study investigates the treatment of acute pain, an unpleasant feeling caused by an
      injury. The overall purpose of the study is to gain more information that the pain relief
      medicine Penthrox(Methoxyflurane) administered using the Penthrox Inhaler(a distinctive
      green, whistle like object that you breathe through) is safe and works at relieving pain in
      patients aged 12 years and older who are admitted to a hospital Emergency Department with a
      minor injury (known as trauma).
