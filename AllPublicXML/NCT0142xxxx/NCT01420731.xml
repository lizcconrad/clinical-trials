      Back pain is a common hormonal disorder in men that may affect the phases of male sexual
      function. The investigators investigated sexual function in male patients with back pain.

      A total of 54 men with back pain and 27 age matched voluntary healthy men who served as the
      as control group were evaluated with a detailed medical and sexual history, including a
      international erectile function index (IEFI) questionnaire and the Beck Depression Inventory.
      Serum prolactin, dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate, free testosterone, androstenedione,
      17alpha-hydroxyprogesterone, estradiol, free thyroxin and thyrotropin were measured. These
      variables were compared statistically between the 2 groups.
