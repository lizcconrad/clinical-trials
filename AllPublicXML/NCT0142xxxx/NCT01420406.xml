  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study will assess the relative bioavailability and bioefficacy of cryptoxanthin (CX) and
      beta-carotene (BC) from food sources for increasing breast milk carotenoid and retinol
      concentrations in lactating Bangladeshi women.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The specific aim is to compare the effects of orange-fleshed sweet potatoes and tangerines
      compared to white-fleshed sweet potatoes and vitamin A as retinyl palmitate on blood and
      breast milk cryptoxanthin (CX), beta-carotene (BC), and vitamin A (VA) concentrations by
      randomly assigning lactating Bangladeshi women to one of four treatment groups for 6
      days/week for 3 weeks.

      The investigators will also compare the relative vitamin A (VA) value of BC and CX from food
      sources by comparing the mean change in breast milk retinol concentrations of the groups that
      receive tangerines (CX) or orange-fleshed sweet potatoes (BC) with the mean change in breast
      milk retinol of the group that receives retinyl palmitate.
