      The purpose of this study was to examine preliminary effect of Computer-assisted Psychosocial
      Risk Assessment tool (CaPRA) among Afghan refugees visiting medical professionals (family
      physicians or nurse practitioners) at a Community Health Center. The investigators examined
      the tool's acceptability among patients and its impact on patient satisfaction and patient
      intention to visit a psychosocial counselor as a proxy of potential to integrate medical and
      social care.

      The recent waves of refugees to Canada belong to regions of prolonged conflict and, thus
      arrive in compromised state of mental, physical, and social health. This complexity asks for
      provision of integrated medical and social care to newly arrived refugees. With this aim, a
      university-community initiative developed a Computer-assisted Psychosocial Risk Assessment
      tool (CaPRA) in Dari/Farsi for Afghan refugees. This innovative eHealth approach is first of
      its kind for Canadian refugees accessing primary care. In this model of care, patients
      complete an interactive multi-risk iPad computer survey in their own language before seeing
      the provider. The computer then generates individualized recommendation sheet for patients
      and a risk-report for providers at the point of care. The tool was developed through a
      collaborative process by working with Access Alliance Multicultural Health and Community
      Services and advisory board with community representatives.

    <description>The study intervention was a touch-screen self-assessment survey which eligible patients completed on a touch-screen iPad in Dari/Farsi language while waiting to see their medical practitioner. The Computer-assisted Psychosocial Risk Assessment (CaPRA) survey had questions on psychosocial risks (e.g., alcohol, tobacco and street drug use, sexual health, personal violence, post-traumatic stress disorder, depression, and food insecurity), cardiovascular risks (e.g., physical activity, weight, diabetes, and hypertension), road and home safety, stress buffers (e.g., coping and social support) and sociodemographics. The tool generated two tailored print-outs at the point of care. The recommendation sheet for patients summarized their disclosed risks in simple Dari/Farsi language along with contacts of relevant services. The risk-report for medical practitioner summarized patients' risks with possible referrals. This was attached to the medical chart prior to the consult.</description>
