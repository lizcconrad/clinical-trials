  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research is to evaluate the effects of DGB-01 on performance of a 40‐km
      time trial in trained male cyclists. The investigators believe that DGB-01 will improve
      performance on the time trial as measured by a reduction in the amount of time required to
      complete the distance, using a computerized cycle ergometer.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>The efficacy of DGB-01 in promoting exercise endurance will be measured by cycling performance on a standardized 40-km time trial course.</measure>
    <time_frame>Individual participants will be followed for the duration of study enrollment, an expected average of 97 days. The study will remain open for up to 2 years or until subject number requirement is met.</time_frame>
    <description>Time to complete the 40km time trial for subjects with DGB-01 intervention in period 1 (minimum 4 weeks of supplementation) versus the time for time trial completion of these subjects with casein in period 2 (minimum of 4 weeks of supplementation); Between the two periods with supplementation, there will be a washout period of a minimum 4 weeks; Results of time trial for subjects with DGB-01 intervention in period 2 (minimum 4 weeks of supplementation) versus the time trial completion of these subjects with casein in period 1 (minimum 4 weeks supplementation).</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in markers of plasma thiol status over the course of each time trial</measure>
    <time_frame>Individual participants will be followed for the duration of study enrollment, an expected average of 97 days. The study will remain open for up to 2 years or until subject number requirement is met.</time_frame>
    <description>A) Plasma samples will be obtained before and during the final minute of each time trial. These samples will be stored at -80oC for no longer than 14 days to prevent sample deterioration.
B) All samples will be analyzed for glutathione (GSH), oxidized glutathione (GSSG), cysteine (CySH), cystine (CySS), and cysteine-glutathione disulfide (CySSG) using high-performance liquid chromatography (Clinical Biomarkers Laboratory, Emory University, Atlanta, GA). Total glutathione (TGSH) will be calculated as GSH + 2•GSSG + CySSG. Total cysteine (TCyS) will be calculated as CySH + 2•CySS + CySSG.</description>

    <intervention_name>DGB-01 Supplementation</intervention_name>
    <description>Approximately one-half of the subjects will initially receive DGB-01. The other half of the subjects will receive casein. Investigators and subjects are blinded to the product the subject is receiving. Subjects will be asked to consume one pouch of their assigned study product twice daily for four weeks.
Subsequently, all subjects will undergo a supplement-free washout period of at least four weeks duration. Following the washout period, the subjects who originally received DGB-01 will receive casein and the subjects who originally received casein will receive DGB-01. Subjects will be asked to consume one pouch of their assigned study product twice daily for four weeks.</description>
