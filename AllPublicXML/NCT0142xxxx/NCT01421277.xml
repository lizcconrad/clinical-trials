    <textblock>
      This study will describe the reasons for triptan utilization patterns (continuation and
      discontinuation) in triptan-naïve participants and assess the stability of treatment
      utilization patterns over time according to standard medical guidelines or clinical practice
      standards of the investigating physician.

    <textblock>
      After study start, the Protocol was amended to clarifiy that the first triptan prescription
      must have been received by the participant within a time window of 3 months (± 2 weeks) prior
      to the participant being identified by the Investigator, and could be enrolled into the study
      within 6 months of taking the prescribed triptan medication for the first time and that use
      of a sample triptan would not disqualify a participant as long as the sample was of the same
      triptan that was eventually prescribed.
