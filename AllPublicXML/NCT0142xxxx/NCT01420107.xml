  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A video of the delivery room management will be taken using standardized conditions. The
      video will be evaluated either locally by those directly involved in the delivery room care
      of this specific infant or anonymously at the main study center. Using a standardized
      evaluation form a set of predefined interventions is rated regarding at what time they took
      place and at what time they should have taken place. The difference in time for all
      interventions is summed up to a score. This score should allow to assess the delivery room
      management in comparison to the desired standard as well as between hospitals. The evaluation
      forms of all centers will be analyzed at the main study center to define correlations between
      certain delivery room interventions and short term outcome.

      Aim of the study is to

        -  gather data on how delivery room care is currently done,

        -  come closer to an agreement between different NICUs towards what should be done in the
           delivery room under what circumstances in which way,

        -  find those interventions with potential influence on short term outcome. Those aspects
           of management that are different between centers and show correlation with short term
           outcome will be the focus of future prospective intervention trials in order to find the
           best way how to take care of preterm infants in the delivery room.

      Hypothesis:

      In preterm infants &lt;32;0 weeks of gestational age a correlation exists between specific
      delivery room interventions and short term outcome.
