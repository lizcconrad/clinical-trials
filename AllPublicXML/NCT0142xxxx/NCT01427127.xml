  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Ramosetron is effective in preventing postoperative nausea and vomiting. Several studies
      reported that ramosetron is also effective treatment diarrhea-predominant irritable bowel
      syndrome. The investigators examine the effect of ramosetron used for preventing
      postoperative nausea and vomiting on bowel motility.

    <textblock>
      Ramosetron, a new potent and long-acting selective 5-HT3 receptor antagonist, is effective
      for preventing postoperative nausea and vomiting. Also several studies reported that
      ramosetron is effective treatment of irritable bowel syndrome because it inhibits the
      accelerated colonic transit, abnormal colonic water transport, defecation abnormality, and
      the lowered colonic perceptual threshold by corticotrophin-releasing hormone. There is no
      study about the effect of ramosetron used for preventing postoperative nausea and vomiting on
      postoperative bowel motility. In this study, the investigators examine the effect of
      ramosetron on postoperative bowel motility.
