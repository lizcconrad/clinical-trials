      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of lanolin for the treatment of
      painful/damaged nipples among breastfeeding women, and to evaluate if the use of lanolin has
      an effect on breastfeeding outcomes such as duration and exclusivity.

    <description>Women randomized to standard care will not receive lanolin or information regarding how to use lanolin. In-hospital standard care may include any of the following pain management measures at the recommendation / discretion of the participant's health care provider, or based on the patient's personal preference: analgesics (such as ibuprofen or acetaminophen); application of cold or warm compresses; application of ice packs; use of breast shields; air drying the nipples; or applying expressed breast milk.</description>
