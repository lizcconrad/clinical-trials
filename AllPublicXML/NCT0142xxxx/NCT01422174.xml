      INTRODUCTION: Sudden cardiac death is one of the most important reasons of death at
      industrialized countries. Despite its importance, nowadays Clinical Guidelines are not as
      extended as expected, with respect to indications for primary prevention defibrillator
      implantation, following MADIT II and MUSTT criteria, especially at Latin American countries.

      OBJECTIVES: This Project is designed with the purpose of providing tools to help spreading
      primary prevention by the means of clinical evidence on real risk of death in this group of
      patients.

      REGISTRY DESIGN:

        -  retrospective (at stage 1); prospective (at stage 2)

        -  multi-center (minimum 25-30 centres)

        -  international (Argentina, Brazil, Colombia, Chile, Mexico and Venezuela)

        -  non randomized.

        -  Sample size: at screening about 12.500 patients and 962 patients at treatment stage

      REGISTRY DEVICES: CE marked (Conformité Européenne) single-chamber, dual-chamber or CRT
      (Cardiac Resynchronization Therapy) implantable cardiac defibrillator (ICD).

      REGISTRY STAGES 2 stages will be performed:

        -  Stage 1 (Screening): 12500 patients with MI and LVEF&lt;40% will be evaluated, to know ICD
           implantation prevalence in such patients at Latin American countries

        -  Stage 2 (Treatment): after patient screening and as per clinical decision, 962 patients
           will be entered in group 1 and 2 (481 each, 1:1)

      Victoria. Malaga - Spain

      REGISTRY DURATION

        -  Patient enrollment period initiation: September 2011

        -  End of patient enrollment: September 2013

        -  End of FUs: September 2018

        -  Registry closure and data analyses: 4Q 2018.

      REGULATORY CONSIDERATIONS As this is an observational registry, no submission to National
      Authorities is required.
