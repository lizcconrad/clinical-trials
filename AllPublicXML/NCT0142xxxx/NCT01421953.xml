  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Computed tomography (CT) images, used for radiotherapy planning, are often caught out in lung
      target volumes delineation because of their inability to differentiate between neoplasia,
      inflammation and atelectasia. Positron Emission Tomography (PET) is a new functional imaging
      modality and is currently used in the diagnosis and the staging of lung cancers. The aim of
      this study is to evaluate the impact of 4D 18F-FDG-PET-CT on radiotherapy planning for lung
      cancers.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Many PET studies have been interested in lung radiotherapy volumes definition, however
      lacking any standardisation. Effectively, the use of PET images is difficult because of the
      poor image quality resulting from noise and partial volume effects induced blurring.
      Moreover, due to the long duration of PET acquisitions, respiratory motions are inevitable
      and result in artifacts in the PET images affecting the volumes and contrast of the tumour:
      tumours may appear larger while their activity can be lower. To overcome these limitations,
      we propose to use a 4D PET-CT, ie a PET-CT acquisition system synchronized with respiration
      in order to compare CT-simulation target volumes and PET target volumes after application of
      different approaches for partial volume effect correction, respiratory motion correction and
      automatic segmentation method of functional volumes. For this purpose, patients with a non
      small cell lung cancer and having to be treated with radiotherapy or radio-chemotherapy
      underwent CT-simulation and 4D PET-CT in radiotherapy treatment position. The target volumes
      and the dosimetries obtained with both modalities were compared.
