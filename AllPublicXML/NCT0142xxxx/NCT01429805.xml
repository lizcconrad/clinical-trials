  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to obtain information on the safety and performance of HipJack
      Balloon Spacer to access the central compartment of the hip and maintain intra-articular hip
      joint distraction during arthroscopy of the central compartment of the hip.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The HipJack Kit is intended to maintain distraction of the joint during hip arthroscopy. This
      study will evaluate the Kit in clinical sites outside of the United States.
