    <textblock>
      Some previous studies has demonstrated that Metformin can improve the weight gain which
      caused by antipsychotics. An our study, which will be published, also found that Metformin
      can improve the amenorrhea for patients with antipsychotics, approximately 60% patients
      recovery period. So the present study was designed to investigate the efficacy and safety of
      Metformin in preventing patients with Risperidone from weight gain and amenorrhea.
