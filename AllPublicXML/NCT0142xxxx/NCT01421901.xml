    <textblock>
      The acute appendicitis (AA) is a very common disease with a life time risk 7-8% and the
      highest incidence in the second decades . The aetiology of AA is still poor understood: the
      commonest hypothesis refers to appendix obstruction followed by impairment of wall appendix
      barrier and thus wall perforation and/or abscess formation1. However some studies suggest
      that no-complicate and complicate appendicitis are different entities allowing a different
      treatment. The study aims to test the no inferiority in terms of efficacy of antibiotic
      treatment compared to surgery in a population with high probability to suffer of 1st episode
      of AA.The study aims to test the no inferiority in terms of efficacy of antibiotic treatment
      compared to surgery in a population with high probability to suffer of 1st episode of AA.

    <description>Surgery:
Rate of reintervention due to bowel occlusion (idro fluid level at Abdomen xRay and/no resolution by Gasytograffin) or intraperitoneal abscess; incisional hernia or wound dehiscence.
Antibiotic:
Rate of Diagnosis of new AA. We will register also the rate of intervention for bowel occlusion longer than 48 hours (no passage of flatus, vomit or combination) or intraperitoneal abscess.
Further secondary outcome are Wound infection, negative appendectomy. Hospital stay and work absence.</description>
