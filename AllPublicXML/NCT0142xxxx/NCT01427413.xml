  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      While the number of assisted reproduction cycles increases worldwide, the introduction of
      actual technological improvements in the ability to quickly and non-invasively identify the
      best embryos for transfer still represents a critical goal for reproductive medicine. Indeed,
      embryo assessment is currently performed through the analysis of morphology and cleavage
      rate. Recent studies have sought to identify a correlation between qualitative-quantitative
      profiles of small molecules of metabolic interest and the outcome of embryo transfer. Some of
      these molecules seem to be best suited for this purpose, including glucose, lactate, pyruvate
      or amino acid levels. Approaches relying on both optical and non-optical spectroscopy have
      been proposed to non-invasively monitor the embryo culture media. However, the non-invasive
      approach only offers an indirect strategy to monitor embryos and a turn-around solution to
      bypass the limits of detection of these analytical techniques. In this paper the
      investigators pave the way for direct assessment of embryos through the mass
      spectrometry-based analysis of blastocoele fluid, which is withdrawn from the blastocoele
      cavity prior to cryostorage of blastocysts. The investigators show how it is possible to
      detect most of the already documented metabolites of interest right at the very heart of the
      blastocyst, without disrupting the workflow of a classic laboratory pipeline.

    <time_frame>2 months</time_frame>
    <description>The method for blastocyst micropuncturing and aspiration of blastocoel fluid is according also to the last literature about blastocyst vitrification. In brief, expanded day 5 blastocysts were removed from culture and transferred to a 30 nl droplet of pre-warmed Hepes buffer.
An injection pipette was introduced avoiding contaminations through the trophectoderm, and blastocoel fluid was aspirated until the blastocyst had fully collapsed around the pipette. The retrieved fluids were expelled into new purified water drops and frozen at −80°C alongside 0.5 nl control droplets of purified water.</description>

    <measure>metabolite detection</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>metabolite detection through rapid resolution reversed phase (RR-RP) high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC)-mass spectrometry (MS). From sample volumes as low as 0.5 nl we could detect and quantify against external standards a group of metabolites, whose roles in blastocyst development and embryo metabolism have long been postulated. The list included i) ATP adenosine triphosphate ; ii) glucose-6-phosphate; iii) lactate; iv) NAD+ nicotinamide-adenine dinucleotide+ and v) NADH and vi) NADPH nicotinamide-adenine dinucleotide phosphate; vii) 6-phosphogluconic acid; viii) glutamic acid and ix) α-ketoglutarate.</description>
