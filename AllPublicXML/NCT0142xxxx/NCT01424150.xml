  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The optimal fluid regimen, haemodynamic (or other) targets and fluid choice (colloid or
      crystalloid) for patients undergoing major surgery are based on rationales that are not
      supported by strong evidence. Practices vary substantially, guidelines are vague, small
      trials and meta-analyses are contradictory. The strongest and most consistent evidence, and
      biological plausibility because of tissue edema, supports a restrictive fluid strategy. But
      other evidence supports goal-directed therapy, requiring additional IV fluid. There is no
      good evidence that use and choice of colloids improves outcome. RELIEF will study the effects
      of fluid restriction, and the possible effect-modification of goal-directed therapy and
      colloids. The first will be randomly assigned; the latter will be measured covariates
      dictated by local practices and beliefs.

      Study Hypotheses A restrictive fluid regimen for adults undergoing major abdominal surgery
      leads to reduced complications and improved disability-free survival when compared with a
      liberal fluid regimen.

      Secondary hypothesis: The effects of fluid restriction are similar whether or not
      goal-directed therapy is used (assessed as a statistical test of interaction). A restrictive
      fluid regimen will reduce a composite of 30-day septic complications and mortality.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators have completed a pilot study of 82 subjects to test the feasibility of the
      trial (2011), and are currently doing a cost-effectiveness substudy (2012-13)

      1. AIM OF THE TRIAL To investigate the effectiveness of fluid restriction (vs. liberal), and
      the possible effect-modification of goal-directed therapy (eg. oesophageal Doppler,
      Flotrac®). The first will be randomly assigned; the latter will be measured covariates
      according to local practices and beliefs.

      The optimal fluid regimen and haemodynamic (or other) targets for patients undergoing major
      surgery are based on rationales that are not supported by strong evidence. Practices vary
      substantially; guidelines are vague, small trials and meta-analyses are contradictory. The
      strongest and most consistent evidence, and biological plausability regarding tissue oedema,
      supports a restrictive fluid strategy. There is less (and more contradictory) evidence
      supporting goal-directed therapy using a flow-directed device and/or dopexamine, and use and
      choice of colloids. A large, definitive clinical trial evaluating perioperative fluid
      replacement in major surgery is required.

      Study Hypotheses A restrictive fluid regimen for adults undergoing major abdominal surgery
      leads to reduced complications and improved disability-free survival when compared with a
      liberal fluid regimen.

      Secondary hypotheses: The effects of fluid restriction are similar whether or not
      goal-directed therapy is used (assessed as a statistical test of interaction). A restrictive
      fluid regimen will reduce a composite of 30-day septic complications and mortality.

    <description>Disability-free survival up to 1 year: survival and freedom from disability. The latter is defined as a persistent (≥6 months) reduction in health status as measured by a 12-item version of WHODAS score of at least 24 points, reflecting a disability level of at least 25% and being the threshold point between &quot;disabled&quot; and &quot;not disabled&quot; as per WHO guidelines. Disability will be assessed by the participant, but if unable then we will use the proxy's report. The date of onset of new disability will be recorded. Further details are provided in the Procedures Manual and the Statistical Analysis Plan.</description>

Because a restrictive IV fluid regimen may artificially elevate serum creatinine due to a smaller dilutional effect from less IV fluids, we therefore calculated adjusted creatinine by first estimating the volume of distribution for creatinine as equal to total body water (assumed to be 60% of body weight, expressed in mL).</description>

    <description>At the commencement of surgery a bolus of Hartmann's balanced salt crystalloid 10 ml/kg followed by 8 ml/kg/h will be administered until the end of surgery. A maintenance infusion will then continue at 1.5 ml/kg/h, for at least 24 hours, but this can be reduced postoperatively if there is evidence of fluid overload and no hypotension, and increased if there is evidence of hypovolaemia or hypotension. Alternative fluid types (crystalloid, dextrose, colloid) and electrolyte supplements will be allowed postoperatively in order to account for local preferences and patient biochemistry, for which we will collect data.</description>

Induction of anaesthesia will limit IV bolus fluid to ≤5 ml/kg; no other IV fluids will be used at the commencement of surgery (unless indicated by goal-directed device [see below]). Hartmann's balanced salt crystalloid 5 ml/kg/h will be administered until the end of surgery, and bolus colloid/blood used intraoperatively to replace blood loss (ml for ml); then an infusion at 1 ml/kg/h until expedited cessation of IV fluid therapy within 24 hours. The rate of postoperative fluid replacement can be reduced if there is evidence of fluid overload and no hypotension, and can be increased if there is hypotension AND evidence of hypovolaemia.</description>

             hysterectomy, and abdominal incisional hernia repair)

          3. At increased risk of postoperative complications, defined as at least one of the
             following criteria:

               -  age ≥70 years

               -  known or documented history of coronary artery disease

                    -  ASA 3 or 4

                    -  chronic respiratory disease

                    -  obesity (BMI 30-35 kg/m²)

                    -  aortic or peripheral vascular disease

                    -  preoperative haemoglobin &lt;100 g/L

        Exclusion Criteria

          1. Urgent or time-critical surgery

          2. ASA physical status 5 - such patients are not expected to survive with or without
             surgery, and their underlying illness is expected to have an overwhelming effect on
             outcome (irrespective of fluid therapy)

          3. Chronic renal failure requiring dialysis

          4. Pulmonary or cardiac surgery - different pathophysiology, and thoracic surgery
             typically have strict fluid restrictions

          5. Liver resection - most units have strict fluid/CVP limits in place and won't allow
             randomisation

          6. Minor or intermediate surgery, such as laparoscopic cholecystectomy, transurethral
             resection of the prostate, inguinal hernia repair, splenectomy, closure of colostomy -
             each of these are typically &quot;minor&quot; surgery with minimal IV fluid requirements,
             generally low rates of complications and mostly very good survival.
