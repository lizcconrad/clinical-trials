      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety of VM202RY direct injection into the
      cardiac muscles of the coronary artery territory where complete revascularization could not
      be done even through Coronary Artery Bypass Graft.

      All the patients expected to undergo Coronary Artery Bypass Graft will screen for the
      participation in the clinical study. Subjects who signed the informed consent will receive
      all the screening tests within 21 days before surgery (Day 0). VM202RY will be injected into
      4 sites or 8 sites on the coronary artery where complete revascularization was not done since
      vascular anastomosis could not be performed due to the bad vascular condition during surgery.
      VM202RY will be administered to Group1 (0.5mg), Group 2 (1mg) and Group 3 (2mg) at different
      concentrations. Subjects will be scheduled to get inpatient treatment during the gene therapy
      period (7 days) and follow-up tests at Week 2, 4, 8, 12 and 24 based on surgery day (Day 0).
      Adverse events and concomitant drugs will be checked.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients aged ≥ 19 and ≤ 75 years

          2. Patients in whom decrease of myocardial perfusion in coronary artery territories (rest
             perfusion - stress perfusion: ≥ 7%) was observed by myocardial SPECT

          3. Patients judged to have possibly incomplete revascularization based on the observation
             of the coronary artery's internal diameter of ≤ 1 mm, diffuse atherosclerosis or
             severe calcification on coronary angiography, or patients judged to have some
             myocardial perfusion territories that could not be performed Coronary Artery Bypass
             Graft

          4. Patients who or whose legal representative can write the informed consent before the
             initiation of the clinical study and comply with the requirements

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients with progressive or present heart failure

          2. Patients with uncontrolled ventricular arrhythmia on electrocardiogram, or who have
             been treated for ventricular arrhythmia
