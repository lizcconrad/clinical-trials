      Main objective :

      To develop the tools for evaluation of humoral and cell-mediated immunity after Yellow Fever
      Vaccine (YFV) and compare virological and immune responses in HIV-positive and HIV-negative
      individuals who had not been given YFV before.

      Secondary objectives :

        -  To develop and assess ELISPOT technology for yellow fever and to measure the response
           within 7, 14, 28, 90 and 365 days of administration of YFV in 30 HIV negative subjects
           and 40 HIV positive subjects (CD4 &gt; 350/mm3 under Highly Active Antiretroviral Therapy
           (HAART) for at least one year, with a viral load &lt; 50 copies/mL since at least 6 months)
           in terms of : (1) seroconversion by fluorescence, (2) cytotoxic response in ELISPOT, (3)
           neutralizing antibody levels in Plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT:reference
           method) and a new pseudotype based method, (4) post-vaccination viremia and (5)
           diversity of viral quasi-species.

        -  To assess the impact of YFV on the T-lymphocyte response against HIV by ELISPOT and
           viral load.

      Method :

      Clinical Trial Phase III, Multicentre protocol at Saint-Louis hospital, Bichat hospital and
      Cochin-Pasteur hospital, with CERVI, INSERM U 941 and SC10 collaboration.

      Trial treatment : Yellow fever vaccination (STAMARIL)

      Criterion :

      Immuno-virologic: At J-7, J7, J28, M3 and M12 will be determined the levels of antibodies by
      fluorescence, at J0, J7, J28, M3 and M12 titles and neutralization with Prnt pseudotypes, the
      ELISPOT response anti-yellow fever, viremia with quantitative analysis and nucleotide
      sequences on phylogenetic strains of viremia. Titles and Amariles kinetics of viremia,
      neutralizing antibodies and ELISPOT will be considered as surrogate markers of response in
      terms of groups.

      Clinical and biological tolerance: At all follows up will be measured the incidence of CDC
      classification events (for HIV+) and general and local reactions of degree ≥ 2 in the setting
      of the injection of STAMARIL®.

      Schedule :

      Date of first enrolment : third quarter 2011. Inclusion period : 18 months. For each subject,
      participation in this trial will be for 12 months.
