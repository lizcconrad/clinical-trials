      This trial will evaluate the 36mm or greater metal head on metal hip system and compare it to
      the 32mm or 28mm metal head on polyethylene (liner) hip system in patients receiving a
      primary cementless total hip replacement.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Male and non-pregnant female subjects 65 years of age or older

          -  Subjects undergoing cementless hip arthroplasty. If a press fit metal articulation
             acetabulum is not possible; the modular cup system will be utilized with screw
             fixation and a metal head of the greatest diameter deemed appropriate and safe for the
             patient will be utilized.(At the discretion of the surgeon). The cup in this situation
             may have a metal or poly articulation. The patient will be followed as an intent to
             treat (the patient will be evaluated and included in the group as randomized)

          -  Subjects with, but not limited to, original diagnoses of osteoarthritis, avascular
             necrosis, rheumatoid arthritis, congenital dysplasia of the hip, ankylosing
             spondylitis, posttraumatic arthritis, and traumatic injury to the hip joint.

          -  Subjects who are able and willing to understand the conditions of informed consent, to
             participate in the study according to the protocol for the length of the expected term
             of follow-up, and to follow their physician's directions.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects undergoing hip arthroplasty using a cemented femoral component and/or a
             bipolar prosthesis.

          -  Subjects with gross obesity, &gt;45% over ideal body weight for age and height. Refer to
             Appendix A, Obesity Table.

          -  Subjects with active infections.

          -  Subjects with malignancy in the area of the involved hip joint.

          -  Subjects with a neuromuscular deficit that interferes with the subject's ability to
             limit weight bearing or places an extreme load on the implant during the healing
             period.

          -  Subjects with a diagnosis of Fibromyalgia

          -  Female subjects who are pregnant or may be pregnant.

          -  Subjects whom, as judged by the surgeon, are not capable of understanding the informed
             consent or the requirements of the protocol, or are reasonably unlikely to be
             compliant with the prescribed postoperative routine and the follow-up evaluation
             schedule.

          -  Subjects who have a known sensitivity to device materials.
