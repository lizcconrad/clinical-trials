  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to establish pharmacodynamics (PD), pharmacokinetics (PK), and
      adverse event (AE) profile of OPC-34712 administered to schizophrenic/schizoaffective
      subjects. The goals of this trial are three-fold:

        -  To determine the effect of OPC-34712 on the individual QT interval (QTcI) corrected for
           placebo

        -  To determine the effect of moxifloxacin on QTcI

        -  To examine the concentration-effect relationship of OPC-34712 and moxifloxacin on QTcI

    <measure>Time-matched QTcI Change From Baseline (Day −1) Corrected for Placebo on Day 11 Following Brexpiprazole Treatment.</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 11 (Hours 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 12, 16, 24)</time_frame>
    <description>Pharmacodynamics endpoint is the time-matched corrected QT interval (QTcI) change from baseline (Day -1) corrected for placebo on Day 11 following brexpiprazole treatment. The primary QT to QTc correction formula (QTcI) was determined for each participant using the participant's baseline (Day -1 placebo) ECG data. The QT correction formula QT / (RR)k was derived using log-log-linear regression, where log (QT) = a + k × log (RR) + ε to estimate the exponent (k).</description>

        <title>Time-matched QTcI Change From Baseline (Day −1) Corrected for Placebo on Day 11 Following Brexpiprazole Treatment.</title>
        <description>Pharmacodynamics endpoint is the time-matched corrected QT interval (QTcI) change from baseline (Day -1) corrected for placebo on Day 11 following brexpiprazole treatment. The primary QT to QTc correction formula (QTcI) was determined for each participant using the participant's baseline (Day -1 placebo) ECG data. The QT correction formula QT / (RR)k was derived using log-log-linear regression, where log (QT) = a + k × log (RR) + ε to estimate the exponent (k).</description>

        <title>Area Under the Plasma Concentration-time Curve During Dosing (AUCT).</title>
        <description>Pharmacokinetics endpoint is the area under the concentration-time curve from time zero to 24 hours (AUC0-24h) of brexpiprazole and moxifloxacin. Area under the plasma concentration-time curve during the dosing interval at steady-state (AUCT) value was estimated using the linear trapezoidal rule; the value reported represent the area under the curves to the last time point during that day. Blood samples were collected on Days -1, 1, 11, and 12 at predose, and 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 12, 16, and 24 hours postdose or at ET.</description>

The number of participants were noted with time-matched change in mean QTcI change from Baseline for assay sensitivity of moxifloxacin treatment corrected for placebo. The primary QT to QTc correction formula (QTcI) were determined for each participant using the participant's Baseline (Day -1 placebo) ECG data. The QT correction formula QT / (RR)k were derived using log-log-linear regression, where log (QT) = a + k × log (RR) + ε to estimate the exponent (k).</description>

        <title>Number of Participants With QTcI Interval Between 30 and 60 Msec on Day 11.</title>
        <description>The primary QT to QTc correction formula (QTcI) were determined for each participant using the participant's Baseline (Day -1 placebo) ECG data. The QT correction formula QT / (RR)k were derived using log-log-linear regression, where log (QT) = a + k × log (RR) + ε to estimate the exponent (k). Participants with QTcI interval change between 30 to 60 msec were presented here.</description>
