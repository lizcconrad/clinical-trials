  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      One-third or more of individuals treated for major depressive disorder (MDD) do not
      experience remission of symptoms despite at least two adequate antidepressant trials. Such
      treatment-resistant depression (TRD) contributes disproportionately to the tremendous costs
      of MDD, in terms of health care costs, functional impairment, and diminished quality of life.

      The promise of personalized medicine for individuals at high risk for TRD is apparent. If
      these individuals could be recognized early in their disease course, they could be triaged to
      more intensive or targeted interventions to improve their likelihood of remission. With the
      proliferation of treatment options in MDD, at present individuals can spend months or years
      in and out of treatment before receiving these next-step treatments.

      At present, no clinical or biomarker-based tool has been shown to assist in matching patients
      with treatments most likely to be effective for them. The Genecept Assay offers the
      possibility of &quot;Personalized Medicine&quot; in psychiatry. Clinicians may find this additional
      genetic information can lead to optimized treatment plans for individual patients. Before
      such an assay can be widely applied clinically, it is necessary to demonstrate that this tool
      usefully impacts treatment outcomes.

      This study will examine the potential impact of the assay in terms of depression severity at
      3 months, with further follow-up out to 6 months. Secondary measures will allow an estimate
      of its potential to change clinician behavior and improve patient quality of life. Further
      measures will also allow for refinement of the assay to maximize patient and clinician
      satisfaction, and estimate the potential savings associated with deployment of this assay in
      real-world clinical settings.

    <description>To determine the efficacy of assay-guided treatment (AGT) versus treatment-as-usual (TAU), in terms of depression severity as measured by change in Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology-Self Report (QIDS-SR), adjusted for baseline severity, at 6 months
Add:
highest score on any 1 of the 4 sleep items (items 1 to 4)
highest score on any 1 of the 4 weight items (items 6 to 9)
highest score on either of the 2 psychomotor items (15 and 16)
scores for each of the 6 MDD symptom domains
Total scores range from 0-27. 0 = no signs of depression; 27 = severe depression</description>

        <title>Efficacy Measured by Change in Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology-Self Report (QIDS-SR), Adjusted for Baseline Severity, at 6 Months</title>
        <description>To determine the efficacy of assay-guided treatment (AGT) versus treatment-as-usual (TAU), in terms of depression severity as measured by change in Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology-Self Report (QIDS-SR), adjusted for baseline severity, at 6 months
Add:
highest score on any 1 of the 4 sleep items (items 1 to 4)
highest score on any 1 of the 4 weight items (items 6 to 9)
highest score on either of the 2 psychomotor items (15 and 16)
scores for each of the 6 MDD symptom domains
Total scores range from 0-27. 0 = no signs of depression; 27 = severe depression</description>
