  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Through the development of a novel treatment targeting core Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD)
      social deficits and studying the efficacy of this intervention, the investigators hope to
      provide a means for children with ASD to more effectively and efficiently process social
      information and enable them to more successfully engage in social interactions. Children
      between the ages of 24 and 36 months and their families may join.

    <description>The intervention will be conducted at our center and focuses on providing an invigorating learning environment in which emerging social skills/knowledge are the focus of intervention with the aim of bringing them to a higher level of maturity, integrated with existing abilities, and used functionally. Learning with and through peers, provides the opportunity to address abnormal peer relationships for developmental level. Providing an enriched environment with toys, structured learning, and opportunities for ongoing engagement we offer the children robust learning experiences. Parent training sessions will focus on strategies aimed at improving child social engagement and communication.</description>

    <description>Parent education sessions will focus on topics related to autism, learning styles, interventions, and resources. The curriculum provides parents with information about child development and autism as well as instructional strategies (e.g., responsive teaching strategies, principles of applied behavior analysis) for use at home to enhance their children's communication, engagement, and play development. Concrete examples for home-based implementation are presented. Each week, homework will be given and parents will be encouraged to practice the strategies daily at home. No direct coaching to parents during interaction with their children or direct intervention with the child will be provided.</description>
