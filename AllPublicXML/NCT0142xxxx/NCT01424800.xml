    <textblock>
      This study emphasizes on the influence of changes in systemic flow and systemic mean arterial
      blood pressure (MAP) during cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) on cerebral oxygenation assessed by
      near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS). The aim of the study is to determine whether variations in
      systemic flow, in MAP, or in both variables at the same time have the greatest impact on the
      cerebral oxygen saturation.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cerebral autoregulation is defined as the whole of regulatory mechanisms that maintains a
      constant cerebral blood flow (CBF) during changes in cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP).
      Cerebrovascular resistance adjusts when CPP changes in order to keep CBF constant. In
      contrast with this concept of pressure-mediated autoregulation, it is suggested that cerebral
      autoregulation is focused on maintaining homeostasis of the cerebral metabolic rate of oxygen
      (CMRO2). We assume that both flow and pressure contribute to the regulation of CMRO2.

      Assessment of cerebral oxygenation - Cerebral oxygen saturation will be monitored with
      near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS). NIRS allows simple, continuous and non-invasive
      measurement of cerebral oxygen saturation (ScO2)and primarily cerebral venous saturation.
      Cerebral oxygen saturation will be monitored with a FDA-approved devices: INVOS 5100
      (Somanetics Corporation, Troy, MI, USA).

      To study the effects of changes in pressure and in flow, we need a condition where we can
      alter these variables separately and in a controlled manner. Therefore this study will be
      performed during cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB). Pressure will be varied with the
      administration of routinely used vasoactive substances, while flow will be varied by altering
      the pump flow manually. We hypothesize that if we change one parameter (pressure or flow), a
      compensatory mechanism will preserve the CMRO2 homeostasis, with no change in ScO2. On the
      other hand, if we change both pressure and flow, we expect a significant effect on cerebral
      oxygen saturation. With 20 % changes in pressure and/or flow, we expect a change in NIRS
      values of approximately 5 %. Previous studies showed that this kind of reduction is well
      tolerated by the brain. This means that the proposed changes are within the normal
      physiological range, and will have no adverse effects.

    <description>When the patient is on CPB, pressure and/or flow will be changed while continuously measuring ScO2. Temperature, CO2 , arterial oxygen content, hematocrit and anesthesia will be kept constant during the measurements. First, baseline MAP (mean arterial pressure), baseline ScO2 and baseline central venous oxygen saturation (SvO2) are determined. With the interventions, we will induce a change of 20% in MAP and/or flow. This is within the normal range during operations. Changes in blood pressure will be obtained by the use of vasoactive agents (sodiumnitroprusside for blood pressure decrease and phenylephrine for blood pressure increase). Flow is regulated by manual control of the pump flow. Values of the different variables will be obtained after a 5 min stabilisation period. Flow/pressure interventions will be randomized.</description>
