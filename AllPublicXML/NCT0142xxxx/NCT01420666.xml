      The purpose of this study is to determine whether the analgesic effects of Maxigesic USA are
      greater than acetaminophen, ibuprofen or placebo in patients who have painful osteoarthritis
      of the hip or knee.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Osteoarthritis is a significant and disabling disease in the developed world.

      Published guidelines for medical management of osteoarthritis from expert groups, in general
      advocate acetaminophen as first line treatment. The European League Against Rheumatism
      (EULAR) guidelines (1)recommend acetaminophen should be first choice therapy in OA, and that
      NSAIDs should be reserved for those patients unresponsive to acetaminophen. The American
      College of Rheumatology Guidelines (2) recommend acetaminophen be considered as reasonable
      initial therapy in patients with mild to moderate OA pain and that NSAIDs be considered as an
      initial alternative in moderate to severe OA pain. The Canadian guidelines recommend
      acetaminophen for mild OA pain and NSAIDs for moderate to severe OA (3).

      A Cochrane Review of acetaminophen in osteoarthritis concluded that NSAIDs were superior to
      acetaminophen for improving knee and hip pain in people with OA. However, it was noted that
      the size of the treatment effect was modest with NSAIDs appearing to be more effective in OA
      subjects with moderate-to-severe pain (4).

      There are many situations in clinical practice where either acetaminophen alone or low dose
      ibuprofen is not sufficiently effective. In these cases the dose of acetaminophen cannot be
      increased to more than 4000mg/day due to toxicity concerns. In the case of ibuprofen the dose
      can be increased from 1200mg/day to 2400mg/day. However comparison of low dose ibuprofen with
      high dose showed gastrointestinal (GI) toxicity increased: the relative risk (RR) of GI
      complications increased from 1.6 (95% CI 0.8, 3.2) with low dose ibuprofen to 4.2 (95% CI
      1.8, 9.8) with high dose ibuprofen (5). Ibuprofen is associated with a low risk of serious
      gastrointestinal complications, but this advantage is probably lost at doses above 1800
      mg/day (6).

      A simple combination treatment whereby both acetaminophen and ibuprofen can be taken together
      as one single tablet and at the same time each day would, if effective, have the advantage of
      increasing analgesia without having to raise the ibuprofen dose above 1200mg/day (1170mg if
      administered every 6 hours) and lose the improved safety profile associated with a lower dose
      of ibuprofen.
