  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Imaging with CT (Computed Tomography) or MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging) is normally used to
      see how tumors respond to treatment. If tumors shrink after therapy, doctors continue with
      the same treatment. On the other hand, growing tumors in a patient can bring about a change
      in therapy. Unfortunately, it often takes three to six months, or even longer before the
      investigators see tumors shrink or grow on scans. Doctors are looking for new imaging tools
      that can look at how tumors respond early on during treatment. This study will help us decide
      if such an MRI technology called DWI (Diffusion Weighted Imaging) can be used as a helpful
      imaging tool.

    <measure>reproducibility of diffusion weighted imaging for neuroendocrine liver metastases.</measure>
    <time_frame>2 years</time_frame>
    <description>The investigators will calculate an ADC value for each metastasis that was chosen through consensus by the two participating radiologists. ADC is a voxel-level measurement so summary measures will be employed in order to get a single measurement for the ROI of each metastasis under study. For both the clinical and research MRI, the investigators will take the voxel-level data and calculate the mean, median, and minimum ADC within each ROI.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>evaluate the repeatability of perfusion insensitive diffusion coefficients ADC high of liver metastases</measure>
    <time_frame>2 years</time_frame>
    <description>A similar application of the CCC will be employed to assess both intra-observer and interobserver variability separately for ADC high as in the primary aim. The repeatability and reproducibility of the ADC high will then be compared to the most repeatable and reproducible ADC measures identified in Aim 1 by ranking the CCC values and selecting the measure with the highest value.</description>

    <description>Patients will be consented for a second MRI without additional intravenous contrast, referred to from now on as 'research MRI', to be performed later on the same day as their clinical liver MR examination, on one of two 3.0 Tesla MR 750 GE scanners at the Breast and Imaging Center. The research MRI will consist only of the localizer and diffusion weighted imaging (DWI) sequences, with acquisition parameters identical to our clinical MRI. The reproducibility of DWI is best assessed in separate MR imaging sessions, although the examinations can be performed the same day.</description>

    <description>Each patient will undergo clinical and research MRI examinations. Before any MRI examination, the patient will answer a standard radiology MR department questionnaire form, with specific questions addressing contra-indications to MRI. The questionnaire form will be reviewed by radiology personnel as per standard practice.
During the research MRI, the patient will be monitored visually and communication will be maintained between the patient and the MR technologists via a speaker system. At the termination of the study, the patient will be evaluated by the MR department radiology personnel as done routinely. Two breath hold DWI sequences will be performed for each patient. Since this is a reproducibility study, identical scan parameters will be used for the clinical and research MRI. The multiple b value DWI will be performed using the enhanced DW sequence that have been recently made available on our 3.0 Tesla MR 750 scanners at the Breast and Imaging Center.</description>
