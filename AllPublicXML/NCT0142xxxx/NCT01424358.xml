      Objective:

      The experimental design is a one-site, randomized experimental web-based educational
      feasibility intervention trial, with approximately 50% primary care physicians (PCPs) in the
      intervention group and approximately 50% PCPs on the control group, giving a total of 159
      participants. All 159 participants have willingly provided their e-mail addresses, as part of
      a survey they previously completed entitled, &quot;Survey of Health Professionals on Oral Cancer
      in Ohio- Intervention to Prevent Delayed Diagnosis of Oral Cancer.&quot;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The main specific aim is to determine the short-term effectiveness of a web-based educational
      intervention for primary care physicians (PCPs) in Ohio to improve the following:Index of
      knowledge of risk factors for oral cancer, and Index of knowledge of diagnostic procedures
      for oral cancer

      The following hypothesis will be explored: The use of a web-based educational module for PCPs
      in Ohio regarding oral cancer will increase the proportion of the PCPs in the high score
      category for the following indices: Index of knowledge of risk factors of oral cancer, and
      Index of knowledge of diagnostic procedures for oral cancer

    <time_frame>An average of 8 months from the time of the initial email sent on 7/21/11.</time_frame>
    <description>The list of participants will be sent an initial email inviting them to view the module and complete a pre test (control group) or a post test (intervention group). Reminder emails will be sent every 2 months for up to 6 months following the initial email. It is expected that at least a 15% higher proportion of Intervention group PCPs will attain the high score category for each of this index, as compared to the Control group PCPs.</description>

    <description>Three years post-web-based education intervention data will be requested from Ohio Cancer Incidence Surveillance System (OCISS). OCISS's cleaning and processing of the data takes approximately three years. Comparison using Chi-square will be carried out pre- and post- intervention years.</description>

    <description>The intervention group will be invited to participate in the web-based educational program. PCPs in the intervention group will be asked to view the educational module which will be followed by an assessment. This group will be tested on the following knowledge outcomes: Index of knowledge of risk factor for oral cancer and Index of knowledge of diagnostic procedures for oral cancer.</description>
