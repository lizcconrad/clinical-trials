      Primary objective:

      To compare the pharmacokinetic profile of PB1023 after a single dose administered by
      subcutaneous injection of two formulations (concentrations).

      Secondary objectives:

      To evaluate the safety and tolerability of two formulations of PB1023 Injection administered
      as a subcutaneous injection in adult subjects with T2DM.

      To evaluate the impact on the pharmacokinetic profile of PB1023 after a single 90 mg dose of
      formulation B (100 mg/mL) administered cold at 2 to 8°C by subcutaneous injection.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Willing and able to sign a written informed consent and follow all study related
             procedures.

          -  Males or post menopausal or surgically sterile females age 18 - 75 years of age
             inclusive.

          -  Diagnosed with T2DM for ≥ 6 months.

          -  HbA1c of ≥ 6.0% if diet and exercise controlled, or ≥5.8% if taking one or more
             glucose lowering agents

          -  Weight ≥ 45 kg and BMI ≤ 40 kg/m2

          -  In otherwise stable health except for T2DM (no clinically significant laboratory
             abnormalities, vital signs, ECG findings or clinically significant underlying disease
             that would put the subject at risk for participation in the study).

          -  Receiving stable doses of concomitant medications for 30 days prior to dosing.

          -  Criteria for Participation in Period 3 only: Received PB1023 Injection at 50 mg/mL and
             100 mg/mL during Period 1 or 2 of the study and had adequate pharmacokinetic samples
             collected for evaluation of their pharmacokinetic profile.

                  Protein/Creatinine ratio &gt; 1.0 (&gt; 1000 mg/g)

               -  Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) &gt; 2 x ULN

          -  Pregnant or lactating females

          -  Known history of or active alcohol or drug abuse within 12 months prior to Screening

          -  Other medical (i.e., acute or chronic illness) or psychiatric condition which in the
