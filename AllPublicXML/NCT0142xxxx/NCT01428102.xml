    <textblock>
      During normal physiological conditions hemostasis (the ability of blood to clot) is kept in
      homeostatic balance by feedback mechanisms. These mechanisms involve an extremely complex
      series of steps on both sides of the coagulation cascade including cellular components (i.e.
      clot formation and breakdown). However, should this homeostatic balance be upset, normal
      hemostasis is affected resulting in pathological clotting (vessel blockage) or bleeding
      (hemorrhage). In instances that include acquired or congenital abnormalities of the
      hemostatic system it is clinically important to diagnose, monitor and manage the patient to
      optimize therapeutic intervention. Moreover, it is important to regulate the hemostasis
      system in the post-surgical outpatient who receives oral anticoagulant therapy to maintain
      the homeostatic balance.

      The TEG® analyzer, using a small whole blood sample, documents the interaction of platelets
      with the protein coagulation cascade from the time of placing the blood in the analyzer until
      initial fibrin formation, clot rate strengthening and fibrin-platelet bonding via GPIIb/IIIa,
      through eventual clot lysis. It displays both qualitatively and quantitatively the two
      distinct parts of hemostasis - the part that produces the clot and the part that causes the
      breakdown of the clot. It shows the balance or degree of imbalance in the patient's
      hemostasis system, highlights any areas of deficiency or excess, and offers a precise view of
      the patient's hemostasis condition. If the system is not in balance, one can see where the
      imbalance lies. If a patient is bleeding, it is crucial to determine the cause of bleeding as
      soon as possible in order to start the proper treatment.

      By utilizing a kaolin/tissue factor activator (RapidTEG™), the TEG® system can measure the
      interaction and simultaneous contribution of the intrinsic and extrinsic coagulation pathways
      which initiate and result in clot formation. This RapidTEG™ reagent can deliver results
      faster than activating with Kaolin alone. This protocol will specifically assess one
      algorithm called MA. MA is a direct function of the maximum dynamic properties of fibrin and
      platelet bonding via GPIIb/IIIa that represents the ultimate strength of the fibrin clot.
      This represents platelet function.

      The objective of the study is to demonstrate the substantial equivalence of MA RapidTEG vs.
      MA Kaolin.
