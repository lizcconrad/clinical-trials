      The objectives of this study are to evaluate the safety and efficacy of 3 dose groups (27, 36
      and 45 mg/m2) of Combretastatin A-4 Phosphate for the treatment of subfoveal choroidal
      neovascularization in subjects with pathologic myopia.

    <description>Combretastatin A-4 Phosphate is administered on Day 0 and Day 7 (+/- 2 days). If the treating ophthalmologist notes any leakage from CNV in the study eye on a fluorescein angiography during the study or an increase in subretinal fluid on an optical coherence tomography measurement, retreatment with Combretastatin A-4 Phosphate is recommended with up to 3 additional treatments. The retreatment visit(s) could occur during a scheduled visit or at an additional visit 1 week after a regular study visit. A post-retreatment follow-up visit is necessary.</description>

          -  Take any drugs known to prolong the QTc interval however subject can remain eligible
             if a non-QTc substitute can be administered

          -  Have uncontrolled hypertension (defined as blood pressure consistently greater than
             150/100 mm Hg irrespective of medication)
