  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether the adjunctive therapy to standard
      antibiotic treatment of BT086 is safe and effective of decreasing the days patients require
      endotracheal ventilation due to Severe Community-Acquired Pneumonia (sCAP).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Severe Community-Acquired Pneumonia (sCAP) is usually defined clinically as pneumonia
      acquired from outside the hospital (CAP) that requires intensive medical care. Mortality of
      (s)CAP patients admitted to ICU range from 35-58% depending on time and admission of the
      patient and has not much improved in the last years.

      BT086 contains a sufficient number of antibodies against the most frequent pathogens as well
      as antibodies against lipopolysaccharides and lipid A. Therefore, it can be assumed that
      administration of BT086 early in the clinical course of a severe infection such as sCAP may
      provide an effective adjunctive treatment to standard antibiotic therapy for sCAP patients.

    <time_frame>28 days</time_frame>
    <description>Each organ system (cardiovascular, haematology, hepatic, renal, respiratory) will be scored using the SOFA methodology.For analysis, a patient will receive a score on each day (Study Days 1-7, Day 14, Day 21, and Day 28).

A day is considered as a vasopressor-free day if a patient does not receive
Dobutamine &gt;2.5 µg/kg/min or/and
Epinephrine (adrenalin) &gt;=2.5 µg/min or/and
Dopamine &gt;=2.5 µg/kg/min or/and
Norepinephrine &gt;=0.014 µg/kg/min for 4 hours per day.</description>
