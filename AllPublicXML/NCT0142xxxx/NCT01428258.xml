  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      For individuals with Phenylketonuria (PKU), the investigators hypothesize that
      glycomacropeptide will provide an acceptable form of low-phenylalanine dietary protein that
      will improve dietary compliance, blood phenylalanine levels, cognitive function, and
      ultimately quality of life compared with the usual amino acid based diet. The study is funded
      by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Office of Orphan Products Development Grants
      Program, R01 FD003711.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Individuals with phenylketonuria (PKU) lack the enzyme phenylalanine hydroxylase that is
      needed to metabolize the essential amino acid phenylalanine (phe). When eating a normal diet
      they show an elevated level of phe in blood that is toxic to the brain. In order to prevent
      brain damage and cognitive impairment, individuals with PKU must follow a lifelong, low-phe
      diet that is restricted in natural foods and requires ingestion of a phe-free amino acid (AA)
      formula. Most adolescents and adults with PKU find the AA formula unpalatable and go off the
      diet resulting in elevated blood phe levels and neuropsychological deterioration.
      Glycomacropeptide (GMP), an intact protein produced during cheese making, is uniquely suited
      to a low-phe diet because it is the only known dietary protein that contains minimal phe.
      Foods and beverages made with GMP are a palatable alternative to AA formula. The long term
      goal is to assess the safety, efficacy and acceptability of GMP for the nutritional
      management of PKU. The specific aim is to conduct a randomized, two-stage, 11-wk, crossover
      trial comparing the GMP diet with the AA diet in 30 subjects with PKU ≥12 years of age
      treated since birth with a low-phe AA diet. The sites are: University of Wisconsin-Madison,
      Waisman Center (primary) and Harvard University, Children's Hospital Boston. Subjects will be
      recruited and randomized to begin the first 3-wk of the study with either a low-phe diet in
      which the majority of dietary protein is provided by GMP or AA medical foods and then, after
      a 3-wk washout with intake of their usual diet, begin the second diet for 3-wk. Dietary
      education will be provided in a 1-wk base period preceding initiation of each diet.

    <intervention_model_description>The study is a randomized, two-arm, crossover trial comparing the GMP diet and the AA diet in 30 subjects with PKU &gt; 12 years of age. Subjects were randomized to start with either the GMP diet or the AA diet which they followed for 3-wk at home, followed by a 3-wk washout period when they resumed their usual AA diet, and then 3-wk of either the GMP diet or the AA diet whichever they did not consume first. Each subject served as their own control; there was no control group. We studied medical foods - either AA or GMP medical foods which are not drugs. The FDA did not require that we have an IND.</intervention_model_description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in the Plasma Phenylalanine Concentration of PKU Subjects Fed the Glycomacropeptide Diet Compared With the Change When Fed the Amino Acid Diet</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline to day 22 on each diet</time_frame>
    <description>Plasma will be collected at each base week and after 3 weeks on each of the dietary treatments, glycomacropeptide and amino acid, following an overnight fast. Plasma phenylalanine concentration (along with the complete profile of free amino acids) will be determined with an amino acid analyzer in the Wisconsin State Lab of Hygiene. Statistical analysis to determine the significance of the change in plasma phe concentration when comparing the 2 diets will consist of ANCOVA with covariates for baseline Phe and dietary Phe intake. The change in plasma Phe concentration from day 22 (final) to day 1 (baseline) was determined after adjusting for baseline Phe level and dietary Phe intake.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Dietary Compliance</measure>
    <time_frame>3 week dietary treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Compliance with the glycomacropeptide and amino acid dietary treatments will be assessed by comparison of the intake of medical food in grams of protein from medical food per day based on subject completion of 3-day food records prior to the final study visit on day 22. Statistical analysis for a dietary treatment effect will consist of ANOVA.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Executive Function Assessed by BRIEF</measure>
    <time_frame>day 22 of each dietary treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Completion of a standardized test, the Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function (BRIEF), by each subject for the GMP diet and the AA diet. Values are T-scores which have a mean of 50 points and a SD of 10 points. A T score of &lt;50 is considered within the normative range. Data are analyzed with a paired t-test.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Vitamin D (25-OH) Plasma Concentration at Day 22</measure>
    <time_frame>day 22 of each dietary treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Vitamin D was measured as a measure of the capacity for calcium absorption. Higher levels of plasma vitamin D are consistent with higher calcium absorption.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Comparison of Phe Concentrations in Plasma With Concentrations in Dried Blood Spots</measure>
    <time_frame>4 times total, 2 per treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Concentrations of Phe in plasma and in dried blood spots collected simultaneously by subjects will be compared using 2 methodologies, regardless of intervention. At each of the 4 study visits (baseline and final for each dietary treatment): 1) venipuncture was used to collect blood and plasma was isolated and analyzed for Phe with ion exchange chromatography and 2) subjects were asked right after the venipuncture to spot their blood on filter paper for analysis of Phe with tandem mass spectroscopy (MS/MS). The discrepancy in Phe concentrations with these 2 methods was compared for each sample pair using Bland-Altman statistical analysis. Each subject should have had 4 sample pairs, 29 x 4 = 116, but we ended up with only 110 sample pairs, as explained below.</description>

          <description>In this randomized crossover study, half of subjects will be assigned to an arm that consists of the the GMP diet followed by the AA diet referred to as the Glycomacropeptide (GMP) diet given first intervention.
Glycomacropeptide (GMP) diet given first: The intervention compares a new low-phenylalanine (phe) dietary therapy for PKU, a diet containing foods and beverages made from GMP using Glytactin provided by Cambrooke Foods LLC, with the usual amino acid (AA) low-phe dietary therapy. PKU subjects in the GMP Diet-AA Diet Arm will follow the GMP diet that will replace all of the dietary protein equivalents provided by AA formula with foods and beverages made from GMP for 3 weeks followed by a 3 wk wash out period. They will then follow the usual AA diet for 3 weeks. Each dietary treatment period will maintain constant intake of total protein and phe and last for 3 weeks in subjects living at home.</description>

        <title>Change in the Plasma Phenylalanine Concentration of PKU Subjects Fed the Glycomacropeptide Diet Compared With the Change When Fed the Amino Acid Diet</title>
        <description>Plasma will be collected at each base week and after 3 weeks on each of the dietary treatments, glycomacropeptide and amino acid, following an overnight fast. Plasma phenylalanine concentration (along with the complete profile of free amino acids) will be determined with an amino acid analyzer in the Wisconsin State Lab of Hygiene. Statistical analysis to determine the significance of the change in plasma phe concentration when comparing the 2 diets will consist of ANCOVA with covariates for baseline Phe and dietary Phe intake. The change in plasma Phe concentration from day 22 (final) to day 1 (baseline) was determined after adjusting for baseline Phe level and dietary Phe intake.</description>

        <title>Comparison of Phe Concentrations in Plasma With Concentrations in Dried Blood Spots</title>
        <description>Concentrations of Phe in plasma and in dried blood spots collected simultaneously by subjects will be compared using 2 methodologies, regardless of intervention. At each of the 4 study visits (baseline and final for each dietary treatment): 1) venipuncture was used to collect blood and plasma was isolated and analyzed for Phe with ion exchange chromatography and 2) subjects were asked right after the venipuncture to spot their blood on filter paper for analysis of Phe with tandem mass spectroscopy (MS/MS). The discrepancy in Phe concentrations with these 2 methods was compared for each sample pair using Bland-Altman statistical analysis. Each subject should have had 4 sample pairs, 29 x 4 = 116, but we ended up with only 110 sample pairs, as explained below.</description>
        <time_frame>4 times total, 2 per treatment</time_frame>
        <population>Analysis of sample pairs is required to determine the discrepancy in Phe levels with the 2 methods. Each subject should have had 4 sample pairs, 29 x 4 = 116, but we ended up with only 110 sample pairs. The explanation for the difference is that several subjects did not provide dried blood spots because research staff forgot to obtain them.</population>
