    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to evaluate the efficacy of SAR 1118 Ophthalmic Solution (5.0%)
      compared to placebo in the treatment of Dry Eye. The safety and tolerability of SAR 1118
      Ophthalmic Solution (5.0%) compared to placebo in subjects with dry eye when administered BID
      for 12 weeks will also be evaluated.

    <measure>Ocular Sign: Change From Baseline in Inferior Corneal Fluorescein Staining to Day 84</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Day 0) to Day 84</time_frame>
    <description>Corneal staining was performed to grade the degree of corneal epithelial cell injury as measured by fluorescence using slit-lamp examination. The staining was graded with the Ophthalmic Research Associates, Inc. (ORA) scale. The corneal surface is divided into three regions: superior, central and inferior. The scores for each of these 3 regions ranged from 0 to 4 (0=no staining/none; 1=occasional/trace; 2=countable/mild; 3=uncountable, but not confluent/moderate; 4=confluent/severe) with 0.5 point increments, and lower score indicates a better outcome. Inferior corneal fluorescein staining scores from the study eye only were reported. Study eye is the 'worse eye', defined as the eye with worse (higher) score at baseline.</description>

    <measure>Ocular Symptom: Change From Baseline in Visual-Related Subscale of the Symptom Functional Scale Score to Day 84</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Day 0) to Day 84</time_frame>
    <description>The symptom functional scale is a validated instrument for ocular surface diseases, measuring the ocular symptoms, vision-related function, and environmental triggers. The 12 items of the symptom functional scale questionnaire were graded on a scale of 0 (none of the time) to 4 (all of the time). The index consisted of 3 sub scales: symptoms (sensitivity to light, gritty sensation, pain, blurred vision, and poor vision [Items 1-5]), visual-related sub scale of the symptom functional scale (ability to read, drive at night, use a computer, watch television [Items 6-9]), and environmental triggers (windy conditions, low humidity, air conditioning [Items 10-12]). The symptom functional scale was scored on a scale of 0 to 100, with higher scores representing greater disability. Negative change from baseline indicates improvement.</description>

        <title>Ocular Sign: Change From Baseline in Inferior Corneal Fluorescein Staining to Day 84</title>
        <description>Corneal staining was performed to grade the degree of corneal epithelial cell injury as measured by fluorescence using slit-lamp examination. The staining was graded with the Ophthalmic Research Associates, Inc. (ORA) scale. The corneal surface is divided into three regions: superior, central and inferior. The scores for each of these 3 regions ranged from 0 to 4 (0=no staining/none; 1=occasional/trace; 2=countable/mild; 3=uncountable, but not confluent/moderate; 4=confluent/severe) with 0.5 point increments, and lower score indicates a better outcome. Inferior corneal fluorescein staining scores from the study eye only were reported. Study eye is the ‘worse eye’, defined as the eye with worse (higher) score at baseline.</description>

          <title>Ocular Sign: Change From Baseline in Inferior Corneal Fluorescein Staining to Day 84</title>
          <description>Corneal staining was performed to grade the degree of corneal epithelial cell injury as measured by fluorescence using slit-lamp examination. The staining was graded with the Ophthalmic Research Associates, Inc. (ORA) scale. The corneal surface is divided into three regions: superior, central and inferior. The scores for each of these 3 regions ranged from 0 to 4 (0=no staining/none; 1=occasional/trace; 2=countable/mild; 3=uncountable, but not confluent/moderate; 4=confluent/severe) with 0.5 point increments, and lower score indicates a better outcome. Inferior corneal fluorescein staining scores from the study eye only were reported. Study eye is the ‘worse eye’, defined as the eye with worse (higher) score at baseline.</description>

        <title>Ocular Symptom: Change From Baseline in Visual-Related Subscale of the Symptom Functional Scale Score to Day 84</title>
        <description>The symptom functional scale is a validated instrument for ocular surface diseases, measuring the ocular symptoms, vision-related function, and environmental triggers. The 12 items of the symptom functional scale questionnaire were graded on a scale of 0 (none of the time) to 4 (all of the time). The index consisted of 3 sub scales: symptoms (sensitivity to light, gritty sensation, pain, blurred vision, and poor vision [Items 1-5]), visual-related sub scale of the symptom functional scale (ability to read, drive at night, use a computer, watch television [Items 6–9]), and environmental triggers (windy conditions, low humidity, air conditioning [Items 10–12]). The symptom functional scale was scored on a scale of 0 to 100, with higher scores representing greater disability. Negative change from baseline indicates improvement.</description>
