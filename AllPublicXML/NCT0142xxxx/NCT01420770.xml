      Primary Objective:

      - To evaluate the efficacy of daily oral doses of 300 mg, 400 mg, and 500 mg SAR302503 for
      the reduction of spleen volume as determined by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).

      Secondary Objectives:

        -  To evaluate the safety of SAR302503.

        -  To evaluate the pharmacokinetics (PK) of SAR302503 after single and repeat doses.

        -  To evaluate the pharmacodynamics of SAR302503 as measured by changes in JAK2V617F allele
           burden in those patients with JAK2V617F mutation, changes in substrate phosphorylation
           in the JAK-STAT signal transduction pathway, and the expression of cytokines.

        -  To measure improvement in baseline Myeloproliferative Neoplasm (MPN) associated
           symptoms, as well as overall impact in quality of life (QOL), through serial
           administration of the Myeloproliferative Neoplasm Symptom Assessment Form (MPN-SAF).

        -  To measure generic health-related quality of life (HRQL) and utility values using the
           EQ-5D questionnaire.

      The duration of the study for an individual patient will include a period to assess
      eligibility (screening period 28 days), followed by a treatment period of at least 1 cycle
      (28 days) of study treatment, and an end-of-treatment visit at least 30 days following the
      last administration of study drug. However, treatment may continue if patients are deriving
      benefit and do not have unacceptable toxicity or meet study withdrawal criteria.

      The study duration will be approximately 16 months which includes a 3-month enrollment period
      followed by a 12-month treatment period following the last patient enrolled followed by a
      30-day follow-up period. The cut-off date for the analysis of the primary endpoint of
      response will be in maximum at the end of 3 months after the date of first dose of study drug
      of the last treated patient. The final analysis will be performed after the last enrolled
      patient completes the Cycle12 assessment.
