      Objective: To assess the accuracy of transcutaneous bilirubin (TcB) measurements in neonates,
      in relation to gestational age (GA), time (postnatal hour) and site (forehead, sternum, knee)
      of measurements.

      Hypothesis: Using (or combining) different sites for TcB determination might improve the
      accuracy of TcB in relation to the time of measurement and the GA of the neonate.

      Methods: The study will include neonates &gt;32 weeks' gestation cared for in the well-baby
      nursery and NICU of the University Hospital of Patras, from September to December 2011. Data
      such as sex, gestational age, gestation and perinatal information, mother's and infant's ABO
      group and Rh, G6PD deficiency, Coombs test, type of delivery and complications, birthweight,
      postnatal medications and interventions, type and volume of feeding, and extension of
      jaundice, will be collected.

      TcB measurements will be performed using the BiliCheck bilirubinometer (according to the
      standard protocol) at 3 different sites: forehead, sternum and knee. Total serum bilirubin
      (TSB) values will be obtained using the heel stick technique, and measurements will be
      performed by a direct spectrophotometric device (Unistat bilirubinometer, Richert, Depew,
      NY). The accuracy of the device has been validated previously. TSB measurements will be
      performed within 5 minutes of the TcB measurements.

      At each occasion TcB measurements (3), the corresponding TSB value, the time of measurement
      (postnatal hours), and the actual weight will be noted.

      Statistics: The agreement between TcB and TSB values will be assessed using the Bland-Altman
      % method. The independent and joint effects of GA and time of measurement on bias will be
      evaluated by multivariate regression analysis.

    <description>TcB measurements performed at 3 different sites (forehead, sternum, knee)will be compared with the corresponding TSB value. The agreement between TcB and TSB values will be assessed using the Bland-Altman % method. The effect of gestational age and time of measurement (postnatal hour)on TcB bias will be explored by multivariate regression analysis.</description>
