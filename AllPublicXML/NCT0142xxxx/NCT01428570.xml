  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Pentax-AWS_ system (AWS; Pentax Corporation, Tokyo, Japan) is a new rigid indirect
      laryngoscope which has an integrated tube passage function. Pentax-AWS improved the laryngeal
      view and facilitated tracheal intubation in patients with restricted neck motion. The purpose
      of this clinical trial was to evaluate the relative efficacy of the AWS laryngoscopes when
      used by experienced anesthetists in Obstructive Sleep Apnea Syndrome (OSAS) patients and to
      compare its performance with the Macintosh laryngoscope.

    <textblock>
      The occurrence of difficult intubation in OSAS patients is higher than in age and sex matched
      control patients. The Pentax-AWS_ system (AWS; Pentax Corporation, Tokyo, Japan) is a new
      rigid indirect laryngoscope which has an integrated tube passage function. Several studies
      reported that Pentax-AWS improved the laryngeal view and guide also facilitated rapid, easy
      and reliable tracheal intubation in patients undergoing elective surgery. The purpose of this
      clinical trial was to evaluate the relative efficacy of the AWS laryngoscopes when used by
      experienced anesthetists in OSAS patients and to compare its performance with the Macintosh
      laryngoscope. The investigators hypothesized that, in comparison with the Macintosh, AWS
      would reduce intubation difficulty, as measured by the intubation difficulty scale (IDS)
      score.
