  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if the menopausal transition is associated with
      subjective and objective cognitive declines that ameliorate in menopause. The investigators
      hypothesize that perimenopause is associated with both subjective memory complaints and
      objective declines in attentionally mediated cognitive tasks. The investigators also
      hypothesize that this is time-limited. The investigators predict that as women transition
      from early perimenopause to late perimenopause their performance on attentionally mediated
      and verbal memory tasks will decline, and that as they transition from late perimenopause to
      menopause, their performance will improve.

      Two groups of women will be recruited, those in early perimenopause and those in mid to late
      perimenopause. Tests of attention, working memory, mental flexibility, processing speed, and
      retentive memory will be administered to each subject at 6 month intervals for 5 years.
      Additionally, women will be asked to fill out questionnaires about their mood, memory
      functioning, health, and quality of life. The investigators will also calculate each
      subject's Body Mass Index (BMI) and waist circumference at each visit. Finally, serum levels
      of reproductive hormones will be taken. Measures of interest will be the percentage of women
      in each group with absolute and relative cognitive deficits, change over time in performance
      on neuropsychological tests and scores on depression and anxiety scales, and correlations
      between cognitive function, mood and hormone level.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        Menopausal status will be based on self-report of menstrual cycles over the past 12 months.
        Early perimenopause is defined as the presence of irregular periods (cycle length differs
        by 7 days from usual). Late perimenopause is defined as at least 2 skipped periods over the
        past 12 months (cycle double usual length) and one period of amenorrhea (over 60 days
        without a period), with at least one menstrual cycle over the past 12 months, according to
        the Stages of Reproductive Aging Workshop criteria.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        - history of neurological disease known to affect cognitive function (i.e., stroke, MS,
        etc) and major psychiatric illness. The investigators will exclude women who are currently
        pregnant or breast-feeding, have undergone surgical menopause, or who have used exogenous
        hormone preparations affecting ovarian or pituitary function in the past 3 months. The
        investigators will also exclude women who have had hysterectomies, but intact ovaries, or
        oophorectomies. Women who choose to initiate HRT at some point during the study will
        continue to be followed, but their data obtained after HRT is initiated will be analyzed
        separately.
