  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Leucine-Rich Repeat Kinase 2 (LRRK2) is implicated in autosomal dominant Parkinson's
      disease (PKD). An inhibitor for the leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2) is in pre-clinical
      development for potential use in treating Parkinson's disease. Patients with PKD have
      cognitive impairments which develop alongside the typical motor symptoms but a full
      characterisation of the neurocognitive phenotype of PKD patients with LRRK2 mutation is
      currently lacking. This observational study conducted on a single visit will assess the
      phenotypic neurocognitive abnormalities of PKD patients with the LRRK2 mutation with the aim
      of identifying potential PD endpoints related to the LRRK2 mutation for future Phase I or II
      clinical trials of LRRK2 inhibitors.

      The Leucine-Rich Repeat Kinase 2 (LRRK2) is implicated in autosomal dominant Parkinson's
      disease (PKD). An inhibitor for the leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2) is in pre-clinical
      development for potential use in treating Parkinson's disease. Patients with PKD have
      cognitive impairments which develop alongside the typical motor symptoms but a full

      of identifying potential PD endpoints related to the LRRK2 mutation for future Phase I or II
      clinical trials of LRRK2 inhibitors.

      Approximately 20 subjects with PKD bearing one of the known LRRK2 mutations will be
      investigated. Approximately 20 healthy subjects without the LRRK2 mutation who are matched
      with PKD patients will also be evaluated.

      Healthy subjects are not expected to be taking medications for PKD. Subjects with PKD may
      continue their medications for PKD treatment throughout the study, Testing will take place
      within 30 days of screening, depending on the subject's availability.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects with clinically significant condition(s) other than Parkinson's disease
             which, in the opinion of the investigator, would render the subject unsuitable for the

             and cardiac monitoring. A subject with a clinical abnormality or laboratory parameters
             outside the reference range for the population being studied may be included only if
             the Investigator and the GSK Medical Monitor agree that the finding is unlikely to
             introduce additional risk factors and will not interfere with the study procedures.

             interview.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Currently taking any prescription medication, in particular medication with a central
             mechanism of action, unless in the opinion of the Investigator and GSK Medical Monitor
             the medication will not interfere with the study procedures or compromise subject
             safety.
