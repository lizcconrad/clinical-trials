      This two-part study will evaluate the effectiveness of etoricoxib in controlling pain in
      participants with osteoarthritis who are experiencing inadequate response to their current
      treatments. In Part 1, all participants will receive open-label etoricoxib 60 mg daily. Those
      participants who experience a clinically meaningful response to etoricoxib 60 mg daily within
      two weeks will be eligible to enter the double-blind withdrawal period (Part II). Responders
      entering Part 2 will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive either etoricoxib 60 mg or
      placebo.
