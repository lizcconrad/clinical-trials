      PURPOSE:

      The purpose of this study is to quantitatively assess the efficacy of monovision correction
      in the treatment of acquired small angle binocular diplopia in adult patients.

      METHOD:

      Twenty patients with symptomatic diplopia were enrolled in a prospective treatment trial. All
      had stable deviations of 10 prism diopters or less for over three months. Each received
      monovision spectacles and/ or contact lenses with distance correction in the dominant eye.
      Half received a +3.00 diopter (D) add and the others received +2.50 D. The validated and
      standardized Diplopia Questionnaire and Amblyopia and Strabismus Questionnaire (ASQE) were
      used to quantify the efficacy of monovision correction for diplopia by measuring the
      functional impact on vision-specific quality of life.
