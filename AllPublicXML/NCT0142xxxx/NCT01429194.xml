  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Articulating Circular Endoscopic (ACE) Stapler is an investigational system using
      endoscopic guidance to trans-orally place plications in the stomach in obese subjects to
      reduce volume and expansion of the fundus and greater curve to abate hunger as part of a
      supervised weight reduction program.

      The primary objective of this study is to perform an evaluation of the safety of the
      plication procedure.

      The secondary objective of this study is to evaluate the preliminary efficacy of the ACE
      Stapler for the treatment of obesity over a 24 month follow-up period.

      This study was originally sponsored by BaroSense, Inc (protocol 11-03). 69 subjects were
      enrolled and treated as part of the study at 6 centers in 4 countries outside the United
      States. On April 30, 2013 BaroSense Inc went out of business and the study was terminated
      with all participating centers' Ethics Committees. At the point of study termination, all
      patients were in the middle of post procedure follow-up.

      Boston Scientific has since acquired the technology and study and will re-initiate follow-up
      to 24 months in order to collect data to support the original safety and efficacy endpoints
      of the protocol. Only the 69 subjects previously enrolled and treated in BaroSense's protocol
      11-03 will be eligible for participation in the Boston Scientific continued follow-up study
      (&quot;The ACE Follow-up Study&quot; protocol 90891629). The Boston Scientific protocol will be
      approved by participating centers' Ethics Committees and patients who choose to participate
      in The ACE Follow-up Study will need to sign a new, Ethics Committee Approved, informed
      consent form.
