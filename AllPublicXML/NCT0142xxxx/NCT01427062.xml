  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Falling is a complex and most disabling feature for patients with Parkinson's disease (PD).
      Previous studies suggested that falls in patients with PD are related to postural instability
      characterized by deficits in anticipatory postural adjustment (APA) for postural orientation
      in walking and standing and inadequate postural response to perturbation. The present study
      developed an innovative balance treatment with focus of anticipatory and compensatory
      postural control and examined its effects on enhancing balance and gait performance and
      decreasing fall rate in people with PD.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Participants: Forty-two eligible subjects with PD were randomly allocated into balance with
      focus of anticipatory and compensatory postural control (EXP) or control (CON) group with
      strength-focused training, with 26 subjects in each group.

      Methods: Subjects in the EXP group were trained the speed and amplitude of anticipatory
      postural adjustment during stepping and walking and postural response to perturbation during
      walking. Subjects In the CON group were trained to improve the strength of lower limb
      muscles. Treatment period in both groups lasted for 12 weeks, which consisted of 4-week
      laboratory-based training (phase 1), 4-week home-based exercise (phase 2) and final 4-week
      laboratory-based training (phase 3). Outcome measures included reaction time(RT), movement
      velocity (MV) and endpoint excursion (EPE) of limit-of-stability test, one-leg-stance (OLS)
      time, gait velocity, stride length (SL), cadence, and fall rate. All tests were conducted for
      6 time intervals including baseline, after each training phase, at 3-month follow-up and at
      12-month follow-up.
