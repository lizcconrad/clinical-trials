  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the success rate of cementless primary hip
      replacement with the Restoration® ADM X3® Acetabular System as compared to other primary hip
      systems in the literature, through absence of femoral head dislocation at 10 years
      postoperative.

    <measure>Harris Hip Score (HHS) score improvement from preoperative score</measure>
    <time_frame>pre-op, 6 week, 1,2,3,4,5 years</time_frame>
    <description>The Harris Hip Score (HHS) assesses pain, function, joint deformity and range of motion. Scores can range from 0 to 100 with 0 being the worst and 100 being the best score. A score of 80-100 is considered good-excellent and a score of less than or equal to 79 is considered fair-poor. 90-100 = excellent 80-89 = good 70-79 = fair 0-69 = poor</description>

    <measure>Patient Satisfaction and Pain: Follow-up Questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>6-10 years</time_frame>
    <description>This questionnaire will be used to obtain the following information:
Satisfaction with the hip replacement
Presence of any pain in the study hip
Surgeries performed on the study hip
Any dislocations in the study hip</description>

    <measure>Radiographic Stability Rates</measure>
    <time_frame>6 week,1,2,3,4,5</time_frame>
    <description>Cases that present with migration of greater than 5 mm in any direction or at least 2 mm radiolucency in all zones will be considered radiographic failures.</description>

    <measure>Short Form-12 (SF-12) improvement from preoperative score</measure>
    <time_frame>preop, 6 week, 1,2,3,4,5 years</time_frame>
    <description>The SF-12 Health Survey is a 12-item patient completed questionnaire to measure general health and well-being. It includes a physical and mental status component score; each ranging from 0-100. Low values represent a poor health state and high values represent a good health state.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Lower Extremity Activity Scale (LEAS) improvement from preoperative score</measure>
    <time_frame>preop, 6 week, 1,2,3,4,5 years</time_frame>
    <description>The LEAS is completed by the participant to assess activity level. Activity levels were ordered in terms of intensity from 1 to 18, with 18 indicating the highest activity level.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>EQ-5D Index Score improvement from preoperative score</measure>
    <time_frame>preop, 6 week, 1,2,3,4,5 years</time_frame>
    <description>The EQ-5D is a subject-completed questionnaire designed to assess subject health state values. The EQ-5D consists of 2 areas; the EQ visual analogue scale (EQ VAS) and EQ-5D descriptive system. The EQ VAS collects health state values using a 20 cm visual analogue scale with the endpoints labeled best imaginable health state at the top and worst imaginable health state at the bottom, having numeric values of 100 to 0 respectively. The EQ-5D Time Trade-off (TTO) descriptive system comprises the following five dimensions: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/comfort and anxiety/depression. Each dimension has three levels: no problems, some problems and extreme problems, where an overall score of 1 represents full health.</description>
