  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The hypothesis of this study is to investigate whether surgical intervention is necessary for
      patients who suffer from cartilage lesions of the knee, or whether this surgical intervention
      can be avoided or postponed by using conservative treatment options such as physiotherapy,
      nutrition supplements, intra-articular injections, bracing.

      Forty patients suffering from cartilage lesions in their knee joint will be selected
      preoperatively. All these patients fulfil certain inclusion- and exclusion criteria. They
      will be asked to respond to 3 different questionnaires. These questionnaires include the
      visual analogue scale to evaluate pain (VAS), the Knee injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome
      Score or KOOS and the International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) form to evaluate the
      effect of their cartilage lesion on activities in daily life. Six months later +/- 20
      patients will have had surgery and +/- 20 patients will have had conservative treatment, both
      groups of patients will be asked to respond again to the 3 different questionnaires. The
      outcome of the results will tell us more of the evolution both between groups and in each
      group separately.
