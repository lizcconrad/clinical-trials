    <textblock>
      There are many different factors that cause acne. So combination treatment using different
      medications that can address these different factors is commonly used to treat acne.
      Fixed-dose combination clindamycin phosphate 1.2% and tretinoin 0.025% gel and benzoyl
      peroxide 6% foaming cloths are both used to treat acne. This study will evaluate the use of
      the medications when used together.
