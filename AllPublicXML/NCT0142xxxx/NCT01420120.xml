      This is a prospective multicenter registry to evaluate safety and performance of the REMEDY,
      biodegradable peripheral stent for the treatment of occluded or stenotic superficial femoral
      arteries. Patients will be followed for a period of 1 year.

    <study_pop>
      <textblock>
        Patients with documented symptomatic occlusion and/or &gt; 70% stenosis of SFA.

    <criteria>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with symptomatic leg ischemia requiring treatment of SFA artery or proximal
             popliteal artery located within the following parameters:

               -  1 cm from the femoral bifurcation in the SFA

               -  3 cm from the proximal margin of the intercondylar fossa

          -  Rutherford-Becker Category 2-5. In patients with bilateral lesions, the highest
             Rutherford Category limb should be treated. Only 1 leg can be included.

          -  Single lesion which can be covered by one stent.

          -  Target vessel reference diameter ≥ 4 mm and ≤ 6 mm (by visual estimate)

          -  A patent popliteal artery free from significant stenosis (&gt;50%) with at least one
             patent vessel runoff as confirmed by baseline angiography

          -  Signed informed consent.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Pregnancy

          -  Previous stenting of target lesion

          -  Acute ischemia

          -  Untreated inflow disease of the ipsilateral pelvic arteries (more than 50% stenosis or
             occlusion). Inclusion of a patient is allowed in case inflow lesions are successfully
             treated during the index-procedure yielding less than 30% diameter stenosis.

          -  Significant gastrointestinal bleeding or any coagulopathy that would contraindicate
             the use of anti-platelet therapy

          -  Known intolerance to study medications or contrast agents.
