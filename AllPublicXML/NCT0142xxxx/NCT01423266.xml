  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research project was designed to study the role of dietary modifications in heart
      failure (HF) patients that suffer from type 2 diabetes mellitus and obesity. Specifically,
      the purpose of this study is to determine whether or not heart failure patients participating
      in a 3-month intensive lifestyle modification program of either a high protein (30 % of total
      calories from protein) group will have a significant improvement in weight reduction, quality
      of life and clinical outcomes compared to a standardized protein (15% of total calories from
      protein) group.

    <textblock>
      Clinical management of heart failure (HF) related to obesity and diet recommendations
      currently lacks a strong scientific basis, and clinicians are divided in their approach to
      diet recommendations for this patient population. It has been shown that in extremely obese
      HF patients, weight reduction improves cardiac structure and function as well as functional
      status and symptomatology. Evidence on the impact of voluntary weight loss on improvement in
      survival in obese HF patients, however, is limited.

      The purpose of this study is to determine whether or not heart failure patients participating
      in a 3-month intensive lifestyle modification program of either a high protein (30% of total
      calories from protein) group will have a significant improvement in weight reduction, quality
      of life and clinical outcomes compared to a standardized protein (15% of total calories from
      protein) group.

      In addition to dietary interventions, participants in both groups with be given an exercise
      prescription and encouraged to exercise for 20-30 minutes at least 3-5 times each week as
      tolerated. They will also continue to receive usual medical care, advice and other support
      for their condition from their cardiologist or medical physician. Both sets of participants
      will utilize self-monitoring tools to assist with diet compliance and behavior change. These
      self-monitoring tools are mandatory and will be collected and analyzed. At each visit,
      subjects will also be asked to will also be asked to have their weight and waist
      circumference measured and, at select visits, they will provide a 24 hour recall to assess
      fullness with the overall diet. Subjects will be given a 3-day food (3DFR) record at
      baseline, which will be returned at the the 2-week, 4- week and 8-week visits, and will also
      complete the 3DFR at three months.

    <description>Patients in the 2 study arms will participate in an intensive 12-week supervised weight loss intervention and will be seen by the same dietician at regular intervals: baseline, 2 weeks, 4 weeks, 8 weeks, and 12 weeks. Participants will receive personalized nutrition counseling and support during each of these visits. Participants will be randomized to either the HP or SP diet and assigned to receive one of two standard structured energy-restricted meal plans (1200, 1500 Kcal/day) based on the computed calorie deficit</description>
