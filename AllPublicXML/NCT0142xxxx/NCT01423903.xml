  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether OPB-51602 is safe and tolerable when given
      daily by mouth to subjects with advanced solid tumors.

    <textblock>
      This study is based on data that support a role for the signal transducer and activator of
      transcription (STAT) family of proteins in oncogenesis. One of the mechanisms of action of
      OPB-51602 includes inhibition of STAT3 phosphorylation. Therefore OPB-51602 is expected to be
      active as an anti-cancer drug. This first-in-human study will characterize the safety profile
      of OPB-51602, evaluate the pharmacokinetics of OPB-51602, identify a recommended phase II
      dose, and obtain preliminary efficacy data, in subjects with advanced cancers for whom there
      is no standard treatment available.

             therapy or for which no standard curative therapy is available

          3. At least 4 weeks since the last dose of prior chemotherapy, radiation therapy, or
             investigational agent.

          4. Subjects must have recovered from adverse effects of prior therapy at time of
             enrollment to ≤ Grade 1 (excluding alopecia)

          5. ECOG performance status ≤ 1

          6. Life expectancy of ≥ 3 months following study entry

          7. Adequate organ function, defined as follows:

               -  Aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase levels ≤ 3.0 x ULN (≤ 5.0
