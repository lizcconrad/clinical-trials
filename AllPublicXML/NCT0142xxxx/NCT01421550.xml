    <textblock>
      The purpose of the present study is to investigate whether or not to perform elective
      surgical repair of umbilical hernias in patients with liver cirrhosis and ascites. There are
      no other randomized controlled trials in this area. The optimal management in patients with
      umbilical hernias and liver cirrhosis with ascites is not clear yet. The general surgical
      opinion is that umbilical hernias in patients with ascites should not be corrected because of
      the supposedly high operative risks and high recurrence rates. Conservative treatment,
      however, can have severe complications resulting in emergency repair. Such operations carry a
      higher risk of complications than elective operations, particularly in this group of
      patients. Prospective and retrospective series showed us that elective hernia repair in this
      specific patient group is safe without major complications or high recurrence rates.

      The aim of this study is to asses the optimal timing of correction of umbilical hernia in
      patients with liver cirrhosis and ascites.
