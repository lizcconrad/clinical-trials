    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to examine the effects of ankle taping on improving muscle
      function and ankle motion in individuals who frequently twist (sprain) their ankle. It is
      thought that ankle taping may increase muscle function and ankle motion which would benefit
      individuals who frequently sprain their ankle.

      Previous research has demonstrated improved dynamic balance following the application of
      fibular taping. The effects of fibular taping on ankle dorsiflexion ROM and muscle activation
      in individuals with CAI are unknown. The purpose of this study is to determine the acute
      effects of fibular taping on muscle activation of the fibularis longus (peroneus) and soleus
      muscles, ankle dorsiflexion range of motion (ROM) and dynamic balance. The investigators
      hypothesize that fibular taping will have similar effectiveness as mobilization interventions
      which have been shown to improve muscle activation, ankle dorsiflexion ROM,and dynamic
      balance. Outcomes will be measured immediately before and after intervention. A crossover
      design will be used and participants will complete two visits at least 48 hours apart, but
      not more than 1 week apart. After participants complete both arms of the study their
      participation will be complete (average time to completion for each subject is 1 week).

    <description>To determine the changes in muscle activation of the fibularis longus and soleus muscles following a fibular taping or sham taping intervention in individuals with CAI. Changes in muscle activation will be quantified by assessing the H-reflex technique before and after intervention.
Hypothesis: We hypothesize that the fibular taping intervention will result in a greater activation of the fibularis longus and soleus muscles than a sham taping intervention.</description>

    <description>To determine the changes in ankle dorsiflexion ROM following a fibular taping or sham taping intervention in individuals with CAI. Changes in ankle dorsiflexion ROM will be quantified using a weight bearing lunge.
Hypothesis: We hypothesize that the fibular taping intervention will result in a greater improvement in ankle dorsiflexion ROM than the sham taping intervention.</description>

    <description>To determine the acute changes in balance following a fibular taping or sham taping intervention in individuals with CAI. Changes in balance will be quantified using the the Star Excursion Balance Test (SEBT).
Hypothesis: We hypothesize that the fibular taping intervention will result in greater improvements in reach distance in all three SEBT directions compared to the sham taping intervention.</description>

    <description>With the ankle in a neutral position, two strips of nonrigid hypoallergenic tape will be applied beginning at the distal aspect of the fibula, wrapping around the posterior aspect of the leg, and finishing superior and medial to the starting point. Next,a strip of rigid zinc oxide tape will be applied to the distal aspect of the fibula with tension.</description>
