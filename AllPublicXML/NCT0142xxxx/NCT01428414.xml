      The purpose of the investigators study is to compare the efficacy and safety of combining
      trastuzumab and paclitaxel based regimen plus carboplatin or epirubicin as neoadjuvant
      therapy in Chinese HER2-positive breast cancer patients. 100 patients from multicenter would
      be randomly assigned into two treatment arms and receive neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by
      operation and adjuvant treatment. The main end point of this study would be the efficacy and
      safety of the two treatment arms, and the trend of the two curves is anticipated.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      With the increased awareness and development of the diagnosis of breast cancer, more and more
      breast cancer is diagnosed at early. Amplification or overexpression, or both, of human
      epidermal growth factor receptor-2 (HER2, also known as ERBB2), a transmembrane receptor
      tyrosine kinase, is present in around 22% of early breast cancers, 35% of locally advanced
      and metastatic tumors, and 40% of inflammatory breast cancers, and is associated with
      aggressive disease and poor prognosis. The significant efficacy and good safety profile of
      Trastuzumab targeting HER 2 combination with chemotherapy as adjuvant treatment on EBC are
      accepted. Currently Trastuzumab has moved to Neoadjuvant treatment combined with chemotherapy
      based on many publications, among them pCR is accepted as primary endpoint to evaluate the
      efficacy of neoadjuvant therapy.

      In the investigators study, Trastuzumab was concomitantly administered with different
      chemotherapies after randomization to determine the effect of this approach on the pathologic
      CR rates. 100 patients from multicenter would be randomly assigned into two treatment arms
      and receive neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by operation and adjuvant treatment.
      Pathological complete response rate (pCR), disease free survival (DFS), response rates (RR),
      percentage of conserving breast surgery and adverse events including Serious AEs and
      non-serious AEs would be compared. The follow up time for each patients would be 3 years at
      most.
