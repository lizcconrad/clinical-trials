      A follow-up study of 191 patients operated on with the TVT procedure between January 1998 and
      May 2000 at the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology in the Turku City Hospital. After a
      mean of 10.5 years patients were invited to a follow-up visit. Subjective outcome was
      evaluated with condition-specific and general quality of life and health questionnaires.
      Objective outcome was evaluated with gynaecological examination and a supine stress test.
      Objective cure was defined as a negative stress test and no need for a reoperation for SUI
      and subjective cure.
