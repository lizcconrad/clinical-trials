  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, multicenter, phase 2 clinical trial to evaluate the efficacy and
      safety of brentuximab vedotin as a single agent in patients with CD30-positive non-Hodgkin
      lymphoma (NHL) (Part A). The study will also evaluate the safety and efficacy of brentuximab
      vedotin in combination with rituximab in patients with relapsed or refractory diffuse large
      B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) (Part B) as well as further evaluate correlation of CD30 expression
      and response in DLBCL (Part C).

    <description>Counts of participants who had treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAE, defined as newly occurring or worsening after first dose on Study SGN35-012). Serious adverse events are reported from the time of informed consent. National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE version 4.03) were used to assess severity (1=mild, 2=moderate, 3=severe, 4=life-threatening/disabling, 5=fatal). Relatedness to study drug was assessed by the investigator (Yes/No). Participants with multiple occurrences of an adverse event within a category are counted once within the category.</description>
