  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine how efficient the combination of rituximab,
      cyclophosphamide, vincristine, and prednisolone (R-CVP) is in the treatment of stage I or II
      non-conjunctival ocular adnexal MALT lymphoma (OAML).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The treatment of stage I or II OAML is mainly composed of radiotherapy because chemotherapy
      including cyclophosphamide, vincristine, and prednisolone (CVP) did not show the acceptable
      response rate compared with radiotherapy. However, radiotherapy for this disease can cause
      many complications of eyes. This clinical trial was designed to examine the efficacy of R-CVP
      combination therapy as a first-line treatment for stage I or II non-conjunctival OAML aiming
      to avoid radiation hazard and increase the efficacy of CVP chemotherapy.

             upper normal value

          -  Adequate renal function:serum creatinine level &lt;2 mg/dL (177 μmol/L)

          -  Life expectancy ≥ 6 months
