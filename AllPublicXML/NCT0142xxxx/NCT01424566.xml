  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of nabiximols (Sativex®),
      compared with placebo, when used as an adjunctive measure in relieving uncontrolled
      persistent chronic pain (not breakthrough pain) in participants with advanced cancer, who had
      inadequate analgesia even with optimized chronic opioid therapy.

      This multi-center study was conducted in two parts. All participants enrolled into the trial
      received nabiximols during one of two parts of the study, but they did not know which part.

      Eligible participants were not required to stop any of their current treatments or
      medications.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This 11-week, multi-center, placebo-controlled study aimed to determine the efficacy, safety
      and tolerability of nabiximols administered as an adjunctive treatment for 5 weeks, versus
      placebo, assessed by a 2-part, randomized withdrawal design. The first part of the study
      (Part A) was single-blind (participants) and the second part of the study (Part B) was
      randomized, double-blind. Eligible participants had advanced cancer, with a clinical
      diagnosis of cancer related pain which was not wholly alleviated by their current optimized
      opioid treatment.

      Qualifying participants entered the study at screening and commenced a 5- to 14-day
      eligibility period. During this period, eligible participants had 3 consecutive days where
      pain severity remained within defined parameters, break-through opioid usage had not exceeded
      an average of 4 episodes per day, and maintenance opioid medication and dose had not changed.
      Eligible participants underwent nabiximols titration during a single-blind treatment period
      lasting 10 days, followed by 4 days of therapy at the titrated dose. Participants who
      demonstrated an improvement of 15% or more on the score of the pain numerical rating scale
      were advanced to Part B, where they were randomized 1:1 to nabiximols or placebo in a
      double-blind fashion. Participants then received study treatments at their self-titrated
      doses for 5 weeks. After the end of the 5-week treatment period, participants were offered
      the option of entering an open-label extension (OLE) study; participants who entered the OLE
      up to 7 days after study completion had their follow-up assessments performed on the same day
      as their first OLE study visit. Participants that did not enter the OLE study had a safety
      follow up visit 14 days after treatment completion, which could be via telephone.

    <measure>Change From Randomization Baseline In Mean NRS Average Pain At End Of Treatment</measure>
    <time_frame>Randomization Baseline, End of Treatment (Day 36 of the double-blind period)</time_frame>
    <description>Participants indicated the level of pain experienced in the last 24 hours on an 11-point NRS, where a score of 0 indicated &quot;no pain&quot; and a score of 10 indicated &quot;pain as bad as you can imagine.&quot; Change in mean NRS average pain was calculated as: End of Treatment NRS average pain score - Randomization (Part B) Baseline NRS average pain score. The participant's Randomization (Part B) baseline pain 0-10 NRS value was the mean over the last 4 consecutive days of the single-blind treatment period (Part A; pre-randomization). A negative value indicates an improvement in average pain score from Randomization (Part B) Baseline.</description>

    <measure>Percent Improvement From Eligibility Baseline In Mean NRS Average Pain Score At End Of Treatment</measure>
    <time_frame>Eligibility Baseline, End of Treatment (Day 36 of the double-blind period)</time_frame>
    <description>Participants indicated level of pain in the last 24 hours on an 11-point NRS, where a score of 0 was &quot;no pain&quot; and 10 was &quot;pain as bad as you can imagine&quot;. Eligibility Baseline = mean score from the 3-day eligibility period. End of Treatment = mean score over last (up to) 4 days to the final pain score at End of Treatment or up until Day 36 of the double-blind period, whichever is earlier, or final score available (prematurely terminated).
Percentage improvement from baseline (Imp%) was calculated as:
Imp% = (Eligibility Baseline pain NRS mean - End of Treatment pain NRS mean)/Eligibility Baseline pain NRS mean * 100.
For participants who died or withdrew due to disease progression, Imp% values were used. For participants who died or withdrew unrelated to disease progression before end of Week 5, Imp% was zero for participants whose Imp% value was positive and it was Imp% for participants whose Imp% value was not positive.</description>

    <measure>Change From Randomization Baseline In Daily Total Opioid Use (Morphine Equivalent) At End Of Treatment</measure>
    <time_frame>Randomization Baseline, End of Treatment (Day 36 of the double-blind period)</time_frame>
    <description>The total daily opioid use (in morphine equivalence) was the sum of morphine equivalence of daily maintenance dose and break-through dose.
Change in daily total opioid use was calculated as: End of Treatment daily total opioid use - Randomization (Part B) Baseline daily total opioid use. The participant's Randomization (Part B) baseline daily total opioid use value was the mean over the last 4 consecutive days of the single-blind treatment period (Part A; pre-randomization). A negative value indicates a decrease in use from Randomization (Part B) Baseline.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Randomization Baseline In Daily Maintenance Opioid Dose (Morphine Equivalent) At End Of Treatment</measure>
    <time_frame>Randomization Baseline, End of Treatment (Day 36 of the double-blind period)</time_frame>
    <description>The prescribed daily quantity of opioid maintenance dose was calculated as the product of dose per use and daily frequency of use. Participants were asked: &quot;Have you used your maintenance dose painkiller today as prescribed?&quot; If the participant answered &quot;No&quot; to the question, the daily opioid maintenance dose usage on that day was set to 0.
Change in daily maintenance opioid dose was calculated as: End of Treatment daily maintenance opioid dose - Randomization (Part B) Baseline daily maintenance opioid dose. The participant's Randomization (Part B) baseline daily maintenance opioid dose value was the mean over the last 4 consecutive days of the single-blind treatment period (Part A; pre-randomization). A negative value indicates a decrease in dose from Randomization (Part B) Baseline.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Randomization Baseline In Daily Break-through Opioid Dose (Morphine Equivalent) At End Of Treatment</measure>
    <time_frame>Randomization Baseline, End of Treatment (Day 36 of the double-blind period)</time_frame>
    <description>Daily break-through opioid dose usage was calculated as the product of prescribed dose per use, and the number of uses per day. If participants took more than 1 different break-through opioid for more than 1 day, the sum of morphine equivalence dose usages for each break-through opioid was calculated for the summary.
Change in daily break-through opioid dose was calculated as: End of Treatment daily break-through opioid dose - Randomization (Part B) Baseline daily maintenance opioid dose. The participant's Randomization (Part B) baseline daily break-through opioid dose value was the mean over the last 4 consecutive days of the single-blind treatment period (Part A; pre-randomization). A negative value indicates a decrease in dose from Randomization (Part B) Baseline.</description>

    <measure>Change From Randomization Baseline In NRS Constipation At Last Visit (Up To Day 36 Of The Double-blind Period)</measure>
    <time_frame>Randomization Baseline, Last Visit (up to Day 36 of the double-blind period)</time_frame>
    <description>Participants indicated level of constipation on an 11-point NRS, where a score of 0 was &quot;no constipation&quot;, and 10 was &quot;constipation as bad as you can imagine.&quot; Last visit refers to the last visit that a participant completed the assessment.
Change in NRS constipation score was calculated as: Last Visit NRS constipation score - Randomization (Part B) Baseline NRS constipation score. The participant's Randomization (Part B) baseline constipation NRS value was the last evaluation (including unscheduled visits) in the single-blind treatment period (Part A) prior to the first dose of study drug in the double-blind treatment period (Part B). A negative value indicates improvement in condition from Randomization (Part B) Baseline.</description>

          <title>Single-blind Nabiximols</title>
          <description>Nabiximols was self-administered by participants as a 100 microliter (μL) oromucosal spray in the morning and evening, up to a maximum of 10 sprays per day, for 2 weeks. Nabiximols oromucosal spray contained delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) (27 milligrams [mg]/milliliter [mL]):cannabidiol (CBD) (25 mg/mL), in ethanol:propylene glycol (50:50) excipients, with peppermint oil flavoring. Each 100 μL actuation delivered 2.7 mg THC and 2.5 mg CBD.</description>

          <description>Nabiximols was self-administered by participants as a 100 μL oromucosal spray in the morning and evening, for 5 weeks, at the same level of dosing attained during the last 4 days of the single-blind period; however, the number of sprays could be decreased based upon tolerability throughout the study. Nabiximols oromucosal spray contained THC (27 mg/mL):CBD (25 mg/mL), in ethanol:propylene glycol (50:50) excipients, with peppermint oil flavoring. Each 100 μL actuation delivered 2.7 mg THC and 2.5 mg CBD. To enter the double-blind treatment period (Part B), participants had to achieve at least a 15% improvement in Numerical Rating Scale (NRS) pain scores during the single-blind treatment period (Part A).</description>

        <description>Participants indicated level of pain in the last 24 hours on an 11-point NRS, where a score of 0 was “no pain” and 10 was “pain as bad as you can imagine”. Eligibility Baseline = mean score from the 3-day eligibility period. End of Treatment = mean score over last (up to) 4 days to the final pain score at End of Treatment or up until Day 36 of the double-blind period, whichever is earlier, or final score available (prematurely terminated).
Percentage improvement from baseline (Imp%) was calculated as:
Imp% = (Eligibility Baseline pain NRS mean - End of Treatment pain NRS mean)/Eligibility Baseline pain NRS mean * 100.
For participants who died or withdrew due to disease progression, Imp% values were used. For participants who died or withdrew unrelated to disease progression before end of Week 5, Imp% was zero for participants whose Imp% value was positive and it was Imp% for participants whose Imp% value was not positive.</description>

        <description>Participants indicated the level of worst pain experienced in the last 24 hours on an 11-point NRS, where a score of 0 indicated “no pain” and a score of 10 indicated “pain as bad as you can imagine.” Change in mean NRS worst pain was calculated as: End of Treatment NRS worst pain score - Randomization (Part B) Baseline NRS worst pain score. The participant's Randomization (Part B) baseline worst pain 0-10 NRS value was the mean over the last 4 consecutive days of the single-blind treatment period (Part A; pre-randomization). A negative value indicates an improvement in worst pain score from Randomization (Part B) Baseline.</description>

Nabiximols oromucosal spray contained THC (27 mg/mL):CBD (25 mg/mL), in ethanol:propylene glycol (50:50) excipients, with peppermint oil flavoring. Each 100 μL actuation delivered 2.7 mg THC and 2.5 mg CBD. To enter the double-blind treatment period (Part B), participants had to achieve at least a 15% improvement in NRS pain scores during the single-blind treatment period (Part A).</description>

          <title>Change From Randomization Baseline In Daily Break-through Opioid Dose (Morphine Equivalent) At End Of Treatment</title>
          <description>Daily break-through opioid dose usage was calculated as the product of prescribed dose per use, and the number of uses per day. If participants took more than 1 different break-through opioid for more than 1 day, the sum of morphine equivalence dose usages for each break-through opioid was calculated for the summary.
Change in daily break-through opioid dose was calculated as: End of Treatment daily break-through opioid dose - Randomization (Part B) Baseline daily maintenance opioid dose. The participant's Randomization (Part B) baseline daily break-through opioid dose value was the mean over the last 4 consecutive days of the single-blind treatment period (Part A; pre-randomization). A negative value indicates a decrease in dose from Randomization (Part B) Baseline.</description>

        <description>Participants indicated level of constipation on an 11-point NRS, where a score of 0 was “no constipation”, and 10 was “constipation as bad as you can imagine.” Last visit refers to the last visit that a participant completed the assessment.
Change in NRS constipation score was calculated as: Last Visit NRS constipation score - Randomization (Part B) Baseline NRS constipation score. The participant's Randomization (Part B) baseline constipation NRS value was the last evaluation (including unscheduled visits) in the single-blind treatment period (Part A) prior to the first dose of study drug in the double-blind treatment period (Part B). A negative value indicates improvement in condition from Randomization (Part B) Baseline.</description>
