      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the relative effectiveness of two different ways to
      teach subjects while hospitalized how to use respiratory inhalers and to follow-up after
      discharge home from the hospital to determine durability of the education.

      Teach-to-Goal (TTG) education employs instruction followed by patient &quot;teach-back,&quot; then
      repeated cycles of learning and assessment until a skill is mastered. By contrast, Brief
      Intervention (BI) education only consists of providing the patient with verbal and written
      instruction.

      The investigators hypothesize that hospital-based TTG compared to BI increases a patient's
      ability to retain instructions on respiratory inhaler technique. The investigators will test
      this hypothesis separately for the MDI and Diskus® devices after discharge.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Respiratory inhalers are often used incorrectly by patients with obstructive lung disorders
      (including patients hospitalized with exacerbations of asthma or chronic obstructive
      pulmonary disease (COPD). As the mainstay of bronchodilator and anti-inflammatory therapy in
      patients with OLD, the implication of this difficulty with self-management is that patients
      are at risk for under-treatment and worse health outcomes. Several factors are thought to
      contribute to poor self-management skills, particularly inadequate patient education at
      healthcare encounters and inadequate patient health literacy. However, the most effective
      strategy to instruct patients about respiratory inhaler use in hospital settings is unclear,
      particularly in populations enriched with inadequate health literacy.

      Therefore, the overall goal of this study is to evaluate the relative effectiveness of two
      hospital-based educational interventions: Teach-To-Goal (TTG, iterative cycles of
      demonstration-based education and assessment) versus Brief Intervention (BI, one-time set of
      verbal instructions) on the durability of instructions provided in the hospital and its
      effect on clinical outcomes (e.g., respiratory events and/or death), post hospital discharge.
      The investigators also plan to evaluate whether the relative effectiveness of TTG vs. BI
      varies by level of health literacy. The objectives of this proposal are to conduct a study in
      adults hospitalized with asthma/COPD to 1) to evaluate the relative effectiveness of
      hospital-based TTG versus BI on patients' ability to retain instruction about the correct use
      of MDI and Diskus® devices after discharge home and 2) To determine the relative
      effectiveness of TTG compared to BI for patients with less-than-adequate health literacy
      compared to those with adequate health literacy. These data will inform the development of a
      larger, multi-center clinical trial.
