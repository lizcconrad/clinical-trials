  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a randomized, double-blind, ascending dose, placebo-controlled, incomplete
      crossover, single and multiple dose study in healthy Japanese male subjects to assess the
      pharmacokinetics and safety/tolerability of single and multiple intravenous administration of
      GR121167. Serial blood samples and pooled urine samples for the determination of GR121167
      concentration will be collected and safety assessments will be performed for each treatment
      period.

      The pharmacokinetics and dose proportionality of GR121167 after single intravenous
      administration of GR121167 at the dose levels of 100 mg, 300 mg and 600 mg will be assessed.
      In addition, in the final treatment period (600 mg), twice daily intravenous administrations
      for 5 days will be also conducted and the pharmacokinetics and accumulation will be assessed.

          1. Healthy as defined as being free from clinically significant illness or disease as
             determined by a responsible and experienced physician, based on a medical evaluation
