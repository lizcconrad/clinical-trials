      Background:

      - Spondyloarthritis (SpA) is a group of bone and joint disorders that may cause back and
      joint pain and stiffness. In some cases, SpA can lead to abnormal bone growth affecting the
      joints and spine. Some patients have SpA without ever developing these growths, while others
      develop them after only a few years. Researchers are interested in studying people with SpA
      and their relatives to determine which people are more likely to develop more severe
      conditions.

      Objectives:

      - To identify symptoms and medical tests that can help determine whether a person with SpA is
      at risk for developing more severe forms of the disease.

      Eligibility:

        -  Individuals of any age who have been diagnosed with SpA.

        -  Healthy volunteer relatives (at least 6 years of age) of the individuals with SpA.

      Design:

        -  Participants will be screened with medical records and family medical histories, and
           will be invited to the clinical center for the study.

        -  Participants with SpA will have a physical exam and medical history, including a study
           of joint movement, blood and urine tests, and questionnaires about pain and quality of
           life.

        -  Participants with SpA will have imaging studies, including magnetic resonance imaging
           (MRI). Other samples such as skin tissue and bone marrow may also be collected for
           study.

        -  Healthy volunteers will provide a blood sample and cheek cell samples.

        -  No treatment will be provided, although treatment options will be discussed.

      The purpose of this protocol is to study the natural history of spondyloarthritis (SpA) in
      children and adults. Spondyloarthritis encompasses a spectrum of immune-mediated inflammatory
      diseases that exhibit overlapping features, but differ from other types of inflammatory
      arthritis in genetic predisposition, pathogenesis, and outcome. Ankylosing spondylitis (AS),
      the most common form of SpA, frequently begins in an undifferentiated form with back pain and
      stiffness in adults, and leads to aberrant ossification and ankylosis (fusion) of the spine.
      In children, SpA rarely presents with back pain, but instead often begins with pain and
      stiffness in the hips and knees due to arthritis. Enthesitis, or inflammation where tendons
      and ligaments connect to bones, is more common in children. Our ability to recognize early
      forms of AS involving the axial skeleton, particularly in children, and our understanding of
      the cause and progression of this disease, is limited.

      The goals of this natural history protocol are to establish a cohort of pediatric and adult
      patients with SpA to prospectively evaluate the signs and symptoms, magnetic resonance
      imaging (MRI) and X-ray findings, and bone and inflammatory biomarkers associated with axial
      disease. We will study pathogenic mechanisms including the role of AS susceptibility genes
      and their variants in causing disease, and will identify patients for possible entry into
      future treatment studies.

      Patients enrolled in this protocol will undergo a history, physical examination, imaging
      studies, and laboratory evaluation. When clinically indicated, patients may also be evaluated
      for extra-articular manifestations such as acute anterior uveitis, psoriasis or other skin
      problems, and inflammatory bowel disease. Peripheral blood samples will be collected from
      affected patients, unrelated healthy volunteers, and in some cases unaffected family members
      to help identify and study the genes involved in SpA and their functions. We may ask some
      patients to undergo skin biopsy or bone marrow aspiration for research purposes. For a small
      number of patients and family members, we may ask permission to perform whole genome or exome
      sequencing. Fibroblasts and/or peripheral blood cells obtained from patients will be induced
      to become pluripotent stem cells that can be maintained indefinitely in culture and
      differentiated into cell types that are relevant to pathogenesis. Successful completion of
      these studies will allow rheumatologists to better recognize early SpA with axial
      involvement, particularly in children, and will improve our understanding of disease
      pathogenesis.

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:

        Subjects with known or suspected SpA will provide informed consent and then be evaluated
        either in the outpatient or inpatient unit of the NIH Clinical Center. To be eligible for
        follow-up visits patients must meet the Inclusion Criteria, but not the Exclusion criteria.
        Subjects determined to not have SpA will not be followed.

        Patients with signs and symptoms of SpA will be classified as outlined in #1 and #2 below
        (see Appendix 10.1 for Classification Criteria):

          1. Patients less than 16 years of age will be considered to have SpA if they meet the
             ILAR criteria for ERA (without or with psoriasis or a positive family history of
             psoriasis), or modified NY criteria for AS.

          2. Patients 16 years of age or older will be considered to have SpA if they have
             previously met ILAR criteria for ERA, or currently meet ESSG or Amor criteria for
             USpA, ASAS criteria for Axial SpA, or modified NY criteria for AS.

          3. Family members of individuals included under items 1 and 2. Family members will not be
             asked to submit to bone marrow aspiration or interruption of therapy.

          4. Controls for clinical, cellular, molecular, and biochemical assays, and genetic
             evaluation will be enrolled. Individuals who undergo phlebotomy specifically to
             provide a control specimen will be 6 years of age or older, and not pregnant.

          5. Minor healthy volunteers undergoing imaging (SI and/or WB MRI) must be old enough to
             complete the procedure without sedation. Generally this requires that they be at least
             6 years of age, so no healthy volunteers under age 6 will be enrolled.

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:

          1. Inability to provide informed consent or, in the case of minors, unavailability of a
             parent or guardian.

          2. Presence of any medical condition that would, in the opinion of the investigators,
             confuse the interpretation of the study.

          3. Unavailability, or inability to comply with the schedule for follow-up visits.
