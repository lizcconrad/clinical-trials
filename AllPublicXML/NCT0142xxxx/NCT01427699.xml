  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if T2-18C3, a true human monoclonal antibody that
      blocks inflammation, is safe to use in patients with type 2 diabetes. The study will also be
      looking at the ability of T2-18C3 to improve control of blood sugar levels in diabetics by
      blocking inflammation in the pancreas.

      This is a phase I, open label study of the safety and pharmacokinetics of T2-18C3 in patients
      with T2D. Nine patients will receive four biweekly IV infusions of the study drug, T2-18C3,
      at a dose level of 1.25 mg/kg. These patients will be followed for a total of 90 days to
      examine safety, pharmacokinetics, and preliminary efficacy.
