  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this clinical research study is learn if eltrombopag can help control or prevent
      low platelet counts in patients receiving treatment for CML or myelofibrosis.

      This is an investigational study. Eltrombopag is FDA approved and commercially available for
      the treatment of patients with low platelet counts. The use of eltrombopag for the treatment
      of low platelet counts in patients with CML and myelofibrosis is investigational.

      Up to 39 patients will take part in this study. All will be enrolled at MD Anderson. As of
      June 6, 2017, the study is closed to new participants.

      Study Drug Administration:

      If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, you will receive eltrombopag by
      mouth 1 time a day. Your dose may be increased every 2 weeks depending on your platelet count
      response.

      You should take eltrombopag on an empty stomach. You should not eat for 2 hours before taking
      eltrombopag. You should wait at least 4 hours between taking eltrombopag and taking other
      drugs (like antacids), dairy products, juices with calcium added, or supplements containing
      iron, calcium, aluminum, magnesium, selenium, or zinc.

      Study Visits:

      Some of the routine blood draws listed below may be done at a clinic near your home. Ask the
      study staff for more details about this.

      The dose adjustment phase is when the study doctor will change the dose of the study drug or
      your drug for treatment of CML or myelofibrosis.

      During the dose adjustment phase:

        -  Before the most effective dose is found, blood (about 1-2 tablespoons) will be drawn 1
           time every week for routine tests and to check your platelet counts.

        -  After the most effective dose is found, blood (about 1-2 tablespoons) will be drawn 1
           time each month for routine tests and to check your platelet counts.

      During the first year of eltrombopag therapy, every 3-4 months:

        -  Your medical history will be recorded.

        -  You will have a physical exam, including measurement of your height, weight, and vital
           signs.

        -  You will be asked about side effects you may be having and any other drugs you may be
           taking.

        -  You will have a standard-of-care bone marrow aspiration and/or biopsy to check the
           status of the disease. This sample will also be used for genetic research tests. If an
           aspirate cannot be collected, blood (about 1 teaspoon) will be drawn for these tests.

      After the first year of eltrombopag therapy, every 12 months (+/- 2 months), you will return
      to the clinic and have the same tests and procedures performed as listed above.

      Length of Study:

      You may continue taking the study drug for as long as the doctor thinks it is in your best
      interest. You will no longer be able to take the study drug if the disease gets worse, if
      intolerable side effects occur, or if you are unable to follow study directions.

      Your participation on the study will be over once you have completed the end-of-treatment
      visit.

      End-of-Treatment Visi:t About 30 days after your last dose of study drug, you will return to
      the clinic for an end-of-treatment visit.

        -  You will have a physical exam, including measurement of your height, weight, and vital
           signs.

        -  You will be asked about any side effects you may be having.

        -  Blood (about 1-2 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests. This blood will also be
           used to check your platelet counts.
