      If a child is unable to tolerate enough of his/her feeding orally to grow and requires that
      nutrition is given by vein (IV parenteral nutrition), it can result in severe liver disease.
      This is called cholestasis. IV fat that children receive may be contributing to this liver
      disease. A different fat mixture comprised from fish oil could be used in place of
      intralipid. This is a compassionate use of the fish oil and not a comparison of the two. We
      believe the use of fish oil may provide less liver disease and decrease the need of liver
      transplant or dying than those who receive the usual fat.
