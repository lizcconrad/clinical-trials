    <textblock>
      When patients suffer a subarachnoid hemorrhage (bleeding around the brain), they often
      develop hydrocephalus. This is an enlargement of the fluid-filled spaces (ventricles) in the
      brain. Standard-of-care treatment includes placing an external ventricular drain (EVD) to
      drain off fluid. Eventually the EVD is weaned with the goal of removing it. Occasionally a
      patient does not tolerate this and a permanent surgery needs to be done to internalize a
      shunt.

      Though this is done commonly and routinely throughout the world, there are no good studies to
      address how to optimally set the EVD level and how fast to wean it. Most set the EVD to a
      level of around 15 mmHg. The investigators hypothesize that setting the EVD lower (which will
      allow higher volume Cerebrospinal Fluid (CSF) drainage through the EVD) will improve
      perfusion at the level of the microcirculation in the brain, and result in improved
      neurologic outcomes.

    <description>The primary outcome is clinical outcome at 90 days. A favorable outcome is defined as a score of 1 or 2 on the modified Rankin Score (mRS) and poor outcome defined as a mRS of 3-6. This assessment will be made by a clinician who was blinded to the patient's CSF diversion treatment arm.</description>
