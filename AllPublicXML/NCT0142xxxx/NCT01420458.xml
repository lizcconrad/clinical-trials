  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, single-center, 2 period crossover, PK profile study. Each subject will
      be randomized to 1 of 2 treatment sequences. Both treatment sequences will be enrolled
      concurrently.

             aspartate aminotransferase (AST) total bilirubin, or creatinine above the upper limit
             of normal, or an out of normal range screening value for white blood cells (WBC).
