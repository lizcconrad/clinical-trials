  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Ageing is related to a decrease in physical fitness, disability and age related symptoms like
      nocturnal leg cramps (NLC). Our research is focused on the enhancement of physical activity
      and mobility to increase physical fitness and decrease disability and nocturnal cramp in
      older adults.

    <textblock>
      The ageing population leads to an increase of chronic disease and disability and to a
      decrease of physical activity and ADL performance. This circle can be reversed by physical
      exercise to increase physical fitness.

      The goal of this research is to establish the effects of a trainings program on ADL
      performance, physical fitness and nocturnal cramps. Furthermore the characteristics from
      participants who benefit from the program will be investigated by the research.

      The study design is a randomized intervention study. Participants are elderly people, age 65
      years and older, without cognitive impairment.

      Intervention: The intervention is a physical trainings program. The intensity is moderate,
      the frequency is daily and the total duration is 6 weeks. The control group will be provided
      with an education program.

      Main parameters are: physical fitness, nocturnal cramp severity and frequency.
