    <textblock>
      This is a phase 1, multicenter, nonrandomized, open-label, dose escalation study. The study
      will be conducted in 2 stages, Dose Escalation and Dose Expansion. The Dose Escalation phase
      will include patients with solid tumors (including melanoma) who have failed or are not
      candidates for standard therapies or for whom no approved therapy is available. The Dose
      Expansion phase will include patients with metastatic melanoma.

    <description>Dose Escalation Phase: patients will receive MLN2480 orally in escalating doses every other day or once weekly for three weeks of a 28-day cycle. Patients may continue treatment for additional cycles (up to 12 months) until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or the patient discontinues for any other reason. If it is determined that a patient would derive benefit from continued therapy beyond 12 months treatment may continue. Dose Expansion Phase: Patients will take MLN2480 at the maximum tolerated dose orally every other day or once weekly for three weeks of a 28-day cycle until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or the patient discontinues for any other reason. The maximum duration of treatment is 1 year unless determined that a patient would derive benefit from continued therapy beyond 12 months.</description>
