  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A loss of mobility in the shoulder in direction of internal rotation is associated with
      shoulder tendon pathology. Cause-effect relationship between these two is still not clear. It
      is suspected that this loss of mobility reduces the size of the tunnel in which this shoulder
      tendon is lying, namely the subacromial space. Overhead athletes frequently show glenohumeral
      internal rotation deficit (GIRD) while being healthy and free of shoulder pain. This makes
      this population interesting to investigate. This study wants to look at shoulders of overhead
      athletes with GIRD and measure the size of the subacromial space. After this, the athletes
      will be instructed to perform a home stretching program and at the end the effect of this on
      mobility and the size of the subacromial space will be measured.60 athletes will be recruited
      and randomly allocated to the control group and the stretching group. Before they start
      stretching, subacromial space size will be measured by use of ultrasound. This is a safe and
      non-invasive measuring tool. Mobility will be measured by use of a digital inclinometer. This
      also is safe and non-invasive. Patients will be instructed a stretching exercise, which they
      will be performing at home once a day during 6 weeks. At the end all outcome measures will be
      reassessed.
