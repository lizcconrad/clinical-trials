  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Menorrhagia, considered a public health challenge and reported by 5 to 10% of adult women, is
      encountered even more frequently in adolescents. Surveys of school students in the United
      States (US) and Europe reported menorrhagia in 37% to 55% of adolescent females. Medical
      management of adolescent menorrhagia includes various formulations of hormonal therapy and
      the antifibrinolytic agent epsilon aminocaproic acid. Oral tranexamic acid (TA), a more
      potent antifibrinolytic agent used as standard therapy for menorrhagia in adult women and in
      adolescent women in Europe and Canada, was not previously available in the US. Subsequent to
      US FDA approval in November 2009 of a novel oral TA formulation to treat cyclic heavy
      menstrual bleeding in adult women, this medication is currently included in the treatment
      armamentarium for adult menorrhagia. There is currently no preliminary data available in the
      US about the clinical use of oral TA in an exclusive adolescent population with menorrhagia.
      Oral contraceptive pills (OCP) are considered standard therapy in the management of
      menorrhagia in teen-aged women. Oral TA has been shown to be more efficacious than
      progesterone-only hormonal therapy for menorrhagia in adult women. However, there is no data
      available comparing the efficacy of oral TA and combined OCP (COCP) in adult women or in
      adolescents with menorrhagia.

      The study hypothesis is that, in adolescent menorrhagia, oral TA will have comparable
      efficacy in reducing menstrual blood loss (MBL) and improving quality of life (QOL) when
      compared to the commonly prescribed COCP.

      This hypothesis was tested by comparing the efficacy of these two medications, in a
      prospective randomized crossover trial in post-menarchal young girls with menorrhagia.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Subjects were randomized to one of two groups (group A or B).

      Group A received oral tranexamic acid at 1300 mg (two 650mg tablets), three times each day on
      days 1 to 5 of menstrual cycle for 3 cycles.

      Group B received combined oral contraceptive pills (OCP) with 3 weeks of hormonal pills and 1
      week of placebo for 3 cycles.

      After 3 cycles of therapy, both groups had one cycle without any therapy. Then, the groups
      crossed over. Group A, who first received TA, then received OCP. Group B, who first received
      OCP, then received TA.

      All subjects were to receive both tranexamic acid and oral contraceptive pills.

      There were a total of 3 study-associated visits per patient: 1 at baseline and 2 at the end
      of 3 cycles on each medication. These visits were considered within standard of care, as
      subjects with menorrhagia have frequent monitoring until the effectiveness of the treatment
      is determined.

      At the study visits the following were done:

        1. Assessment of the last menstrual period (amount of blood lost) using the Pictorial Blood
           Assessment Chart (PBAC) score and the number of days the period lasted

        2. Quality of Life evaluation - by the patient completing a standardized pediatric quality
           of life (PedsQL) questionnaire

        3. Detailed history and physical examination to evaluate for drug side effects and to look
           for signs of blood clots.

        4. Blood drawn for a complete blood count.

change in quality of life (QOL) as evaluated by the PedsQL instrument from baseline to the end of 3 cycles of COCP
PBAC score:
Quantitative score to measure menstrual blood loss. Scale range: Minimum - 0 score, Maximum: No maximum Interpretation: Score &gt; 100 indicates heavy menstrual bleeding
Peds QL score:
Score to measure quality of life in children Scale range: Minimum: 0, Maximum 100 Calculation: Subscales are reverse scored (using formula 100 - a x 25) and then all subscales are averaged Eg: Subscale score of 3 is reverse scored as: 100 - (3 x 25) = 25 Interpretation: Higher score indicates better quality of life</description>

change in quality of life (QOL) as evaluated by the PedsQL instrument from baseline to the end of 3 cycles of COCP
PBAC score:
Quantitative score to measure menstrual blood loss. Scale range: Minimum - 0 score, Maximum: No maximum Interpretation: Score &gt; 100 indicates heavy menstrual bleeding
Peds QL score:
Score to measure quality of life in children Scale range: Minimum: 0, Maximum 100 Calculation: Subscales are reverse scored (using formula 100 - a x 25) and then all subscales are averaged Eg: Subscale score of 3 is reverse scored as: 100 - (3 x 25) = 25 Interpretation: Higher score indicates better quality of life</description>
