  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The principle aim of the project is to analyze brain electrical activity and genetic
      information that will help identify the nature and cause of the disease schizophrenia. This
      effort should lay the groundwork for future treatment in schizophrenic patients.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There are several studies and hypotheses to be tested. This project includes a
      cross-sectional study design measuring brain waves, clinical symptoms, cognitive and
      functional ability, and genetic information in schizophrenic patients and normal controls.
      Subjects are expected to do a brain wave recording (EEG/ERP), role-play test designed to
      measure functionality and cognitive ability, and clinical symptom assessments. Expected
      duration of subject participation will be approximately 8 hours (about 2 visits). Outcome
      measures includes biomarkers, clinical symptoms and function, and genetic information.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Male and Female between ages 14-62 (clinical assessment and blood draw only above 62)

          -  Ability to give written assent (subjects who are below the age of 18)

          -  Ability to give written informed consent (age 18 or above)

          -  Sufficient understanding of the study and risks (ESC score 10 or above)

          -  Subjects above age 62 will not participate in brain electrical activity measurements
             although they may still participate in clinical assessments and blood draw.

        Exclusion Criteria:

             conditions include, but not limited to, stroke, repeated seizure, history of
             significant head trauma, CNS infection or tumor, an other significant brain
             neurological conditions.

          -  Significant alcohol or drug use (substance dependence within 6 months or substance
             abuse within 1 month) other than nicotine or marijuana dependence.
