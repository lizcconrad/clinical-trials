  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Although keloid is a very common condition; there are no statistics as to its true incidence
      and prevalence, neither in United States, nor elsewhere in the world. This trial intends to
      capture epidemiological data about this disease in a large population sample.

      The purpose of current trial is to establish a robust database of incidence and prevalence of
      keloid, as well as prevalence of familial keloid, in various ethnic groups. Study sample size
      is 100,000 random individuals who will fill out either a web survery or a paper
      questionnaire.

    <description>This will be a prospective online and paper based survey with an estimated 100,000 responders participating in two years. Statistics will be descriptive. The prevalence of various clinical findings will be determined at the end of Survey. Findings will be correlated with the source of the data, online, or paper questionnaire, as well as the locations where the paper questionnaires surveys were placed.</description>
