      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of mesenchymal stem cells
      (MSCs) derived from human umbilical cord/placenta at a dose of 1.0E+6 MSC/kg in subject for
      the therapy of Ankylosing spondylitis (AS)

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Ankylosing spondylitis (AS) is a chronic, progressive inflammatory rheumatic disease
      involving primarily the sacroiliac joints and the axial skeleton. The main clinical features
      are back pain and progressive stiffness of the spine. Oligoarthritis of the hips and
      shoulders, enthesopathy, and anterior uveitis are common, and involvement of the heart and
      lungs is rare. The current understanding of the pathogenesis of this disorder is limited.It
      mainly about to hereditary susceptibility (eg hla-b27),infection and autoimmunity.

      Although traditional drugs, such as Nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)
      disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs such as MTX,SASP OR thalidomide) and steroids
      have been used in the treatment of AS, however, many studies have indicated that the overall
      response to these drugs is not satisfied. Addition, the severe side effects of these drugs
      have also been observed. The management of AS patients therefore remains unsatisfactory and
      targeted therapies are needed. Human MSCs isolated from human umbilical cord/placenta have
      been shown to have immunoregulatory, immunosuppressive, stimulating hematopoiesis and tissue
      repairing properties. This study will evaluate the safety and effectiveness of MSC
      transplantation in the AS patients.

      This study will last 2 to 3 years. Participants will be randomly assigned to receive either
      MSC transplant +DMARDs therapy (experimental group) or DMARDs therapy (control group).
      Patients will undergo MSC transplant at the start of the study on Day 0. After 3 months,
      patients will receive the second MSC transplantation. After six and twelve months from the
      first transplantation, patients will be evaluated.
