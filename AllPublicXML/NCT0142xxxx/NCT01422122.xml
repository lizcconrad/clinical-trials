      There is a gap in knowledge regarding the effects of Vitamin D supplementation on periodontal
      status in pregnant wome. The investigators aim to evaluate the potential benefit, if any of
      vitamin D supplementation during pregnancy on periodontal disease and relevant outcomes
      including burden of infections and prematurity rates.

      the investigators hypothesize that

        1. Vitamin D supplementation during pregnancy improves the periodontal health.

        2. There is an association between inflammatory biomarkers and periodontal health of
           pregnant females.

        3. Vitamin D supplementation improves the outcomes of pregnancy such as prematurity rates
           and birth weight

      Periodontal disease is one of the most common chronic infectious diseases known to humans,
      with a reported prevalence varying between 10%-60% in adults. Periodontal health is commonly
      affected in pregnancy. The prevalence of pregnancy gingivitis varies widely, ranging from
      around 35%- 100%. Although, most of the periodontal changes during pregnancy are reversible
      but females with preexisting periodontitis or those who have metabolic disease such as
      diabetes may suffer increased periodontal destruction and may exhibit significantly greater
      probing pocket depth and attachment level. Periodontal disease, as a source of persistent
      infection, may induce systemic inflammatory responses that increase the risk of adverse
      pregnancy outcomes. However, so far the results have been mixed. As vitamin D metabolites may
      also alter the inflammatory response and have antimicrobial effects thus the use of vitamin D
      may affect periodontal status. Evidence is there which suggests that an association exists
      between low serum levels of Vitamin D and periodontal attachment loss. If the investigators
      take all of the above factors in consideration, the broad picture reveals that as vitamin D
      deficiency is prevalent in Pakistan, the pregnant females here are likely to have compromised
      periodontal health and probably poor pregnancy outcomes.
