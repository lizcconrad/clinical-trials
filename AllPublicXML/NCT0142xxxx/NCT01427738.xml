      The purpose of this study was to see which one of two medicines (topical gentian violet [GV]
      or nystatin oral suspension) was better than the other in treating Oral Candidiasis (OC).
      This was measured by whether the study participant still had OC or sores in his/her mouth
      after 14 days of treatment. Also, safety and tolerability of GV and nystatin in the treatment
      of OC were assessed.

      A5265 was a phase III, open-label (both the researchers and participants know which treatment
      was being administered) clinical trial to compare the safety and efficacy of topical GV to
      that of oral nystatin suspension. Male and female HIV-1 positive participants ≥ 18 years of
      age were randomized (as if by the toss of a coin) with equal probability and stratified by
      CD4+ T-cell counts and the use of antiretroviral therapy at the time of study entry to
      receive either topical GV solution (5 mL swish and gargle for 1 minute and spit two times
      daily) or nystatin oral suspension (5 mL swish for 1 minute and swallow four times daily) for
      14 days. Therapy was considered as failed if participants have no clinical improvement
      (assessed by severity of pseudomembranous candidiasis) during either treatment regimen.
      Evaluation of signs and symptoms of oral candidiasis was done by an evaluator who was blinded
      to the treatment assignment. A total of 494 participants was expected to enroll in the study
      but due to early study closure only 221 enrolled; and participants are expected to be on the
      study for about 13 weeks.

    <description>The primary endpoint is clinical efficacy defined as cure (absence of lesions) or improvement (a decrease in severity of lesions) after 14 days of treatment. The oral cavity will be split arbitrarily into 6 sites: left lower and upper labial mucosa and buccal mucosa, right lower and upper labial mucosa and buccal mucosa, hard palate, soft palate, tongue (dorsum, lateral, and ventral), and floor of mouth. Severity is scored using a scoring system from 0 to 3 (0 corresponds to absence of lesions, and 3 corresponds to presence of extensive confluent lesions) which leads to a composite severity score ranging from 0 to 18 after adding up the scores from all 6 sites. Complete success is assigned if the composite score after treatment equals to 0. Improved/partial response is assigned if the composite score after treatment is less than the baseline score. The blinded evaluator scores the severity of lesions by examining different lesion characteristics.</description>

    <measure>Number of Participant With Symptom</measure>
    <time_frame>after 14 days of treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Symptoms were assessed using a visual analog scale where the level of discomfort and pain were recorded and quantified using a scoring system from 0 to 3. 0=no discomfort/pain; 1=mild discomfort/pain; 2=Moderate discomfort/pain; 3=Severe discomfort/pain.</description>

    <measure>Tolerance</measure>
    <time_frame>After 14 days of treatment</time_frame>
    <description>The investigators will measure tolerance using a scale from 0 to 3 (0=No side effects experienced, no changes in treatment; 1=Some side effects experienced, but not enough to modify treatment; 2=Some side effects experienced, resulted in treatment interruption; 3=Side effects experienced, resulted in treatment discontinuation.)</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Participants Who Were Adherent.</measure>
    <time_frame>After 14 days of treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Adherence was reported as a dichotomous variable (adherence vs. non-adherence). Participants who have missing doses less than 15% will be considered as adherent, i.e., if a participant is in the GV arm, then the cutoff point is 28*0.15=4 doses; and for the nystatin arm is 56*0.15=8 doses.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Self-Assessment of General Health</measure>
    <time_frame>Weeks 0, 6</time_frame>
    <description>Participants rated their general health on two scales. One is a five point scale ranging from 1 to 5 (1=Excellent; 2=Very Good; 3=Good; 4=Fair; 5=Poor)</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Participants Who Found GV and Nystatin Acceptable.</measure>
    <time_frame>After 14 days of treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Acceptability was defined as the willingness to use the drug if it is proven effective to treat oral candidiasis. Participants were asked whether or not they would be willing to use the assigned treatment via questionnaires.</description>

        <title>Number of Participants With Clinical Efficacy</title>
        <description>The primary endpoint is clinical efficacy defined as cure (absence of lesions) or improvement (a decrease in severity of lesions) after 14 days of treatment. The oral cavity will be split arbitrarily into 6 sites: left lower and upper labial mucosa and buccal mucosa, right lower and upper labial mucosa and buccal mucosa, hard palate, soft palate, tongue (dorsum, lateral, and ventral), and floor of mouth. Severity is scored using a scoring system from 0 to 3 (0 corresponds to absence of lesions, and 3 corresponds to presence of extensive confluent lesions) which leads to a composite severity score ranging from 0 to 18 after adding up the scores from all 6 sites. Complete success is assigned if the composite score after treatment equals to 0. Improved/partial response is assigned if the composite score after treatment is less than the baseline score. The blinded evaluator scores the severity of lesions by examining different lesion characteristics.</description>

            <groups_desc>Repeated confidence intervals (RCIs) were used to control type I error.A interim analysis was conducted by a 99.7% CI. The final analyses use a 95.1% CI, based on the Lan-DeMets error-spending function corresponding to the O’Brien-Fleming boundary.76% of 100 participant in arm GV had cure or improvement of OC after 14 days of treatment, and 71.6% of 102 in arm nystatin had cure or improvement of OC. Difference in clinical efficacy rates between GV and nystatin 95.1% CI is 0.044 (-0.077, 0.166).</groups_desc>
