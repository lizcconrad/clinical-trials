      O2C is a diagnostic device for non-invasive determination of oxygen supply in
      microcirculation of blood perfused tissues. The optical sensor is easy to handle and
      guarantees reproducible examinations of local oxygen supply of tissues in clinics as well as
      in research. The examinations are without any strain for your patient.

      Determines by use of a glass fibre probe:

      Blood Flow in Microcirculation Capillary-Venous Oxygen Saturation Blood Filling of
      Microvessels Blood Flow Velocity This device makes it possible to supervise the local oxygen
      supply of organs and tissue.

      With it is possible to measure locally the amount of oxygen which is transported into the
      region of interest and to diagnose local oxygen consumption of an organ. O2C's novelty is
      monitoring the energetic metabolism of cells by measuring the oxygen uptake with an optical
      sensor probe. Pathological O2-supply, which can lead to angiogenesis or cell-death and
      subsequently to organ failure, now can be detected in an early state by use of the new sensor
      system.

      One of these new developed sensors are used to place in rectal position during extracorporeal
      circulation to determine the microcirculation.
