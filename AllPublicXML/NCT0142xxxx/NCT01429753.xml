  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cardiac resynchronisation therapy (CRT) is an established treatment for improving symptoms in
      patients with congestive heart failure (CHF) by left ventricular (LV) pacing. CRT can help to
      improve LV function in patients with heart failure if those regions of the myocardium which
      are most compromised by electromechanical dyssynchrony can be identified and effectively
      stimulated. There still remains, however, a significant rate of up to 30% of patients who do
      not respond to treatment. Reasons for lack of benefit can be related to the inability of
      identifying and effectively stimulating those regions of myocardium, which are most
      compromised by electromechanical dyssynchrony. The investigators hypothesize that by using
      cardiac MR and 3D echo to identify scar, reconstruct coronary sinus anatomy, and determine
      the site of latest LV activation, the investigators can find the best place to implant the
      left ventricular lead. By avoiding scar and pacing in the site of latest activation, the
      investigators believe the investigators will reduce dyssynchrony and thus improve overall
      heart function. The researchers thus aim to increase the proportion of people who respond to
      treatment. The researchers also believe that the procedure may be streamlined so as to reduce
      procedure duration, radiation dose and dose of iodinated contrast medium.
