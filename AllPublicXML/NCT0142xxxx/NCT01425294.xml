  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a post-authorisation study, committed to Center for Drug Evaluation (CDE) and
      China Food and Drug Administration (CFDA), in order to provide more effectiveness and safety
      data about Faslodex in real world clinical practice in China. The primary objective of this
      study was to evaluate the effectiveness of Faslodex 250mg monthly to treat post-menopausal
      women with oestrogen receptor-positive locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer, for
      disease relapse on or after adjuvant anti-oestrogen therapy or disease progression on therapy
      with an anti-oestrogen, in terms of progression-free survival (PFS), by collecting real world
      data according to Chinese physicians' clinical practice.

    <time_frame>Follow-up will be taken every 3 months after commencement of the protocol, through the study completion, an average of 12 months.</time_frame>
    <description>ORR was defined as the percentage of patients who had a best objective tumour response of either complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) among the evaluable patients with measurable disease at baseline. The best overall response was the best response recorded from the start of the treatment until disease progression. The RECIST1.1 criteria were used to assess objective tumour response. ORR was summarized and expressed as the percentage together with the corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CI).</description>
