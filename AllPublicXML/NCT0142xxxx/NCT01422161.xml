      The purpose of this study is to determine whether injections of botulinum toxin (commonly
      known as BOTOX®) into the affected hand of Stroke patients, while targeting the muscles
      controlling the hand, will lead to improved use of the hand when compared to injections of
      placebo (a substance that looks similar to the study drug but contains no active study
      medication).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Hemiparesis is the most common motor impairment after stroke that frequently leads to
      persistent deficits in hand function. This study investigates whether the application of
      botulinum toxin to a set of synergistically-acting hand muscles, in conjunction with
      task-specific therapy, will lead to reorganization and improved motor function in the
      stroke-involved hand. The investigators will use objective psychophysical measures of hand
      function and hand function rating scales to investigate if Botox in conjunction with
      task-specific therapy will lead to:

        -  improved motor execution,

        -  improved motor planning during a psychophysical two-finger grasping and lifting task
           with varying object weight, and

        -  increased hand function as assessed by the time taken to complete fine motor tasks.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Known allergy or sensitivity to botulinum toxin type A (BOTOX).

          -  Females with a positive pregnancy test, or who are breast-feeding, planning a
             pregnancy during the study, who think that they may be pregnant at the start of the

             subject's participation in the study.

          -  History of surgery or other significant injury to either upper extremity causing
             mechanical limitations that preclude task performance.
