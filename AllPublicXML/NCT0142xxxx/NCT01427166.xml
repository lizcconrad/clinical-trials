  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To date, the scientific literature has yet to provide sufficient evidence regarding the
      pathophysiology of cording. The objective of this protocol is to evaluate the utility of non
      invasive vascular imaging for assessing the pathophysiology of cording in a small study
      cohort of patients who were treated for breast cancer. The hypothesis is that cording may
      have a vascular etiology

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cords are bands of tissue that are present in the axilla following breast cancer surgery and
      may extend across the antecubital fossa and into the forearm. Cords are often painful to
      patients and limit their shoulder range of motion.The proposed study design involves the
      recruitment of patients who are enrolled in Partners Protocol # 2008P000540, a prospective
      analysis of symptoms, functionality and quality of life questionnaire to evaluate lymphedema
      in patients following treatment for breast cancer. This protocol recruits newly diagnosed
      breast cancer patients prior to any treatment interventions. Subjects are required to undergo
      volumetric arm measurements and complete the Lymphedema Evaluation Following Treatment for
      Breast Cancer Questionnaire (LEFT-BC) which will allow for the evaluation of changes in
      functionality, upper extremity utilization (fear associated avoidance), and quality of life.
      Throughout treatment patients will be screened before and after each treatment event:
      surgery, chemotherapy and radiation. Following the conclusion of treatment for breast cancer,
      patients will be measured at least 2 times per year (every 4-7 months). If during these study
      visits the patient notes cording symptoms, the research staff administering the questionnaire
      will be alerted. At this point, they will notify a designated medical provider who will
      perform a physical examination of the area to confirm the presence of cording. Once the
      presence of cording is verified, the patient will be provided with the opportunity to enroll
      in the proposed trial. Due to the current limited knowledge on the nature of the condition,
      the patients arm and axilla will have to be imaged within 7 days of the physical exam
      confirmation. The patients will be asked to return to the vascular imaging lab located on the
      Massachusetts's General Hospital's main campus. They will undergo a venous duplex ultrasound,
      on a General Electric LOGIQ-9 unit with a Phillips-IU-22 probe.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Participants must be enrolled in Partners protocol # 2008P000540 &quot;Prospective Analysis
             of Symptoms, Functionality and Quality of Life Questionnaires to Evaluate Lymphedema
             in Patients Following Treatment for Breast Cancer&quot;

          -  Confirmed case of cording by a medical provider (Physician, Nurse Practitioner,
             Physician Assistant)

          -  Participants must be at least 18 years of age

          -  Life expectancy of greater than 1 year.

          -  Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document.

          -  Willingness to comply with required follow up Perometer measurements and clinical
             visits.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Participants who are not enrolled or have been removed from Partners Protocol #
             2008P000540 will be excluded from this trial.

          -  Participants with known brain metastases should be excluded from this clinical trial
             because of their poor prognosis and because they often develop progressive neurologic
             dysfunction that would confound the evaluation of neurologic and other adverse events.

          -  History of prior surgery or radiation to the head, neck, upper limb, or trunk.

          -  Patients with a history of a different malignancy are ineligible except for the
             following circumstances. Individuals with a history of other malignancies are eligible
             if they have been disease-free for at least 5 years and are deemed by the investigator
             to be at low risk for recurrence of that malignancy. Individuals with the following
             cancers are eligible if diagnosed and treated within the past 5 years: cervical cancer
             in situ, and basal cell or squamous cell carcinoma of the skin.
