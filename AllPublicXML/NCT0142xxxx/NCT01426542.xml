  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Newborn babies with congenital heart disease often require surgery in the first month of
      life. The risks of brain damage from congenital heart disease and from the various corrective
      surgeries are high because of poor levels of oxygen reaching the brain. Topiramate is an
      anti-convulsant medication that protects brain cells from damage due to low amounts of oxygen
      in animal studies. The investigators hypothesize that giving topiramate to babies with
      congenital heart disease before and after surgery will decrease the amount of brain damage
      caused by the heart disease and/or the surgery to correct the heart disease.

    <textblock>
      Infants with cyanotic congenital heart disease undergoing surgery in the neonatal period have
      a high rate of brain injury resulting in seizures, stroke, cerebral palsy, and
      neurodevelopmental delays. Neuroimaging abnormalities are found in 30% to 60% of cases and
      neurodevelopmental impairments occur in more than half of these children. The mechanisms of
      brain injury in these children are not fully understood. Experimental animal models have
      shown that the abundant release of glutamate in the brain during hypoxic-ischemic insult
      results in brain injury. Blocking glutamate receptors by administration of the anticonvulsant
      topiramate has been shown to prevent such injury in animal studies. This study is an open
      pilot trial of peri-operative topiramate administration to infants with cyanotic congenital
      heart disease to test the feasibility of this approach and generate preliminary data about
      markers of brain injury (serum S100B levels and urine metabolomics) and neurodevelopment at
      18 months of age. If the approach is feasible and the preliminary data are encouraging a
      larger efficacy trial will be designed. Although topiramate has been used in neonates and
      infants to treat seizures and in a pilot study in term infants with hypoxic-ischemic
      encephalopathy, this is the first study of its effects on markers of brain injury and
      neurologic outcomes in infants with cyanotic congenital heart disease.
