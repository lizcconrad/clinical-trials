  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      ClAraC (consisting of one dose of clofarabine and ara-C for five days) or FLAMSA (consisting
      of one dose of fudarabine, amsacrine and ara-C for four days) will be administered followed
      by reduced-intensity conditioning regimen (RIC) in the setting of allogeneic stem cell
      transplantation (SCT). The aim of the study is to explore the antileukemic, immunosuppressive
      effects and toxicity and safety of clofarabine in combination with ara-C in the setting of
      RIC allogeneic transplantation compared with the FLAMSA-protocol for patients with high-risk
      acute myeloid leukemia (AML) or advanced myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS).

               -  Patients with treated non-melanoma skin cancer, in situ carcinoma, or cervical
                  intraepithelial neoplasia, regardless of the disease-free duration, are eligible

               -  Patients with organ-confined prostate cancer with no evidence of recurrent or
                  progressive disease based on prostate-specific antigen (PSA) values are also
                  eligible for this study if hormonal therapy has been initiated or a radical
                  prostatectomy has been performed
