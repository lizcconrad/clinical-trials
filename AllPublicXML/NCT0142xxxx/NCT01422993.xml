  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effects on strength, balance, and neuropathic
      symptoms (numbness, tingling, pain, weakness) of a 12 week, bi-weekly, 60 minute, group
      exercise program designed to improve lower extremity strength and balance with persons with
      oxaliplatin induced peripheral neuropathy.

    <time_frame>10 Months</time_frame>
    <description>To evaluate feasibility, the percentage of patients screened to percentage enrolled in the study and the percentage enrolled to percentage that completes the study will be calculated. Patients who do not complete the study will be contacted to determine why they were unable to complete the study and the reasons will be recorded. How many sessions were attended will also be recorded.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Participants Who Experience Side Effects</measure>
    <time_frame>10 Months</time_frame>
    <description>To evaluate tolerability, at each session, data regarding any participant who was unable to complete the entire session will be recorded along with any side effects that participants report. Participants will also be asked to rate the level of exercise they perform at each session as either a) too easy b) just right c) too challenging.</description>

    <measure>Number of Participants With Measured Improvement</measure>
    <time_frame>10 Months</time_frame>
    <description>Treatment-effect size will be evaluated by means of changes in muscle strength, balance, and neuropathy from the beginning to completion of the study.</description>

    <description>Participants will be asked to take part in a one hour exercise program twice a week for 12 weeks. They will also be asked to answer questionnaires and participate in an evaluation of their strength, balance, and physical function every 4 weeks immediately following the exercise program. This evaluation will take an additional hour every 4 weeks.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Prior history of colon cancer

          -  Completed oxaliplatin based chemotherapy at least 6 months prior to enrollment

          -  Report numbness, tingling, or pain of the lower extremities â‰¥ 4 by chemotherapy
             induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN) Visual Analog Rating

          -  Karnofsky performance status of at least 60%

          -  Able to read, write, and understand English

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients will be excluded from the study if they live outside of a 30 mile radius of
             the University of South Florida, if they are currently undergoing chemotherapy or
             radiation therapy, or if they regularly (at least once a week) participate in strength
             or balance training exercises. The investigators will not exclude participants if they
             are participating in aerobic exercise, but we will collect that information so that
             the investigators may control for aerobic exercise in our data analysis.
