  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary aim of this research is to test the efficacy of innovative, brief alcohol abuse
      prevention strategies that integrate positive youth development messages and health risk
      messages for adolescents in high school settings. A secondary aim is to examine these
      strategies in various combinations as interventions and re-interventions (i.e., boosters) for
      sustaining or enhancing behavior change over time. These strategies are founded upon an
      emerging conceptual framework titled the Behavior-Image Model emanating from findings of our
      recent trials examining multiple behavior health interventions. The long-term objective of
      this project is to reduce alcohol abuse and problems among older high-risk adolescents for
      whom alcohol and drug use disparities exist, yet who are often overlooked in prevention
      research and services.

    <textblock>
      A total of 921 adolescents from two diverse high schools in northeast Florida were randomized
      to receive either the: 1) in-person consult, 2) parent-youth letter, 3) adolescent
      newsletter, or 4) standard care control . Three-month, one-year and 18-month follow-ups are
      planned, with interventions to be implemented in rotating fashion as re-interventions
      immediately after three-month and one-year data collections. Plans for following year include
      the following: 1) collecting and analyzing 3-month post-intervention data to determine the
      effects of the initial consult, parent-youth and adolescent print strategies, intervention
      costs, and assess possible mediators and moderators of outcomes; 2) implementing the first
      round of re-interventions; 3) collecting and analyzing one-year post-baseline effects of
      re-interventions, determining costs and cost-effectiveness of the
      interventions/re-interventions, and assessing possible mediators and moderators of outcomes;
      and 4) implementing the second round of re-interventions.
