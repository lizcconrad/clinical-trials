      All eligible subjects will be enrolled for one visit. A medical history and physical
      examination will be conducted on all subjects. A 10 mL blood specimen will be collected. All
      Sera should be shipped to PPD Vaccines and Biologics Laboratory in the US. The serum specimen
      will be tested at PPD Laboratory with competitive Luminex immunoassay (cLIA) and multiplexed
      HPV immunoassay. The purpose of the quadrivalent HPV cLIA and multiplex is to detect
      neutralizing antibody and total IgG to HPV virus-like particles (VLPs), serotypes 6, 11, 16,
      18, respectively.
