  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Atrial fibrillation and heart failure are two common heart conditions that are associated
      with an increase in death and suffering. When both of these two conditions occur in a patient
      the patient's prognosis is poor. These patients have poor life quality and are frequently
      admitted to the hospital. The treatment of atrial fibrillation in heart failure patients is
      extremely challenging. Two options for managing the atrial fibrillation are permitting the
      atrial fibrillation to continue but controlling the heart rate, or to convert the atrial
      fibrillation rhythm back to normal and try to maintain the heart in sinus rhythm. Until now,
      the method to keep the patient in normal sinus rhythm is with antiarrhythmic drugs. Studies
      using antiarrhythmic drugs to control the rhythm failed to show any survival benefit when
      compared with permitting the patient to be in atrial fibrillation. In the last few years, new
      development in techniques and technologies now enable catheter ablation (cauterization of
      tissue in the heart with a catheter) to be a successful treatment in abolishing atrial
      fibrillation and that this approach is better than antiarrhythmic drug to control the rhythm.
      However, there has not been any long-term study to determine whether catheter ablation to
      abolish atrial fibrillation in heart failure patients would reduce mortality or admissions
      for heart failure.

      This study is to compare the effect of catheter ablation-based atrial fibrillation rhythm
      control to rate control in patients with heart failure and high burden atrial fibrillation on
      the composite endpoint of all-cause mortality and hospitalization for heart failure defined
      as an admission to a health care facility for &gt; 24 hours. The investigators will also be
      assessing the cost-effectiveness of this treatment strategy and the life quality for these
      patients. This study may have a dramatic impact on the way the investigators manage these
      patients with atrial fibrillation and heart failure and may improve the outlook and well
      being of these patients.
