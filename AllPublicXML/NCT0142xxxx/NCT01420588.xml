  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators study the feasibility of a novel method in oncology based on breath
      analysis with a nanosensors array for identifying gastric diseases. Alveolar exhaled breath
      samples collected from volunteers referred for upper endoscopy or surgery are analyzed using
      a custom-designed array of chemical nanosensors based on organically functionalized gold
      nanoparticles and carbon nanotubes. Predictive models are built employing discriminant factor
      analysis (DFA) pattern recognition method. Classification accuracy, sensitivity and
      specificity are determined using leave-one-out cross-validation or an independent blind test
      set. The chemical composition of the breath samples is studied using gas chromatography
      coupled with mass spectrometry (GC-MS).

      A pilot study is conducted first (enlistment of 160 subjects at the Department of Oncology,
      The First Affiliated Hospital of Anhui Medical University, The First Affiliated Hospital of
      Anhui Medical University, Hefei, Anhui, China.)

      The pilot study is followed by a large-scale clinical trial to confirm the preliminary
      results of the Chinese pilot study (enlistment of 800 subjects at the Digestive Diseases
      Centre GASTRO, Riga East University Hospital, 6 Linezera iela, LV1006 Riga, Latvia). 25% of
      the samples are used as independent blind test set. The samples are blinded by the medical
      team and are not disclosed until prediction of blind sample identity is complete.

      Number of patients that will have a definitive diagnosis and Alveolar exhaled breath samples
      collected from individuals with TedlarÂ® bags (Keika Ventures, LLC) after endoscopy.. Two
      breath samples were collected from each person tested.

      Two-bed sorption tubes filled with the following sorbents were used as traps for sample
      collection with simultaneous preconcentration: 100mg matrix Tenax TA and 50mg matrix Tenax TA
      (35-60 mesh; purchased from Supelo, Bellefonte, PA). Sorbents were separated by glass wool.
      The samples were collected at a total flow through sorption trap of 200ml/min.

      One sample was used for analysis with the nanosensors array, and the other sample was used
      for Gas Chromatography coupled with Mass Spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis.

    <description>Proof-of-concept:
Alveolar exhaled breath samples collected from 160 subjects referred for upper endoscopy at The First Affiliated Hospital of Anhui Medical University are analyzed using a custom-designed array of chemical nanosensors. Predictive models are built employing discriminant factor analysis (DFA). Classification accuracy, sensitivity and specificity were determined using leave-one-out cross-validation. The chemical composition is studied using gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry (GC-MS).
Confirmation of proof-of-concept:
Alveolar exhaled breath samples collected from 800 subjects referred for upper endoscopy at Riga East University Hospital are analyzed as was used in the pilot study. Predictive models are built as in the pilot study,using a training set of only 75% of the samples. Classification accuracy, sensitivity and specificity are determined using an independent blind test set (25% of the samples)</description>
