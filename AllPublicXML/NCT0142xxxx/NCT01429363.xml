    <textblock>
      The prospective Clinical Series (CS) aims to prove the hypothesis that Targeted Disc
      Decompression (TDD) reduces the pain in patients suffering from radicular leg pain secondary
      to a contained focal disc protrusion (Lumboradicular Syndrome). Secondary objective will be
      to prove that the treatment Group will have less disability and better quality of life.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will start with a prospective clinical series (CS) in which 20 patients after
      careful selection will be treated with TDD, followed by a standardized rehabilitation
      program. After the diagnosis Lumboradicular syndrome the patient will first receive an
      transforaminal epidural injection at the site and level of the herniated disc, proven on MRI.
      Two weeks after the epidural injection the patient is evaluated. When the response is
      negative (a decrease less than 2.5 points on the 10 points VAS scale) TDD can be performed.
      Patient outcome will be evaluated at 6 weeks, 3, 6, 12 and 24 months after the study
      intervention. End point of this study is 3 months after TDD treatment. A positive response is
      defined as a minimal decrease of 2.5 points on the 10 points VAS scale compared to the VAS
      score at baseline.

      A positive response in at least seven patients and acceptable side-effects and complications
      will lead to the start of a RCT.

      If the response is positive &lt; 7 out of 20 patients, the decision to proceed with a RCT
      following the prospective CS is made after evaluation of the CS by a team of experts. The
      results from this prospective study will be published.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Mono radicular leg pain for at least 6 weeks as a result from a lumbar contained
             herniated disc. Leg pain must be of greater impact then concomitant back-pain

          -  Failing conservative treatment; analgesics and/or physical therapy ( WHO 1-3). Failing
             means persisting pain leading to problems with daily activities.

          -  MRI: must be performed &lt; 6 weeks before start treatment. On MRI signs of contained
             herniated disc, maximum 33% obliteration of the spinal channel. No signs of other
             significant spine pathology (see exclusion criteria).

          -  Negative response to a transforaminal epidural injection. Injection must be performed
             &lt; 6 weeks before start treatment but least 2 weeks before start treatment

          -  Neurological investigation by neurologist. Symptoms should be clinical related to the
             disc herniation level.

          -  Age &gt;18 and &lt; 50 years

          -  Mean pain on visual analogue scale (VAS) &gt;50 mm (0 -100)

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Herniated disc with more then 33% obliteration of the spinal channel.

          -  Other degenerative causes of nerve root compression; ligament flavum or facet joint
             hypertrophy, degenerative spinal channel stenosis, loss of lumbar kyphosis, discopathy
             with signs of Schmorls' nodules and loss of nucleus pulposus signal. Other causes of
             radicular syndrome such as cancer, radiculitis or neural degeneration.

          -  Spinal instability (spondylolisthesis, spinal fracture or tumor)

          -  History of back surgery, chemonucleolysis or other intra discal procedures
