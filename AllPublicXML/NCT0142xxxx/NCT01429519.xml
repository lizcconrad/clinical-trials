      The study objectives are to evaluate safety and efficacy, of topical administration of RPh201
      for treatment of patients with hard to heal wounds.

      This is to include:

        -  Safety evaluation of RPh201 (botanical extract) formulated as an oil solution
           administered topically three times per week during an overall treatment period of up to
           4 weeks in patients with hard to heal wounds.

        -  Efficacy assessment of wound improvement following the use of RPh201 oil solution
           (botanical extract) administered topically three times per week during an overall
           treatment period of up to 4 weeks and at the follow-up visit at 3 months after end of
           treatment in patients with hard to heal wounds
