      This will be an open label, non-randomised [11C]PHNO PET study using healthy male volunteers.
      Each volunteer will undergo 4 [11C]PHNO PET scans to allow for further characterisation of
      this radioligand and examine the effects of [11C]PHNO mass carry-over and displaceable
      binding in the brain. This study aims to obtain data from 6 evaluable subjects.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A test-retest (TRT) investigation of [11C]PHNO in human is required to further characterise
      [11C]PHNO. [11C] PHNO possesses very high affinity for the D3 receptor, and therefore most
      clinical studies are conducted at D3 occupancies &gt;10%. As [11C]PHNO kinetics in the target
      brain regions are moderately slow, considerable mass carry over may be present on a 2nd PET
      scan conducted on the same day. In addition there appears to be a significant displaceable
      binding component in the cerebellum, which, if not accounted for, will lead to a bias in the
      quantification of specific [11C]PHNO binding. The aim of this study is therefore to examine
      the effects of [11C]PHNO mass carry-over and displaceable binding in the cerebellum, on the
      quantification of [11C]PHNO PET data.

      This will be an open label, non-randomised [11C]PHNO PET study using healthy volunteers. Each
      volunteer will undergo 4 [11C]PHNO PET scans:

      1st and 2nd scans; TRT on the same day with a minimal gap between [11C]PHNO injections to
      examine the effects of PHNO mass carry over, 3rd scan &gt;1 week later to determine the &quot;true&quot;
      TRT variability and a 4th scan will follow a 15mg dose of aripiprazole (a D2/D3 compound
      which allows the highest clinically acceptable blockade of central D2/D3 receptors) and will
      examine the amount of displaceable binding in the cerebellum, a proposed reference tissue for
      [11C]PHNO.

      The scan data will be quantified as regional volumes of distribution (VT).

    <description>Aripiprazole is a D2/D3 antagonist registered in the UK for use in the treatment of schizophrenia. It allows the highest clinically acceptable blockade of central D2/D3 receptors and will allow us to examine the amount of displaceable binding in the brain - a proposed reference tissue for [11C]PHNO.</description>
