      Assess the ability to maintain the plasma HIV viral load below the threshold needed for
      detection (&lt; 50 copies/mL) at 24 weeks of raltegravir/maraviroc therapy without NRTIs and

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients infected with HIV-1 type B or CRF02.

          -  ≥ 18 years old

          -  Patients who have been receiving antiretroviral therapy for at least 5 years, and
             whose treatment has been stable for at least 6 months.

          -  Patients whose plasma viral load has been undetectable (below 200 copies/mL) over the
             last 24 months, and &lt; 50 copies/mL for at least 12 months.

          -  Patients with an R5* tropic virus, as determined through DNA and with CD4 nadir ≥
             100/mm3

          -  Patients presenting with clinical lipohypertrophy recognized by themselves and by
             their doctors, and defined by increased volume of the abdominal and/or thoracic and/or
             cervical area (buffalo hump).

          -  Patients who have never been treated with raltegravir.

          -  Patients who have never been treated with maraviroc.

          -  Efficient contraception for women

          -  Free and informed written consent, signed by the patient and the investigator.

          -  Patients with health insurance. * To increase the certainty of selecting patients with
             an R5 virus, the HIV-1 tropism will be determined by the genotype method and
             interpreted with the Geno2pheno[coreceptor] algorithm and a false positive rate
             threshold for X4 virus at 20%, rather than the usual 10%.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  X4, X4/5 or undetermined tropism of the HIV virus.

          -  HIV-2 or coinfection HIV-1/HIV-2.

          -  Chronic viral hepatitis B.

          -  Chronic viral hepatitis C requiring specific treatment over the first 24 weeks.

          -  Treatment with growth hormones.

          -  Hypolipemic or diabetes treatment, begun within the last 3 months.

          -  Pregnant or breastfeeding women.

          -  Haemoglobin &lt; 7g/dl, neutrophils &lt; 500/mm3, platelets &lt; 50 000/mm3, creatinine
             clearance &lt; 50 mL/min, alkaline phosphatases, ASAT, ALAT or bilirubin ≥ 3 times the
             upper limit of the normal range (N).

          -  Antiretroviral treatment associated to enzymatic inducer.

          -  Chronic alcohol consumption.

          -  Subjects under &quot;sauvegarde de justice&quot; (judicial protection due to temporarily and
             slightly diminished mental or physical faculties), or under legal guardianship.

          -  Subjects participating in another clinical trial evaluating different therapies and
             including an exclusion period that is still in force during the screening phase.
