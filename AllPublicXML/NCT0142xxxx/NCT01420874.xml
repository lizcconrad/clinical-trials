  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is for the participant to give their own T cells (a type
      of blood cell in the body that can fight infections and possibly cancer) to them after they
      have been removed, grown in a lab, and then coated with an experimental drug.

      This study will determine the highest dose of EGFR2Bi coated T cells that can be given
      without causing severe side effects. Initially a group of 3 participants will receive the
      same dose of study drug. If no serious side effects occur, the next group of participants
      will receive a slightly higher dose of study agent. The following groups of participants will
      receive higher doses of the study drug until a dose is reached where there are unacceptable
      side effects and maximum tolerated dose is found, or the planned highest dose level is
      reached with no side effects.

      The purpose of this study is to determine in a dose-escalation phase Ib trial the safety of 3
      infusions of EGFR2Bi armed activated T cells (aATC), after chemotherapy, for patients with
      advanced colorectal and pancreatic cancer

    <description>Immune studies: Serum cytokine responses will be quantified focus on the levels of those factors known to be important regulators of T cell responses. Phenotype analysis will measure the percent of T, B, NKT and NK cells in peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) and tumor-infiltrating lymphocyte (TIL) samples. T cell proportions would be further analyzed by subset (CD4, CD8, CD25+). Cytotoxicity is measured in percentage in PBMC.</description>

All patients must have central intravenous acess (e.g. mediport, PICC line) for continuous infusion of 5-FU. Adv. colorectal and pancreatic pts. w/no other standard chemo available, &amp; in pts who cannot receive FOLFOX chemo, immunotherapy may be given w/o antecedent chemo.
EGFRBi armed ATC Infusions: Armed ATC will be infused intravenously (IV) with the rate of infusion based on the endotoxin content of the product. All patients will be observed for at least 4 hours after an infusion. Armed ATC infusions will begin 3 weeks after chemotherapy and subsequent doses will be administered once weekly, for 3 weeks, then 12 weeks post aATC#1. Dose escalation level(per infusion): Level 0-5 billion; Level 1-10 billion; Level 2-20 billion; Level 3-40 billion</description>
