    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 4, descriptive, observational, open, prospective study of patients who their
      doctor prescribes INFERGEN for clinical practice. No medication was provided by the sponsor.
      The planned observation time is 48 weeks and 24 weeks of follow-up.

      Each investigator participating in this registry will employ his or her discretion and
      standard clinical practice to determine when to see the patient in the clinic, how to manage
      the patient's drug regimen, and how best to monitor the patient's response and tolerance to
      therapy.
