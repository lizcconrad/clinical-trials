  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to examine the effects of Dobutamine as compared to Dopamine in
      term and preterm neonates with arterial hypotension on cerebral and renal oxygenation,
      fractional tissue oxygen extraction, mean arterial blood pressure and cardiac output.

      The investigators hypothesize that Dopamine has a stronger effect on blood pressure than
      Dobutamine but Dobutamine has a stronger effect on cerebral oxygenation and cardiac output
      than Dopamine.
