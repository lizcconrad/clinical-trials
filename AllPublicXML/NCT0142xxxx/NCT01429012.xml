  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Bone fractures heal most of the time particularly well and without complications. The
      solidification takes rarely more than two to three months. The wound healing depends greatly
      on a good blood supply and needs several steps. These processes culminate in a new mass of
      heterogeneous tissue which is known as the fracture callus. Unfortunately, 2%-5% bone
      fractures cannot achieve a proper solidification and between the ununited fragments a scar
      tissue appears. This incorrect healing induces pain and even infections. When this situation
      persists more than 6 months, it is referred to as nonunion fracture, which will require some
      form of intervention to stimulate the natural healing process of the body. First of all, good
      surgical techniques with stable immobilization should be applied and local infection should
      be excluded. Then stimulation of the callus is required. Cell therapy with bone marrow cells
      has emerged as a promising new approach for bone regeneration. Animal studies as well as
      preliminary human studies have shown that Mesenchymal Stem Cells, a particular kind of stem
      cells isolated from the bone marrow, could induce callus formation when injected in the
      nonunion site of a broken bone.

      In this study the investigators aim at determining whether Mesenchymal Stem Cells (MSC)
      isolated from the patient's bone marrow and injected in the nonunion site could be a safe and
      effective treatment for nonunion fractures. Patients will be randomized in two groups; one
      injected with Mesenchymal Stem Cell and the other injected with placebo. The investigators
      seek also to know how long it takes to develop the callus formation and whether there is a
      partial or a complete callus formation.
