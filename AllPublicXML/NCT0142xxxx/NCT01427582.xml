  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The YONDELIS (trabectedin) Single Patient Compassionate Use /Expanded Access program provides
      patients with advanced soft tissue sarcoma, who do not qualify for ongoing clinical trials
      with YONDELIS (trabectedin), access to this investigational treatment.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The single patient treatment instructions for use are intended for a single patient with
      advanced soft tissue sarcoma. The patient will be treated with YONDELIS® (trabectedin) i.v.
      formulation at a dose of 1.5 mg/m2 i.v. over 24 hours on Day 1 every 21 days, provided that
      he/she fulfills all eligibility criteria.

      The patient may continue to receive therapy until there is evidence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity. Safety will be evaluated and serious adverse events will be reported.
      Disease assessments will occur according to institutional practice.
