    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to determine the blood's mercury level of patients who had amalgam
      root end filling surgeries. It is to be examined if the mercury concentration in blood is
      elevated by using amalgam retroseal.

      -  A total of 14 patients who needs surgical root canal therapy (SRCT) participated in this
           clinical study.

        -  The Isfahan University Human Subjects Review Committee approved the protocol of the
           study.

        -  All patients filled in the consent form.

        -  Apicoectomy with retrograde amalgam filling performed for all participant.

        -  Blood samples were collected in three period of time immediately before and immediately
           after each surgery and also one week later.

        -  Each time 10 ml blood was drawn from each patient.

        -  Analysis of total mercury in blood samples was performed using cold-vapor atomic
           absorption spectrometry
