  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase II open-label study of the activity and safety of trastuzumab in patients
      with vulvar Paget's disease with overexpression of HER2 on biopsy.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective will be to estimate the anti-tumor activity of trastuzumab by
      evaluating the response to trastuzumab therapy in patients with recurrent or persistent
      vulvar Paget's disease demonstrating HER2/neu overexpression by immunohistochemistry and/ or
      FISH ((fluorescence in situ hybridization).

      The secondary objectives:

        -  To evaluate the quality of life, based on the severity of the patients' vulvar itching
           on a 4-point verbal rating scale from 0 to 3 (0=no itching, 1=mild itching/ bothersome,
           2=moderate itching/ troublesome, 3=severe itching/ extremely troublesome) as well as on
           the severity of the patients' vulvar pain on a numeric pain scale from 0-10 (0=no pain,
           1-3=mild pain, 4-6=moderate pain, 7-10=severe pain).

        -  To assess the frequency and severity of observed adverse effects

        -  To assess the frequency/ incidence of HER2 in Paget's disease of the vulva

    <time_frame>5 years</time_frame>
    <description>Where possible measurement of the target lesion size in 2 perpendicular diameters will be required for follow up. A Change in the product of these 2 diameters affords some estimate of change in tumor size and hence therapeutic efficacy. Response criteria will be based on the RECIST modified response evaluation criteria (appendix I).The reporting of these changes will be on an individual case basis and will be in terms of the best response achieved by that case.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>To assess the safety profile of trastuzumab in persistent or recurrent vulvar Paget's disease</measure>
    <time_frame>5 years</time_frame>
    <description>To assess the safety profile for all patients who receive any amount of trastuzumab will be evaluable for toxicity.At each visit, a brief focused history will be obtained and any indication of treatment related toxicity will be evaluated by appropriate examination and/or laboratory/radiographic studies using the CTCAE v4.0 toxicity grades for both laboratory and non-laboratory data.The evaluation period should extend from date of first treatment until 30 days (or longer if so specified) from the last dose, or until resolution from all acute toxicities associated with the drug administration.</description>
