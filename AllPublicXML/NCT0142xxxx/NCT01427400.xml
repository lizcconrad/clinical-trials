  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Breast reconstruction is a common procedure with over 86,000 breast reconstruction procedures
      performed in the United States in 2009. This is a 1.5-fold increase since 2007. Of these
      breast reconstructions, 65% use a tissue expander/implant technique. Although satisfactory
      results can be achieved with a single-stage technique, a two-stage approach is considered
      more reliable, allowing for precise positioning of the inframammary fold and an opportune
      time to perform a capsulotomy to increase the breast skin flap by releasing the soft tissue.

      The placement of the tissue expander and implant under the chest muscles is thought to
      minimize the incidence of capsular contracture, expander exposure, and in addition, produce
      acceptable aesthetic results. However, discomfort is often associated with this submuscular
      placement of a tissue expander or implant, specifically during the expansion phase. Patients
      undergoing immediate reconstruction using submuscular implants have been shown to have higher
      analgesic requirements and to have higher pain scores post-operatively, compared to
      non-reconstructed patients. An uncomfortable reconstruction can lead to under-filling of the
      expander, a longer expansion process, abandonment of reconstruction, and a compromised
      quality of life. The use of Botulinum Toxin A (Botox) injections into the chest muscles at
      the time of surgery may help ease the discomfort that is often associated with this
      procedure.

      The investigators propose a prospective double-blind randomized placebo-controlled trial of
      patients undergoing tissue expander/implant reconstruction. The information gathered from
      this analysis will provide a greater understanding of the effects of Botox in the setting of
      two-stage tissue expander/implant breast reconstruction, with the goal to improve patient
      satisfaction and quality of life.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Currently, there is level C evidence for the efficacy of Botox in the treatment of
      postoperative pain and muscle spasms in breast reconstruction patients. Additional high-level
      evidence is necessary to justify the use of Botox in breast cancer patients, which
      potentially will improve the reconstructive process for these patients and improve quality of
      life. Additionally, there have been no studies to date that have evaluated patient
      satisfaction and QOL in this setting. The investigators will evaluate patient satisfaction
      and QOL using the Breast-Q© during different time periods after two-stage tissue
      expander/implant reconstruction. Previous studies have demonstrated a reduction in pain when
      Botox was used during tissue expander/implant breast reconstruction, however, these studies
      were not blinded which may introduce bias. Additionally, a timely reconstruction is important
      to the patient, and a decrease in pain may result in a shorter fill interval and an increased
      total amount of volume in the tissue expander. The investigators will therefore document both
      the amount of expansion that a patient can tolerate at each follow-up visit and the total
      volume expanded, and compare the data between the Botox group to the group assigned to
      placebo.

    <description>The Breast-Q© is a patient reported outcome measure (PROM) for breast surgery that was rigorously developed to accurately measure patient reported satisfaction and quality of life (QOL). (http://www.mskcc.org/mskcc/shared/Breast-Q/index.html). The BREAST-Q was developed and validated with adherence to international guidelines. This PROM is composed of six scales that address: 1) psychosocial well-being, 2) physical well-being, 3) sexual well-being, 4) satisfaction with breasts, 5) satisfaction with outcome, and 6) satisfaction with care.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Patient-reported pain,using the BPI (Brief Pain Inventory) and Pain Diary during the expansion phase (initial to final expansion) and in the long-term period (6 and 12 months).</measure>
    <time_frame>BPI (before 1st surgery, day of surgery, 2 weeks, ~ 6 - 8 weeks, before 2nd surgery, 6 months and 12 months). After 1st surgery, pain diary is to be filled out every evening at the same time.</time_frame>
    <description>The BPI is a common patient-reported instrument used to assess clinical pain. The BPI assesses the severity of pain and the impact of pain on daily functions in patients with pain from chronic diseases or conditions or acute conditions (i.e. postoperative pain).
The question asked on the daily pain diary will be derived from the BPI: &quot;Every evening at the same time, please rate the worst pain you've experienced in the last 24 hours when 0 represents no pain and 10 represents the most severe pain imaginable&quot;.</description>

    <measure>Aesthetic outcome</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months and 12 months (after 2nd surgery)</time_frame>
    <description>Aesthetic results can be evaluated using different methods: patient-reported aesthetic satisfaction (Breast-Q) and aesthetic outcome from the perspective of the health professional. Standardized photographs using a three-category, five-item Breast Aesthetic Score. This scoring scheme separates the various components of the aesthetic results of the breast into different subscale thus allowing the rating to be more explicit. This score has not been validated, but has demonstrated good inter- and intra-rater reliability.</description>
