      For 28 days, healthy volunteers will consume one of four daily quantities of Tahitian Noni
      juice: 0 mL (placebo), 30 mL, 300 mL, or 750 mL. Hematology, biochemistry, urinalysis, vital
      signs, and adverse events measurements will be made at 0 (baseline), 2, and 4 weeks, as well
      as during a two-week follow up (week 6). Electrocardiogram (ECG) measurements will also be
      made for each volunteer during the pre-study screen and at week 6.
