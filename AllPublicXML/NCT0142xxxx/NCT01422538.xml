  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is a prospective,single-center, randomized clinical trial. Up to thirty (30)
      subjects will be treated. Enrolled subjects will be assigned to one of three (3) groups. Up
      to 10 subjects per group.

    <measure>Lifting and Tightening of Skin as Determined by Masked Assessment of Pre- and Post-treatment Photographs.</measure>
    <time_frame>90 days post-treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Three masked assessors reviewed pre- and 90 days post-treatment photos from 29 subjects who returned for their 90-day follow-up visit, assessing for improvement in skin laxity at 90 days post-treatment compared to baseline, i.e., lifted and tightened skin in the areas treated with the assigned study treatment based on the assigned study arm.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Overall Aesthetic Improvement at 90 Days Post-treatment</measure>
    <time_frame>90 days post-treatment.</time_frame>
    <description>At 90 days post-treatment, each site investigator and each subject completed a Global Aesthetic Improvement Scale (GAIS) (Physician GAIS - PGAIS; Subject GAIS - SGAIS), comparing to pre-treatment photos. The GAIS is 5-point scale (1-5) describing an overall assessment as follows:
= Very Much Improved
= Much Improved
= Improved
= No Change
= Worse &quot;Any Improvement&quot; includes subjects assessed in categories 1-3.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Overall Aesthetic Improvement at 180 Days Post-treatment</measure>

    <description>At 180 days post-treatment, each site investigator and each subject completed a Global Aesthetic Improvement Scale (GAIS) (Physician GAIS - PGAIS; Subject GAIS - SGAIS), comparing to pre-treatment photos. The GAIS is 5-point scale (1-5) describing an overall assessment as follows:

    <measure>Subject Satisfaction at 90 Days Post-treatment</measure>
    <time_frame>90 days post-treatment.</time_frame>
    <description>Subjects rated their satisfaction as Very Satisfied, Satisfied, Dissatisfied or Very Dissatisfied using a Patient Satisfaction Questionnaire (PSQ). Responses at 90 days post-treatment Responses were tabulated.</description>

    <measure>Subject Satisfaction at 180 Days Post-treatment</measure>
    <time_frame>180 days post-treatment</time_frame>

  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Subject's Assessment of Pain</measure>
    <time_frame>During Ulthera study treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Subjects' sensory response to the Ulthera treatment exposures were recorded for each anatomical region treated using a validated Numeric Rating Scale (0-10), with 1 representing no pain and 10 representing the worst pain possible. Pain assessment data were obtained from Group A and Group C subjects only.</description>

    <limitations_and_caveats>Entrance criteria possibly restricted to a population with too little skin laxity to assess a difference.
Group C time from Sculptra to Ultherapy may be too long to discern any added benefit of both treatments.</limitations_and_caveats>
