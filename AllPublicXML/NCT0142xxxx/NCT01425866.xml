  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Type 2 diabetes has a growing impact on populations and public health worldwide. Clinical
      trials have clearly demonstrated that a better control of blood glucose level and of other
      risk factors is efficient in preventing or retarding the complications of the disease. On
      Reunion island, Type 2 diabetes is present in 18% of population aged 30 or older with a high
      level of socio-economic deprivation. The hypothesis of the ERMIES study is that a structured
      group self-management education maintained at the community level for 2 years in patients
      with insufficiently controlled type 2 diabetes has better metabolic results (as attested by
      improvement in HbA1c level) at 2 yrs, compared to an initial short term (&lt; 3 months)
      self-management program, based on the same theoretical basis and framework (learning nests
      empowerment). A total of 240 adults living in Reunion Island, with type 2 diabetes mellitus
      with HbA1c ≥ 7.5% on a stable treatment for at least 3 months will be randomly allocated to 2
      intervention arms: either a short term (&lt; 3 months) program (1 to 7 thematic 2-hr long
      sessions depending on individual assessment), or a long term program including the same
      initial program as 1st arm, but with group self management education sessions, maintained for
      2 years (4-monthly assessment, empowerment, and contextual action planning; facultative
      additional specific thematic sessions being delivered if needed). Medical visits will be held
      quarterly for the recording of outcome measures (HbA1c, blood pressure, anthropometrics,
      tobacco consumption, diabetes complications) and yearly for blood glucose, lipids,
      micro-albuminuria or proteinuria, creatinine clearance, diet and exercise (questionnaires),
      treatment recording, quality of life, self-efficacy, anxiety and depression scales, and
      social support.

      Randomised clinical trial comparing 2 parallel arms of educational intervention with the
      hypothesis of the superiority of a 2-year maintenance of a structured, theoretically-based,
      educational follow-up. All subjects of both arms will beneficiate from an initial structured
      educational program (&lt; 3-months). Subjects, educators, and investigators will be unaware of
      the group allocation during this initial round. Then the intervention arm will undergo a 2
      years self management educational follow-up program. Randomisation will be stratified on 2
      factors : centres (5 strata) and anti diabetic treatment (2 strata: insulin-treated or not).
      All group sessions (3-10 subjects, 2 hr-long, one assessment group session and 6 facultative
      additional specific sessions for each round [initial in both arms or follow-up in the
      intervention arm], as needed and planned during the first) will be held at the community
      level, as closer as possible to the subjects' residence. Educators are specifically trained
      and the educational sessions are structured and coordinated in the framing and organisational
      supervision of the health management network &quot;ReuCARE&quot; in Reunion island. Subjects of both
      arms will continue quarterly to attend at the outpatient clinic of the centre. This trial is
      associated to a qualitative ethno-sociological study on a sample of 30-40 subjects, with
      in-depth interviews and ethnographic observation of group sessions, with the specific aim of
      describing the learning processes, coping, health and functional literacy, social and
      contextual issues.

    <description>After an initial intensive group education, four-monthly follow-up self-management group education sessions for 2 years. Each session is based on empowerment, socio-constructivism, social learning theory: personalized assessment (BG and risk factors, actions: realized, planned, achieved (or not), cognitive work, analysis of individual and social context and environment (facilitators, obstacles) then action planning. Specific additional sessions can be scheduled (food management, diabetes treatment and hypoglycemia, exercise, self monitoring of BG, insulin dosage, foot care). Sessions are framed, and structured, with patient booklet support. Sessions are delivered at the community level, by trained registered nurses, under the coordination of the health management network Reucare.</description>
