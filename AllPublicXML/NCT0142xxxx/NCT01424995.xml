      This will be a prospective study of all children ages 0 - 5 years old at the time of entry
      into the study that meet the inclusion criteria who present with congenital trigger thumb.
      Patient records will be reviewed for eligibility before obtaining parental permission. They
      will be enrolled in the study at their first visit and followed every year for up to 4 years
      or until one of the exclusion criteria are met. Participating sites include the University of
      Utah Orthopaedic Center, Primary Children's Medical Center and Shriners Hospital for
      Children.

    <textblock>
      Trigger thumb is a stenosis tenosynovitis of the flexor pollicis longus tendon of the thumb1.
      The eitiology of congenital trigger thumb is unclear with many authors proposing both
      hereditary and acquired causes2-4. Surgical release of congenital trigger thumbs has been
      recommended as definitive treatment, though controversy exists over the natural history of
      congenital trigger thumbs5-8. There have been a number of studies looking at the natural
      history of congenital trigger thumbs with spontaneous resolution rates ranging from 0-96%
      over a median duration of follow up that ranged from 6 months to 48 months9-14. Based on our
      clinical experience, the investigators do not feel that congenital trigger thumbs resolve
      spontaneously and that definitive treatment requires surgical release. However, the
      investigators need to do further scientific research into the natural history of trigger
      thumbs to determine how often trigger thumb resolves without needing surgical intervention.

    <description>The following physical exam measurements will be made at the first visit and all subsequent visits until completion of the study: flexion contracture of the interphalangeal joint of both thumbs (resolution of deformity defined as when flexion contracture is 0Â°), metacarpal-phalangeal joint laxity, and amount interphalangeal joint angular deformity.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Diagnosis of congenital trigger thumb based on physical exam and history, no previous
             treatment history (either operative or non-operative), no pain associated with the
             deformity, no functional disability due to the trigger thumb.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Previous operative treatment for the congenital trigger thumb, deformity of the thumb
             that causes pain, triggering that causes secondary deformity of the thumb, and
             deformity that prevents normal use of the thumb and hand.
