  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall purpose of this pilot study is to examine effects of Hatha yoga and
      cardiovascular exercise on craving, mood, cue reactivity, and smoking behavior. Our
      preliminary study indicated that a single session of either form of activity intervention
      improved mood, and the yoga intervention appeared to decrease cravings to smoke. The proposed
      study will extend this preliminary research in several ways.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      First, the investigators will expand the exercise-based interventions from one to three
      sessions, which will more closely resemble how these interventions may be used in the context
      of smoking cessation. Second, the investigators will recruit smokers who are motivated to
      quit smoking, further increasing the clinical relevance of the research. Finally, the
      investigators will examine the effects of the interventions on actual smoking behavior within
      and outside of the laboratory setting. This may appropriately be considered a &quot;proof of
      concept&quot; study, as the investigators will not be powered to detect treatment outcome (smoking
      cessation) differences, nor are the interventions designed to maximize clinical smoking
      cessation outcomes.

      Participants will be randomized to receive 3-sessions of yoga instruction, 3-sessions of
      cardiovascular exercise, or to a no activity control group. Sessions will be scheduled to
      occur approximately 7 days apart, with a minimum of 4 between sessions. Mood and craving will
      be assessed before and after each session, and smoking behavior will be assessed following
      each session. Finally, a detailed cue reactivity assessment will be conducted prior to the
      first session and following the last session. Analyses will examine intervention effects on
      craving, mood, cue reactivity, and smoking behavior. In addition, the investigators will
      examine several potential mediators and moderators of intervention effects on smoking
      behavior. Finally, the investigators will continue to examine the feasibility and potential
      acceptability of each active intervention, to assist in developing future clinical
      applications of these techniques in the context of smoking cessation.

    <description>Intervention effects on measures of craving, mood, cue reactivity, and smoking behavior will be analyzed with mixed-design analysis of variance (ANOVA), with Intervention as the between-group factor (HY vs. CE vs. NA), and Time as a within-subject factor (pre vs. post-intervention). Analyses for cue reactivity variables will include the additional within-subject factor of Cue Type (smoking vs. neutral), and analyses for craving and mood self-report will include the additional within-subject factor of Session (1 vs. 2 vs. 3).</description>

    <description>In order to determine whether intervention effects on smoking behavior are mediated by changes in craving, mood, and/or cue reactivity, we will conduct Sobel tests (e.g., Preacher &amp; Leonardelli, 2001), supplemented by mediation analyses using methods of Baron &amp; Kenny (1986).</description>
