  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the use of antibiotics (i.e. Kefzol) before
      percutaneous gastrostomy performed in interventional radiology. Patient will be randomized to
      receive antibiotics or placebo before the procedure, and the rates of skin infection after
      the procedure will be determined between the two groups. This has never been studied in our
      population of patients undergoing the procedure. However, antibiotics are routinely given
      despite the lack of evidence. The investigators hypothesize that patient receiving
      prophylactic antibiotics will have a decreased number of infections compared to placebo.
