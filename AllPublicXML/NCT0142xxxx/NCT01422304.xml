  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will assess the effect of reversal of neuromuscular blockade with sugammadex
      compared with reversal according to usual care (neostigmine or spontaneous reversal) on the
      incidence of post-surgical bleeding events and on coagulation parameters in participants
      undergoing hip fracture surgery or joint (hip/knee) replacement surgery with neuromuscular
      blockage induced by rocuronium or vecuronium.

    <measure>Number of Participants With One or More Adjudicated Events of Bleeding (Major or Non-major) With Onset Within 24 Hours After Study Drug Administration</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 24 hours post study drug administration</time_frame>
    <description>Post-treatment events of bleeding were evaluated by a medically-qualified, blinded member of the surgical team (Blinded Safety Assessor), in consultation with the surgeon, to determine if an event was a &quot;suspected, unanticipated adverse event of bleeding&quot; (SUAEB). A SUAEB is an event of bleeding outside the usual boundaries of expectations for a participant (e.g., in amount of blood lost, prolonged duration of bleeding, or other factors) considering the type of procedure as well as participant's specific surgical experience and underlying risk of bleeding. In addition, blinded review of clinical and laboratory databases was performed to identify any event potentially consistent with a SUAEB; these were reviewed by the Blinded Safety Assessor, who determined if any was a SUAEB. All SUAEBs were evaluated by a blinded external Adjudication Committee, which classified each as either: 1) a major bleeding event, 2) a non-major bleeding event, or 3) not an unanticipated event of bleeding.</description>

    <measure>Percent Change From Baseline in Activated Partial Thromboplastin Time (aPTT) at 10 and 60 Minutes Post Study Drug Administration</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 10 and 60 minutes post study drug administration</time_frame>
    <description>Change from baseline in aPTT is identified in study protocol as the Key Secondary Outcome Measure. Blood samples for determination of aPTT values were obtained at baseline and at 10 and 60 minutes after study drug administration. aPTT is a performance indicator measuring the efficacy of the intrinsic and common blood coagulation (blood clotting) pathways. Higher values of aPTT indicate a reduction in the clotting tendency of blood.</description>

    <measure>Percent Change From Baseline in Prothrombin Time (International Normalized Ratio) (PT[INR]) at 10 and 60 Minutes Post Study Drug Administration</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 10 and 60 minutes post study drug administration</time_frame>
    <description>Change from baseline in PT(INR) is identified in study protocol as an Other Secondary Outcome Measure. Blood samples for determination of PT(INR) values were obtained at baseline and at 10 and 60 minutes after study drug administration. PT(INR) is a performance indicator measuring the efficacy of the extrinsic and common blood coagulation (blood clotting) pathways. The INR is the ratio of a participant's prothrombin time to a normal (control) sample, raised to the power of the International Sensitivity Index (ISI) value for the analytical system used (INR = [PT-Test/PT-Normal]^ISI). Higher values of PT(INR) indicate a reduction in the clotting tendency of blood.</description>

    <measure>Number of Participants With One or More Adjudicated Events of Anaphylaxis With Onset Within 14 Days After Study Drug Administration</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 14 days post study drug administration</time_frame>
    <description>This Measure is identified in study protocol as an Other Secondary Outcome Measure. Anaphylaxis is a serious allergic reaction that is rapid in onset and may cause death. Adverse events suggestive of hypersensitivity which met defined criteria (e.g., serious event) and/or suspected events of anaphylaxis were evaluated by a blinded external Adjudication Committee to determine whether such events met either of the following two criteria for anaphylaxis (Sampson et al. J Allergy Clin Immunol 2006;117:391-7) - 1. Acute onset of an illness with involvement of the skin, mucosal tissue or both, and at least one of the following: a) respiratory compromise, b) reduced blood pressure (BP) or associated symptoms of end-organ dysfunction. 2. Two or more of the following that occur rapidly after exposure to a likely allergen for that participant: a) involvement of the skin-mucosal tissue, b) respiratory compromise, c) reduced BP or associated symptoms, d) persistent gastrointestinal symptoms.</description>

    <measure>Number of Participants Requiring Any Postoperative Transfusion</measure>
    <time_frame>From end of study drug administration through approximately 120 hours after study drug administration</time_frame>
    <description>The number of participants who received a transfusion unit (e.g., whole blood, packed RBCs, cell saver RBCs, fresh frozen plasma, platelets) that started after study drug administration and within 120 hours after study drug administration (or within 48 hours after any previous [i.e., predose] transfusion for participants who had received a previous transfusion) was determined.</description>

  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Total Transfusion Volume in Participants Who Required Postoperative Transfusion</measure>
    <time_frame>From end of study drug administration through approximately 120 hours after study drug administration</time_frame>
    <description>Among participants who received a transfusion unit (e.g., whole blood, packed RBCs, cell saver RBCs, fresh frozen plasma, platelets) that started after study drug administration and within 120 hours after study drug administration (or within 48 hours after any previous [i.e., predose] transfusion for participants who had received a previous transfusion), the total volume of blood transfused post study drug was calculated. The volume of blood transfused post study drug (using linear interpolation when transfusions were ongoing at the time of study drug administration) was converted to grams of Hgb transfused, using RBC concentration information received from the investigators. The sum of Hgb transfused was standardized to &quot;normal&quot; volume Hgb in homologous whole blood, using 20 g/dL Hgb for calculation of the standardized volume.</description>

  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Postoperative Changes in Hgb Concentrations Using the Bleeding Index</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Visit 3 (24-48 hours post study drug administration)</time_frame>
    <description>The Bleeding Index was used to describe postoperative changes in Hgb concentrations at Visit 3. Bleeding Index = Hgb level at Visit 3 - Hgb level at baseline, adjusted for the amount of RBCs transfused. Missing baseline Hgb values were imputed using the overall mean Hgb value at baseline.</description>

        <title>Number of Participants With One or More Adjudicated Events of Bleeding (Major or Non-major) With Onset Within 24 Hours After Study Drug Administration</title>
        <description>Post-treatment events of bleeding were evaluated by a medically-qualified, blinded member of the surgical team (Blinded Safety Assessor), in consultation with the surgeon, to determine if an event was a &quot;suspected, unanticipated adverse event of bleeding&quot; (SUAEB). A SUAEB is an event of bleeding outside the usual boundaries of expectations for a participant (e.g., in amount of blood lost, prolonged duration of bleeding, or other factors) considering the type of procedure as well as participant’s specific surgical experience and underlying risk of bleeding. In addition, blinded review of clinical and laboratory databases was performed to identify any event potentially consistent with a SUAEB; these were reviewed by the Blinded Safety Assessor, who determined if any was a SUAEB. All SUAEBs were evaluated by a blinded external Adjudication Committee, which classified each as either: 1) a major bleeding event, 2) a non-major bleeding event, or 3) not an unanticipated event of bleeding.</description>

        <description>Change from baseline in PT(INR) is identified in study protocol as an Other Secondary Outcome Measure. Blood samples for determination of PT(INR) values were obtained at baseline and at 10 and 60 minutes after study drug administration. PT(INR) is a performance indicator measuring the efficacy of the extrinsic and common blood coagulation (blood clotting) pathways. The INR is the ratio of a participant's prothrombin time to a normal (control) sample, raised to the power of the International Sensitivity Index (ISI) value for the analytical system used (INR = [PT-Test/PT-Normal]^ISI). Higher values of PT(INR) indicate a reduction in the clotting tendency of blood.</description>

        <description>This Measure is identified in study protocol as an Other Secondary Outcome Measure. Post-treatment events of bleeding were evaluated by a medically-qualified, blinded member of the surgical team (Blinded Safety Assessor), in consultation with the surgeon, to determine if an event was a &quot;suspected, unanticipated adverse event of bleeding&quot; (SUAEB). A SUAEB is an event of bleeding outside the usual boundaries of expectations for a participant considering the type of procedure as well as participant’s specific surgical experience and underlying risk of bleeding. In addition, blinded review of clinical and laboratory databases was performed to identify any event potentially consistent with a SUAEB; these were reviewed by the Blinded Safety Assessor, who determined if any was a SUAEB. All SUAEBs were evaluated by a blinded external Adjudication Committee, which classified each as either: 1) a major bleeding event, 2) a non-major bleeding event, or 3) not an unanticipated event of bleeding.</description>

        <description>This Measure is identified in study protocol as an Other Secondary Outcome Measure. Anaphylaxis is a serious allergic reaction that is rapid in onset and may cause death. Adverse events suggestive of hypersensitivity which met defined criteria (e.g., serious event) and/or suspected events of anaphylaxis were evaluated by a blinded external Adjudication Committee to determine whether such events met either of the following two criteria for anaphylaxis (Sampson et al. J Allergy Clin Immunol 2006;117:391-7) - 1. Acute onset of an illness with involvement of the skin, mucosal tissue or both, and at least one of the following: a) respiratory compromise, b) reduced blood pressure (BP) or associated symptoms of end-organ dysfunction. 2. Two or more of the following that occur rapidly after exposure to a likely allergen for that participant: a) involvement of the skin-mucosal tissue, b) respiratory compromise, c) reduced BP or associated symptoms, d) persistent gastrointestinal symptoms.</description>

        <title>Total Transfusion Volume in Participants Who Required Postoperative Transfusion</title>
        <description>Among participants who received a transfusion unit (e.g., whole blood, packed RBCs, cell saver RBCs, fresh frozen plasma, platelets) that started after study drug administration and within 120 hours after study drug administration (or within 48 hours after any previous [i.e., predose] transfusion for participants who had received a previous transfusion), the total volume of blood transfused post study drug was calculated. The volume of blood transfused post study drug (using linear interpolation when transfusions were ongoing at the time of study drug administration) was converted to grams of Hgb transfused, using RBC concentration information received from the investigators. The sum of Hgb transfused was standardized to “normal” volume Hgb in homologous whole blood, using 20 g/dL Hgb for calculation of the standardized volume.</description>
