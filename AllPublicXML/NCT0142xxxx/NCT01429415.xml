  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Acute asthma is the most common cause of pediatric hospitalizations. While the investigators
      know that repeat inhalations of ß2 agonists and ipratropium with early oral steroids
      substantially reduce hospitalizations, many children are resistant to this standard initial
      therapy. About a third of children remaining in moderate to severe distress after standard
      therapy are admitted to hospital and comprise 84% of pediatric acute asthma hospitalizations.
      Finding safe, non-invasive, and effective strategies to treat children resistant to standard
      therapy would substantially decrease hospitalizations resulting in considerable health care
      savings and reduction of the psycho-social burden of the disease. While studies of magnesium
      sulfate (Mg) given intravenously (IV) suggest that this agent can reduce hospitalizations in
      both adults and children resistant to standard initial therapy Nebulization is an alternate
      route for administering Mg. This route has the advantage of being non-invasive and is likely
      much safer due to lower systemic delivery. Direct delivery via nebulization allows higher Mg
      concentrations at the target site, the lower airways, with a smaller total drug dose. The
      investigators propose to conduct a properly designed study to clarify the role of nebulized
      Mg.

      The investigators plan the following specific aims:

        1. Primary Objective: To examine if in children with acute asthma remaining in moderate to
           severe respiratory distress despite maximized initial bronchodilator and steroid therapy
           there is a reduction in hospitalization rate from the ED in those who receive nebulized
           Mg with salbutamol versus those receiving salbutamol only.

           Hypothesis: The investigators hypothesize that the children with Pediatric Respiratory
           Assessment Measure (PRAM) ≥ 5 points after optimized initial inhaled bronchodilator and
           oral steroid therapies who are given nebulized Mg in addition to nebulized salbutamol
           will have significantly lower hospitalization rate within 24 hours of starting the study
           compared to those given salbutamol only.

        2. To compare a difference in the changes in the validated Pediatric Respiratory Assessment
           Measure (PRAM), respiratory rate, oxygen saturation and blood pressure from
           randomization baseline to 240 minutes in the two groups

        3. To determine if there is a significant association between the difference in the primary
           outcome between the groups and the patient's age, gender, baseline PRAM score, personal
           history of atopy and &quot;viral-induced wheeze&quot; phenotype.

      Hypothesis(es) to be Tested In this randomized, double-blind seven-centre trial, the
      investigators hypothesize that children with acute asthma with a Pediatric Respiratory
      Assessment Measure (PRAM) of ≥ 5 points after optimized initial inhaled bronchodilator and
      oral steroid therapies who are given nebulized Mg in addition to nebulized salbutamol will
      have at least a 10% lower hospitalization rate within 24 hours of starting the study as
      compared to those given salbutamol only.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. 2-17 years of age

          2. Diagnosis of asthma/reactive airways/viral wheeze, defined as this diagnosis made by a
             physician and at least one prior acute episode of wheezing with cough or dyspnea
             treated with inhaled ß2 agonists or oral corticosteroids. Our study population will
             exclude bronchiolitis and first-time wheeze (potential alternate diagnoses).

          3. Persistent moderate to severe airway obstruction after 3 doses of salbutamol and
             ipratropium, defined as a PRAM 5 or higher. A PRAM score of 5 or more following
             initial therapy indicates the child has at least moderate disease severity and has a
             high likelihood of being hospitalized.This group of children includes 84% of all
             pediatric asthma hospitalizations; therefore, finding an effective therapy for this
             population has great potential to significantly reduce hospitalizations. (Appendix B).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. No previous history of wheezing or bronchodilator therapy. Some children who present
             with wheezing for the first time will have other diagnoses which would not be expected
             to respond to Mg.

          2. Patients who have already received IV Mg therapy during the index visit.

          3. Critically ill children requiring immediate intubation. These children need immediate
             ICU management and hospitalization.

          4. Children who in the opinion of the treating physician require a chest radiograph due
             to atypical clinical presentation and are found to have radiologist-confirmed
             pneumonia. These rare patients may have to be hospitalized primarily for treatment of
             the infection and may not respond to magnesium.

          5. Known co-existent renal, chronic pulmonary, neurologic, cardiac or systemic disease.
             These conditions may influence the response to Mg and hospitalization.

          6. Known hypersensitivity to Mg sulfate.

          7. Patients previously enrolled in the study.

          8. Insufficient command of the English and or French language.

          9. Lack of a home or cellular telephone.

         10. Known allergy/sensitivity to latex.
