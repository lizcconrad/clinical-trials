  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Postoperative atrial fibrillation (POAF) is a common complication after heart surgery.

      Amiodarone is the drug of choice to treat POAF. Inflammation is considered one of underlying
      factor for POAF. Minocycline is an antibiotic with anti-inflammatory properties.

    <textblock>
      Currently, the most effective therapy to prevent PAF after cardiac surgery remains
      undetermined. Amiodarone administration should be considered to decrease the incidence of
      new-onset postoperative atrial fibrillation (PAF) after cardiac operations. However, PAF
      requiring anticoagulation therapy occurs in 40-50% of cases early after cardiac surgery
      despite amiodarone prophylaxis. PAF is associated with increased morbidity and mortality
      including complications resulting from long-term anticoagulation. The findings that an
      exaggerated inflammatory response manifested by elevated acute oxidative stress proteins, and
      the induction of apoptotic mediators in right atrial myocytes may be responsible for PAF, and
      that steroidal or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug therapy can reduce PAF support this
      mechanism as a possible etiological factor. Minocycline, a tetracycline antibiotic, has
      specific atrial myocyte anti-apoptotic effect which decreases right atrial tissue
      inflammation, oxidative stress activity and molecular indices of apoptosis. Apoptosis of
      cardiac myocytes is thought to be one etiologic factor underlying postoperative atrial
      fibrillation. These observations lead to this trial hypothesis that the addition of
      minocycline to amiodarone may favorably affect suppression of PAF. This randomized controlled
      trial compares the efficacy and safety of treatment effects of intravenous minocycline 100 mg
      daily x 5 days starting intra-operatively combined with oral amiodarone (400 mg twice daily
      for 7 days, then 200 mg twice daily for the next 7 days), versus the same dose oral
      amiodarone alone, in the prevention of PAF among adult patients undergoing coronary artery
      bypass grafts, heart valve replacement/repair, or combined procedures. All patients receive
      150 mg intravenous amiodarone intraoperatively and a 2nd similar dose of amiodarone bolus is
      permitted for tachyarrhythmia any time within 24 hours after surgery. PAF is detected by
      telemetry during hospitalization and 2 weeks following hospital discharge, by a 12-lead
      electrocardiogram. The primary outcome is PAF occurrence. Secondary outcomes include
      thromboembolic stroke, need for pharmacologic or electric cardioversion, mediastinal
      exploration for anticoagulation-related bleeding, serious drug side effects, Clostridium
      difficile superinfection, length of hospital stay and 30-day mortality from cardiovascular
      causes. Based on a projected PAF incidence of 26% and assuming 5% dropout rate and a
      two-sided alpha of 0.05, this design requires 400 subjects to detect a reduction of 50% in
      the primary outcome with 90% power. This is a valuable trial that would affect the method in
      which the investigators practice.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        -Eligibility criteria includes all non-congenital cardiac operations are included:

          -  coronary artery bypass graft (CABG),

          -  valve repair/replacement, or

          -  combination of CABG and heart valve operations.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  prior (within 6 months) or current PAF or flutter,

          -  prior cerebrovascular event,

          -  cardiogenic shock or resuscitation,

          -  evidence of hepatic or renal dysfunctions (i.e., an alanine aminotransferase level
             that is ≥ twice the upper limit of the normal range, or either a serum creatinine
             level that is ≥ 2.0 mg/dL or need for preoperative dialysis),

          -  thyrotoxicosis,

          -  pregnancy,

          -  severe COPD (FEV1/FVC &lt;70%),

          -  recent history of drug or alcohol abuse, and

          -  intolerance to tetracycline or amiodarone.

        Finally, because a core scientific basis of the trial concerned the role of underlying
        atrial tissue inflammatory activity, patients with inflammatory conditions such as lupus,
        severe arthritis, thyroiditis or inflammatory bowel disease are excluded; as are patients
        taking preoperative immunosuppressant agents, long-term oral corticosteroids, or estrogen
        replacement; and a newly diagnosed cancer (&lt;5 years).
