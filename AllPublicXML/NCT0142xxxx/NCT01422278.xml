      Evaluating the effects in functional status after three weeks of cognitive - and behavioural
      rehabilitation on patients with gait disorder. The patients are followed up as after 1 and 12
      months to study if any improvement is still present. The patients are being recruited from
      neurological units. The intervention is explanation of symptoms, positive reinforcement of
      normal behaviour and absence reinforcement of dysfunctional behaviour. In addition the study
      aims at describing typical gait patterns at patients with gait disorder by using
      biomechanical measurements (EKG).

      Patients are being recruited from neurological unit/ div and out patients department of SSR
      and are randomized to treatment or control group. Essential gait disorders do to conversion
      symptoms and willingness to participate in either of the two groups with informed consent are
      required.
