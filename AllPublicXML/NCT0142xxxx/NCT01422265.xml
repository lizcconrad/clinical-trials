      This multicenter, observational, prospective study will include approximately 20 US-based
      centers, and approximately 142 patients diagnosed with epithelial ovarian cancer, primary
      peritoneal carcinoma or fallopian tube carcinoma, whose disease has recurred &gt; 6 months after
      first-line platinum-based chemotherapy (first recurrence). Patients who have completed
      second-line chemotherapy and are currently in observation or undergoing bevacizumab
      maintenance treatment will be eligible to participate in the study.
