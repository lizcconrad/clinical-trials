  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to test whether body-worn wireless motion sensors can measure
      dyskinesias (involuntary movements caused by medications) in individuals with Parkinson
      disease (PD) independent of voluntary activity being performed and other PD motor symptoms
      (e.g. tremor).
