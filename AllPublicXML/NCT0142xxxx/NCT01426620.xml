  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial will evaluate phyto-therapy's, in the form of blueberry powder,
      synergistic effect on second-line therapy for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The
      proposition is that the addition of blueberry polyphenolics to routine docetaxel therapy will
      have a significant, positive effect in the response rate and overall survival.

      This study is designed to evaluate the feasibility of using blueberry powder (rich in
      anthocyanidins) as an adjunct therapy with the conventional chemotherapy drug
      paclitaxel/docetaxel for treatment of NSCLC. The study is based on information from published
      studies in which blueberry anthocyanidins (bioflavonoids which give blueberries their color)
      have been shown to regulate a vast array of molecular targets, and on our own exciting and
      compelling preliminary data showing that blueberry anthocyanidins elicited potent synergistic
      chemo-sensitizing effects in two highly aggressive non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cell
      lines.

             or non-melanoma skin cancer. In the case of other malignancies, patients may be
             considered for participation if the prior malignancies were diagnosed and definitively
             treated at least two years previously with no subsequent evidence of recurrence.

          7. Presence of an underlying disease state associated with active bleeding

          8. Concurrent treatment with other anticancer drugs

             vaccine, or device

         11. Patients with any other medical conditions that in the opinion of the Investigator
             would make the patient unsuitable for enrollment, or could interfere with the patient
