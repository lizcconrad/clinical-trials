  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Streptococcus pneumoniae is a major cause of serious bacterial infections, particularly among
      young children. Over 30 different types of the pneumococcus germ can cause invasive disease,
      but 7 types (namely serotypes 4, 6B, 9V, 14, 18C, 19F and 23F) are responsible for around 75%
      of cases in young children. A pneumococcal conjugate vaccine against these 7 serotypes (PCV7;
      Prevenar ®, Wyeth Vaccines) was introduced into the UK national immunisation programme in
      September 2006 and has resulted in a rapid reduction in pneumococcal disease caused by the 7
      serotypes among both vaccinated children and older unvaccinated children and adults through
      herd immunity. By 2009, over half of all invasive pneumococcal cases in young children were
      caused by six other pneumococcal serotypes (1, 3, 5, 6A, 7F and 19A) that are included in a
      newly licensed 13 valent pneumococcal vaccine (PCV13; Prevenar 13®, Wyeth Vaccines). In April
      2010, PCV13 replaced PCV7 in the UK immunisation programme with the aim of further reducing
      cases of invasive pneumococcal disease. The antibody responses induced by the 7 serotypes in
      both PCV13 and PCV7 have been shown to be comparable, but the protection offered by the
      additional 6 serotypes in PCV13 merits further study. Also, it is possible that the use of
      PCV13 instead of PCV7 may interfere with immune responses to other vaccines, such as
      Haemophilus influenzae serotype b (Hib), which are given to infants at the same time as
      PCV13. The proposed study will aim to collect one blood sample from infants after they
      receive their routine vaccinations at 2, 3 and 4 months in order to their measure immune
      responses to routine vaccines. The investigators hope that their results will help us better
      understand the added protection offered by the 13valent pneumococcal vaccine and ensure that
      children are adequately protected by the other vaccines they receive.

      This study will aim to prospectively recruit infants in the first 6 months of life who are
      either due to receive or in the process of receiving their routine infant immunisation and
      request one blood sample one month after completing their primary immunisation schedule,
      which will be at around 5 months of age, if they fulfil the inclusion criteria for the study.

      NUMBER OF SUBJECTS AND DURATION OF STUDY

      A total of 200 infants will be recruited in two centres - Hertfordshire and Gloucestershire.
