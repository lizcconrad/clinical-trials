    <textblock>
      Hypertension is a major and growing public health concern. Chronic elevation of sympathetic
      nervous system (SNS) activity has been identified as a major contributor to the complex
      pathophysiology of (essential) hypertension. The renal sympathetic nerves play a major role
      in the elevation of the SNS activity. Therapeutic renal denervation (RD), the deliberate
      disruption of the nerves connecting the kidneys with the central nervous system, has been
      shown to be an effective means of modulating elevated SNS activity - both by reducing the
      sympathetic modulation of renal function (renin release, sodium excretion and renal blood
      flow) and by removing the renal afferent sympathetic contribution to central blood pressure
      elevation.

      This current study is an observational exploratory study. The main objective of this study is
      to learn more on the effects of RD. We wish to do that by quantifying the effects of RD on
      various biological variables. Those variables are studied in four sets of investigations: a
      radiological set, a laboratorial set, a set of blood pressure measurements and a set of
      investigations in the vascular laboratory. The radiological set consists of imaging of the
      heart and kidney function (renal perfusion) and structure (renal arteries), the laboratorial
      set of serum and urine tests, 24 h- home- and office- blood pressure measurements will be
      taken and finally the set of vascular tests contains investigations on pulse wave
      velocity(PWV) and heart rate variability(HRV). The data will most likely help us to define
      future studies, to describe the mode of action and the effects of RD on various organs and
      systems in more detail, and finally to define in more detail which type of hypertensive
      patients is especially likely to benefit of the procedure.

      Hypothesis:

        -  We hypothesize that LV mass will decrease after RD. Because all patients have severe
           hypertension, it is likely that a substantial percentage will have increased LV mass.

        -  We hypothesize that renal perfusion and renal oxygenation increase after RD.

        -  We hypothesize that there will be no complications related to the device or procedure.

        -  We hypothesize that renal denervation has a beneficial effect on insulin resistance

        -  We hypothesize that renal denervation will decrease the blood pressure(office and
           24-hour-measurements)

        -  We hypothesize that RD has a beneficial effect on PWV and HRV.

      Objective: The objectives of this study are: the investigation of changes in left ventricular
      mass (LV mass) after RD using MRI, renal perfusion and renal oxygenation after RD using
      dynamic contrast enhanced MRI (DCE MRI)and blood oxygenation level dependent MRI (BOLD MRI),
      the evaluation of safety of RD, in terms of structural changes in the renal arteries and
      kidney using Magnetic resonance angiography (MRA). Secondly the evaluation of changes in
      various biological functions assessed by analysis of blood and/or urine samples. Thirdly the
      quantification of changes in blood pressure. Finally the changes in pulse wave velocity (PWV)
      and heart rate variability (HRV).

      Study design: Observational exploratory-study.

      Study population: Adults with a systolic BP ≥160 mmHg (≥150 mmHg for type 2 diabetics) with a
      stable drug regimen including 3 or more antihypertensive medications, including a diuretic,
      or inability to follow a stable drug regimen due to unacceptable side-effects of
      antihypertensive medication.

      Main study parameters/endpoints: The effect of RD on: radiological variables: left
      ventricular wall mass, renal perfusion, renal oxygenation and the anatomy of the renal
      arteries. Secondly the effect of RD on biological variables assessed by analysis of blood
      and/or urine samples. Thirdly the changes in blood pressure. Finally the changes in PWV and
      HRV after RD.

      Nature and extent of the burden and risks associated with participation, benefit and group
      relatedness: The risks associated with the tests and procedures performed for the clinical
      study are limited. There are no known risks associated with MRI when appropriate safety
      guidelines are followed. Based on the experience form our previous studies, we do not expect
      any potential risks regarding the cessation of anti-hypertensives.
