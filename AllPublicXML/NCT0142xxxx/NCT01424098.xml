  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A growing body of evidence suggests that individuals with chronic lung disease have important
      deficits in balance control that may be associated with an increased risk of falls. The main
      purpose of this study is to examine the effects of a balance training program on measures of
      balance and fall risk in people with chronic lung disease.

    <description>Training will consist of 30 minute sessions 3 times/week for 6 weeks in keeping with best practice guidelines for older adults. Sessions will be supervised by physical therapists, using a circuit training approach with different stations designed to target specific areas of impairment. Participants will work through stations in a group setting; however, will receive individualized exercise prescription regarding level of difficulty and exercise progression.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Diagnosis of COPD; a self-report of decline in balance or fall in the last 5 years or
             a recent near fall; smoking history greater than 10 pack years; and are able to
             provide written informed consent.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Inability to communicate because of language skills, hearing or cognitive impairment;
             and evidence of a neurological or musculoskeletal condition that severely limits
             mobility and postural control (e.g., cerebrovascular accident, advanced Parkinson's
             disease, amputation).
