    <measure>Hernia recurrence</measure>
    <time_frame>2 Years</time_frame>
    <description>Recurrence will be evaluated through physical exam and/or CT scans at all study visits (30 days, 6 months, 1 year, and 2 years), or when patients present with symptoms, with primary endpoint at 2 years.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Medical and Surgical Complications</measure>
    <time_frame>2 years</time_frame>
    <description>Medical and Surgical Complications, including seroma, wound infection or other concurrent infection, hematoma, fistula, ileus, skin necrosis, wound dehiscence, or any other device-related events, will be evaluated through physical exam and/or CT scans at 30 days, 6 months, 1 year, and 2 years, or when patients present with symptoms. These will be reported as total number of each complication within the total number of patients.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Quality of Life</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to 2 Years</time_frame>
    <description>Patients will complete questionnaires regarding physical functioning including activities of daily living, work productivity, and patient comfort at various timepoints after implant at baseline, and at all follow-up visits. Outcomes will be reported in the change from baseline to 2-years.</description>
