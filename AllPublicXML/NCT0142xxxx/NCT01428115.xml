  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It has been shown that emotional health issues, such as state anxiety, are more prevalent in
      patients suffering from inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) compared to physically healthy
      subjects.

      Such findings have to be taken into consideration when making an educated guess that
      psychological factors such as depression and anxiety in particular interact with the course
      of Crohns disease. Therefore the treatment of the underlying disease may have a significant
      influence on the level of psychological disorders.

      Several studies have shown that treatment with tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-Î±) antibodies
      ameliorates the emotional/psychological status of patients, however the impact of adalimumab
      therapy on anxiety correlated with the status of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) remains
      unclear.

      The primary objective of this study was to describe and evaluate changes in levels of anxiety
      assessed by validated patient questionnaires after 6 months of treatment with adalimumab.

    <time_frame>Baseline and Visit 3 [Month 6]</time_frame>
    <description>HADS is used to detect emotional disturbances (such as anxiety and depression) in non-psychiatric patients treated at hospital clinics. It consists of 14 items with 7 items relating to anxiety and to depression respectively. Each item is scored from 0 to 3 therefore scores for each subscale range from 0 to 21 with higher scores indicating higher levels of anxiety and depression. The scores were categorized as follows: 0 to 7 was normal, 8 to 10 was suggestive, and 11 to 21 was case.</description>

    <description>The sIBDQ is a disease-specific health-related quality of life (HRQoL) questionnaire, able to detect and define meaningful clinical changes in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients by measuring physical, social and emotional status. The sIBDQ consists of 10 questions, each question is scored on a scale from 1 (poor QoL) to 7 (good QoL). The scores are summed up and divided by 10 for a mean score ranging from 1 (poor QoL) to 7 (good QoL). A higher score indicates a better HRQoL.</description>

    <description>Harvey-Bradshaw Index (HBI) is for use in the assessment and quantification of symptoms and the present level of disease activity of patients with Crohn's disease. It is a validated clinical index for Crohn's disease, including the 5 categories of: general well-being, abdominal pain, number of liquid stools, abdominal mass and complications. The score ranges from 0 to 25 with higher scores indicating higher disease activity. The scores were classified as follows: less than 5 is remission, 5 to 7 is mild, 8 to 16 is moderate, and greater than 16 is severe.</description>

        <title>Short Inflammatory Bowel Disease Questionnaire (sIBDQ) Scores by Visit</title>
        <description>The sIBDQ is a disease-specific health-related quality of life (HRQoL) questionnaire, able to detect and define meaningful clinical changes in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients by measuring physical, social and emotional status. The sIBDQ consists of 10 questions, each question is scored on a scale from 1 (poor QoL) to 7 (good QoL). The scores are summed up and divided by 10 for a mean score ranging from 1 (poor QoL) to 7 (good QoL). A higher score indicates a better HRQoL.</description>

        <description>Harvey-Bradshaw Index (HBI) is for use in the assessment and quantification of symptoms and the present level of disease activity of patients with Crohnâs disease. It is a validated clinical index for Crohn's disease, including the 5 categories of: general well-being, abdominal pain, number of liquid stools, abdominal mass and complications. The score ranges from 0 to 25 with higher scores indicating higher disease activity. The scores were classified as follows: less than 5 is remission, 5 to 7 is mild, 8 to 16 is moderate, and greater than 16 is severe.</description>

        <title>Hospital Anxiety and Depression Score (HADS) â Anxiety Scores by Visit</title>
        <description>HADS is used to detect emotional disturbances (such as anxiety and depression) in non-psychiatric patients treated at hospital clinics. It consists of 14 items with 7 items relating to anxiety and to depression respectively. Each item is scored from 0 to 3 therefore scores for each subscale range from 0 to 21 with higher scores indicating higher levels of anxiety and depression. The scores were categorized as follows: 0 to 7 was normal, 8 to 10 was suggestive, and 11 to 21 was case.</description>
