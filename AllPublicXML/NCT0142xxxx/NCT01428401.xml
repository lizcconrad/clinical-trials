    <textblock>
      Astragalus membranaceus (AM) is used to treat stroke for a long period, and a number of
      studies have known that AM can reduce cerebral infarction area and has anti-oxidation.
      Hemorrhagic stroke will induce secondary peri-blood clot edema and that may increase
      intracranial pressure to exacerbate clinical symptom. Therefore, the purpose of the present
      study was to investigate the effect of AM on hemorrhagic stroke edema. The investigators
      selected 80 hemorrhagic stroke patients , and who the stroke is first attack, they were
      randomly divided into control and experimental groups, and each group was 40 patients as
      follows: 1) control group, accepted AM placebo 2.8 g three times per day (tid) treatment for
      continuously 14 days from second day of admission or operation, except standard ordinary
      treatment; 2) experimental group, accepted AM 2.8 g tid treatment for continuously 14 days
      from second day of admission or operation, except standard ordinary treatment. Computer
      tomography (CT) examination was done at first day, 4th day and 7th day of admission,
      respectively. The ratio of brain edema was calculated by CT image, and inflammatory index
      including the levels of C-reactive protein (CRP), erythrocyte sedimentation rate
      (ESR)，Creatine Kinase BB Isoenzyme (CMBB). D-dimer from venous blood also were measured. In
      addition, the score including Glasgow outcome scale (GOS), Modified rankin scale (MRS),
      Function independence measure (FIM), Barthel index (BI) was recorded one week, four weeks and
      12 weeks after admission or surgical operation, as an index for clinical symptoms. The index
      for the therapeutic effect of AM was according to above-mentioned the ratio of brain edema,
      inflammatory index and clinical symptoms.

      The investigators expected the results of the present study may provide a scientific evidence
      for the hemorrhagic stroke edema treatment of AM, thus, the present study may contribute to
      use the method of integrated Chinese and Western Medicine for the treatment of stroke, and to
      the research of Chinese Medicine.

    <description>The primary outcome measures were the differences in patients' scores on several clinical scales, between baseline (within 7 ± 1 days after the onset of stroke) and week 4 (28 ± 4 days), and between at baseline and week 12 (84 ± 10 days). The scales we used were the Functional Independence Measure scale (FIM), Barthel Index scale (BI), Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS), and Modified Rankin Scale (MRS). The scores of FIM, BI, GOS, and MRS were assessed by an experienced research nurse.</description>
