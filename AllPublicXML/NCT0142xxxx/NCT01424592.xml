      Hypothesis: Portable sleep testing of hospitalized medical inpatients suspected of having OSA
      is accurate in determining the need for positive airway pressure (PAP) therapy when compared
      to outpatient laboratory-based polysomnography.

        -  Hospitalized medical inpatients referred for suspected OSA will be tested with a
           portable sleep apnea testing device during hospitalization.

        -  These patients will then undergo an outpatient laboratory-based attended polysomnography
           after hospital discharge.

        -  Results of the inpatient portable sleep apnea test will be compared to the outpatient
           laboratory-based polysomnography in terms of diagnostic accuracy.
