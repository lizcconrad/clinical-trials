  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Periodontal instrumentation aims to remove plaque and calculus from the root surface. Both
      manual and ultrasonic instruments have been used for such decontamination; however,
      establishing a healthy periodontium can result in adverse effects, such as dentin
      hypersensitivity. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of hand or ultrasonic
      instrumentation on dentin hypersensitivity in patients undergoing non-surgical periodontal
      treatment. For this controlled clinical trial of a &quot;split mouth&quot; design, 14 patients were
      selected with homologous teeth in the incisor to premolar region and probing depth ≥ 5 mm on
      the buccal aspect of the teeth. One side (control) was instrumented with hand instruments and
      the other side (test) with ultrasonic instruments. Dentin hypersensitivity was assessed in
      the baseline and during the follow 4 weeks after treatment, with a periodontal probe
      scratching the root surface and with an air jet. The patient's response was detected by a
      visual analog scale (VAS) of 10 cm.

    <description>The individuals were instructed regarding causes and consequences of periodontal disease as well as prevention techniques, including the sulcular brushing technique and flossing. The retention factors of plaque (caries cavities, excess supragingival restorations and calculus) were removed during the initial visits. Clinical parameters were initially assessed 30 days after initial therapy.
The quadrants were randomly assigned and a total of 28 teeth were examined and treated. One side was treated with Gracey curettes (Hu-Friedy™ - Chicago, IL, USA) - control group and the other side with ultrasonic instruments (Profi II Ceramic™, Dabi Atlante - Ribeirão Preto, São Paulo, Brazil) - the test group, using the tip for subgingival instrumentation Perio Sub (Dabi Atlante ®).</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  patients diagnosed with chronic or aggressive periodontitis, according to the American
             Academy of Periodontology classification15, requiring non-surgical periodontal
             treatment in at least two quadrants. These quadrants should present two contralateral
             and homologous teeth in the incisor to premolar region with probing depth ≥ 5 mm and
             bleeding on probing on the buccal surface.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  presence of systemic illness or medication use (six months preceding the research),
             which could influence the response to periodontal treatment,

          -  performance of periodontal treatment including subgingival instrumentation in the six
             months preceding the study,

          -  performance of treatment for dentin hypersensitivity in the three months previous to
             the study,

          -  presence of periapical or pulpal changes,

          -  being under orthodontic treatment,

          -  smoking and

          -  pregnancy.
