  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a phase I study of a cell based prostate cancer therapy, Autologous Lymphoid
      Effector Cells Specific Against Tumor-cells (ALECSAT). Safety and tolerability of a single
      dose has been shown in 13 prostate cancer patients. In this study 20 prostate cancer patients
      will receive 3 doses of the ALECSAT treatment. In this therapy specific cells from the
      patient's own immune system are isolated, activated and re-administered to the patient to
      boost a specific immune response against the cancer cells. The aim of the study is to show
      safety and tolerability for repeated dosing of this type of therapy. It is the hypothesis
      that the cells administered during the therapy will attack the tumor cells and in this way
      stop or slow down the progression of disease.

      This study is a prospective open phase I study to investigate the safety and tolerability of
      administration of repeated doses of a cell based medicinal product (CBMP) ALECSAT.

      ALECSAT is an autologous CBMP that is made from the patient's own blood cells. ALECSAT
      contains a large amount of tumour specific cytotoxic Lymphocytes (CTL) and Natural Killer
      (NK) cells that are isolated activated and amplified in number.

      The CBMP is given as a slow i. v. injection to patients with prostate cancer. The patients
      are in the late stage of the disease where they have received hormone treatment but their
      disease is progressing.

      The primary objective of the study is to observe if any side effects or tolerability issues
      occur as a consequence of the repeated administration of ALECSAT, secondarily it will be
      observed if changes in Prostate-Specific Antigen (PSA) levels or any positive anti tumor
      effect may be observed. The study has the purpose to investigate whether repeated treatment
      with ALECSAT in any way is toxic.

      Trial Design: The study is an open, prospective phase I safety study of ALECSAT in prostate
      cancer patients.

      A group consisting of 4 patients will be treated twice with ALECSAT according to the
      protocol. Then an interim analysis will be done. If there are no signs of significant
      toxicity related to the treatment, the study will continue to the third treatment for these
      patients and with 14 more patients that will be treated with ALECSAT according to the
      protocol. Thus this study will include a total of 20 patients.

      The patients will after the first administration of ALECSAT be hospitalized for 2 days. Five
      and 10 weeks later the patients will be hospitalized for 1 day and receive the second and
      third administration of ALECSAT. Each patient will furthermore be followed closely for 12
      weeks after the third treatment. During the course of the entire study the patients will be
      monitored by 11 planned study visits, by the investigators at Department of Urology,
      Fredrikssund Hospital, Denmark.

    <description>To show safety and tolerability patients was monitored closely after administration of ALECSAT and during the follow up period. Heart rate, temperature, blood pressure, Performance status was monitored. Blood samples analysed were: PSA, Alkaline Phosphatase (ALP), Lactate DeHydogenase (LDH), Creatinine (CREAT) and Standard haematology: Blood picture (complete blood count, haemogram), leucocytes, Differential count, electrolytes, renal function, and liver count (liver enzymes).
AE and SAE was reported during the study period and the Investigator was urged to judge whether the event was related to the study product or not.</description>

    <time_frame>Within 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>No significant conclusion of efficacy is possible due to the study design with only one group of patients. However by analyzing and comparing the outcome with the data the individual patient presented at baseline some trends of efficacy, defined as stable disease or partial response, are possible. Trends towards possible treatment response were measured by monitoring PSA, a potential marker for prostate cancer disease progression; by other blood markers; and by Quality of life questionnaire (EORTC QLQ-C30) and WHO/ECOG (Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group). Control of any bone metastases were followed by hotspots and bone scan index measured by skeletal scintigraphy.</description>

Blood samples analysed were: PSA, Alkaline Phosphatase (ALP), Lactate DeHydogenase (LDH), Creatinine (CREAT) and Standard haematology: Blood picture (complete blood count, haemogram), leucocytes, Differential count, electrolytes, renal function, and liver count (liver enzymes).
AE and SAE was reported during the study period and the Investigator was urged to judge whether the event was related to the study product or not.</description>

        <description>No significant conclusion of efficacy is possible due to the study design with only one group of patients. However by analyzing and comparing the outcome with the data the individual patient presented at baseline some trends of efficacy, defined as stable disease or partial response, are possible. Trends towards possible treatment response were measured by monitoring PSA, a potential marker for prostate cancer disease progression; by other blood markers; and by Quality of life questionnaire (EORTC QLQ-C30) and WHO/ECOG (Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group). Control of any bone metastases were followed by hotspots and bone scan index measured by skeletal scintigraphy.</description>
