  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will investigate how 3 new types of drug formulations are absorbed by the body.
      This study is termed 'open-label', which means volunteers will be aware of which treatment
      they are receiving. The study involves all volunteers receiving all 3 different formulations,
      as a single dose, and there is no placebo (dummy-drug; no active ingredient) in this study.
      Volunteers will also receive a single dose of a formulation used in previous trials
      (reference formulation), so as a proper comparison with the new formulations can be made. One
      of the new formulations will also be administered along with food, to assess if the drug
      performs or is absorbed differently.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The present study will investigate the tolerability and pharmacokinetics of single oral doses
      of firategrast administered as the existing immediate release tablet formulation and as three
      modified release tablet formulations designed to release drug over differing relase rates.
      The range of release rates is expected to give preliminary information on the performance of
      a matrix modified release formulation for use in future efficacy studies.

      Subjects will receive each formulation in the fasted state in a randomised 4-part single dose
      crossover fashion. Based on the review of pharmacokinetic data from at least the first two
      study sessions, subjects may also receive a fifth dose of firategrast, administered after a
      high fat meal. The formulation administered with food will be chosen based upon
      pharmacokinetic data from previous dose sessions. Doses administered will be different with
      respect to gender; the doses are expected to result in similar exposures across the genders.
