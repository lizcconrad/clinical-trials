    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the non-inferiority between two different FDC,
      measuring LDL-Cholesterol levels, in high risk patients by NCEP-ATP III, with primary
      hypercholesterolemia or mixed dyslipidemia.

      The propose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of the combination Rosuvastatin +
      Ezetimibe noninferiority compared with simvastatin + ezetimibe combination - Vytorin ® - in
      control of LDL cholesterol compared to baseline stipulated in high-risk patients by NCEP-ATP
      III, patients with primary hypercholesterolemia or mixed dyslipidemia.
