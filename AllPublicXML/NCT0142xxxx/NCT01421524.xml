  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main purpose of this first in human study with CC-122 is to assess the safety and action
      of a new class of experimental drug (Pleiotropic Pathway Modulator) in patients with advanced
      tumors unresponsive to standard therapies and to determine the appropriate dosing level and
      regimen for later-stage clinical trials.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This trial is enrolling additional Multiple Myeloma (MM) subjects in a separate cohort
      defined as MM-2 to evaluate tolerability, safety and preliminary efficacy of CC-122
      formulated capsule alone or in combination with DEX on intermittent dosing schedule (5 of 7
      days of the week) in Pomalidomide-naïve subjects. Preliminary efficacy data in Multiple
      Myeloma subjects, warrants further exploration of CC-122 in MM on intermittent schedules to
      assess if dose intensity and tolerability can be improved. Initially, patients will be
      treated with oral CC-122 for one month. During this time, various tests (involving blood and
      urine collections, ECGs, etc) will be performed. Those whose tumors stabilize or regress may
      continue receiving treatment for as long as they benefit from CC-122. Different dose levels
      of CC-122 will be tested in a dose-rising study design.
