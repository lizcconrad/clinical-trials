      The purpose of this study is to investigate the tolerability, safety, pharmacokinetics (PK),
      pharmacodynamics (PD) and anti-tumor activity of E7050 when administered orally once daily to
      patients with advanced solid tumor and gastric cancer.

    <description>Drug: E7050 The starting dose of E7050 will be 400 mg given orally, once-daily, in patients with advanced tumor that have progressed following effective therapy. The study consists of 2 parts: a Tolerability Confirmation Component to confirm the tolerable dose in subjects with solid tumor and an Expansion Component to confirm the safety and to preliminarily assess the anti-tumor activity in subjects with gastric cancer.</description>
