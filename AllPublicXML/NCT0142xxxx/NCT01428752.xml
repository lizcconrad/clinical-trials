      Current guidelines for initiating screening colonoscopies in patients younger than 50 years
      of age who have a first relative history of colorectal cancer are controversial. The aim of
      this study was to prospectively define the prevalence of colorectal adenoma 30- to
      49-years-old asymptomatic subjects with a first relative history of colorectal cancer and to
      compare the data with controls.

      Design: Single-center prospective study

      Colorectal cancer screening is recommended for average-risk persons beginning at age 50. A
      family history of colorectal cancer is recognized as a risk factor for colorectal adenoma.
      However, the strength of this association is uncertain. Current guidelines for initiating
      screening colonoscopies in patients younger than 50 years of age who have a first relative
      history of colorectal cancer have proved controversial. The conflicting recommendations are
      partly attributable to the lack of data about the prevalence of CRC and adenomas among 30- to
      49-year-old individuals with a first relative history of colorectal cancer. This prospective
      study will quantify the prevalence of adenomas (any size) and advanced adenomas among 30- to
      49-year-old individuals undergoing their first screening colonoscopy because of a first
      relative history of colorectal cancer and compare the data with controls(asymptomatic
      subjects without a first relative history of colorectal cancer).
