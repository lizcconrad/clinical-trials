    <description>Mean change from baseline to week 12 (LOCF) in Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) total scores The MADRS is a clinician-rated assessment of the subject's level of depression and consists of 10 items. Each item is rated on a Likert scale, from 0=&quot;Normal&quot; to 6=&quot;Most Severe&quot;. The MADRS total score is calculated as the sum of the ten items and ranges from 0 to 60. Higher scores are associated with greater severity.</description>

    <description>The Clinical Global Impression - Severity of illness (CGI-S) score is a single value, clinician-rated assessment of illness severity and ranges from 1= 'Normal, not at all ill' to 7= 'Among the most extremely ill patients'. A higher score is associated with greater illness severity.</description>

    <description>The Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS) is an 11-item instrument used to assess the severity of mania. Seven items are rated on a 5-point scale, ranging from 0 to 4, and four items are rated on a 9-point scale, ranging from 0 to 8. The YMRS total score is calculated as the sum of the 11 items and ranges from 0 to 60. Higher scores are associated with greater severity of mania.</description>

    <description>The Hamilton Rating Scale for Anxiety (HAM-A) is used to quantify the severity of anxiety symptomatology and consists of 14 items. Each item is rated on a 5-point scale, ranging from 0 (not present) to 4 (severe/disabling). The HAM-A total score is calculated as the sum of the 14 individual items and ranges from 0 to 56. Higher scores are associated with greater degree of anxiety.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline to week 12</time_frame>
    <description>The Sheehan Disability Scale (SDS) is a composite of three self-rated items designed to measure the extent to which three major sectors (work/school, social life/leisure, and family life/home responsibility) in the patient's life are impaired by depressive symptoms. These three items are responded to on a visual analogue scale (VAS) ranging through 0 (no impairment), 1-3 (mild), 4-6 (moderate), 7-9 (marked) and 10 (extreme) disability. The SDS total score is calculated as the sum of the three items and ranges from 0 (unimpaired) to 30 (highly impaired).</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline to Week 12 (LOCF) in the YMRS Total Score</title>
        <description>The Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS) is an 11-item instrument used to assess the severity of mania. Seven items are rated on a 5-point scale, ranging from 0 to 4, and four items are rated on a 9-point scale, ranging from 0 to 8. The YMRS total score is calculated as the sum of the 11 items and ranges from 0 to 60. Higher scores are associated with greater severity of mania.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline to Week 12 (LOCF) in the HAM-A Total Score</title>
        <description>The Hamilton Rating Scale for Anxiety (HAM-A) is used to quantify the severity of anxiety symptomatology and consists of 14 items. Each item is rated on a 5-point scale, ranging from 0 (not present) to 4 (severe/disabling). The HAM-A total score is calculated as the sum of the 14 individual items and ranges from 0 to 56. Higher scores are associated with greater degree of anxiety.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline to Week 12 (LOCF) in the SDS Total Score</title>
        <description>The Sheehan Disability Scale (SDS) is a composite of three self-rated items designed to measure the extent to which three major sectors (work/school, social life/leisure, and family life/home responsibility) in the patient’s life are impaired by depressive symptoms. These three items are responded to on a visual analogue scale (VAS) ranging through 0 (no impairment), 1–3 (mild), 4–6 (moderate), 7–9 (marked) and 10 (extreme) disability. The SDS total score is calculated as the sum of the three items and ranges from 0 (unimpaired) to 30 (highly impaired).</description>
