    <textblock>
      The study is divided in 3 parts, starting with the safety assessment of BPR277 ointment in
      Healthy volunteers (Part 1). If found to be well tolerated in Part 1, BPR277 ointment will be
      assessed in two different patients groups to evaluate safety and efficacy in atopic
      dermatitis (Part 2) and in Netherton syndrome (Part 3).
