      RATIONALE: Studying tissue samples from patients with cancer in the laboratory may help
      doctors learn more about changes that occur in DNA and identify biomarkers related to cancer.
      It may also help doctors find better ways to treat cancer.

      PURPOSE: This research trial studies protein expression in samples from young patients with
      rhabdomyosarcoma.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  To measure the protein expression of candidate proteins in human rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS)
           tumor samples.

      OUTLINE: Archived tumor tissue samples are analyzed for protein expression (i.e., Notch1,
      Hey1, FGFR4, and Sp1) by IHC techniques and standard commercially available antibodies.
      Candidate proteins are then correlated with each patient age, gender, rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS)
      tumor stage, and RMS tumor subtype.
