      Back pa覺n is a common hormonal disorder in women that may affect the phases of female sexual
      function (FSD). We investigated sexual function in patients with back pa覺n A total of 54
      women with back pa覺n and 27 age matched voluntary healthy women who served as the as control
      group were evaluated with a detailed medical and sexual history, including a female sexual
      function index (FSFI) questionnaire and the Beck Depression Inventory. Serum prolactin,
      dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate, free testosterone, androstenedione,
      17alpha-hydroxyprogesterone, estradiol, free thyroxin and thyrotropin were measured. These
      variables were compared statistically between the 2 groups.
