    <textblock>
      The alternate binaural bithermal caloric test (ABBT) is a well established examination in the
      evaluation of the dizzy patient. ABBT is useful in detecting the side of peripheral
      vestibulopathy by stimulating each ear separately, it contributes to the diagnosis of
      bilateral vestibular involvement when all responses to cold and warm stimuli are reduced, and
      adds to the differentiation of peripheral from central vestibular involvement by measuring
      the fixation-induced inhibition of the caloric response. In spite of these benefits, ABBT is
      the most time-consuming part of the electronystagmography/Videonystagmography (ENG/VNG) test
      battery, and frequently causes significant inconvenience to the patient due to the repeated
      extreme vestibular stimuli.

      The head impulse test (HIT) assesses vestibular function by brisk, passive rotations of the
      head in the plane of the examined semicircular canals. Whenever the vestibulo-ocular reflex
      (VOR) is deficient, this maneuver would produce catch-up saccades aiming to the re-fixation
      of the eyes on the target. Hence, both residual VOR and catch-up saccades act synergistically
      to stabilize gaze. The HIT requires only several minutes and might cause minimal discomfort
      only.

      The study hypothesis is that the HIT recorded by standard VNG equipment of the VNG system
      would provide diagnostic information on the side of vestibular involvement matching that of
      the ABBT.
