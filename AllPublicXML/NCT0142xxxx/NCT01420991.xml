    <textblock>
      Aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (aSAH) is the most deadly kind of stroke. Each year,
      40,000 Americans have SAH. Case-fatality approaches 60% and more than half of those who die
      do so before reaching the hospital. Most commonly, SAH results from rupture of an
      intracranial aneurysm. Screening high-risk individuals could identify those at greatest risk
      and decrease the devastating effect of SAH. Aortic Aneurysm also constitutes a major public
      health problem with high lethality. Current estimates are that ruptured aortic aneurysm kills
      13,000 Americans each year. Screening efforts have effectively lowered mortality from aortic
      aneurysm rupture but a high proportion of those who die did not have a diagnosis of aortic
      aneurysm prior to rupture.

      The relationship between intracranial and aortic aneurysm has long been recognized, but
      poorly quantified. Recent genome-wide association studies (GWAS) provide a molecular
      biological evidence for a shared pathophysiology. The chromosome 9p21 locus confers increased
      risk for both intracranial aneurysms and aortic aneurysms. These GWAS data, along with
      linkage data for other susceptibility loci, indicate that individuals and families harboring
      one type of aneurysm may be at especially increased risk of the other.

      The rationale for this project is that opportunistic screening for abdominal aortic aneurysms
      (AAA) may be warranted in patients who present with aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage. This
      study is meant to see if the yield of screening in this population is too low to justify its
      routine use. The investigators plan to systematically screen for AAA in all cases of aSAH
      presenting to MCH for treatment. If no individual out of 81 consecutively screened cases of
      aSAH has evidence of AAA, then the investigators can have strong confidence that there is a
      less than 5% chance of finding an AAA in the patient population.
