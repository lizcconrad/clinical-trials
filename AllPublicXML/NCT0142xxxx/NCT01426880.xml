  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Study participants with primary breast cancer will receive a standard chemotherapy with an
      anthracycline and a taxane as well as trastuzumab in case of HER2-positive tumors at doses
      and duration in concordance to current treatment guidelines. Patients will be receive and
      benefit in addition currently not in the neoadjuvant setting registered medication as
      lapatinib or bevacizumab of which significant increases of cure (pCR) rates have been
      reported in previous phase III studies. Patients randomized to carboplatin will receive in
      addition to the described backbone therapies a potentially active agent which suggested
      synergy of efficacy with chemotherapies as well as targeted agents. Patients might have the
      risk of an increase in toxicities due to the added agents and will have additional burden due
      to investigations required for study participation. However, due to the severity of the
      underlying disease and the high risk of relapse and death due to the stage of disease, this
      increase in toxicity and burden appears less relevant compared to the potential higher
      efficacy and finally cure rate by the incorporated treatments.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Anthracycline/taxane based combination chemotherapy of at least 18 weeks represents the
      standard of care in the neoadjuvant setting. In HER2-positive disease trastuzumab is given
      simultaneously to chemotherapy. Recent data from the Neo-Altto and Neosphere trials suggest
      that a dual blockage of the HER2 receptor with e.g. trastuzumab and lapatinib reach
      significantly higher pCR rates than trastuzumab alone and should therefore represent the
      treatment back-bone of new neoadjuvant trials. A preplanned subgroup analysis of the
      GeparQuinto study demonstrated that in TNBC the addition of bevacizumab resulted in a
      significant increase of pCR rates (HR 1.4).

      Having a better cardiac tolerability profile compared to conventional anthracyclines, the
      non-pegylated liposomal encapsulated doxorubicin (NPLD) Myocet® might provide the possibility
      to combine taxane, anthracycline, platinum salt as well with targeted agents as double HER2
      blockage or bevacizumab.
