  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Although there has been some progress in chemotherapy for metastatic gastric cancer, no
      standard regimen of adjuvant chemotherapy is available, and many clinical trials have
      produced contradictory results. The majority of randomized clinical trials studying adjuvant
      chemotherapy in gastric cancer have been underpowered, involved low-volume centers, or used
      ineffective chemotherapy regimens. As a result, well-designed multicenter trials are still
      needed. The ACTS-GC trial, which demonstrated the efficacy of S-1 for stage II-III gastric
      cancer patients who underwent curative resection with extended lymph-node dissection (D2),
      may be valid in countries where D2 surgery is considered the standard of care. S-1 improved
      the 3-year overall survival from 70.1% for surgery alone to 80.1%. However, 3-year overall
      survival in stage IIIA and stage IIIB patients receiving S-1 were 77.4% and 63.4%,
      respectively, which are less satisfactory compared to the rate for stage II (90.7%). Based on
      the unsatisfactory outcome among later stage patients in the ACTS-GC adjuvant trial, further
      investigation is needed for more effective postoperative treatment of patients with stage
      IIIB and IV (M0) cancer. Therefore, the researchers investigated the efficacy and safety of
      S-1 versus S-1 plus cisplatin as adjuvant chemotherapy in patient with curatively resected
      gastric adenocarcinoma.

      This controlled study is designed to evaluate the efficacy of S-1 on survival compared with
      S-1 plus cisplatin. Patients will be randomly assigned to receive either surgery followed by
      treatment with S-1 plus cisplatin or surgery followed by treatment with S-1 within 42 days
      after curative resection. To assess the efficacy, data on recurrence and survival will be
      collected from the time of enrollment until 5 years after surgery. To evaluate safety, data
      on adverse events will be collected from the time of enrollment until 1 year after surgery.
