  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of Taiwan. American Heart Association (AHA)
      indicated that CVD patients with Statin therapy would decrease the recurrence of CVD. The
      goal for lipid lowering in CVD patients was set at the level of low-density lipoprotein
      cholesterol (LDL-C) below 100 mg/dL. Coenzyme Q10 is recognized as a lipid soluble
      antioxidant, Statin treatment might affect the level of coenzyme Q10. Therefore, the purposes
      of this study are going to investigate the relation of coenzyme Q10 with other antioxidant
      vitamins (Vitamin A and E), the markers of lipid peroxidation, antioxidant enzymes
      activities, and the inflammatory markers in coronary artery disease (CAD) patients during
      Statin therapy. The study is going to design a placebo-controlled study. The investigators
      will recruit coronary artery disease (CAD) patients who are identified by cardiac
      catheterization as having at least 50% stenosis of one major coronary artery, and healthy
      subjects. CAD subjects are randomly assign to placebo and coenzyme Q10 supplements (150
      mg/bid = 300 mg/d) groups. Intervention is going to administration for three months. Fasting
      blood will be obtained in each month and determine the concentration of antioxidant vitamins,
      lipid peroxidation markers, antioxidant enzymes activities after intervention. Meanwhile, the
      investigators will measure the level of inflammatory markers in all subjects of this study.
      Hopefully, the results of this study could provide information of coenzyme Q10
      supplementation for clinical dietitian in advising CAD patients who are under Statin therapy.
