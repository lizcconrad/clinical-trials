    <textblock>
      MEK112111 is a dose-escalation, Phase IB, open-label, single-arm, multi-center study. The
      primary objective of the study is to determine the recommended dose and regimen for the
      orally administered MEK inhibitor GSK1120212 dosed in combination with gemcitabine in
      subjects with solid tumors.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Subjects will be enrolled using a dose-escalation procedure in which the initial cohort
      receives a fraction of the GSK1120212 dose that achieved a dose limiting toxicity in a
      previous study and the recommended dose of gemcitabine. Escalation will proceed until the
      maximum tolerated doses are identified. These doses will be selected based on emerging safety
      data. Confirmation of the tolerability of the Recommended Phase II Dose (RP2D) will be
      explored in approximately 12 subjects. Subjects will continue on treatment until treatment
      discontinuation criteria are met (disease progression, intercurrent illness, adverse event or
      consent withdrawal).

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Capable of giving written informed consent, which includes compliance with the
             requirements and restrictions listed in the consent form.

          -  Age 18 years old or older and able to swallow oral medication.

          -  Performance Status score of 0 or 1 according to the Eastern Cooperative Oncology
             (ECOG) scale.

          -  Histologically or cytologically confirmed diagnosis of a solid tumor malignancy that
             is either relapsed or refractory, or potentially responsive to gemcitabine.

          -  Tumor Type criteria as listed in protocol.

          -  Male subjects must agree to use one of the contraception methods listed in protocol.

          -  A female subject is eligible to participate if she is of non-childbearing potential as
             defined in the protocol or postmenopausal as defined in the protocol. If of
             child-bearing potential, she agrees to use protocol specified contraceptive methods

          -  Adequate organ system function as defined below in the protocol.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Chemotherapy, radiotherapy, or immunotherapy within 28 days (or 42 days for prior
             nitrosoureas or mitomycin C) prior to the first dose of GSK1120212.

          -  Use of an investigational anti-cancer drug within 28 days or five half-lives,
             whichever is shorter preceding the first dose of GSK1120212 - as long as a minimum of
             14 days has passed between the last dose of the prior investigational anti-cancer drug
             and the first dose of GSK1120212.

          -  Unresolved toxicity greater than common terminology criteria for adverse events (CTCAE
             v4.0) grade 1 from previous anti-cancer therapy.

          -  History of acute coronary within the past 24 weeks.
