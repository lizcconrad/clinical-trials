  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Nonanesthesiologist administration of propofol for sedation is actually a field of growing
      interest for endoscopists, as demonstrated by recent American and European guidelines on this
      issue. Propofol is a hypnotic drug with rapid onset and offset of action. Used as a single
      agent, it is commonly titrated to deep sedation, whereas balanced propofol sedation (BPS),
      which combines propofol with small doses of a benzodiazepine and/or an opioid, can be
      successfully titrated to moderate sedation. However, nonanesthesiologists propofol
      administration remains controversial on account of the possibility of deep sedation/general
      anesthesia related adverse events. On the other hand, the use of longer elimination half-life
      drugs, such as opioids and benzodiazepines, may theoretically prolong sedation and recovery.

      Up to date, no study has addressed a head-to-head comparison of both regimens administered by
      non-anesthesiologists and titrated to moderate sedation.

      This study aims to evaluate the impact on propofol sedation of premedication with a fixed
      dose of midazolam (2 mg)2 minutes before propofol administration targeted to moderate
      sedation, in terms of depth of sedation, recovery times, safety and satisfaction.

      The onset of sedative action of midazolam has been reported to be 1-2.5 minutes and the peak
      effect of midazolam occurs 8-12 minutes. Taking into account that colonoscopy usually lasts a
      minimum of 15-20 minutes, our hypothesis is that synergy between propofol and midazolam may
      increase the depth of sedation through the initial phases of the procedure, diminishing
      propofol requirements, but not prolonging significantly recovery times.

    <textblock>
      Justification of the study:

      Nonanesthesiologist administration of propofol is controversial owing to deep sedation
      concerns. One of the latest therapeutic innovations on this issue has been the development of
      balanced propofol sedation, which consists of adding low doses of opioids or benzodiazepins.
      Several studies have recently demonstrated that BPS allows successfully moderate sedation,
      maintains a reversible drug component, reduces the total dose of propofol even by more than
      50% without increasing adverse events and maintains high levels of physician and patient
      satisfaction, even for advanced endoscopic procedure. However, recovery may be prolonged by
      using midazolam or meperidine as they have a longer elimination half-life than propofol has.

      Up to date, nonanesthesiologist administration of propofol and BPS, using either midazolam or
      fentanyl, for outpatient colonoscopy have been compared in a single non-placebo controlled
      randomized trial (VanNatta and Rex, 2006). In this study, the authors obtained shorter
      recovery times with BPS compared to propofol alone, in contrast with the expected on account
      of pharmacokinetics. These results can be easily understood yet single-agent propofol was
      titrated to deep sedation, whereas BPS was titrated to moderate sedation.

      Therefore, it is necessary to make a randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial to
      directly compare both sedation regimens targeted to a similar moderate level of sedation. The
      results of this study will conclude which should be the first line treatment for moderate
      sedation in colonoscopy, providing further insight in drug synergy and its impact on the
      depth of sedation and recovery times

    <description>After completion of the procedure, the patient stood in the examination room monitored continuously by a nurse. When patients responded to normal verbal command, they were asked to sit up and were offered a drink. This was considered the early recovery time.
If they were able to stand unassisted by the bed and had stable hemodynamics parameters (saturation&gt;90 % on room air and blood pressure and heart rate within 20 % of baseline), they were transferred to a locker room accompanied by a relative. The discharge criteria included ability to stand unassisted and tolerate clear liquids once dressed. Once a patient met discharge criteria, they were allowed to leave at their own discretion</description>

    <measure>Rate of Sedation-related Complications During the Procedure and the Recovery Phases</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to two hours, including colonoscopy performance and recovery period</time_frame>
    <description>The following events were considered complications of procedural sedation: a decline in oxygen saturation to less than 85 % longer than 30 s after increasing the oxygen flow rate to 5 L/min and transient propofol interruption, a heart rate less than 40 beats per minute and blood pressure less than 80/50 mmHg. Major complications were defined as need for mechanical ventilation or any cardiorespiratory event requiring anaesthesiologist assistance.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Rate of Patients and Physician Satisfaction With Sedation</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 1 hour after colonoscopy for endoscopists and up to 48 hours for patients</time_frame>
    <description>Endoscopists and patients rated their satisfaction with sedation in a 10-cm visual analogue scale after discharge.The patients were contacted 24-48 h after the procedure to answer a questionnaire regarding if they remembered scope insertion or scope removal and willingness to repeat it with a similar protocol and rated their satisfaction and pain perception from 0 to 10. This phone survey was done by the nurse specifically making the measurements in the endoscopy room, who was blinded to the sedation regimen.
For the interpretation of results of the 0-10 point numerical scale, 0 stands for 'extremely dissatisfied with sedation level during the endoscopic procedure', whereas 10 stands for 'extremely satisfied with sedation level during the endoscopic procedure&quot;.</description>

        <description>After completion of the procedure, the patient stood in the examination room monitored continuously by a nurse. When patients responded to normal verbal command, they were asked to sit up and were offered a drink. This was considered the early recovery time.
If they were able to stand unassisted by the bed and had stable hemodynamics parameters (saturation&gt;90 % on room air and blood pressure and heart rate within 20 % of baseline), they were transferred to a locker room accompanied by a relative. The discharge criteria included ability to stand unassisted and tolerate clear liquids once dressed. Once a patient met discharge criteria, they were allowed to leave at their own discretion</description>

        <description>The following events were considered complications of procedural sedation: a decline in oxygen saturation to less than 85 % longer than 30 s after increasing the oxygen flow rate to 5 L/min and transient propofol interruption, a heart rate less than 40 beats per minute and blood pressure less than 80/50 mmHg. Major complications were defined as need for mechanical ventilation or any cardiorespiratory event requiring anaesthesiologist assistance.</description>

        <title>Rate of Patients and Physician Satisfaction With Sedation</title>
        <description>Endoscopists and patients rated their satisfaction with sedation in a 10-cm visual analogue scale after discharge.The patients were contacted 24–48 h after the procedure to answer a questionnaire regarding if they remembered scope insertion or scope removal and willingness to repeat it with a similar protocol and rated their satisfaction and pain perception from 0 to 10. This phone survey was done by the nurse specifically making the measurements in the endoscopy room, who was blinded to the sedation regimen.
For the interpretation of results of the 0-10 point numerical scale, 0 stands for 'extremely dissatisfied with sedation level during the endoscopic procedure', whereas 10 stands for 'extremely satisfied with sedation level during the endoscopic procedure&quot;.</description>
