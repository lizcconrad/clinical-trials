    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to determine whether the use of mouthwashes Caphosol ™ in
      addition to standard oral care (strategy A) is cost-effective in the prevention and treatment
      of severe mucositis in adult patients with auto or allograft packaging without ICT versus
      mouthwashes standard bicarbonates with an antiseptic (strategy B).

    <description>The Caphosol ™ is a recently launched medical in France (2009). (source: laboratory EUSA Pharma ®)
The product is an aqueous solution for mouthwash that comes in the form of a hyper-saturated mixture of calcium phosphate at neutral pH to reconstitute immediately before use.
Each patient randomized to the treatment arms in the study will receive daily at least 4 (maximum 10) mouthwash Caphosol ™.
The treatments are to begin preventive J1 to chemotherapy and continued until out of aplasia (ANC&gt; 500/mm3), and / or mucositis grade 0.</description>
