    <textblock>
      EPIPAGEADO is an observational study. Respiratory symptoms and lung function will be
      evaluated in very low birth weight and term infants, born in 1997 and included in the French
      EPIPAGE cohort.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      EPIPAGEADO is a multicenter observational study:- to evaluate respiratory symptoms and lung
      function at adolescence in very low birthweight (VLBW) children, to identify perinatal risk
      factors for persistent symptoms or impaired lung function tests at adolescence, to assess the
      exercise tolerance in VLBW children and to search for genetic susceptibility markers
      associated to impaired lung function.

      The main criteria for analysis will be the forced expiratory volume in one seconde (FEV1) The
      study duration will be 36 months the number of centers will be 4 centers in France
      (Paris-Necker, Nantes, Lille, Rouen) The number of patients to be included will be 400,
      including 260 VLBW children without BPD, 40 VLBW children with BPD, 100 control children with
      birth at term.
