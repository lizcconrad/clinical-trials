  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single and multiple dose, open-label study to evaluate the pharmacokinetics (PK),
      safety, and tolerability of dexpramipexole administered orally to adult Japanese and
      Caucasian healthy subjects.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study is designed to evaluate the influence of ethnic factors on dexpramipexole safety,
      tolerability, and PK. Subjects will be admitted to the clinical unit on Day -1 (the day prior
      to first dosing) and will remain in the clinical unit under observation until discharge. All
      subjects will have a final follow up visit. Whilst resident in the clinic, subjects will
      receive 4 treatments: The first 3 treatments comprise Part A of the study and the final
      treatment group comprises Part B.

      Part A:

      Treatment 1: Dose 1 (reduced) of dexpramipexole; a single dose Treatment 2: Dose 2 (standard)
      dexpramipexole; a single dose Treatment 3: Dose 3 (standard) dexpramipexole; 5 doses
      administered at 12 hour intervals Part B: Dose 4 (standard) dexpramipexole; 5 doses
      administered at 12 hour intervals There will be a minimum washout of 3 days between
      treatments.

      For all subjects, prior to proceeding to the next treatment group, safety and tolerability
      data will be reviewed.

      Caucasian subjects will be matched individually (on a 1:1 basis) to Japanese subjects with
      respect to gender and age and if possible BMI.
