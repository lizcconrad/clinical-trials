      The purpose of the MENU Study is to examine whether there is a differential weight loss
      response to different dietary macronutrient composition (higher carbohydrate and lower fat
      versus lower carbohydrate and higher monounsaturated fat [MUFA] or lower carbohydrate and
      walnut-rich higher fat diets) in a weight loss intervention in healthy obese women, depending
      on insulin resistance status. Blood samples will be collected to enable analysis of potential
      mechanisms and differential response across subgroups.
