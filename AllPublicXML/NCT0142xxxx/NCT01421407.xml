  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Secondary hyperparathyroidism (sHPT) is common in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD),
      including those who are undergoing long-term haemodialysis treatment. sHPT is characterized
      by persistently elevated levels of parathyroid hormone (PTH) and major disturbances in
      phosphorus and calcium metabolism. When glomerular filtration rate (GFR) falls, the
      phosphorus clearance decreases significantly, leading to phosphorus retention. The resulting
      hyperphosphatemia is thought to be one of the principal causes of secondary
      hyperparathyroidism which is a very early complication of patients with CKD. Its diagnosis
      and treatment is crucial in the management of such patients.The treatment of the sHPT of
      CKD's patient includes dietary phosphate restriction, the use of phosphate binders,
      correction of hypocalcaemia, the use of vitamin D and its derivatives. The calcimimetic agent
      cinacalcet hydrochloride may be also used in combination with vitamin D. While the majority
      of patients can be controlled in this way, medical therapy is not always successful in
      achieving adequate control of secondary hyperparathyroidism. Oral medications (calcimimetics,
      recently developed phosphate binders, and active vitamin D derivatives amount to very high
      monthly costs, and have efficacy limitations as well as side-effects.

      HIFU may become a valuable alternative treatment that help control secondary
      hyperparathyroidism in selected patients presenting with enlarged parathyroid gland(s)
      visible at ultrasonography,.

      The aim of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of HIFU treatment in chronic
      haemodialysis patients with secondary hyperparathyroidism presenting with enlarged
      parathyroid gland(s) which are visible at ultrasonography and for whom medical therapy has
      been unsuccessful.
