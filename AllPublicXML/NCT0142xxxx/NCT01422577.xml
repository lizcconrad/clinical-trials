    <textblock>
      Early detection of colo-rectal adenoma using colonoscopy can prevent occurrence of colon
      cancers. While colonoscopy is a standard technique, it can miss early cancers. To improve the
      detection rate, Narrow Band Imaging (NBI) was introduced in 2006. It has been shown to
      compare favorably with chromo-endoscopy in the sensitivity and specificity in the diagnosis
      of malignant colo-rectal neoplasms. The major drawback of NBI is that images become dark in
      the presence of blood and fecal matters. The bright-NBI is a prototype imaging technology
      that enables endoscopists to obtain better images in suboptimal conditions. The study
      proposes to compare the performance of colonoscopy using either white light or bright NBI in
      subjects undergoing screening colonoscopy in search for colon adenomas.

      Purpose

      To determine that bright -NBI is superior to WLE in detecting colorectal adenomas in average
      risk subjects undergoing screening colonoscopy.

      Removal of colorectal adenomas prevents occurrence of cancers [1]. It is recognized that
      colonoscopy can miss colorectal adenomas and early cancers [2]. There is a need to further
      improve performance of colonoscopy. The use of chromo-endoscopy has been shown to improve
      detection of flat adenomas [3]. Narrow band imaging was introduced in year 2006. It is
      similar to chromo-endoscopy in that it provides more mucosal details. This enables
      endoscopists to accurately describe the pit pattern of adenomas. NBI has been used as a
      substitute to chromo-endoscopy. In pooled analysis, NBI is comparable to chromo-endoscopy in
      their sensitivity and specificity in the diagnosis of malignant colorectal adenomas [4].
      Unfortunately, the use of NBI has not been shown to conclusively improve rate of colorectal
      adenoma detection. Two of 3 randomized trials that compared WLE to NBI showed a higher
      adenoma detection rate with the use of NBI [5, 6]. In a study by Rex et al., the rate was
      however similar with either modality. In a pooled analysis, NBI was only marginally better
      than WLE [4].

      The effective use of NBI depends on the quality of bowel preparation and the experience of
      endoscopist. In the presence of fecal matters, NBI tends to be dark and detection of small
      adenomas becomes difficult. The prototype bright NBI coupled with high definition resolution
      is likely to overcome this drawback of original NBI.
