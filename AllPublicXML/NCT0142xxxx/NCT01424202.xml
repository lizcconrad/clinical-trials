  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Weaning protocols that include the use of noninvasive ventilation (NIV), decreases the
      incidence of re-intubation and ICU length of stay. However, the role of NIV in
      post-extubation failure is still not clear. Impaired airway clearance is associated with NIV
      failure. Mechanical Insufflation-Exsufflation (MI-E) is an assisted coughing technique that
      has been proven to be very effective in patients under NIV.

      In this study the investigators assess the efficacy of MI-E as part of a protocol for
      patients that develop respiratory failure after extubation.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients under mechanical ventilation (MV) for more than 48 hours with specific inclusion
      criteria, who successfully tolerated an spontaneous breathing trial (SBT) were randomly
      allocated before extubation, either for (A) conventional extubation protocol (control group)
      or (B) MI-E extubation protocol (study group). Re-intubation rates, ICU length of stay and
      NIV failure rates were analyzed.

      Inclusion of MI-E in post-extubation failure may reduce re-intubation rates with consequent
      reduction in post-extubation ICU length of stay. This technique seems to be efficient in
      improving the efficacy of NIV in this patient population.

    <description>After passing the SBT and randomized to group B, before extubation, all patients were submitted to a treatment of MI-E (3 sessions) through the endotracheal tube with pressures set at 40 cm H2O for insufflation and -40 cm H2O for exsufflation pressure. An insufflation/exsufflation time ratio of 3secs/2 secs and a pause of 3 sec between each cycle was used. Eight cycles were applied in every session with an abdominal thrust timed to the exsufflation cycle.
On top of the standard medical therapy, during the first 48 hours post extubation, each patient received 3 daily treatments by means of a light-weight, elastic oronasal mask. Treatments (3 sessions each) were divided between morning, afternoon and night, making a total of 9 daily sessions.
The daily treatment frequency and its outcomes were recorded in a diary by the nursing staff. All MI-E treatments were administered by a trained respiratory therapist, ICU physician or nurse.</description>
