      Post transplant vasculopathy is a major negative outcome in heart transplantation. Current
      methods of detection are highly invasive and pose a risk to transplant recipients.
      Noninvasive markers of endothelial function can be used to detect transplant vasculopathy.
      Endothelial biomarkers such as: endothelial nitric oxide synthase, vascular cellular adhesion
      molecules, intracellular adhesion molecules, endothelin-1, thromboplastin, circulating
      endothelial cells, uric acid, and C-reactive play a role in the pathophysiologic mechanism of
      vasculopathy. Therefore, the investigators would like to assess the association between
      various endothelial biomarkers and the presence or absence of transplant vasculopathy.

      Cardiac transplantation has become the established treatment of choice for eligible patients
      with end-stage heart failure.

      Cardiac allograft vasculopathy (CAV) is a major and potentially preventable limitation to
      long-term survival in cardiac transplant recipients. CAV affects up to 50% of recipients by
      year 5, though intimal thickening is present in up to 58% one year after transplantation. CAV
      is characterized by diffuse, concentric intimal hyperplasia, involving both epicardial and
      intramyocardial coronary arteries. In its most advanced stages, CAV is not amenable to
      standard revascularization procedures making the only cure re-transplantation. Given the
      limited donor pool and poor outcome, re-transplantation is not an option for all patients.
      CAV tends to be a silent process. Due to denervation of the transplanted heart, transplant
      recipients do not typically have chest pain, and thus the first symptoms of CAV may be those
      of heart failure or sudden cardiac death. Traditional risk factors are important in
      predicting the development of CAV, however non-traditional risk factors appear equally
      important and include cellular and humoral rejection, graft ischemia at the time of
      implantation, and cytomegalovirus (CMV). Despite the specific inciting event, the end result
      is endothelial dysfunction, which is the predecessor to CAV. Methods to detect, prevent, and
      treat endothelial dysfunction and subsequently CAV are few. The rapidity with which it
      develops, however, affords a great opportunity to study mechanisms and potential
      interventions in a relatively short period of time.

      Chronic inflammation and immune activation and subsequent endothelial injury are felt to
      immunopathogenic in the development of CAV. Endothelial activation is a precursor to the
      development of transplant vasculopathy, and multiple biomarkers have been shown to correlate
      with the presence of endothelial dysfunction in transplant vasculopathy. (fig. 1) Endothelial
      activation, as determined by the presence of adhesion molecules, begins hours after brain
      death in a donor. VCAM-1, e-selectin, and p-selectin are expressed early after brain death in
      the donor and are elevated throughout transplantation in the recipient as a response to
      injury in the donor heart. P-selectin and VCAM remain elevated while e-selectin gradually
      decrease over three months. There is data suggesting that p-selectin and VCAM remain elevated
      up to 2 years after transplantation, suggesting persistent inflammation and immune activation
      after transplant. Furthermore, nitric oxide is the principal mediator of protective effects
      on the endothelium. The nitric oxide pathway is essential in maintaining vascular integrity
      in cardiac recipients, and inhibition of this pathway accelerates intimal thickening and
      worsens endothelial function caused by rejection. Intimal thickening is a marker of
      endothelial dysfunction and a precursor to the development of CAV.

      Thus, these markers and others involved in atherogenesis, remodeling, immune activation and
      endothelial activation, may provide a useful modality in predicting the presence of
      vasculopathy. In addition, studying various components of the process, eg. inflammation and
      injury, will provide much needed information regarding targets for therapy.

      Noninvasive assessments of peripheral artery function have demonstrated correlation with
      coronary artery function and are useful modalities to assess risk for coronary artery
      disease. Pulse wave amplitude and hyperemic response, using digital tonometry, are measures
      of peripheral endothelial function and have been shown to correlate with coronary
      microvascular function. Abnormalities in the coronary microcirculation and macrocirculation
      precede the development of vasculopathy in heart transplant recipients. Other measures of
      peripheral endothelial function include arterial elasticity (measured using CV Profiler, HDI,
      inc.) and flow-mediated dilatation of the brachial artery (FMD). These studies are sensitive
      noninvasive predictors of coronary artery disease, though have not been tested widely in the
      transplanted population. The investigators will use these studies to characterize peripheral
      artery function in heart transplant recipients and to determine whether they will be useful
      adjuncts in evaluating patients at risk for transplant vasculopathy. The ability to predict
      the development of vasculopathy before it is present provides an opportunity to intervene by
      escalating or modifying therapy and an opportunity to possibly prevent CAV, a major
      limitation to longevity of transplant recipients.
