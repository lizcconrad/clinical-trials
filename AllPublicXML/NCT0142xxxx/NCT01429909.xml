  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is a non-invasive imaging technique assessing
      neuronal activations during motor or cognitive tasks. The MRI sequences used are currently
      optimized for the study of cortex activations, particularly concerning the echo time
      (TE).Very few studies are interested in optimizing the fMRI for the study of the basal
      ganglia, structure implicated in many neurological diseases such as Parkinson's disease. The
      T2 * is a tissue parameter dependent of iron content, which differs with brain structures and
      probably also with age and in case of neurodegenerative disease. Optimal TE s should
      correspond to the T2 * of studied brain structure The primary purpose is to optimize the fMRI
      by a quantitative measurement of the T2* in the cortex and the basal ganglia using MRI. The
      secondary purpose is to study the effect of age and Parkinson's disease on T2*.

      80 subjects (40 PD patients and 40 paired healthy volunteers (on sex and age)) aged 40-80
      years will be included. PD patients will be recruited in the Department of Neurology of CHU
      of Clermont-Ferrand. Healthy volunteers will be selected in clinical trial database. This
      study will consist of one visit (at J0) during which subjects will undergo a MRI (a single
      acquisition of 40 minutes approximately). PD patients will be further questioned on their
      disease and will benefit from a neurological examination
