  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) often have irregular menstrual periods, too much
      facial and body hair, and weight gain. Women with PCOS also have a hard time becoming
      pregnant. Girls with high levels of the male hormone testosterone often develop PCOS as
      adults. Some girls with high levels of male hormone will develop normal hormone levels as
      they grow up, but most girls continue to have high levels of male hormone as adults. The
      purpose of this study is to understand where the male and female hormones come from in girls
      as they get older. The investigators think the adrenal gland, makes most of the hormones in
      young girls and that the ovary and the adrenal gland make these hormones in older girls. The
      investigators would like to find out whether an overactive adrenal gland makes these hormones
      higher in girls who are overweight, compared to those who are not overweight.

      We propose that the adrenal gland is the predominant source of the early morning rise in
      progesterone and testosterone which is more marked in early puberty. Specifically, we
      hypothesize that dexamethasone administration at 22:00 will be associated with a dampened
      progesterone and testosterone rise the subsequent morning in normal girls. We also propose
      that the adrenal gland is the source of the excess androgen production in young obese girls,
      and that dexamethasone will decrease their early morning testosterone and progesterone
      levels. We will explore the hypothesis that functional adrenal hyperandrogenism, or ACTH
      hyperresponsiveness, is one mechanism underlying this excess adrenal androgen production seen
      in obesity.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Normal and obese (&gt;95th BMI%) females

          -  Weight of 24 kg or more

          -  Early to late puberty (expected age range 7-18)

          -  Screening labs within age-appropriate normal range, with the exception of a mildly low
             hematocrit (see below) and the hormonal abnormalities inherent in obesity which could
             include mildly elevated LH, lipids, testosterone, prolactin, DHEAS, E2, glucose, and
             insulin; and decreased follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and/or sex hormone-binding
             globulin (SHBG)

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Screening labs outside of age-appropriate normal range

          -  Hemoglobin &lt;12 mg/dL and hematocrit&lt;36% (Subjects will be offered the opportunity to
             take iron supplementation for 60 days if their hematocrit is slightly low (33-36%)
             (suggestive of iron deficiency anemia) and will then return for retesting of their
             hemoglobin/hematocrit. If still &lt;36%, they will be excluded.)

          -  Morning Cortisol &lt;5 g/dL
