  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) is a severe and common psychiatric disorder. Although MDD
      primarily involves mood disturbances, patients also usually present alterations in cognitive
      function (attention, memory, executive functioning and psychomotor speed). Even though
      antidepressants are suggested in the literature to potentially improve cognitive dysfunction
      in patients with MDD to some degree, there is a lack of adequate and well-controlled studies
      to investigate this effect. This study will evaluate the efficacy, safety and tolerability of
      a new antidepressant Vortioxetine versus placebo on cognitive dysfunction in adult patients
      with MDD.

    <measure>Change From Baseline to Week 8 in DSST (Number of Correct Symbols) and RAVLT (Acquisition and Delayed Recall) Using the Composite Z-score Defined as the Weighted Sum of the Individual Patient Z-scores</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 8</time_frame>
    <description>DSST assesses psychomotor speed of performance requiring visual perception, spatial decision-making, and motor skills. It consists of 133 digits and requires the patient to substitute each digit with a simple symbol in a 90-s period. Each correct symbol is counted, and the total score ranges from 0 (&lt; normal functioning) to 133 (&gt; normal functioning).
RAVLT assesses verbal learning and memory, including immediate memory, efficiency of learning, retroactive and proactive interference effects, and encoding versus retrieval. It consists of a number of tasks, including immediate recall and delayed recall. The number of words correctly recalled on each task is recorded.
The scores are standardized by subtracting the overall mean change from baseline from the individual change from baseline and dividing by the standard deviation estimate of the change from baseline. The 2 tests, DSST and RAVLT are each assigned a weight of 0.5, the 2 subtests of RAVLT are each assigned a weight of 0.25.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 8</time_frame>
    <description>Trail Making Test (TMT) is a cognitive test designed to assess scanning, visuomotor tracking, executive function, and cognitive flexibility. It consists of two parts, A and B: the patient must draw lines to connect consecutively numbered circles (part A) and then connect consecutively numbered and lettered circles alternating between the two sequences (part B). The time taken to complete the two parts is recorded. Part A assesses cognitive processing speed. The lower the score the faster the processing speed.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline to Week 8 in Congruent STROOP Time to Complete (Executive Function)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 8</time_frame>
    <description>Stroop Colour Naming Test (STROOP) is a cognitive test designed to assess the ability to inhibit a prepotent response to reading words while performing a task that requires attention control. It comprises two sheets with 50 words on each, and each word is the name of a colour. On the first sheet, the Congruent STROOP Sheet, the word and ink colour match; on the Incongruent STROOP Sheet, the word and ink colour do not match. For each sheet, the patient has 4 minutes to name the ink colour of each word. When the patient finishes the sheet, or once 4 minutes is up, the clinician notes the time taken and counts the number of correct and incorrect responses. The scale ranges from 0-100, the higher score the greater the cognitive flexibility.</description>

    <description>Simple Reaction Time (SRT) is designed to assess psychomotor speed, and Choice Reaction Time (CRT) is designed to assess visual attention. Two computerised tests, part of the CogState battery were used to measure SRT and CRT in milliseconds:
The &quot;detection task&quot; measures SRT: the patient presses a &quot;yes&quot; button, whenever an onscreen playing card is turned over.
The &quot;identification task&quot; measures CRT: the patient presses a &quot;yes&quot; button whenever an onscreen playing card is turned over and is red, or a &quot;no&quot; button if the card is not red.</description>

    <description>The Montgomery Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) is a depression rating scale consisting of 10 items, each rated 0 (no symptom) to 6 (severe symptom). The 10 items represent the core symptoms of depressive illness. The rating should be based on a clinical interview with the patient, moving from broadly phrased questions about symptoms to more detailed ones, which allow a precise rating of severity, covering the last 7 days. Total score from 0 to 60. The higher the score, the more severe.</description>

    <description>Effect on cognitive dysfunction after correcting for the effect on depressive symptoms.
The estimation of the effect on cognitive dysfunction after correcting for the effect on depressive symptoms was based on the composite z-score and the MADRS total score. The effect was estimated in an ANCOVA model using the composite z-score at week 1 as dependent variable and the change from baseline to week 1 in the MADRS total score, the baseline MADRS total score, the baseline composite z-score, the treatment group and site as independent variables.
In the week 1 analysis the vortioxetine 10 and 20 mg groups were pooled because patients randomized to vortioxetine 20 mg received vortioxetine 10 mg in the first week of the study.</description>

    <measure>Risk of Suicidality Using C-SSRS Scores</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS) was developed by researchers at Columbia University as a tool to systematically assess suicidal ideation and behaviour in patients during participation in a clinical study. The C-SSRS is composed of questions that address suicidal behaviour and questions that address suicidal ideation, with subquestions that assess severity. The tool was administered via an interview with the patient.
For 2 patients in each treament group (6 in total) the CSSRS assessments are missing during study.</description>

          <description>Digit Symbol Substitution Test (DSST) is a cognitive test designed to assess psychomotor speed of performance requiring visual perception, spatial decision-making, and motor skills. It consists of 133 digits and requires the patient to substitute each digit with a simple symbol in a 90-second period. Each correct symbol is counted, and the total score ranges from 0 (less than normal functioning) to 133 (greater than normal functioning).</description>

          <description>Stroop Colour Naming Test (STROOP) is a cognitive test designed to assess the ability to inhibit a prepotent response to reading words while performing a task that requires attention control. It comprises two sheets with 50 words on each, and each word is the name of a colour. On the Congruent STROOP Sheet, the word and ink colour match; on the Incongruent STROOP Sheet, the word and ink colour do not match. The patient has 4 minutes to name the ink colour of each word. The clinician notes the time taken and counts the number of correct and incorrect responses.</description>

          <title>MADRS: Baseline Total Score</title>
          <description>The Montgomery Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) is a depression rating scale consisting of 10 items, each rated 0 (no symptom) to 6 (severe symptom). The 10 items represent the core symptoms of depressive illness. The rating should be based on a clinical interview with the patient, moving from broadly phrased questions about symptoms to more detailed ones, which allow a precise rating of severity, covering the last 7 days. Total score from 0 to 60. The higher the score, the more severe.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline to Week 8 in DSST (Number of Correct Symbols) and RAVLT (Acquisition and Delayed Recall) Using the Composite Z-score Defined as the Weighted Sum of the Individual Patient Z-scores</title>
        <description>DSST assesses psychomotor speed of performance requiring visual perception, spatial decision-making, and motor skills. It consists of 133 digits and requires the patient to substitute each digit with a simple symbol in a 90-s period. Each correct symbol is counted, and the total score ranges from 0 (&lt; normal functioning) to 133 (&gt; normal functioning).
RAVLT assesses verbal learning and memory, including immediate memory, efficiency of learning, retroactive and proactive interference effects, and encoding versus retrieval. It consists of a number of tasks, including immediate recall and delayed recall. The number of words correctly recalled on each task is recorded.
The scores are standardized by subtracting the overall mean change from baseline from the individual change from baseline and dividing by the standard deviation estimate of the change from baseline. The 2 tests, DSST and RAVLT are each assigned a weight of 0.5, the 2 subtests of RAVLT are each assigned a weight of 0.25.</description>

        <description>Trail Making Test (TMT) is a cognitive test designed to assess scanning, visuomotor tracking, executive function, and cognitive flexibility. It consists of two parts, A and B: the patient must draw lines to connect consecutively numbered circles (part A) and then connect consecutively numbered and lettered circles alternating between the two sequences (part B). The time taken to complete the two parts is recorded. Part A assesses cognitive processing speed. The lower the score the faster the processing speed.</description>

        <description>Stroop Colour Naming Test (STROOP) is a cognitive test designed to assess the ability to inhibit a prepotent response to reading words while performing a task that requires attention control. It comprises two sheets with 50 words on each, and each word is the name of a colour. On the first sheet, the Congruent STROOP Sheet, the word and ink colour match; on the Incongruent STROOP Sheet, the word and ink colour do not match. For each sheet, the patient has 4 minutes to name the ink colour of each word. When the patient finishes the sheet, or once 4 minutes is up, the clinician notes the time taken and counts the number of correct and incorrect responses. The scale ranges from 0-100, the higher score the greater the cognitive flexibility.</description>

        <description>The Montgomery Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) is a depression rating scale consisting of 10 items, each rated 0 (no symptom) to 6 (severe symptom). The 10 items represent the core symptoms of depressive illness. The rating should be based on a clinical interview with the patient, moving from broadly phrased questions about symptoms to more detailed ones, which allow a precise rating of severity, covering the last 7 days. Total score from 0 to 60. The higher the score, the more severe.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline to Week 1 Using the MADRS Total Score and the Composite Z-score</title>
        <description>Effect on cognitive dysfunction after correcting for the effect on depressive symptoms.
The estimation of the effect on cognitive dysfunction after correcting for the effect on depressive symptoms was based on the composite z-score and the MADRS total score. The effect was estimated in an ANCOVA model using the composite z-score at week 1 as dependent variable and the change from baseline to week 1 in the MADRS total score, the baseline MADRS total score, the baseline composite z-score, the treatment group and site as independent variables.
In the week 1 analysis the vortioxetine 10 and 20 mg groups were pooled because patients randomized to vortioxetine 20 mg received vortioxetine 10 mg in the first week of the study.</description>

        <title>Risk of Suicidality Using C-SSRS Scores</title>
        <description>The Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS) was developed by researchers at Columbia University as a tool to systematically assess suicidal ideation and behaviour in patients during participation in a clinical study. The C-SSRS is composed of questions that address suicidal behaviour and questions that address suicidal ideation, with subquestions that assess severity. The tool was administered via an interview with the patient.
For 2 patients in each treament group (6 in total) the CSSRS assessments are missing during study.</description>
