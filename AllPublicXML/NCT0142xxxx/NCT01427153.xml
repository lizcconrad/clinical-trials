      The purpose of this study is to compare an orthopaedic manual physical therapy (OMPT) to
      corticosteroid injection for the management of knee osteoarthritis.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare a commonly offered clinical approach of a series of
      intra-articular steroid injections to an orthopaedic manual physical therapy (OMPT) approach
      consisting of manually applied passive movement and reinforcing exercise for the treatment of
      osteoarthritis of the knee (knee OA). A second purpose is to validate a clinical prediction
      rule (CPR) for patients unlikely to respond to the orthopaedic manual physical therapy
      approach in a pre-planned secondary analysis of data from the randomized clinical trial.

      Aim 1: To see if there is a significant difference in pain and function lasting out to 1 year
      for patients that receive a clinical approach consisting of a series of intra-articular
      steroid injections compared to those that receive a clinical approach consisting of
      orthopaedic manual physical therapy.

      Aim 2: To validate a clinical prediction rule of characteristics identified in a previous
      preliminary study that predicted which patients with knee OA would be unlikely to respond to
      OMPT.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Western Ontario McMasters Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC)</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
    <description>The WOMAC is a self report questionnaire that asks patient to rate their pain, stiffness, and functional limitation associated with their condition. This instrument will provide important information about the self-reported pain and disability level of the patients in this study. The WOMAC is a recommended primary outcome measure in therapy trials of arthritic conditions, and is considered one of the most appropriate scales for trials evaluating knee osteoarthritis (OA). It is a reliable, valid, and responsive instrument widely used in clinical trials evaluating therapy for hip and knee OA</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Global Rating of Change (GROC)</measure>
    <time_frame>1 Year</time_frame>
    <description>The GROC questionnaire is a common, feasible, and useful method for assessing short term outcomes and overall changes in quality of life, and is a valid measurement of change in patient status in a variety of pain populations. The GROC has a 15-point scale with a change of positive three points or higher demonstrating clinically significant improvement in a patients perception of quality of life.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Alternate Step Test (AST)</measure>
    <time_frame>1 Year</time_frame>
    <description>The Alternate Step Test is an inexpensive and efficient measure of dynamic postural stability and mobility. The AST requires participants to alternate feet and step 8 times (4 times for each foot) onto a 18 cm stool or step as rapidly as possible Recent evidence involving community dwelling adults also suggests that the AST has acceptable test-retest reliability (ICC=0.78) and potential as a fall risk assessment measure.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Timed Up and Go Test (TUG)</measure>
    <time_frame>1 Year</time_frame>
    <description>The Timed Up and Go Test is a functional performance measure which directly evaluates an individual's ability to transfer, ambulate, and maintain balance during transitions. Individuals are timed on how quickly they can stand, walk 3 meters, turn around, and return to the chair and sit down. The TUG has good inter-rater and intra-rater reliability and validity for functional testing in older adults at risk for falls. The test is easy to administer and can be completed in two to three minutes.</description>
