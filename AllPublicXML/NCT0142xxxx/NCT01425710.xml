      Non-invasive measurements of cardiac output (CO), systemic vascular resistance (SVR),
      corrected aortic flow time (FTc) and stroke volume (SV) are useful parameters during
      laparoscopic resection of pheochromocytoma (adrenalectomy) to document the intraoperative
      changes in volume status and to estimate the volume depletion.

    <textblock>
      Pheochromocytomas and extraadrenal paragangliomas are catecholamin-producing tumours deriving
      from the adrenal medulla and sympathetic ganglia. The only causal therapy is surgical
      resection. Nowadays, laparoscopic adrenalectomy is thought to be the optimal approach.
      Chronic volume depletion due to chronic hypertension and preoperative
      Î±-adrenoreceptor-blockade (to avoid the effects of intraoperative catecholamine-excess) often
      lead to hypotension after resection of the tumour. Volume reload with high amounts of fluid
      is often needed. Therefor some authors recommended invasive measurement (pulmonary artery
      catheter) to control cardiac output parameters and fluid balance. However, there are
      non-invasive methods to measure cardiac output(CO), systemic vascular resistance(SVR), stroke
      volume(SV) and corrected aortic flow time(FTc) to estimate volume status. Except
      transesophageal echocardiography, other techniques such as transoesophageal doppler and pulse
      pressure methods exist but have not been investigated during surgical therapy for
      pheochromocytoma so far. The esophageal Doppler currently represents the &quot;gold standard&quot; for
      perioperative fluid replacement therapy.

      The study's hypothesis is that non-invasive measurements of cardiac output (CO), systemic
      vascular resistance (SVR), corrected aortic flow time (FTc) and stroke volume (SV) are useful
      parameters during laparoscopic resection of pheochromocytoma (adrenalectomy) to document the
      intraoperative changes in volume status and to estimate the volume depletion.
