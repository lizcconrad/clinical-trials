    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Healthy, ambulatory, male and female volunteers between 16 to 45 years of age

          -  Scheduled to undergo surgical removal of either two partial bony impactions or one
             full bony alone or in combination with a partial bony impaction, soft tissue impaction
             or erupted third molar. Maxillary third molars may be removed regardless of impaction
             level

          -  Use of only short-acting local anesthetic (e.g., mepivacaine or lidocaine)
             preoperatively, with or without vasoconstrictor and nitrous oxide

          -  No use of any analgesics, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAIDs), aspirin, any
             other pain reliever over the counter (OTC ) or prescription, or herbal supplements
             within 5 days of surgery. Oral contraceptives, prophylactic antibiotics,
             pre-anesthetic medication, anesthesia during the procedure, or other routine
             medications to treat benign conditions that would not confound the evaluation of the
             investigational would be acceptable

          -  Female subjects of childbearing potential must be using a medically acceptable form of
             birth control for at least 1 month prior to screening (3 months on oral
             contraceptives), e.g., oral or patch contraceptives, intrauterine device, NuvaRing,
             Depo-Provera, or double-barrier and have a negative pregnancy test at Screening and
             prior to surgery. Female subjects of nonchildbearing potential must be amenorrheic for
             at least 2 years or had a hysterectomy and/or bilateral oophorectomy

          -  Provide a personally signed and dated informed consent indicating that the subject has
             been informed of all pertinent aspects of the trial, (subjects &lt; 18 years of age must
             sign a written assent and have parental or guardian consent)

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  History of hypersensitivity to aspirin, salicylates, other nonsteroidal
             anti-inflammatory drug (NSAIDs), acetaminophen, opioid analgesics, and similar
             pharmacological agents or components of the investigational products, including the
             placebo

          -  Evidence or history of clinically significant hematological, renal, endocrine,
             pulmonary, gastrointestinal, cardiovascular, hepatic, psychiatric, neurologic
             diseases, or malignancies

          -  Relevant concomitant disease such as asthma (exercise induced asthma is permitted),
             chronic sinusitis or nasal structural abnormalities causing greater than 50 percent
             obstruction (polyposis nasi, marked septal deviation) that can interfere with the
             conduct of the study in the judgment of the Investigator

          -  Current or past history of bleeding disorder(s)

          -  History of gastrointestinal bleeding or perforation, related to previous nonsteroidal
             anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) therapy. Active, or history of recurrent peptic
             ulcer/hemorrhage (two or more distinct episodes of proven ulceration or bleeding)

          -  Acute illness or local infection prior to surgery that can interfere with the conduct
             of the study in the judgment of the Investigator

          -  Females who are pregnant or lactating

          -  Positive alcohol breathalyzer test and/or positive urine drug or cotinine test prior
             to surgery
