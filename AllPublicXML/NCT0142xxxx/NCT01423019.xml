  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether subjects taking a supplement designed to
      increase metabolic rate will have a positive effect on body composition (fat mass, muscle
      mass, and bone density.)
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In a previous randomized double-blinded placebo-controlled pilot study, subjects taking the
      nutritional supplements contained in these two weight loss plans had a short-term
      statistically significant increase in their resting metabolic rates as compared to taking a
      placebo. No increases were found in blood pressure, resting heart rate, or self-reported
      discomfort when taking the supplement.

      The current study was designed to extend the findings of the pilot study over a 60-day study
      period using a randomized double-blinded placebo-controlled protocol with the same weight
      loss interventions.

    <measure>Change from Baseline in Systolic and Diastolic Blood Pressure at 30 days</measure>
    <time_frame>0 and 30 days</time_frame>
    <description>Measures the amount of force (pressure) that blood exerts on the walls of the blood vessels as it passes through them. Systolic blood pressure is a measure of blood pressure while the heart is beating. Diastolic pressure is a measure of blood pressure while the heart is relaxed, between heartbeats. Measurements will be taken after sitting or lying down for at least 5 minutes. Changes will be reported between baseline and day 30 of study.</description>
