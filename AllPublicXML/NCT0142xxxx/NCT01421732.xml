    <textblock>
      A study of dengue in children presenting to outpatient departments of 5 large hospitals in Ho
      Chi Minh City and Tien Giang province, Viet Nam.

      Different blood tests are compared at the early stages of dengue fever onset in their ability
      to accurately and specifically detect children whose dengue will progress to severe disease.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In a prospective study in the outpatients department of three large hospitals in Ho Chi Minh
      City, Viet Nam, we will determine the early diagnostic sensitivity, specificity, positive and
      negative predictive values of two NS1 diagnostic tests in severe dengue cases.

      The study is intended to develop a prognostic algorithm for the early identification of
      severe dengue cases.

      Routine demographic, haematological and biochemical laboratory markers will be utilized to
      derive a prognostic algorithm that is clinically-useful for guiding patient triage and
      interventions.

      We hope to discover and evaluate new early biomarkers of severe dengue and will evaluate
      candidate host response molecules and virological markers for their prognostic value.

      We further plan to understand the phylogeography of DENV in the super-urban setting of HCMC.

      We will use genome scale sequencing of DENV together with geospatial information on the
      residential addresses of patients to better understand transmission dynamics in space and
      time in a high transmission super-urban district of HCMC and thereby identify opportunities
      for public health interventions.
