  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A series of studies are proposed to develop an intervention to increase sleep duration and
      study the effects on eating, exercise, and weight control. The hypothesis is that increasing
      sleep duration will help improve weight loss and maintenance.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Study 1 is conducted in a sleep laboratory. Participants sleep short duration (approximately
      four hours per night) on one weekend and long duration (approximately nine hours per night)
      on another weekend.

      Study 2 is examining ways to increase sleep duration in overweight individuals with short
      sleep and examining the effects on short term weight loss.

      Study 3 is comparing a standard weight loss program with a novel Sleep+Weight Loss
      intervention.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Sleep Duration</measure>
    <time_frame>4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Participants with verified short sleep are taught to increase their sleep either gradually or immediately. These two groups are compared to a control group who makes no changes in their sleep. The primary outcome is sleep duration per night as determined by actigraphy.</description>

    <description>24-hour recalls are used to estimate dietary intake at baseline and after 4 weeks of sleep intervention.</description>

    <measure>Physical Activity</measure>
    <time_frame>4 weeks</time_frame>

    <description>Subjects in this condition are taught to increase their sleep by 30 minutes per night during week 1 of the intervention; 60 minutes during week 2; and 90 minutes during week 3.
