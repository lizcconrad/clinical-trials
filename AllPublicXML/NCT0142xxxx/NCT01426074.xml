      This study will determine the following: the response rate (including pathological CR rate),
      TTP, and complications of treatment in patients with rectal cancer treated with FOLFOX
      bevacizumab, the alteration of tumor blood flow (assessed by DCE-MRI as percentage change in
      Ktrans) after 1 cycle of bevacizumab therapy compared to baseline value in patients treated
      with FOLFOX alone and those treated with bevacizumab at 5 mg/kg., the degree of hypoxis
      (measured by tumor uptake of the 2-nitroimidazole EF5) induced by bevacizumab treatment and
      its relationship to changes in tumor blood flow, and the degree of apoptosis (measured by
      tumor uptake of di-annexin V) induced by bevacizumab treatment and its relationship to
      changes in tumor blood flow.

      The primary objectives of this study will determine the following: the response rate
      (including pathological CR rate), TTP, and complications of treatment in patients with rectal
      cancer treated with FOLFOX bevacizumab, the alteration of tumor blood flow (assessed by
      DCE-MRI as percentage change in Ktrans) after 1 cycle of bevacizumab therapy compared to
      baseline value in patients treated with FOLFOX alone and those treated with bevacizumab at 5
      mg/kg., the degree of hypoxis (measured by tumor uptake of the 2-nitroimidazole EF5) induced
      by bevacizumab treatment and its relationship to changes in tumor blood flow, and the degree
      of apoptosis (measured by tumor uptake of di-annexin V) induced by bevacizumab treatment and
      its relationship to changes in tumor blood flow. The secondary objectives of this study is to
      determine in an exploratory fashion the relationship between tumor blood flow, hypoxia
      induction, and apoptosis induction , and time to progression in patients continuing on to
      receive Bevacizumab 5 mg/kg, to analyze archival tumor from the patients treated in this
      trial for mutations in the MKK7 and SEK1 genes, and by semi-quantitative IHC for these and
      other relevant proteins, to determine the relationship between vascular proliferation as
      measured by DCE-MRI and markers of endothelial cell proliferation, and to obtain pilot data
      on whether assays that measure vascular endothelial cell mitogenic stimulation and mitogenic
      activity may predict response to therapy, time to progression and overall survival in
      patients receiving bevacizumab 5 mg/kg.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients must have histologically documented advanced or metastatic adenocarcinoma of
             the rectum, T3 or T4, N any, M0 or M1. Patients must have available and identified
             tissue for immunohistochemical analysis and agree to submit it for the correlative
             endpoints. When available, formalin-fixed,paraffin-embedded tissue from previous
             biopsy or surgical resection will suffice.

          -  Patients must measurable disease as defined by the RECIST criteria as at least one
             lesion that can be accurately measured in at least one dimension (longest diameter to
             be recorded) as ≥ 20mm with conventional techniques on either CT, MRI, or EUS. marker
             (CEA) elevation alone is in sufficient for entry.

          -  Patients may have had prior adjuvant treatment of rectal cancer. The prior treatment
             regimen must not have included bevacizumab but may have included oxaliplatin and the
             last dose of chemotherapy must have been &gt; 6 months prior to study entry. Patients
             with prior radiotherapy are acceptable. It must be at least 2 weeks since
             administration of radiation therapy and all signs of toxicity must have abated.

          -  Patients with prior malignancies other than colorectal cancer are allowed, provided
             they have been treated with curative, intent, and have no evidence of recurrence of
             that malignancy.

          -  Patients must be age 18 years or older.
