    <textblock>
      This study is intended to assess the feasibility of adjusting a radiation plan during its
      course to accommodate for a shrinking tumor target. The investigators hypothesize that an
      adaptive radiotherapy (RT) planning strategy for small cell lung cancer (SCLC) patients with
      chest-confined disease will allow for safe delivery of higher doses of chest RT than a
      non-adaptive RT planning approach without subjecting normal critical structures to
      unacceptable doses of radiotherapy.
