  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      An actual use trial to demonstrate that consumers will not exceed the labeled daily dose of
      Aleve 24 Hour at an unacceptable rate. Two aspects of consumer use will be evaluated: 1) the
      frequency at which consumers exceed the label-defined daily dose, thus putting themselves at
      clinical risk, and 2) the reasons for exceeding the labeled daily dose.

    <time_frame>28 days</time_frame>
    <description>The primary objective of this trial was to determine the percentage of non-therapeutic misuse. Two aspects of consumer use of Aleve 24 Hour were examined: the frequency at which consumers exceeded the label-defined daily dose modified by those who did so for non-therapeutic reasons.</description>

    <measure>Non-therapeutic Reasons for Misuse</measure>
    <time_frame>28 days</time_frame>
    <description>Those subjects in the Reasons for Misuse Cohort who did not state misuse due to need for additional pain relief were categorized to Non-therapeutic misuse.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Estimated Percentage of Misuse for Non-Therapeutic Reasons Using the First 10-Day Treatment Course</measure>
    <time_frame>28 days</time_frame>
    <description>This endpoint was an assessment of whether the rate of non-therapeutic misuse exceeded the pre-defined acceptable threshold for non-therapeutic misuse. The difference lay in the estimation of misuse in the Patterns of Use Cohort by using 10-day treatment courses rather than by &quot;use day&quot;. A treatment course for each subject began on the first day they recorded taking one or more tablets which was followed by nine consecutive &quot;evaluable days.&quot;</description>

The difference lay in the estimation of misuse in the Patterns of Use Cohort by using 10-day treatment courses rather than by “use day”. A treatment course for each subject began on the first day they recorded taking one or more tablets which was followed by nine consecutive “evaluable days.”</description>
