        Inclusion Criteria:

        General Inclusion Criteria

          -  Subject must be at least 18 years of age and less than 85 years of age.

          -  Subject must agree not to participate in any other clinical investigation for a period
             of three years following the index procedure. This includes clinical trials of
             medication and invasive procedures. Questionnaire-based studies, or other studies that
             are non-invasive and do not require medication are allowed.

          -  Subject is able to verbally confirm understanding of risks, benefits and treatment
             alternatives of receiving the ABSORB BVS system and he/she or his/her legally
             authorized representative provides written informed consent prior to any Clinical
             Investigation related procedure, as approved by the appropriate Ethics Committee.

          -  Subject must have evidence of myocardial ischemia (e.g., stable or unstable angina,
             silent ischemia).

          -  Subject must be an acceptable candidate for coronary artery bypass graft (CABG)
             surgery

          -  Subject must agree to undergo all clinical investigation plan-required follow-up
             visits, exercise testing, blood draw as well as adherence to European Society of
             Cardiology Guidelines and completion of quality of life questionnaires and of a
             subject diary to collect information including but not limited to tobacco usage, food
             intake, daily exercise and body weight

        Angiographic Inclusion Criteria

          -  One or two de novo native lesions each located in a different epicardial vessel.

          -  If two treatable lesions meet the eligibility criteria, they must be in separate major
             epicardial vessels (left anterior descending (LAD) with septal and diagonal branches,
             left circumflex artery (LCX) with obtuse marginal and/or ramus intermedius branches
             and right coronary artery (RCA) and any of its branches).

          -  Lesion(s) must have a visually estimated diameter stenosis of ≥50% and &lt;100% with a
             TIMI flow of ≥1.

          -  Lesion(s) must be located in a native coronary artery with Dmax by on-line QCA of
             ≥2.25 mm and ≤3.8 mm.

          -  Lesion(s) must be located in a native coronary artery with lesion(s) length by on-line
             QCA of ≤48 mm.

          -  Percutaneous interventions for lesions in a non-target vessel are allowed if done ≥30
             days prior to or if planned to be done 2 years after the index procedure.

          -  Percutaneous intervention for lesions in the target vessel are allowed if done &gt;6
             months prior to or if planned to be done 2 years after the index procedure.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Known hypersensitivity or contraindication to aspirin, both heparin and bivalirudin,
             antiplatelet medication specified for use in the study (clopidogrel and prasugrel and
             ticlopidine, inclusive), everolimus, poly (L-lactide), poly (DL-lactide), cobalt,
             chromium, nickel, tungsten, acrylic and fluoro polymers or contrast sensitivity that
             cannot be adequately pre-medicated.

          -  Subject has a known diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) at any time
             preceding the index procedure and relevant cardiac enzymes (according to local

             autoimmune disease (e.g. human immunodeficiency virus, systemic lupus erythematosus,
             rheumatoid arthritis, severe asthma requiring immunosuppressive medication, etc.).

          -  Subject is receiving chronic anticoagulation therapy that can not be stopped and
             restarted according to local hospital standard procedures.

          -  Elective surgery is planned within 2 years after the procedure that will require
             discontinuing either aspirin, clopidogrel, prasugrel or ticlopidine.

          -  Subject has a platelet count &lt;100,000 cells/mm3 or &gt;700,000 cells/mm3, a white blood
             cell count of &lt;3,000 cells/mm3, or documented or suspected liver disease (including
             laboratory evidence of hepatitis)

          -  Known renal insufficiency (e.g., estimated glomerular filtration rate &lt;60 ml/kg/1.73m²
             or serum creatinine level of &gt;2.5 mg/dL, or subject on dialysis).

          -  History of bleeding diathesis or coagulopathy or will refuse blood transfusions.

          -  Subject has had a cerebrovascular accident (CVA) or transient ischemic neurological

          -  Pregnant or nursing subjects and those who plan pregnancy in the period up to 3 years
             following index procedure. (Female subjects of child-bearing potential must have a
             negative pregnancy test done within 28 days prior to the index procedure and
             contraception must be used during participation in this trial)

          -  Other medical illness (e.g., cancer or congestive heart failure) or known history of
             substance abuse (alcohol, cocaine, heroin etc.) as per physician judgment that may
             cause non-compliance with the protocol or confound the data interpretation or is
             associated with a limited life expectancy.

          -  Subject is already participating in another clinical investigation that has not yet
             reached its primary endpoint.

          -  Subject is belonging to a vulnerable population (per investigator's judgment, e.g.,
             subordinate hospital staff or sponsor staff) or subject unable to read or write.

        Angiographic Exclusion Criteria

          -  Target lesion which prevents adequate (residual stenosis at target lesion(s) is ≤ 40%
             by visual assessment) coronary pre-dilatation.

          -  Target lesion in left main trunk.

          -  Aorto-ostial target lesion (within 3 mm of the aorta junction).

          -  Target lesion located within 2 mm of the origin of the LAD or LCX.

          -  Target lesion located distal to a diseased (vessel irregularity per angiogram and &gt;20%
             stenosed lesion) arterial or saphenous vein graft.

          -  Target lesion involving a bifurcation lesion with side branch ≥2 mm in diameter, or
             with a side branch &lt;2mm in diameter requiring guide wire protection or dilatation.

          -  Total occlusion (TIMI flow 0), prior to wire crossing

          -  Excessive tortuosity (≥ two 45° angles), or extreme angulation (≥90 °) proximal to or
             within the target lesion.

          -  Restenotic from previous intervention

          -  Heavy calcification proximal to or within the target lesion.

          -  Target lesion involves myocardial bridge.

          -  Target vessel contains thrombus as indicated in the angiographic images.

          -  Additionally clinically significant lesion(s) (≥ 40% diameter stenosis by visual
             assessment) for which percutaneous coronary intervention may be required &lt;2 years
             after the index procedure.

          -  Subject has received brachytherapy in any epicardial vessel (including side branches)

          -  Subject has a high probability that a procedure other than pre-dilatation and study
             device implantation and (if necessary) post-dilatation will be required at the time of
             index procedure for treatment of the target vessel (e.g. atherectomy, cutting balloon)
