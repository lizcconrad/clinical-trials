  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to examine the effect of lactobacillus preparation on Bacterial
      vaginosis (BV) in low-risk pregnant women and to evaluate the value of double courses for the
      patients with durative positive result. It is assumed that the living preparation of
      lactobacillus was beneficial for treatment of BV during pregnancy. The two-courses treatment
      can increase the response rate and improve pregnancy outcomes in the durative BV positive
      patients comparing with one-course one.

      Research method: This was a single-blind randomized controlled trial.

      Diagnostic standard: The study population is the women who have positive outcome of screened
      test for BV by sialidase method.

      Allocation and follow up: Patients who were screened for BV by sialidase method and randomly
      allocated into control group、one-course group and two-course group. The patients in control
      group who were BV positive would receive lotion washout and be repeatedly evaluated BV status
      per two weeks and be followed up to the 4th～7th days of postpartum. The patients in
      one-course group and in two-course group who were BV positive would receive the first course
      treatment of vaginal lactobacillus capsule and be repeatedly evaluated BV status after
      treatment. The patients in two-course group will receive the second course treatment of
      Lactobacilli preparation if their BV test result were still positive after one-course
      treatment, but those in one-course group would NOT receive any treatment even though they
      would have the durative BV positive result after one-course of Lactobacilli. The patients in
      the two interventional groups would be repeatedly evaluated BV status at 28th gestational
      weeks and be followed up to the 4th-7th days of postpartum. All the inspection results of
      vaginal secretions and pregnancy outcome were recorded.

      Outcome measures:

        -  The prevalence of BV,the response rates of lactobacillus preparation,the recurrence
           rate.

        -  The adverse pregnancy outcomes of mother.

        -  The adverse pregnancy outcomes of perinatal fetus.
