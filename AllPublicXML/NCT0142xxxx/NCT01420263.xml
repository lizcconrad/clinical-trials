  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether re-feeding of gastric residuals reduces the
      time needed to establish full enteral feedings in premature infants. Infants with gestational
      ages 23-28 weeks at birth will be randomized within one week to receive either gastric
      residuals or fresh formula or breastmilk whenever significant residuals during feeding
      advancement require clinical assessment for continuing feedings. Primary outcome measure is
      time to establish full enteral feedings (120cc/kg/day).
