      The objective of this study is to obtain female first-catch urine, vaginal swab, endocervical
      swab, and cervical specimens collected in PreservCyt Solution (&quot;PreservCyt Specimens&quot;) for
      testing with the APTIMA Trichomonas vaginalis (ATV) Assay.

      These specimens will be used to demonstrate assay performance on the PANTHER System is
      comparable to performance on the TIGRIS System.
