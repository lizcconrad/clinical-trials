      The role of continuous non-invasive arterial pressure (CNAP) in high risk patients with
      pronounced variation of arterial pressure will be assessed under analgosedation.

      Therefore, patients will be analyzed during normo-, hypo- and hypertension with standard IAP
      undergoing elective transfemoral aortic valve implantation procedures. Systolic, diastolic,
      and mean invasive arterial pressures (IAP) will be compared to those obtained by CNAP. Data
      will be analysed in different periods of arterial pressure for agreement of the two methods
      and for determination of precision (i.e. measurement error) and accuracy (i.e. systematic
      error). Additionally, we will compare both methods regarding the amplitude and time of very
      fast changes in arterial pressure during intervals of functional cardiac arrests (rapid
      pacing).

        Patients admitted for elective transfemoral implantation of the aortic valve in
        analgosedation will be included. The patients' primary diagnosis was severe aortic
        stenosis, that was defined as a valve area of &lt;1cm² or a mean pressure gradient &gt;50mmHg.

        Exclusion criteria for the study will be an advanced dysfunction of peripheral perfusion
        (i.e. pronounced arterial peripheral artery occlusive disease or Raynaud's syndrome),
        arterio-venous shunts for haemodialysis, and vascular surgery of the upper extremities.

        Before including patients in the present study, blood pressure will be measured on both
        arms noninvasively by oscillometry to exclude any significant arterial stenosis between the
        upper extremities. Differences of less than 10 mmHg will be accepted.

        All patients won't receive any sedative drugs preoperatively and were allowed to drink
        fluids up to 2 hours before surgery.
