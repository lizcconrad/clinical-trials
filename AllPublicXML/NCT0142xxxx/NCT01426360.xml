  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of the present study was to compare the effects of a commercially available
      dentifrice containing 2% strontium chloride and 5% potassium nitrate in a silica base, versus
      a control dentifrice, containing exactly the same ingredients apart from strontium chloride
      and potassium nitrate, on the instant and lasting relief of DH.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Dentin hypersensitivity (DH) is a very common complaint that occurs in the general
      population. The intensity of the pain can be minor to very serious, which may prevent one
      from eating or performing ordinary oral hygiene practices. The most accepted mechanism by
      which DH occurs is hydrodynamic theory, which suggests that pain-producing stimuli cause
      rapid movement of fluid within the dentin tubules, as a result the free nerve endings, at the
      inner ends of the tubules or the periphery of the pulp, are excited and DH occurs. According
      to this theory, one approach to treat DH is reducing dentin tubule fluid movement through
      occluding open tubules. Strontium chloride was the first tubule-blocking ingredient used in
      dentifrice about fifty years ago and since that time a paucity of clinical studies have been
      carried out to test its effectiveness on DH. The other approach is to reduce the pulp nerve
      excitability by depolarizing the nerve endings, in which the most widely used material is
      potassium salts. Although there is limited clinical evidence that dentifrices containing
      strontium chloride or potassium nitrate alone, as the major desensitizing agent, has an
      effect on reducing DH, no clinical studies have shown the effectiveness of a dentifrice
      containing both strontium chloride and potassium nitrate in a silica base on alleviating DH.

    <measure>Tactile Hypersensitivity Scores Immediately After Topical Dentifrice Use</measure>
    <time_frame>immediately after dentifrice use</time_frame>
    <description>Immediately after dentifice use, tactile hypersensitivity assessments were done using an Electronic Force Sensing Probe (Yeaple Probe Model 200A, Xinix Research Inc., USA). Scores were recorded in terms of a quantified force applied by a #19 explorer tip. After presetting the probe to 10 grams, the tip of the probe was run across the exposed dentin perpendicular to the examined surface. Subsequent passes were made, each time the applied force was increased by 10 grams, until the subject indicated that he/she was experiencing discomfort, or until the maximum force of 50 grams had been reached.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Air Blast Hypersensitivity Scores Immediately After Topical Dentifrice Use</measure>
    <time_frame>immediately after dentifrice use</time_frame>
    <description>The tooth was isolated. Air was delivered from a standard dental unit air syringe and directed at the exposed buccal surface of the hypersensitive tooth for 1 second. The Schiff Cold Air Sensitivity Scale was used to assess the subjects' response.
0 - Subject does not respond to air stimulus;
- Subject responds to air stimulus, but does not request discontinuation of stimulus;
- Subject responds to air stimulus and requests discontinuation or moves from stimulus;
- Subject responds to air stimulus, considers stimulus to be painful, and requests discontinuation of the stimulus.</description>

    <description>After 3 days, tactile hypersensitivity assessments were done using an Electronic Force Sensing Probe (Yeaple Probe Model 200A, Xinix Research Inc., USA). Scores were recorded in terms of a quantified, reproducible force applied by a #19 explorer tip. After presetting the probe to 10 grams, the tip of the probe was run across the exposed dentin perpendicular to the examined surface. Subsequent passes were made, each time the applied force was increased by 10 grams, until the subject indicated that he/she was experiencing discomfort, or until the maximum force of 50 grams had been reached.</description>

          <title>Baseline tactile hypersensitivity score</title>
          <description>Tactile hypersensitivity assessments were done using an Electronic Force Sensing Probe (Yeaple Probe Model 200A, Xinix Research Inc., USA). Scores were recorded in terms of a quantified, reproducible force applied by a #19 explorer tip. After presetting the probe to 10 grams, the tip of the probe was run across the exposed dentin perpendicular to the examined surface. Subsequent passes were made, each time the applied force was increased by 10 grams, until the subject indicated that he/she was experiencing discomfort, or until the maximum force of 50 grams had been reached.</description>
