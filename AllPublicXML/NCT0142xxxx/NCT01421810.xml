      Women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) can have unwanted facial or male-patterned body
      hair, irregular menstrual periods, or no menstrual periods excess body weight, and
      infertility. It also results in elevated androgen levels such as testosterone. In women with
      PCOS, the majority of excess androgens are produced by the ovaries. However, it is unknown
      whether the ovaries are fully active during early puberty. The purpose of this study is to
      determine how the ovaries contribute to the production of male hormones in the body during
      different stages of puberty, so that it can be better understood why some females have excess
      androgens.

    <textblock>
      Adolescent hyperandrogenemia can represent a forerunner to adult PCOS. Because adrenarche
      leads to an increase in adrenal androgen production during early puberty and since early
      puberty is associated with an overnight rise in testosterone that follows a similar time
      course to cortisol, we hypothesize that the adrenal gland is a major source of androgens in
      early puberty. On the other hand, the overnight rise in testosterone may reflect an ovarian
      response to overnight increases of gonadotropin secretion in early puberty. However, the
      ability of the ovaries to produce androgens (e.g., to respond to gonadotropin stimulation)
      during early puberty has not been tested concurrently in these girls. The sources of excess
      androgen production and the timing of their relative contributions across puberty are
      important in understanding the mechanism of hyperandrogenemia in these individuals. In
      addition, determination of the sources of hyperandrogenemia across puberty may have clinical
      utility in the development of preclinical screening tests designed to reveal those girls at
      greatest risk for PCOS and identification of potential therapeutic targets to prevent its
      development.

      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Girls age 7-18 years

          -  Normal weight (BMI 5-85%-ile for age) or overweight (&gt;85%-ile)

          -  With or without signs of excess androgen

          -  Screening labs within age-appropriate normal range, with the exception of a mildly low
             hematocrit (see below) and the hormonal abnormalities inherent in obesity which could
             include mildly elevated luteinizing hormone (LH), lipids, testosterone, prolactin,
             DHEAS, E2, glucose, and insulin; and decreased follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH)
             and/or sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG)

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients currently enrolled in another research protocol will be excluded, except for
             those enrolled in IRB-HSR #12702/JCM022. This protocol is designed to allow subjects
             enrolling in IRB-HSR #12702/JCM022 to simultaneously participate in this companion
             protocol.

          -  Inability to comprehend what will be done during the study or why it will be done

          -  BMI-for-age &lt; 5th percentile

          -  Weight &lt; 27 kg if simultaneously participating in IRB-HSR #12702/JCM022 due to blood
             volume limits

          -  Obesity associated with a diagnosed genetic syndrome (e.g. Prader-Willi syndrome)

          -  Since the study involves looking at ovarian function, boys will be excluded.

          -  Positive pregnancy test or lactation. Subjects with a positive pregnancy test will be
             informed of the result by the screening physician. Under Virginia law, parental
             notification is not required for minors. However, the screening physician will
             encourage them to tell their parent(s) and counsel them about the importance of
             appropriate prenatal care and counseling. We will arrange follow-up for them at the
             Teen Health Clinic at the University of Virginia or their primary care physician's
             office in a timely manner.

          -  Abnormal laboratory studies will be confirmed by repeat testing to exclude laboratory
             error.

          -  Morning cortisol &lt; 3 microgram/dL or history of Cushing syndrome or adrenal
             insufficiency

          -  History of congenital adrenal hyperplasia or 17-hydroxyprogesterone &gt; 300 ng/dL, which
             suggests the possibility of congenital adrenal hyperplasia (if postmenarchal, the
             17-hydroxyprogesterone will be collected during the follicular phase, or ≥ 40 days
             since last menses if oligomenorrheic). NOTE: If a 17-hydroxyprogesterone &gt;300 mg/dL is
             confirmed on repeat testing, an adrenocorticotropic hormone-stimulated
             17-hydroxyprogesterone &lt;1000 ng/dL will be required for study participation.

          -  Total testosterone &gt; 150 ng/dL

          -  Previous diagnosis of diabetes, fasting glucose ≥126 mg/dL, or a hemoglobin A1c &gt;6.5%

          -  Abnormal thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) for age. Subjects with adequately treated
             hypothyroidism, reflected by normal TSH values, will not be excluded.

          -  Abnormal prolactin. Mild elevations may be seen in overweight girls, and elevations
             &lt;1.5 times the upper limit of normal will be accepted in this group.

          -  Persistent hematocrit &lt;36% and hemoglobin &lt;12 g/dL. Subjects with a mildly low
             hematocrit (33-36%) will be asked to take iron in the form of ferrous gluconate for up
             to 60 days. Subjects weighing ≤ 36 kg will take one 300-325 mg tablet oral ferrous
             gluconate daily (containing 36 mg elemental iron); subjects weighing &gt;36 kg will take
             two 300-325 mg tablets oral ferrous gluconate daily (containing 36 mg elemental iron
             each). They will return to the Clinical Research Unit (CRU) or alternate UVA clinical
             unit after 30-60 days of iron therapy to have their hemoglobin or hematocrit rechecked
             and will proceed with the remainder of the study if it is ≥12 g/dL or ≥36%,
             respectively.

          -  Persistent liver test abnormalities, with the exception that mild bilirubin elevations
             will be accepted in the setting of known Gilbert's syndrome. Mild elevations may be
             seen in overweight girls, so elevations &lt;1.5 times the upper limit of normal will be
             accepted in this group.
