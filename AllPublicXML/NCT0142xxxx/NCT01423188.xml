    <textblock>
      This study is designed to provide an assessment of the change in baseline lipid parameters
      with RVX000222 after 12 weeks and 24 weeks of treatment when given in addition to optimized
      statin background therapy in subjects with low baseline HDL-C.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      One-third of the US population, almost 80 million adults, have cardiovascular disease and
      mortality associated with heart disease still remains as a leading cause of death around the
      world. The major risk factors for cardiovascular disease associated with atherosclerosis is
      dyslipidemia, characterized by high levels of low density lipoprotein (LDL) and/or low levels
      of high density lipoprotein (HDL). The widespread use of statins in patients at risk for
      cardiovascular disease has led to lower LDL levels but has had little effect on HDL levels.
      HDL has a well established role in atherosclerosis and cardiovascular disease protection. HDL
      mediates the removal of cholesterol from the atherosclerotic plaques for elimination from the
      body. The major component of HDL consists of apolipoprotein A-I (ApoA I). Recent intervention
      studies with synthetic HDL particles and recombinant ApoA-I have shown that HDL has the
      capacity to reverse coronary atherosclerosis. Increasing ApoA-I is likely to have a favorable
      effect on atherosclerotic plaque stability and size and on cardiovascular diseases. RVX000222
      is a member of a novel class of small molecules that are candidates for the treatment of
      dyslipidemia by increasing plasma levels of HDL through increased ApoA-I transcription.
