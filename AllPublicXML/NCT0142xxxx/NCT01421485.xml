  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Youth and young adults in the juvenile justice system have a high prevalence of concurrent
      psychiatric and substance use disorders and are also at high risk for HIV. However, even when
      the disorders and risks are recognized, most programs do not address all of these important
      problems and long-term efficacy for all outcomes simultaneously has yet to be demonstrated
      for these multi-problem youth. Adverse outcomes for youth include partially treated or
      relapsing psychiatric disorders, continued substance abuse, unchanged HIV risk, and further
      legal problems. This project, in collaboration with the Rhode Island Family Court, with whom
      we have existing collaborations, will address these issues by implementing an Integrated
      Treatment Program (ITP) that targets mental health/substance abuse disorders and HIV risk.
      ITP is novel by targeting multiple adolescent problems simultaneously, involving parents to
      augment change, and its delivery within the Family Court. This study will extend our previous
      efficacious interventions among youth with psychiatric disorders to court-involved youth.
      Adolescents and their parents will be enrolled from the Rhode Island Family Court Mental
      Health Clinic where youth aged 13-17 are referred by judges for comprehensive assessment and
      referral for treatment. This randomized controlled trial will test the efficacy, among 200
      sexually active court-involved youth who need outpatient treatment, of the novel, integrated
      treatment (ITP, n=100) as compared to enhanced standard care in community outpatient services
      (ESC, n=100) over an 18-month period (6 months of ITP or ESC and 12 months of follow-up). ITP
      consists of three components: 1) individual cognitive behavioral therapy which includes a
      motivational interviewing component and is modular-based to address concurrent mental health
      and substance abuse issues; 2) family and parent training sessions to address parental
      communication and monitoring to support risk reduction among youth; 3) multifamily group
      workshops to address HIV risk, family communication and peer resistance skills. Youth in both
      conditions (ITP and ESC) will receive similar case management services from the court and
      psychiatric medication management (if needed) from a study psychiatrist. ITP will be compared
      to ESC on reductions in sexual risk behavior, substance use, symptoms of psychiatric
      disorders, and legal offenses.
