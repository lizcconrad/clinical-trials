  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Taxane-based chemotherapy is currently one of the most commonly used regimen for salvage
      chemotherapy in advanced urothelial carcinoma. In previously untreated patients, single-agent
      paclitaxel, administered in a 24-hour infusion, produced an overall response rate of 42%, and
      single-agent docetaxel as a first-line therapy produced response rates of 31% and 45% in 11
      patients with impaired renal function. Of the two taxanes, paclitaxel has been studied more
      extensively.

      Intravenous administration of paclitaxel requires the use of solubilizing agents such as
      Cremophor EL (CrEL) due to its hydrophobicity. CrEL often contributes to hypersensitivity
      reactions including hypotension or dyspnea with bronchospasm, some of which are major and
      potentially life-threatening. Minor allergic reactions such as transient rashes and flushing
      also may occur. Despite pretreatment with corticosteroids and histamine antagonists, minor
      reactions still occur in 10-44% of all patients, with 1-3% of patients experiencing
      potentially fatal reactions. CrEL may also act as a potential cofactor for the development of
      peripheral neuropathy. In addition, special infusion sets must be used clinically when
      administering CrEL-based paclitaxel.

      Genexol-PM (Samyang Co., Seoul, Korea), a form of paclitaxel formulated with sterile,
      lyophilized polymeric micells that allow intravenous delivery of paclitaxel without CrEL. The
      polymeric micelle formulation is composed of hundreds of low molecular weight, nontoxic, and
      biodegradable amphiphilic diblock copolymers which include monomethoxy poly(ethylene
      glycol)-block-poly(D,L-lactide), and has a great potential in terms of water solubility, in
      vivo stability, and the nanoscopic size (a diameter of 20-50 nm) of the micellar structure.

      A phase I study established that Genexol-PM administered at 390 mg/m2 intravenously for 3 h
      every 3 weeks was the maximum tolerable dose (MTD) in humans. Dose-limiting toxicities were
      neuropathy, myalgia, and neutropenia. No hypersensitivity reactions were observed in any
      patients despite the absence of antiallergic premedication. The recommended dosage for phase
      II studies was 300 mg/m2.

      Based on the promising results of taxane-based chemotherapy and the absence of standard
      second-line chemotherapy regimen for advanced urothelial cancer, the investigators designed
      phase II study to explore the efficacy and safety of Genexol-PM in advanced urothelial
      patients, who previously treated with gemcitabine plus platinum as adjuvant chemotherapy or
      1st line therapy for metastatic diseases.
