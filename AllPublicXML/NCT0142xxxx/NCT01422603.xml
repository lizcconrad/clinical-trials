  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study has been designed to investigate the safety and feasibility of using a
      chemotherapy drug, Clofarabine, to reduce the disease burden before a donor transplant, in
      patients with high risk Acute Myeloid Leukaemia or Myelodysplasia (MDS). In this study
      Clofarabine chemotherapy will be given a few days before a reduced or full intensity donor
      stem cell transplant and without waiting for normal blood counts to recover. It is hoped that
      this approach may improve the outcome for patients with high risk AML and MDS after their
      transplant.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a pilot study. Twenty patients in total will be treated in two cohorts of 10 patients
      each.

        -  Cohort One: Patients suitable for full intensity conditioning will receive Clofarabine
           pre-conditioning followed by a Cyclophosphamide and Total Body Irradiation conditioned
           allogeneic stem cell transplant.

        -  Cohort Two: Patients not suitable for a full intensity TBI-based transplant due to age
           or co-morbidity will receive Clofarabine pre-conditioning followed by a reduced
           intensity allogeneic stem cell transplant using Fludarabine, intravenous Busulphan and
           Campath 1H.

      The cohorts will be recruited concurrently. It is anticipated that recruitment of the 20
      subjects will be achieved in 18 months to two years.

      The study will be conducted at a single centre (Southampton, UK) in the first instance.

      This design allows the use of a full intensity, TBI-based transplant conditioning schedule,
      for younger patients able to tolerate this approach but also the use of a reduced intensity
      transplant conditioning schedule in older or less fit patients who may still benefit from
      pre-conditioning with Clofarabine followed by an allogeneic stem cell transplant. This
      design, therefore, does not restrict potential recruitment to the study on age or performance
      status alone (within the limits set by ability to tolerate intensive chemotherapy and a
      transplant procedure).
