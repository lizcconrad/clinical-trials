  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main objective of this study is to assess the effectiveness and costs of magnetic
      resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) and compare it to endoscopic retrograde
      cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) in the work up of patients with suspected bile duct
      obstruction on ultrasound. The investigators do not anticipate that a universal
      recommendation for a given diagnostic test (MRCP versus ERCP) will be applicable in all
      patients presenting with bile duct obstruction. Rather, the investigators hope to provide
      quantitative and comparative data relevant to the different clinical situations likely to be
      encountered in practice, in order to assist physicians in choosing the appropriate diagnostic
      modality. More specifically, the investigators feel that patients with intrahepatic or hilar
      obstruction (particularly those with malignant conditions), and those with partial common
      bile duct (CBD) obstruction (to rule out suspected choledocholithiasis) will benefit most
      from this new technology and the avoidance of an unnecessary ERCP to further determine the
      biliary anatomy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The approach to investigation and management of intermediate-risk biliary obstruction is
      controversial. Both magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography(MRCP)and endoscopic
      retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) are used interchangeably in practice, with little
      literature to support the efficacy of one versus the other.

      The purpose is to assess the effectiveness of MRCP compared to ERCP in the initial work-up of
      patients at intermediate risk of suspected biliary obstruction following initial clinical
      assessment and ultrasonography.

      A randomized medical effectiveness study was conducted across three tertiary care hospital
      sites. Patients at intermediate risk of biliary obstruction were randomized to either ERCP or
      MRCP based on level of obstruction as seen by ultrasound (US).
