      The study will include 1200 patients with type 2 diabetes and angiographically documented
      coronary artery disease and 600 matched non-diabetic patients without type 2 diabetes.
      Extensive traditional and novel risk marker tests are performed for the patients and they
      will be followed-up for 5 years. Sudden cardiac death is the main outcome measure and various
      other endpoints are secondary endpoints. As a substudy, 120 diabetic patients and 120
      non-diabetic patients will undergo exercise training with home monitoring to assess the
      effects of exercise training on risk profiles.

      Specific aims of the study:

        1. To compare several autonomic, electric and metabolic risk markers in a case-control
           study between the patients with coronary artery disease with and without type II
           diabetes at the time of diagnosis of CAD.

        2. To assess the prognostic significance of autonomic markers, electrical markers, coronary
           angiographic markers and metabolic markers in predicting the cardiac events among the
           CAD patients with and without diabetes

        3. To develop and test the feasibility of home-monitoring of biosignals among the type II
           diabetic patients with CAD.

        4. To further explore the molecular, cellular and genetic factors that predispose diabetics
           to cardiovascular diseases.

        5. To develop new methods for the early clinical diagnosis of vulnerable subjects
           susceptible to the complications of the coronary artery disease in Type 2 diabetes.

      5. To assess the effects of controlled exercise training programs to several autonomic,
      electrical and metabolic risk markers among the type II diabetic patients with CAD

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  A total of 1200 patients with CAD and diagnosed type II diabetes and 600 patients with
             CAD but without evidence of diabetes will be included in the study. The patients will
             be recruited from the consecutive series of patients undergoing coronary angiography
             in the division of cardiology of the Oulu University Hospital. First, 600 patients
             with diabetes will be collected. Thereafter, 600 matched CAD patients without diabetes
             will be recruited. The groups will be matched in terms of following variables:

               1. sex (1:1)

               2. age (&lt;40 years, 40-50 years, 50-60 years, 60-70 years, 70-80 years)

               3. history of recent (&lt;3 months) myocardial infarction (1:1)

               4. type of coronary intervention after angiography (1:1 CABG ).

          -  Diabetes is defined as fasting plasma glucose levels ≥ 7.0 and/or a 2-h postload value
             in the OGTT 11.1 mmol/l according to definition and diagnosis of diabetes mellitus and
             intermediate hyperglycemia : report of a WHO/IDF consultation. World Health
             Organization (WHO) 2006. -

             &lt;6.1 mmol/l in the fasting state and a 2-h postload value &lt; 7.8 mmol/l in the oral
             glucose tolerance test (OGTT).

        Exclusion Criteria:
