  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN), most notably polycythemia vera (PV), essential
      thrombocythemia (ET), and primary myelofibrosis (PMF) are a diverse but inter-related suite
      of clonal disorders of pluripotent hematopoietic stem cells (Tefferi et al., 2008). The MPN
      share a range of biological, pathological, and clinical features including the relative
      overproduction of one or more cells of myeloid origin, growth factor independent colony
      formation in vitro, marrow hypercellularity, extramedullary hematopoiesis, spleno- and
      hepatomegaly, and thrombotic and/or hemorrhagic diatheses (Tefferi et al., 2005).

      This is a multi-centre, open-label, non-randomized, dose-escalation study, to be conducted in
      two phases: a dose-escalation phase (Part 1), to determine the safety and tolerability of
      momelotinib (CYT387), and to identify a therapeutic dose for the expanded cohort; and a
      dose-confirmation phase (Part 2), which will be a cohort expansion at or below the MTD of
      momelotinib.

      In the Part I dose-escalation phase of the study, subjects will be assigned to dose levels in
      successive cohorts starting with a dose in the first cohort of 200 mg BID (twice daily with
      doses taken approximately 12 hours apart). Doses will be escalated by 50 mg BID per cohort
      until dose-limiting toxicities are observed. The dose level at which ≥2 of 6 subjects develop
      a first cycle dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) is defined as the DLT level. The maximum tolerated
      dose (MTD) is defined as the dose level below the DLT level. New dose levels may begin
      accrual only if all subjects at the current dose level have been observed for a minimum of 28
      days from the first day of treatment. The dose level chosen for study in the dose
      confirmation phase of the study will be the MTD or a lower dose shown to have significant
      clinical activity (efficacy) as determined by the safety review committee. Subjects will be
      evaluated weekly for the first cycle, every 2 weeks during cycle 2, then monthly for 4 cycles
      for a total of 6 cycles.

      In the dose-confirmation phase of the study, approximately fifty (50) subjects will be
      treated at the MTD or at a lower dose shown to have significant clinical activity (efficacy)
      as chosen by the Safety Review Committee. In the dose confirmation phase of the study
      subjects will be evaluated every 2 weeks during the first treatment cycle, and then monthly
      for 5 cycles for a total of 6 cycles.
