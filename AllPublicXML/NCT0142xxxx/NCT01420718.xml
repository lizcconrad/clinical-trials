      The purpose of this study is to compare the human pulp response to partial pulpotomy using
      White ProRoot MTA or iRoot BP in the terms of dentinal bridge formation and inflammation.

      This will be a randomized single blind clinical trial. Setting and conduct: Twenty caries
      free premolar teeth from fifteen patients assigned for orthodontic extraction will be
      included. Participants including major eligibility criteria: Their parents need to sign an
      informed form, Patients shouldn't have any systematic complication, The teeth should be free
      of any symptom, caries and decalcification and should reveal a normal response to pulp
      sensitivity tests, No mobility or swelling in the surrounding soft tissues, sensitivity on
      palpation or percussion should be present. Intervention: A class one cavity will be prepared
      and the depth will be increased until the pulp exposure occurs. One millimeter of the coronal
      pulp will be removed. Then the exposure site will be covered using two pulpotomy agents:
      White ProRoot MTA as control group and iRoot BP. After six weeks (42 days) the teeth will be
      extracted after radiographic and clinical examination to find any sign of swelling, abscess
      or sinus tract. Main outcome measures (variables): The teeth will be sectioned and examined
      to compare the presence of dentinal bridge, its thickness and feature in the terms of tunnel
      defect formation. The underlying pulp will be assessed and graded according to the degree of
      inflammation as follows: grade 0 no inflammation, grade 1 mild inflammation, grade 2 moderate
      inflammations, grade 3 severe inflammation, grade 4 abscess formation or necrosis. Our
      criteria are based on ISO 7405.
