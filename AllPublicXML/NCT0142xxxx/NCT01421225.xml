  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators are conducting this study to find out whether a new device can control
      blood sugar levels in children who have Type 1 diabetes. In Type 1 diabetes, children have
      high blood sugar levels because they do not make enough insulin. The standard treatment is to
      give insulin either by shots or using an insulin pump. A new device, called closed-loop
      insulin therapy, uses a continuous glucose monitor (CGMs) linked to an insulin pump by a
      computer. The CGM will send the sugar levels to a computer which automatically figures out
      how much insulin to give and then gives that amount of insulin through the insulin pump. It
      will give the child insulin to bring sugar levels down if they are high, and will give less
      insulin if the child's blood sugar is getting lower. Earlier research using closed-loop
      insulin therapy has shown the ability for it to improve diabetes care in adults and older
      children, but there has been no research of closed-loop insulin therapy in young children.
      This study will compare children's current insulin therapy with the closed-loop system. The
      knowledge that the investigators gain from this research will help us to figure out whether
      closed-loop therapy can work in young children, hopefully leading to better Type 1 diabetes
      care.

      We will perform a randomized cross-over study of semi-closed-loop insulin therapy in children
      less than 7 years old with type 1 diabetes. Subjects will be admitted to the inpatient
      clinical research center for 48 hours. They will receive their standard home insulin therapy
      for one day and semi-closed-loop insulin therapy for the other day.
