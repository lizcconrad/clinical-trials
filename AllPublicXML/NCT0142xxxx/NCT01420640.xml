    <textblock>
      The investigators will conduct a large randomized controlled trial comparing the
      effectiveness of Tai Chi mind-body exercise and standard-of-care aerobic exercise for
      fibromyalgia. In addition, the investigators will determine the optimal frequency and
      duration of a Tai Chi intervention for short and long-term effectiveness.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Fibromyalgia (FM) is a chronic musculoskeletal pain syndrome that causes substantial physical
      and psychological impairment and costs over $25 billion annually. Current pharmacological
      therapies may be expensive, cause serious adverse effects, and fail to effectively improve
      pain and function. Finding new and effective non-pharmacological treatments for FM patients
      is urgently needed.

      We propose to conduct the first comparative effectiveness trial of Tai Chi vs. aerobic
      exercise (a recommended component of the current standard of care) and to evaluate
      effectiveness under different Tai Chi dosing schedules in a large FM population. We aim to
      (1) demonstrate that, compared to aerobic exercise, Tai Chi is a more effective intervention
      for managing the pain and improving the functional limitations that impact quality of life
      for FM patients, and 2) determine the optimal frequency and duration of a supervised Tai Chi
      intervention in relation to short and long-term effectiveness. To achieve this goal, we will
      conduct a single-blind, randomized controlled trial of Tai Chi vs. aerobic exercise in 216
      patients who meet the American College of Rheumatology criteria for FM. Patients will be
      randomized to one of four Tai Chi intervention groups: 12 or 24 weeks of supervised Tai Chi
      given once or twice per week, or a supervised aerobic exercise control: 2x/week for 24 weeks.
      All groups will have a 52-week follow-up. The primary outcome will be the FM Impact
      Questionnaire total score at 24 weeks. Secondary outcomes include the measures of widespread
      pain, functional performance, psychological functioning, self-efficacy, sleep quality, and
      quality of life at 12, 24, and 52 weeks.

      Successful completion of the proposed study will determine the ideal regimen of Tai Chi and
      demonstrate that Tai Chi can be a simple, effective, and durable treatment for this
      therapeutically challenging disorder.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Age 21 years or older.

          -  Fulfills the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) 1990 classification criteria for
             FM: (1) a history of widespread musculoskeletal pain on the right and left sides of
             the body as well as above and below the waist for a minimum duration of 3 months, and
             (2) pain in 11 or more of 18 specific tender points with moderate or greater
             tenderness reported upon digital palpation.27

          -  Fulfills the ACR 2010 diagnostic criteria for FM: (WPI ≥7 AND SS ≥5) OR (WPI 3-6 AND
             SS ≥9) and does not have a disorder that would otherwise explain the pain28

          -  Willing to complete the 12-week or 24-week study, including once or twice-a-week
             exercise sessions.

          -  Willing to abstain from Tai Chi or other new formalized exercise programs until
             completion of the study if randomized to the Aerobic Exercise.

          -  Willing to abstain from Aerobic Exercise or other new formalized exercise programs
             until completion of the study if randomized to Tai Chi

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Prior experience with Tai Chi or other similar types of Complementary and Alternative
             Medicine in the past 1 year such as Qi gong and yoga since these share some of the
             principles of Tai Chi.

          -  Dementia, neurological disease, cancer, cardiovascular disease, pulmonary disease,
             metabolic disease, renal disease, liver disease, or other serious medical conditions
             limiting ability to participate in the Tai Chi or Aerobic Exercise programs, as
             determined by the study physicians.

          -  Any other diagnosed medical condition known to contribute to FM symptomatology that is
             not under adequate control for the study period such as thyroid disease, inflammatory
             arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis, myositis, vasculitis or
             Sjogren's syndrome.

          -  Inability to pass the Mini-Mental Status examination (with a score below 24) 29

          -  Enrollment in any other clinical trial within the last 30 days

          -  Plan to permanently relocate from the region during the trial period

          -  Positive urine pregnancy test at baseline or planning pregnancy within the study
             period

          -  Not English-Speaking: English is the only language to be used during the exercise
             training program. Our self-reported outcome measures are obtained from validated
             English-version questionnaires. In addition, using other languages would likely
             require separate classes, recruitment and instructors which are beyond our current
             study scope
