    <textblock>
      This study is to test a therapeutic HIV-1 vaccine (HIVAX™) in HIV-1 infected subjects. The
      safety and immune responses will be studied in vaccine recipients. The anti-viral effect of
      HIVAX vaccine will be monitored during a 12-week treatment interruption phase.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, placebo-controlled dose-escalation clinical trial to evaluate the
      safety and the immunogenicity of two doses of a replication defective HIV-1 vaccine (HIVAX™)
      in subjects receiving stable highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) who have an HIV-1
      RNA &lt;50 copies/ml and CD4 cell count &gt;500 cells/mm3. Following the randomized
      placebo-controlled vaccination phase subjects who received active vaccine and who meet
      eligibility will undergo a 12-week analytical antiretroviral treatment interruption followed
      by reinstitution of antiretroviral therapy (or continued interruption) with follow up through
      week 48.

         10. Willingness to use adequate contraception by study participants

             Subjects must agree not to participate in a conception process (e.g., active attempts
             to become pregnant or to impregnate, sperm donation, or in vitro fertilization), and
             if participating in sexual activity that could lead to pregnancy, subjects must use a
