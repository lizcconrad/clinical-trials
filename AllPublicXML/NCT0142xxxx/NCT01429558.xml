  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this project is to study live recordings from neuronal population of the human
      nucleus accumbens during the implantation of deep brain stimulation (DBS) electrodes for the
      treatment-resistant obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD). The central aim of this project is
      to determine if intra-operative electrophysiological data can confirm that the electrode is
      located in the nucleus accumbens. This confirmation could allow the placement of the DBS
      electrodes with a higher degree of precision. An additional aim of this project will be to
      study the activity of the neuronal population of the nucleus accumbens while a subject is
      presented with a task involving an unexpected reward.

      The investigators central hypothesis is that unexpected reward will be associated with
      increase firing and synchrony in the neuronal population. This will translate into recordable
      increase activity in the investigators region of interest and therefore confirm the proper
      placement of the electrode.

      This study enrolled 2 subjects, with 1 subject completing the protocol showing the
      feasibility of the experiment. There were electrophysiological variations with the task
      presented but no conclusion could be drawn given the small sample size.
