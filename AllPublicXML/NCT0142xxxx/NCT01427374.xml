  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Individuals with kidney disease are at a higher risk for heart and vascular diseases,
      including heart attacks and strokes, than those with normal kidney function. The purpose of
      this research study is to collect information on the causes, complications and treatment of
      kidney disease. Patient characteristics, comorbid diseases and laboratory markers used in
      routine practice, as well as novel biochemical markers and genetic data will be collected to
      examine relationships between biochemical and genetic markers and cardiovascular risk.
      Information on the health history of incident hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis patients
      will be captured using structured patient interviews and review of medical records. Blood and
      urine specimens will be collected at the time of dialysis initiation and stored in order to
      perform novel biochemical and genetic assays in the future. The overall goal of the
      CKDCS/LUCID study is improve understanding of cardiac-associated risks and to improve
      treatment in patients with kidney disease. A cardiac imaging substudy will be performed in a
      subset of patients enrolled. The goals of the substudy are to examine whether the risks of
      developing common cardiac-related complications (coronary artery calcification [CAC] and left
      ventricular hypertrophy [LVH]) are associated with certain medications taken by individuals
      on dialysis and whether these risks are modified by a genotypic predisposition.

      This study is being conducted under the Sponsorship of the University of Alberta (Edmonton,
      Alberta, Canada) and is funded by Canadian Institutes of Health Industry Partnered Research
      Grant IRO 90262 - with partnership funding from Abbott Laboratories. The co-Principal
      Investigators are Marcello Tonelli MD SM and Ravi Thadhani, MD, MPH . A total of 750 patients
      are anticipated being enrolled at Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH). The remaining
      patients are being enrolled in Canada.

      This study will utilize data from &quot;The Canadian Kidney Disease Cohort Study&quot; (CKDCS) and &quot;The
      Longitudinal US/Canada Incident Dialysis STUDY (LUCID).

      Blood and urine will be obtained at baseline, 6 months and annually thereafter. Blood samples
      will be immediately divided into multiple aliquots, from which plasma, DNA, RNA and/or cells
      will be extracted and separately stored. Urine specimens will also be aliquoted to allow
      future measurement of genetic and cellular material. Specimens will be labeled using unique
      study identifiers to maintain confidentiality.
