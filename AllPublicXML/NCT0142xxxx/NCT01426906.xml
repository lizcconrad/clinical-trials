    <textblock>
      This study is a randomized, open-label, 2-period, 3-treatment, 1-sequence, drug-drug
      interaction study in healthy volunteers to evaluate effect of ketoconazole or rifampicin on
      the PK characteristic and safety of LC15-0444.

      Eligibility for participation of this study will be determined by demographic information,
      medical history, physical examination, electrocardiogram (ECG) and clinical laboratory tests
      within 4 weeks(-28 d ~ -2 d) before the first drug administration(1 d). Eligible subjects
      will be randomized to one of study treatment groups.

      According to the characteristics of anti-diabetic drugs, it is expected to be administered
      with other drugs in many patients. Therefore, Drug-Drug Interaction with CYP3A4 inducer and
      inhibitor should be identified in this trial.
