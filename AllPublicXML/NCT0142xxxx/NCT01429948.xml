      We hypothesized that paradoxical embolism may be one of the main mechanisms of silent
      cerebral infarction (SCI) located outside the perforating artery territory. In the present
      study, we evaluated the association between SCI and paradoxical embolism detected by agitated
      saline transcranial Doppler (TCD) monitoring in healthy subjects without history of stroke or
      transient ischemic attack (TIA). We also compared the frequency and amount of paradoxical
      embolism between healthy subjects with SCI and acute stroke patients with presumed
      cryptogenic embolism or conventional stroke mechanisms.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        Healthy subjects

          -  Subjects with age over 20 years

          -  Subjects who consecutively visited a health promotion center for a health screening
             examination that included routine laboratory test, cardiac work-ups (12-lead
             electrocardiography and/or echocardiography), and brain magnetic resonance image (MRI)
             and MR angiography (MRA)

          -  Subjects who showed silent brain infarction (SCI) which was defined as a focal
             hyperintensity lesion 3 mm or large in diameter in the fluid-attenuation inversion
             recovery (FLAIR) images without a history of a corresponding stroke or transient
             ischemic attack (TIA)

          -  Subjects who performed agitated saline transcranial Doppler (TCD) monitoring

        Patients with acute stroke (both cryptogenic embolic stroke and conventional stroke
        mechanisms)

          -  Patients with age over 20 year

          -  Patients with focal neurologic deficits presented within 7 days of symptom onset

          -  Patients with acute ischemic lesions on diffusion-weighted image (DWI)

          -  Patients who performed agitated saline TCD monitoring

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Healthy subjects

          -  Subjects with the presence of previous history of stroke or TIA

          -  Subjects with the presence of dementia on history taking or mini-mental status
             examination

          -  Subjects with the presence of proximal source of embolism, including atrial
             fibrillation or significant (â‰¥50%) stenosis on cervicocerebral artery on MRA or
             carotid Duplex

          -  Subjects who had SCI restricted within perforator territory (basal ganglia or pons)
             suggesting that microangiopathy rather than embolism could be the main mechanism of
             SCI

          -  Subjects in whom agitated saline TCD monitoring was not performed or those who had
             poor temporal windows

        Patients with acute stroke (both cryptogenic embolic stroke and conventional stroke
        mechanisms)

          -  Patients in whom agitated saline TCD monitoring was not performed or those who had
             poor temporal windows
