  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective was to compare the frequency and intensity of symptoms of anxiety in patients
      of preoperative cardiac surgery who received empathic behaviour from nurse or family or those
      who received no specific type of empathic behaviour. This is a randomized clinical trial. The
      sample consisted of 66 patients in preoperative of cardiac surgery, who were divided in three
      groups: empathic behaviour by nurses, without specific empathic behaviour and by family.
      Anxiety was assessed at two time points: before and after the intervention. The instrument
      used was developed and validated, comprising 19 defining characteristics of the nursing
      diagnosis anxiety. The hypothesis is that the group who received empathic behaviour from
      nurse or family will reduce the anxiety.

      Primary outcome is anxiety. Anxiety was assessed by a nurse using of an instrument developed
      and validated previous, based on 19 defining characteristics described by NANDA-International
      for the nursing diagnosis anxiety: verbalization of fear (expressed concern); apprehension,
      nervousness, tension, restlessness, anxiety, anxious, insomnia, abnormal respiratory rate,
      increased pulse, dry mouth, increased perspiration, fatigue, cranky; voice / ends trembling,
      chest / abdominal pain, urinary urgency, nausea, and vomiting.

      Patients were evaluated for the presence and absence of these anxiety symptoms through
      scores: 0 (no symptom) and 1 (presence of symptom). For analysis of the results was carried
      out the sum of the scores of each symptom, ranging from 0 to 21, with the higher the score,
      the greater was the anxiety symptoms presented by the patient.
