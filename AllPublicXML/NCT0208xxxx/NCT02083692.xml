      The purpose of this study is to assess the effect of metformin in tumor metabolism in
      patients with head and neck cancer by evaluating metformin's ability to decrease TOMM20
      expression in squamous carcinoma cells and decrease MCT4 expression in fibroblasts.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Diagnosis of head and neck cancer biopsy proven, and who have a scheduled appointment
             for definitive resection of the tumor at TJUH

          -  Age ≥ 18 years of age and ≤80 years old.

          -  Newly diagnosed with HNSCC cancer.

          -  No prior therapy for HNSCC cancer is permitted for enrollment in the trial.

          -  All subjects must be able to comprehend and sign a written informed consent document.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Pregnant or may become pregnant during metformin administration.

             sulfonylureas.

          -  Received iodinated contrast dye less than 48 hours prior to screening meet a temporary
             exclusion criteria to receive metformin. These patients cannot start investigational
             metformin until 48 hours have elapsed from contrast administration. Subjects who are
             scheduled for iodinated contrast dye administration within 48 hours of definitive
             surgery are excluded.

          -  Myocardial ischemia or peripheral muscle ischemia.

          -  Sepsis or severe infection.

          -  History of lung disease currently requiring any pharmacologic or supplemental oxygen
             treatment.

          -  Scheduled for definitive HNSCC cancer surgical resection less than two weeks from
             enrollment or greater than five weeks from enrollment.

          -  History of hepatic dysfunction or hepatic disease.

          -  Excessive alcohol intake which is defined in accordance with CDC definitions as more
