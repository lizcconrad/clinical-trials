      Problem description In industrialized countries there is a rapid increase in the number of
      senior citizens. In Austria more than 50% of the population is overweight, with highest
      prevalence in the age group from 60 to 74 yrs and the WHO lists physical inactivity as one of
      the main behavioral risk factors of cardiovascular diseases.

      Especially in winter months, activity related energy expenditure was 40% and 31% lower in the
      US and Canada, respectively. In addition, in an Austrian study the winter season was
      associated with higher blood pressure, total cholesterol and body mass index, giving an
      increasing risk of chronic coronary disease by 6.8% in men and 3.6% in women.

      Therefore, the development of intervention programs that overcome the winter physical
      activity deficit and be feasible also for elderly should be goal of future research. Alpine
      skiing (AS) and cross country skiing (XCS) have a long standing tradition in Austria and
      could potentially fill the winter physical activity gap. The Salzburg Skiing for the Elderly
      Study (SASES) has found AS to be a save and feasible possibility to improve the health of the
      aged population in many parameters. XCS as a competitive sport is already well explored but
      there are hardly any studies about its effects in the normal or elderly population.
      Unfortunately knowledge about the differences between AS and XCS in the physiological
      adaptation processes in the elderly population is also lacking.

      Aims and hypotheses of the pre-study In order to standardize training interventions, the
      present pre-study aims at comparing physiological and metabolic parameters between AS, XCS
      and IT. Therefore, the results of the pre-study serve as determinants for the training
      parameters of the above mentioned main study.

      We postulate that, based on the results of the present study, it is possible to set up
      comparable isocaloric training sessions for AS, XCS and IT for elderly and unfit persons.

      Furthermore, we assume that elderly and unfit subjects are able to perform a full spectrum of
      intensities and techniques necessary to set appropriate stimuli for isocaloric comparison.

      We hypothesize arterial stiffness indices and circulating microRNA (miRNA) patterns to change
      due to one bout of physical activity of AS, XCS, and IT with variations depending on the kind
      of sport.
