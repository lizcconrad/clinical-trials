  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Anxiety disorders are a major public health concern, having a profound impact on functioning,
      causing significant disability, loss of productivity and suffering. Effective treatments
      exist for these disorders, but few clinicians are trained in these methods. This project
      attempts to remedy this shortcoming by using web-based tools to facilitate access to this
      training, thus increasing the number of available therapists in order to help meet this unmet
      need.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The need for evidence-based mental health treatments i.e., 'treatment based on the best
      available science or research evidence', has been stressed from scientific, ethical, and
      economic perspectives. While empirical evidence supports both the efficacy and effectiveness
      of cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) for anxiety disorders, the demand for clinicians trained
      in these approaches far exceeds the supply. A major reason for this is the lack of trained
      cognitive behavior therapists. New technologies provide the opportunity to both facilitate
      accessibility to this specialized training by mental health professionals and to improve the
      quality of this training. Recent research has found that training clinicians using these new
      web-based technologies is highly effective, can significantly improve skills, and has
      significant advantages over traditional training programs. The long term goal of this project
      is to increase the number of available mental health professionals trained in cognitive
      behavior therapy for anxiety disorders by developing a set of web-based training tools
      enabling the widespread dissemination of this training. In Phase I the investigators
      developed a prototype online tutorial covering some core CBT principles and a Social Anxiety
      Disorder module. The investigators also tested the feasibility of live remote training
      through videoconferencing. In phase II investigators will expand the tutorial to include a
      comprehensive review of CBT principles and techniques and expand modules to include the full
      spectrum of anxiety and anxiety-related disorders (i.e., Obsessive Compulsive Disorder, Panic
      Disorder, Generalized Anxiety Disorder, Posttraumatic Stress Disorder and Social Anxiety
      Disorder). Investigators will also evaluate the efficacy of live remote training in improving
      clinical skills. A cohort of 50 clinicians from diverse educational and professional
      backgrounds will be recruited. Improvement in trainees' conceptual knowledge will be
      evaluated pre and post tutorial, and improvement in trainees' clinical skills in applying the
      CBT concepts will be evaluated by blind ratings of clinical adherence and competence at three
      time points: before on-line training, and before and after videoconference training. User
      satisfaction with both the on-line tutorial and the videoconference training will also be
      evaluated. Impact of training on post-training patient outcomes will be evaluated.

    <description>User satisfaction with the technical aspects of the tutorial was assessed using the ratings on the System Usability Scale (SUS), a reliable, well-validated 10-item scale designed to evaluate the usability and user satisfaction with web-based applications and other technologies.</description>

    <measure>Yale Adherence and Competence Scale (YACS)</measure>
    <time_frame>At day 0 (baseline) (i.e., priot to any training), and after completing the on line tutorial (an expected average of two weeks), and after completing the appled training (an exected average of 8 weeks).</time_frame>
    <description>The Yale Adherence and Competence Scale (YACS) is a well-validated, scale for rating therapist adherence and competence in delivering cognitive behavioral treatments. It has been used as an outcome measure in several studies evaluating the effectiveness of different CBT rater training approaches . Therapist competence in administering specific CBT techniques is evaluated on a scale ranging from 1 (very poor) to 7 (excellent).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>User Satisfaction Questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>After completing the on line tutorial (an expected average of 2 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>This scale evaluates how well subjects liked the clinical content of the on-line tutorial. It contains 14 statements, each of which are rated on a 4-point scale (strongly agree, agree, disagree, strongly disagree), and covers several dimensions of the user experience . The scale ranges from 15 to 60, and has good internal consistency reliability (Cronbach's Alpha =.90, Phase I study results). An overall mean score of 45 (i.e., an average score of 3 (&quot;agree&quot; on all items)) is considered adequate to demonstrate acceptable user satisfaction with the clinical content.</description>

    <measure>GAD-7</measure>
    <time_frame>Weekly for 8 weeks of patient treatment, post training</time_frame>
    <description>The GAD-7 is a well-validated self-report scale originally developed as a brief measure of GAD. It has since been validated as measure of anxiety across the domain of anxiety disorders.</description>
