    <textblock>
      This Phase I clinical trial studies the side effects and maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of the
      combination of brentuximab vedotin (BV) and lenalidomide in the treatment of patients with
      relapsed or refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL).

    <measure>Safety as measured by grade and frequency of adverse events</measure>
    <time_frame>30 days after completion of treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Adverse events will be graded according to the NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4.0.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) as measured by the number of dose-limiting toxicities in each dose level (cohort)</measure>
    <time_frame>Completion of the first cycle for all participants in dose expansion phase (approximately 12 months)</time_frame>
    <description>MTD is defined as the dose level immediately below the dose level at which 2 patients of a cohort (of 2 to 6 patients) experience dose-limiting toxicity during the first cycle. Dose escalations will proceed until the MTD has been reached.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Objective response rate as measured by CD30 expression</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 2 years after discontinuation of treatment</time_frame>
    <description>The objective response rate by CD30 expression (proportion of positive cells, staining intensity, or both) is defined as the proportion of patients with CR or PR stratified by different values or categories of CD30 expression. Positive CD30 expression is defined as ≥1% staining of the malignant cells.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Overall response rate</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 2 years after discontinuation of treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Complete response rate (CR) + Partial response rate (PR) = Overall response rate according to the Revised Response Criteria for Malignant Lymphoma (Cheson 2007).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Duration of response</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 2 years after discontinuation of treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Duration of response is defined as the time from start of the first documentation of objective tumor response (CR or PR) to the first documentation of tumor progression (including radiographic and clinical progression) or to death due to any cause, whichever comes first.
Duration of response data will be censored on the day following the date of the last disease assessment documenting absence of progressive disease for patients who do not have tumor progression and are still on study at the time of an analysis, are given antitumor treatment (including stem cell transplant) other than the study treatment, or are removed from study prior to documentation of tumor progression.
Duration of response will only be calculated for the subgroup of patients achieving a CR or PR.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Progression-free survival (PFS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 2 years after discontinuation of treatment</time_frame>
    <description>PFS is defined as the time from start of study treatment to first documentation of tumor progression (including radiographic and clinical progression) or to death due to any cause, whichever comes first.
PFS data will be censored on the day following the date of the last disease assessment documenting absence of progressive disease for patients who do not have tumor progression and are still on study at the time of an analysis, are given antitumor treatment (including stem cell transplant) other than the study treatment, or are removed from study prior to documentation of tumor progression. Patients lacking an evaluation of tumor response after their first dose will have their event time censored at 1 day.</description>
