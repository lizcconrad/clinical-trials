  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is a developmental disorder that presents
      during childhood, with at least some symptoms causing impairment before the age of seven. It
      is characterized by developmentally inappropriate levels of inattention and/or
      hyperactive-impulsive behavior, with significant impairment occurring in at least two
      settings. It affects approximately 5.2 million children in the United States. Homeopathic
      treatment has been shown to be a promising intervention for ADHD, however the reasons for
      that effectiveness is unclear. Specifically, it is unclear whether improvement is due to the
      homeopathic medicine, the consultative process, or other non-specific effects.

      This study has 3 primary objectives: 1. to determine if there are any specific effects of
      homeopathic medicines in the treatment of ADHD, 2. to determine if there any specific effects
      the homeopathic consultation alone in the treatment of ADHD, and 3. to determine if there is
      an overall effect of homeopathic treatment (homeopathic medicines plus consultation) in the
      treatment of ADHD.

      This is a three arm study. Participants will be randomized to one of three arms:

      Arm 1 (Verum group): a treatment arm where the participant will receive homeopathic
      consultation plus a homeopathic remedy Arm 2 (Placebo group): a treatment arm where the
      participant will receive homeopathic consultation plus a placebo remedy Arm 3 (Usual care
      group): participants will continue with usual care and will not receive homeopathic treatment
      as part of the study.

      Participants enrolled in this study, regardless of which study Arm they are in, may continue
      with all conventional medications or any other aspect of their current standard of care they
      are taking as recommended by their usual physician (so long as they are on a stable dose of
      the conventional ADHD medication for at least 6 weeks prior to beginning the trial). They may
      also continue to attend regularly scheduled visits with their own health care
      practitioner(s).

      Participants may also start, stop or change the dose of any therapy (including conventional
      medications) during the study and are asked to report the change to the study team. Thus, the
      placebo group participants are not different than other participants, except that they will
      have a homeopathic consultation and a placebo remedy. The use of placebo is specific to
      homeopathic treatment, to allow for double-blinding, which is recognized to reduce study
      bias.

      Prior to enrolling in the study, those considering participation will undergo a full
      assessment by a psychiatrist with a specialty in child and youth mental health. This
      assessment confirms the diagnosis and screens for inclusion/exclusion study criteria. At the
      same time, the psychiatrist recommends evidence-based therapies to clients including
      conventional medication. The psychiatrist does not directly treat the client. If medication
      is recommended and the clients wish to pursue it with their regular physician, they would
      still be able to enroll in the study if they wanted to, after six weeks of reaching a stable
      dose.

      This study will help our understanding of the treatment process and whether different
      elements of the intervention have greater or lesser effects.

      This study is a follow-up to an open label pilot study of the homeopathic treatment of ADHD
      using the same study team. Sample size was calculated based on the results of that study.

As per classical homeopathy practice, once the most appropriate homeopathic remedy has been chosen, it will be prescribed by the homeopath according to her/his clinical judgment (maximum on a daily basis, 3 times per day, minimum 1 dose (or zero doses on the second consult or later)) with administration instructions given to the parent and patient as appropriate. Water dosing, in which a lactose/sucrose granule remedy is dissolved in 250 ml of water will be used based on the homeopath's clinical judgment. Only one remedy will be administered at a time.</description>
