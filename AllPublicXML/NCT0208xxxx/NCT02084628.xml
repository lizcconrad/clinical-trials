  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, multi-center study involving babies 0-2 months of age who have liver
      problems (pathology) and need to have their liver and possibly, the bile ducts imaged using
      magnetic resonance imaging and injection of a contrast agent (dye). This agent is called
      Eovist. It has been marketed since 2004 and used in many countries all over the world.

      The baby will have blood tests before and after the imaging is done to make sure that there
      are no unexpected findings before and after the imaging. Also 3 blood samples up to 8 hours
      after the injection will be obtained in order to measure how much of the dye is in the blood.
      The baby will have an intravenous line which can be used for the blood samples and will not
      need to be stick for the blood samples. Several radiologists will evaluate the images. The
      family doctor will be contacted to find out what was the diagnosis and treatment after the
      results of the MRI were known. Six months after the study, the parent(s)/legal guardian(s)
      will be contacted to make sure the that baby did not have any problems, especially with the
      skin, joints and eyes.

      In order to minimize bias in assessment of the images, blinded reading of the MR images will
      be performed by 2 blinded readers. The blinded readers will be independent board-certified
      pediatric radiologists who have no knowledge about the subjects and are not affiliated with
      any of the clinical sites.
