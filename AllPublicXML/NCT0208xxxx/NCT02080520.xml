      The potential for nattokinase to &quot;thin&quot; blood and to reduce blood clotting by positive
      antithrombotic and fibrinolytic effects presents a unique opportunity to safely study such
      effects on cardiovascular disease and cognition. Unfortunately, such studies of
      antithrombotic and fibrinolytic pathways of prevention have been limited due to lack of safe
      compounds and the adverse reactions associated with current agents such as Coumadin.
      Nattokinase, an over-the-counter supplement used for cardiovascular health, is the most
      active functional constituent of natto, a fermented soy product. Natto has been consumed
      primarily by the Japanese for over 1000 years, a population with one of the lowest risks for
      cardiovascular disease and dementia. Cardiovascular disease and dementia remain the most
      challenging age-related health risks of the 21st century for Americans necessitating
      development of further effective preemptive strategies. Whether reducing the propensity for
      thrombus formation and/or increasing fibrinolytic activity can prevent the progression of
      atherosclerosis and cognitive decline has not yet been determined.

      Using nattokinase under primary prevention conditions, the investigators propose to conduct a
      randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial to determine whether decreasing
      atherothrombotic risk can reduce the progression of atherosclerosis and cognitive decline.
      The investigators propose to randomize 240 healthy non-demented women and men to nattokinase
      supplementation or to placebo for three years. The primary trial end points will be
      measurement of carotid arterial wall thickness and arterial stiffness, early changes of
      atherosclerosis that can be measured safely by non-invasive imaging techniques. The secondary
      trial end point will be ascertained through change in cognition measured by a
      neuropsychological battery. In addition, biochemical blood measurements and in vitro studies
      will be conducted to compare the effects of nattokinase relative to placebo on blood
      coagulation and thrombus break-down capabilities, blood flow properties, inflammation and
      inflammatory activation of endothelial cells that line blood vessels.

      At the conclusion of this trial, the investigators expect to have sufficient evidence as to
      whether reducing the propensity for thrombus formation and/or increasing fibrinolytic
      activity can prevent the progression of atherosclerosis and cognitive decline. These results
      will provide novel and important data that will be informative concerning primary prevention
      through the atherothrombotic pathway. Providing evidence for a reduction in atherosclerosis
      progression and cognitive decline with nattokinase is likely to shift the current clinical
      paradigm for the prevention of these chronic age-related processes. In addition, such
      evidence will serve to create a new field of discovery and opportunity for prevention of
      cardiovascular disease and dementia.

      Objectives and Hypotheses: The goal of the proposed study is to determine under randomized
      controlled trial (RCT) conditions whether nattokinase reduces subclinical atherosclerosis and
      cognitive decline in healthy women and men. The investigators' hypotheses are: 1) Compared to
      placebo, nattokinase will show less subclinical atherosclerosis progression and cognitive
      decline in healthy women and men; 2) The reduction in subclinical atherosclerosis progression
      and cognitive decline with nattokinase will be correlated; and, 3) The reduction in
      progression of subclinical atherosclerosis and cognitive decline with nattokinase will be
      mediated through hemostatic, fibrinolytic and hemorheological factors as well as attenuation
      of inflammation, monocyte activation, vascular endothelium injury and activation of vascular
      endothelium by circulating monocytes.

      Specific Aims: To conduct a RCT to determine the effect of nattokinase on the progression of
      subclinical atherosclerosis (primary trial end point) and cognitive decline (secondary trial
      end point). Healthy non-demented women and men &gt;55 years old without pre-existing symptomatic
      CVD and diabetes mellitus will be randomized over a 2 year period to oral nattokinase (2,000
      fibrinolysis units) daily versus placebo in this double-blind, placebo-controlled trial;
      randomized treatment will be 3-years. The following 5 major specific aims will be completed:

        1. To determine the effect of nattokinase on the progression of subclinical carotid artery
           atherosclerosis determined as the rate of change of the common carotid artery
           intima-media thickness (CIMT) and arterial stiffness in computer image processed B-mode
           ultrasonograms.

        2. To determine the effect of nattokinase on cognitive decline determined with a
           neuropsychological battery designed to evaluate 7 cognitive domains including:
           attention, concentration, working memory, executive function;
           visuospatial/visuoconstructive skills; naming/semantic memory; and verbal and nonverbal
           episodic memory.

      2a. To determine the effect of nattokinase on cognitive decline according to apolipoprotein
      (Apo) E e4 genotype.

      3. To determine the association of subclinical atherosclerosis progression with cognitive
      decline.

      4. To determine whether the effects of nattokinase on subclinical atherosclerosis and
      cognitive decline are mediated through hemostatic (fibrinogen, factor VIII, platelet
      activity), fibrinolytic (tPA, PAI-1, D-dimer), hemorheological (plasma and blood viscosity,
      red blood cell aggregation) and inflammatory (MCP-1, IL-8, TNFα, IL-1β, IL-10, monocyte cell
      surface markers CD11b/CD11c and VLA-4, expression of adhesion molecules VCAM-1 and ICAM-1 in
      cultured human aortic endothelial cells) factors as well as blood pressure.
