  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is one of the UKs commonest chronic diseases and
      is responsible for a significant number of acute hospital admissions. COPD is characterised
      by progressive destruction in the elastic tissue within the lung, causing respiratory
      failure. The clinical course of COPD is characterised by recurrent acute exacerbations
      (AECOPD), causing considerable morbidity and mortality. Patients with moderate to severe
      acute exacerbations present with increased work of breathing and hypercapnia. The standard
      for respiratory support in this setting is non-invasive ventilation (NIV), a management
      strategy underpinned by a considerable evidence base. However despite NIV, up to 30% of
      patients with AECOPD will 'fail' and require intubation and mechanical ventilation. The
      mortality rate for patients requiring NIV is approximately 4%, if conversion to mechanical
      ventilation occurs the mortality is 29%.

      The last decade has seen an increasing interest in the provision of extracorporeal support
      for respiratory failure. The key element that has underpinned improving survival has been
      technological advancement. This has resulted in pumps causing less blood trauma and
      inflammatory response, better percutaneous cannulation techniques and coated circuits with
      reduced heparin requirements. Overall this has significantly reduced the complications
      associated with the provision of extracorporeal support. One variation of this technique
      (extra-corporeal CO2 removal ECCO2R) allows CO2 clearance from the blood. This approach has
      been the subject of a number of animal experiments and uncontrolled human case series
      demonstrating improved arterial CO2 and reduced work of breathing. Our own unpublished series
      demonstrates the same physiological changes. However to date the benefits of this approach
      have not been tested in a randomised controlled trial.

      The hypothesis is that the addition of ECCO2R to NIV will shorten the duration of NIV and
      reduce likelihood of intubation.
