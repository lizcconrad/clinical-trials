      To evaluate the pharmacodynamics of a lower Ticagrelor dose in healthy Korean volunteers
      compared with standard Clopidogrel agent.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Consist with previous study Ticagrelor had greater, faster and more the platelet inhibition
      effect than Clopidogrel in both healthy subjects and stable coronary artery disease patients.
      Moreover, Asian subjects exposed higher active metabolite and stronger pharmacodynamics
      response than European subjects with same oral dose of antiplatelet agent. However, previous
      report comparing the efficacy and safety of Ticagrelor and Clopidogrel in healthy Asian
      ethnicity is lacking. Therefore, the aim of this study is to evaluate the pharmacodynamic
      responses of a lower Ticagrelor dose using laboratory platelet function tests in healthy
      Korean volunteers.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Platelet reactivity</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 122 hours</time_frame>
    <description>Platelet reactivity will be measured using multiple platelet function tests, including, light transmission aggregometry (LTA), multiple electrode platelet aggregometry (MEA, Dynabyte Medical, Munich, Germany), VerifyNow (Accumetrics, San Diego, CA, USA), Total thrombus-formation analysis system (T-TAS®, Fujimori Kogyo, Japan). The platelet reactivity will be measured at 0.5, 2, 6, 24,26,120,122 hours after study drug administration.
Percent inhibition is calculated using the following formula: % inhibition =[(baseline reactivity unit - gain(t) reactivity unit) / baseline reactivity unit] × 100.
Baseline reactivity unit is the value before Ticagrelor or Clopidogrel loading dose.
Gain(t) reactivity unit is the value for each subject at selected time points ( 0.5, 2, 6, 24,26,120,122 hours after study drug administration).</description>
