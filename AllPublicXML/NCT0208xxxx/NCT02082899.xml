      This is a Phase II Single Center, Randomized, Double-Masked, Vehicle-Controlled, Parallel,
      Group Study to Assess the Efficacy of EBI-005 Topical Ophthalmic Solution for the Treatment
      of Moderate to Severe Allergic Conjunctivitis Using an Environmental Exposure Chamber (EEC)
      Model and Conjunctival Allergen Provocation Test (CAPT) Model. Approximately 150 subjects
      will be enrolled and randomized in one study center in Canada for a duration of 0.33 years.

             temporal) in each eye and ≥ 2 for subject-assessed ocular itching within the 3.5-hour
             period of allergen exposure in the EEC at Visit 1B.

          -  Have required more than one anti-allergy pharmaceutical treatments in the past 2 years
             to treat ocular symptoms (including oral, topical, nasal treatments).

          -  Be able to self-administer topical ophthalmic drops.

          -  Avoid any topical or systemic ocular medications during the entire study period.

          -  Are willing and able to follow instructions and can be present for the required study
             visits for the duration of the study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

             participation in such a study within 30 days prior to study entry.

          -  Require concomitant use of TNF-blocking agents (e.g., Etanercept, Adalimumab,
             Infliximab).

          -  Have a history of glaucoma or intraocular pressure (IOP) &gt; 25 mmHg at the Visit 1A
