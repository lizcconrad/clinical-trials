    <textblock>
      The investigators plan to study inflammation in the brain (neuroinflammation) in human
      patients with epilepsy using a novel, non-invasive technique that has been proven successful
      in humans with other neuroinflammatory diseases. This technique uses ferumoxytol, a drug with
      minimal side effects that is FDA-approved for the treatment of iron deficiency anemia, as the
      contrast agent in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The study will recruit epilepsy patients
      who are admitted to Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center (DHMC) for
      video-electroencephalography (video-EEG) monitoring in order to evaluate their candidacy for
      curative brain surgery. During the hospital stay and after informed consent, the patient will
      receive a standard-dose intravenous injection of ferumoxytol, and undergo one session of MRI
      at 24-48 hours after the injection. The patient will also undergo a separate &quot;baseline&quot; MRI
      session (if not already done at DHMC) at admission or at more than four weeks after the
      injection but before any brain surgery. Brain regions that preferentially uptake ferumoxytol
      are localized by subtracting the post-injection MRI session from the &quot;baseline&quot; MRI session.
      The investigators will investigate whether these regions overlap with the epileptogenic
      focus, namely the region that generates epilepsy and is localized by video-EEG and other
      diagnostic measures. Lastly, for those patient participants who thereafter undergo brain
      surgery, DHMC neuropathologists will use special stains to detect and quantify
      neuroinflammation in brain tissue removed, and the results will serve as the reference for
      the investigators to measure the sensitivity and specificity of ferumoxytol-based MRI in
      detecting neuroinflammation.
