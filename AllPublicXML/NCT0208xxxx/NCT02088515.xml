    <textblock>
      The treatment of squamous cell carcinoma of lung has not improved suffuciently. Nedaplatin is
      a second-generation platinum compound that is more active against squamous cell carcinoma of
      the lung with a response rate of 60%, issued by the finished Phase II trial in Japan.
