  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Differentiated thyroid cancer includes papillary, follicular, Hurthle cell, and
      C-cell/medullary carcinoma. Even though incidence is relatively low (1% of all neoplasms), a
      rise in this disease has been recorded in the country (The Atlas of Cancer Mortality in
      Colombia, 2010).

      Although this disease has a low rate of attributable mortality, the costs arising from
      treatment, monitoring, and disabilities among affected patients and their families are high
      for the health system.

      The therapeutic approach to differentiated thyroid cancer once it starts progressing is
      limited; there are no truly favorable treatment options for patients with advanced thyroid
      cancer: available options include surgery, radiotherapy, and radioactive iodine therapy.

      Molecular biology now allows the identification of the effects of mutations and alterations
      in the proteins that participate in cell signaling which account for dedifferentiation,
      invasiveness, and the progression of neoplastic cells.

      VEGFR (vascular endothelial growth factor receptor) is one of the main molecules to be
      addressed by targeted molecular therapy. Its increased expression in differentiated thyroid
      cancer has been demonstrated and has been associated with increased growth, invasiveness, and
      shorter recurrence-free survival.

      Different agents are effective against this tyrosine kinase receptor; nevertheless, taking
      into account that it is not solely responsible for tumor progression, according to clinical
      study results, it is more reasonable to use non-selective tyrosine kinase inhibitors such as
      sorafenib and motesanib. These inhibitors have already been tested in phase II studies.

      Results from recent phase II research studies using these emerging treatment options have
      shown important effects in the therapeutic approach to other solid neoplasms.

      Information about the safety of this type of treatment is limited; a need for information
      regarding the use of new therapeutic approaches in Colombia is one of the contributions that
      the National Institute of Cancer can make to the country through this study.

      Objective:

      Determine the clinical efficacy and safety profile of sorafenib in the treatment of patients
      with advanced thyroid cancer (metastatic or recurrent) in a 24 months follow up period.

      Analysis plan The analysis plan includes the description of clinical and epidemiological
      characteristics of recruited patients at the end of the first year and the before and after
      comparison from clinical response according to RECIST criteria. At the end of the first and
      second follow-up years, analyses will be performed. In each of these, the response of
      patients by outcomes of interest measured at specific monitoring times will be evaluated.

      Parametric and non-parametric descriptive statistics will be used as necessary; the
      comparison of some variables between baseline measurements and follow-up predetermined
      cut-offs will be performed while taking into account the lack of independence between
      observations. Analysis of qualitative variables will be performed using McNemar's Test and
      the analysis of quantitative variables using the Paired Student's t-Test or Wilcoxon Test
      depending on the normality of the distribution

      Descriptive statistics will be used for time until events, survival curve and
      progression-free time median will be stated. Correlation studies between some indicators,
      clinical variables, and observed outcomes using parametric and non-parametric coefficients
      will be performed. Interobserver agreement will be evaluated for the reading of diagnostic
      images using a Kappa coefficient.
