    <textblock>
      The primary objectives of the study are to explore the effect of treatment with orally
      inhaled tiotropium + olodaterol fixed dose combination with and without exercise training,
      and tiotropium comparing to placebo, on top of behavioural modification in improving exercise
      capacity in patients with COPD

    <measure>Endurance Time During Endurance Shuttle Walk Test (ESWT) to Symptom Limitation After 8 Weeks</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 8</time_frame>
    <description>Endurance time during ESWT to symptom limitation at walking speed corresponding to 85% of predicted maximum oxygen consumption (VO2 peak) after 8 weeks of pharmacological treatment and non-pharmacological intervention. The numerical value of endurance time in seconds was transformed in log10 scale to correct for skewness and then an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) was fitted to the log10-transformed data and the least square means (LSMean) and standard error (SE) were obtained. To present the results in a way easier for interpretation, the least square mean from the ANCOVA fitted to the log10-transformed data were transformed back taking 10 to the power of the least square estimate to obtain the geometric mean and the corresponding SE was transformed using delta method to get the corresponding SE of the geometric mean.</description>

    <measure>Average Daily Walking Intensity Measured by the Activity Monitor in the Week Prior to 12 Weeks of Treatment</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>Average daily walking intensity measured by the activity monitor in the week prior to 12 weeks of treatment. The Movement Intensity (MI) is derived from the acceleration signals. Since seismic sensors measure gravitational acceleration (g) in static situations, the acceleration signal is expressed relative to g (1g = 9.81m/s2). To calculate movement intensity (MI) the gravitational acceleration in static situations was removed and the rotation vector of the three accelerometer signals was calculated. The MI gives an indication of the power of movements.</description>

    <measure>Perceived Difficulties as Evaluated With Functional Performance Inventory-Short Form (FPI-SF) Total Score at Week 12</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>Perceived difficulties as evaluated with FPI-SF. FPI-SF self-report questionnaire has 6 domains: Body care(5 items), Household maintenance(8 items), Physical exercise(5 items), Recreation(5 items), Spiritual activities(4 items) and Social interaction(5 items) with five possible answers on each item: Do with no difficulty - 3, Do with some difficulty - 2, Do with great difficulty - 1, don't do because of health reasons - 0, and don't do because choose not to - 0. Domain scores are expressed as mean values, with at least 6 non-missing items required for the household maintenance domain and at least 3 non-missing items for the other domains. Total score is the mean across the six domains. So total and domain scores range from 0 to 3, with higher scores indicating higher levels of functional activity within and across domains. Respondents engaged in many activities with no difficulty will score high on the FPI, while those who perform few activities with much difficulty will score low.</description>

        <title>Endurance Time During Endurance Shuttle Walk Test (ESWT) to Symptom Limitation After 8 Weeks</title>
        <description>Endurance time during ESWT to symptom limitation at walking speed corresponding to 85% of predicted maximum oxygen consumption (VO2 peak) after 8 weeks of pharmacological treatment and non-pharmacological intervention. The numerical value of endurance time in seconds was transformed in log10 scale to correct for skewness and then an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) was fitted to the log10-transformed data and the least square means (LSMean) and standard error (SE) were obtained. To present the results in a way easier for interpretation, the least square mean from the ANCOVA fitted to the log10-transformed data were transformed back taking 10 to the power of the least square estimate to obtain the geometric mean and the corresponding SE was transformed using delta method to get the corresponding SE of the geometric mean.</description>

        <title>Average Daily Walking Intensity Measured by the Activity Monitor in the Week Prior to 12 Weeks of Treatment</title>
        <description>Average daily walking intensity measured by the activity monitor in the week prior to 12 weeks of treatment. The Movement Intensity (MI) is derived from the acceleration signals. Since seismic sensors measure gravitational acceleration (g) in static situations, the acceleration signal is expressed relative to g (1g = 9.81m/s2). To calculate movement intensity (MI) the gravitational acceleration in static situations was removed and the rotation vector of the three accelerometer signals was calculated. The MI gives an indication of the power of movements.</description>

          <title>Average Daily Walking Intensity Measured by the Activity Monitor in the Week Prior to 12 Weeks of Treatment</title>
          <description>Average daily walking intensity measured by the activity monitor in the week prior to 12 weeks of treatment. The Movement Intensity (MI) is derived from the acceleration signals. Since seismic sensors measure gravitational acceleration (g) in static situations, the acceleration signal is expressed relative to g (1g = 9.81m/s2). To calculate movement intensity (MI) the gravitational acceleration in static situations was removed and the rotation vector of the three accelerometer signals was calculated. The MI gives an indication of the power of movements.</description>

        <description>Perceived difficulties as evaluated with FPI-SF. FPI-SF self-report questionnaire has 6 domains: Body care(5 items), Household maintenance(8 items), Physical exercise(5 items), Recreation(5 items), Spiritual activities(4 items) and Social interaction(5 items) with five possible answers on each item: Do with no difficulty - 3, Do with some difficulty - 2, Do with great difficulty - 1, don’t do because of health reasons - 0, and don’t do because choose not to - 0. Domain scores are expressed as mean values, with at least 6 non-missing items required for the household maintenance domain and at least 3 non-missing items for the other domains. Total score is the mean across the six domains. So total and domain scores range from 0 to 3, with higher scores indicating higher levels of functional activity within and across domains. Respondents engaged in many activities with no difficulty will score high on the FPI, while those who perform few activities with much difficulty will score low.</description>

        <title>Endurance Time During Endurance Shuttle Walk Test (ESWT) to Symptom Limitation After 12 Weeks</title>
        <description>Endurance time during ESWT to symptom limitation at walking speed corresponding to 85% of maximum oxygen consumption (VO2 peak) after 12 weeks of pharmacological treatment and non-pharmacological intervention. The numerical value of endurance time in seconds was transformed in log10 scale to correct for skewness and then the ANCOVA was fitted to the log10-transformed data and the least square means and SE were obtained. To present the results in a way easier for interpretation, the least square mean from the ANCOVA fitted to the log10-transformed data were transformed back taking 10 to the power of the least square estimate to obtain the geometric mean and the corresponding SE was transformed using delta method to get the corresponding SE of the geometric mean.</description>
