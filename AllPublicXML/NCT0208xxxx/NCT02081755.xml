  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a prospective Phase IV study to determine if the use of Everolimus results in
      lower liver tumor recurrence and improved patient and graft survival after liver transplant
      for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The immunosuppressive comparators will be Everolimus and
      Tacrolimus therapy compared to Tacrolimus and Mycophenolic acid/Mycophenolate Mofetil.
      Primary outcomes data is disease free survival (the time from randomization to HCC recurrence
      or death). Secondary outcomes are rate of recurrence of Hepatitis C, problems related to
      wound healing, hernia repair within the first 12 months, hepatic arterial thrombosis, renal
      function, acute cellular rejection, post-transplant diabetes, hypertension, and
      hyperlipidemia.

  <detailed_description>

      The study population will consist of approximately 336 patients (224 Everolimus and
      Tacrolimus and 112 Tacrolimus and Mycophenolic acid/Mycophenolate Mofetil). Initial screening
      criteria will includethe presence of hepatocellular carcinoma in the explant as determ
      patients 18 years or older who are candidates to receive a primary orthotopic liver
      transplant (from deceased or living donor). Within 7 - 12 days post-transplant, patients will
      be re-evaluated for eligibility for randomization. The criteria include: pre-transplant
      imaging that shows HCC disease exceeding Milan criteria; pathology review for tumor burden
      and/or presence of microvascular invasion; AFP &gt;200IU/mL; pre-transplant ablation or
      resection with HCC recurrence; progression or new tumors; evaluation to rule out any hepatic
      vessel complication.

      Subjects will remain in study treatment until Month 12 at which time the subject and
      investigator will determine the preferred immunosuppressive regimen. Subjects will be
      followed for an additional 24 months for outcome data as described above.
