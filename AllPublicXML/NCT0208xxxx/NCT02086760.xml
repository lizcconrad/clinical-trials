    <textblock>
      Diagnosis and follow up of hydronephrosis is actually based on repeat ultrasonography and
      scintigraphy wich is a binding exam for children. We wanted to evaluate the use of
      ultrasonography sensibilized by an oral hydration and to determine its efficiency to detect
      which hydronephrosis need a surgery or not.

    <description>The primary outcome measure is a composite outcome measure consisting of multiple measures.
Indeed, the treating surgeon will make a decision (ie to operate or not) upon the clinical exam, ultrasonography with oral hydratation and scintigraphy results. The independent surgeon will only be given data from the clinical exam and the ultrasonography. For ultrasonography, the following parameters will be measured: cortical thickness, anteroposterior renal pelvis diameter, calyx diameter, kidney echogenicity, kidney size.
The measures will be done before, 30 min and 90 min following oral hydration.
For scintigraphy, the relative kidney function, T1/2, Tmax and NORA will be analyzed.
The result will be reported as a single value, ie:
the treating surgeon's decision and the independent surgeon's decision are similar (=1) or
the treating surgeon's decision and the independent surgeon's decision are not similar (=0)</description>

    <description>The secondary outcome measure is a composite outcome measure consisting of multiple measures.
Indeed, the treating surgeon will make a decision (ie to operate or not) upon the clinical exam, ultrasonography with oral hydration and scintigraphy results. The independent surgeon will only be given data from the clinical exam and the ultrasonography with oral hydration, he will make a decision aposteriori.
For ultrasonography, the following parameters will be measured: cortical thickness, anteroposterior renal pelvis diameter, calyx diameter, kidney echogenicity, kidney size.
