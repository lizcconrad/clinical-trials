  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare the efficacy between a Pilates exercise program and a
      Pelvic Floor Muscle Training (PFMT) protocol combined with anal electrical stimulation (AES)
      in the recovery of urinary continence (UI) after radical prostatectomy.

      There are no studies that evaluate Pilates mat exercises for incontinence in men although it
      can be assured that this method has the pelvic floor contractions as a principle for
      practice. If this new therapeutic approach proves to be as effective as described treatment
      in improving urinary complaints, it will be an option for patients who prefer a non-invasive
      treatment.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This randomized clinical trial includes 69 individuals with urinary incontinence one month
      after radical prostatectomy. One physiotherapist, with experience in urogynecology, was
      responsible for all the assessments. Urinary frequency, nocturia, 24-hour pad test, number of
      pads used per day, and the International Consultation on Incontinence Questionnaire - Short
      Form (ICIQ-SF) were the variables evaluated.

      The subjects were allocated in one of two treatment groups (G1: Pilates; G2: anal electrical
      stimulation combined with pelvic floor muscle training). Volunteers participated of 10
      sessions of the corresponding treatment and were reassessed objectively by the number of pads
      used per day, and subjectively with the score of quality of life.
