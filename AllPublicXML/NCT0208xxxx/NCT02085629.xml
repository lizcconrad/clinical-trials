  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To collect evidence of the safety of administering donor-derived regulatory macrophage (M
      reg) preparations to living-donor renal transplant recipients in the context of an
      international European Union funded consortium aimed at evaluating cellular immunotherapy in
      solid organ transplantation (The ONE Study). It is anticipated that immune regulation induced
      by M reg therapy can eventually be used to reduce the need for conventional immunosuppression
      in transplant recipients.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Decades of immunosuppressive drug development has produced an array of powerful
      pharmacological agents, but the various drawbacks associated with these treatments leaves
      considerable room for improvement. By harnessing the power of suppressive mechanisms in the
      human immune system, regulatory cell therapy may be able to support peripheral tolerance and
      induce a level of donor-specific unresponsiveness that allows for a reduction in the use of
      conventional immunosuppression in organ transplant recipients. Several alternative regulatory
      cell types have been identified as potential adjunct immunotherapies for solid organ
      transplantation and are now approaching a stage of development that would allow clinical
      testing in an early-stage trial. The EU-funded international ONE Study consortium aims to
      answer the question as to whether M reg treatment, or other immunoregulatory cell-based
      therapies, can be advanced in the clinical management of solid organ transplant recipients.

      This particular M reg trial aims to explore the potential of M reg therapy as an adjunct
      immunosuppressive treatment in living-donor renal transplant recipients through a clinical
      protocol design shared by other investigators in The ONE Study group testing additional
      regulatory cell therapies in separate trials.
