      The purpose of this pilot trial is to determine the safety and feasibility of using oral salt
      and water loading compared to intravenous saline for the prevention of contrast-induced acute
      kidney injury in patients with chronic kidney disease receiving a contrast-enhanced CT scan.

      Background: Intravenous saline is the accepted prophylactic measure for prevention of
      contrast-induced acute kidney injury. However, most trials for contrast nephropathy
      prevention have been in the setting of arterial contrast, such as with cardiac
      catheterization, and not with venous contrast, such as computed tomography (CT). There is
      insufficient data on effective prophylactic strategies to prevent acute kidney injury (AKI)
      following contrast-enhanced CT scans.

      Objective: The primary aim of this pilot trial is to determine the safety and feasibility of
      using oral salt and water loading compared to intravenous saline for the prevention of
      contrast-induced acute kidney injury in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) receiving
      a contrast-enhanced CT scan of the chest or abdomen. The results of the pilot trial will help
      us to plan and carry out a definitive efficacy trial to compare the two interventions.

      Design: A randomized controlled trial with two parallel arms.

      Study Population: 50 patients with chronic kidney disease (eGFR &lt; 45 mL/min/1.73m2) who are
      undergoing a contrast-enhanced CT scan.

      Intervention: Participants will be randomly allocated to receive either intravenous saline or
      oral salt and water loading. All participants will be administered an intravenous low-osmolar
      contrast medium as per recommended guidelines.

      Relevance: The results of this pilot trial will provide critical information to plan a
      definitive trial to test the efficacy of volume loading regimens to prevent acute kidney
      injury after contrast-enhanced CT scans. The current standard of care for chronic kidney
      disease patients who have contrast-enhanced CT scans is intravenous saline. This regimen
      requires significant health care resources as it requires a same-day hospital stay, nursing
      time as well as patient inconvenience. If the results of this study show that oral salt
      loading is effective as the standard intravenous saline, it would result in a significant
      reduction in the use of these resources. Given the large volume of CT scans performed in
      Canada and worldwide, this will result in a substantial cost savings to the healthcare
      system. We have established a network with acute kidney injury researchers at four other
      large academic health organizations across Canada in preparation for a definitive trial.

    <description>The primary outcome for this pilot trial is feasibility (recruitment rate, adherence to intervention and completeness of follow-up).
We will aim to establish that
We can randomize 50 patients into this trial;
Trial participants have &gt;95% adherence to the fluid regimens and
After randomization, &lt;1% participants are lost to follow-up in terms of post-CT serum creatinine measurements.</description>

    <description>Oral Salt and Water Loading:
Participants randomized to this arm of the trial will receive 0.1 g/kg of salt (NaCl) and 12 mL/kg of water. Patients weighing more than 110 kg will receive the same amount as per a 110 kg patient. One third of the oral salt and water will be given before the CT and 2/3 post-CT as in the intravenous saline arm. Specifically, 0.03 g/kg of NaCl and 4 mL/kg of water in the one hour before CT and 0.07 g/kg of NaCl and 8 mL/kg of water taken over 2 hours post-CT. The ingestion of the oral salt and water will be directly observed by the study nurse to ensure adherence to the protocol.</description>

    <description>Patients randomized to this arm will receive intravenous isotonic (0.9%) saline.
