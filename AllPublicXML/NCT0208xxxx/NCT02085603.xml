  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed to assess whether a drug called Saracatinib is helpful in controlling
      bone pain from cancer. The investigators do not know if it will be, so half of the patients
      in the study will receive the drug and half will get placebo. Saracatinib is a drug that has
      been tried in patients with many different forms of cancer. It seems to have effects in bone
      and so the investigators hope that it will have an effect in those with cancer that has
      spread to the bones.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Controlling cancer pain in cancer patients can be very difficult as not all cancers respond
      to radiotherapy or chemotherapy and sometimes the sideeffects of strong painkillers, like
      morphine, can limit the dose of drug that can be given. The investigators have some evidence
      that a molecule called Src is involved in the development of cancer-induced bone pain. This
      study will use a drug, saracatinib that targets Src and will see if giving it to patients can
      reduce pain from cancer in the bones. The investigators will compare saracatinib to a placebo
      over a 4 week period in an estimated 62 patients. The investigators will measure whether the
      pain that patients report is less with saracatinib than placebo. The investigators will also
      measure how many painkillers people are taking before and after saracatinib/placebo, if pain
      thresholds have changed, if pain-related symptoms and quality of life have been improved and
      if saracatinib has a direct effect on the rate at which cancer breaks down bone.
