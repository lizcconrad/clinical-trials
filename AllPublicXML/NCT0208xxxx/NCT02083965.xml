  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of the study is to characterize the pharmacokinetics (PK) of rFVIIIFc
      administered at vial strengths of 1000 and 3000 IU in subjects with severe hemophilia A. The
      secondary objective of the study is to evaluate the safety of rFVIIIFc beyond the PK
      assessment for up to 6 months for a continued treatment period.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, open-label, crossover study during which each participant receives a
      single injection of rFVIIIFc from 2 different vial concentrations (PK assessment). After the
      PK assessment, participants are provided with rFVIIIFc for either prophylactic or episodic
      (on-demand) treatment for up to 6 months.

    <description>An inhibitor test result ≥0.6 Bethesda units (BU)/mL, confirmed on 2 separate samples drawn 2 to 4 weeks apart, was considered positive.

        Key Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Have severe hemophilia A

          -  Previously treated subject, defined as having at least 150 documented prior exposure
             days to any recombinant and/or plasma-derived FVIII and/or cryoprecipitate products
             (other than any use of rFVIIIFc- study drug or commercial product) at Day 1. Fresh
             frozen plasma treatment must not be considered in the count for documented exposure
             days.

          -  No history of a positive inhibitor test or clinical signs of decreased response to
             FVIII administrations. Family history of inhibitors will not exclude subjects.

          -  No measurable inhibitor activity using the Nijmegen-modified Bethesda assay at
             Screening.

          -  Platelet count ≥100,000 platelets/μL at screening

          -  CD4 lymphocytes &gt;200 mm3 if known as HIV antibody positive at screening.

          -  Viral load of &lt;400 copies/mL if known HIV antibody positive at screening.

        Key Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subject is at high risk of bleeding during the 5-day period between the first and
             second injections for PK analyses, as per Investigator discretion.

          -  Previous treatment with rFVIIIFc as study drug or commercial product.

          -  Other coagulation disorder(s) in addition to hemophilia A.

          -  History of hypersensitivity or anaphylaxis associated with any FVIII or IV
             immunoglobulin administration.

          -  Currently taking (or likely to require during the study) acetylsalicylic acid (ASA),
             except for low-dose ASA as prophylaxis (other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs are
             permitted).

          -  Concurrent systemic treatment with immunosuppressive drugs within 12 weeks prior to
             Day 1. Exceptions to this include: ribavirin for treatment of hepatitis C virus (HCV),
             and/or systemic steroids (a total of 2 courses of pulse treatments lasting no more
             than 7 days at a dose of ≤1 mg/kg within 12 weeks prior to Day 1) and/or inhaled
             steroids.

          <description>Following a minimum 4-day washout, participants received a single injection 50 IU/kg at strength of 1000 IU/vial of rFVIIIFc (on Injection 1 Day 1) with 96 hours of pharmacokinetic (PK) assessments followed by a minimum of a 5-day washout prior to a second single injection of rFVIIIFc 50 IU/kg at strength of 3000 IU/vial (on Injection 2 Day 1) with 96 hours of PK assessments.
After completing the PK assessment, all participants began 1 of 3 continued treatment regimens for up to 6 months:
A prophylaxis regimen at a starting dose of 50 IU/kg of rFVIIIFc given every 3 to 5 days; further dose and interval adjustments were based on the Investigator’s discretion as needed to prevent or treat bleeding.
A prophylaxis regimen of 65 IU/kg administered every 7 days was considered for appropriate subjects who were selected based on the opinion of the Investigator.
An episodic (on-demand) treatment with rFVIIIFc at 20 to 50 IU/kg, depending on the severity of the bleeding episode.</description>

Both tests were to be performed by the central laboratory using the Nijmegen-modified Bethesda Assay.
