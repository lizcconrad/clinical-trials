  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Prevention of physical disability represents a major priority for the public health system.
      Physical disability is the final result of a complex cascade of negative events occurring at
      different levels (i.e., environmental, social, biological, and clinical). The heterogeneity
      of the underlying mechanisms responsible for the onset of physical disability may require the
      adoption of preventive interventions affecting multiple domains. Although several studies
      suggest that single or different combinations of preventive interventions (in particular,
      physical activity, cognitive training, and healthy diet) might provide beneficial effects in
      preventing functional loss (and its related features, such as pain or reduced quality of
      life), very limited evidence coming from clinical trials is currently available on the topic.
      Intervention trials are usually designed to test the effect of a specific monodimensional
      intervention on a very selected population, so to reduce the risk of biased results. This
      approach, although legitimate and methodologically correct, may 1) be insufficient to target
      the multiple and heterogeneous physiopathological mechanisms underlying the onset of physical
      disability, and 2) cause a population selection bias leading to difficulties in implementing
      the study results to the overall older population (thus, determining the &quot;evidence-based
      medicine&quot; issue in the elderly). To our knowledge, there are no available data from clinical
      trials evaluating the effects of a multidomain intervention based on lifestyle modifications
      (e.g., physical activity, cognitive training, nutritional modification) for preventing
      mobility disability (a very early phase of the disabling process) in community-dwelling older
      persons. In the present project (Multidomain Intervention to preveNt Disability in ElDers,
      MINDED), we propose to conduct a pilot study aimed at estimating the effects of a multidomain
      person-tailored preventive intervention (based on physical activity, cognitive training, and
      nutritional modifications) on frailty status, physical performance, cognitive function,
      nutritional status, health-related quality of life, and use of health care services. In
      addition, we will perform cost-effectiveness analyses of the proposed intervention. The
      project will yield the necessary preliminary data to design a definitive full-scale Phase 3
      randomized clinical trial. By providing a conclusive answer about the effectiveness of a
      multidimensional preventive program in the primary prevention of major health-related
      outcomes, the results of the full-scale trial will have relevant clinical and public health
      implications, and will promote the practicing of a truly evidence-based geriatric medicine.
