  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Psychosocial stress increases the risk for a multitude of diseases, including obesity,
      hypertension, and cardiovascular disease. Stress may also result in increased utilization of
      health care services. In the workplace, stress leads to emotional exhaustion, job
      dissatisfaction, lower productivity and impaired performance. Stress management programs and
      those based on mindfulness meditation have gained popularity in recent years. The purpose of
      this study is to evaluate the feasibility of an 8-week web-based mindfulness stress reduction
      program and its effectiveness in reducing work related stress and improving well-being in a
      large corporate call center.
