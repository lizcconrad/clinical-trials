  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to describe and compare the different types of diabetes that
      exist in people from white European and south Asian origin in the UK (United Kingdom) who are
      diagnosed with diabetes before they turn 30 years old. By doing this we hope to identify
      cases of MODY (maturity onset diabetes of the young), which is a rare genetic cause of
      diabetes that is frequently misdiagnosed. Identifying MODY cases is important, as the
      treatment may differ to conventional treatment for type 1 or type 2 diabetes.

      People who meet the recruitment criteria, will be invited to attend for a single fasted 2
      hour visit at our research facility. During the visit we will record details of their
      diabetes history as well as their general health and undertake blood and urine tests. At the
      end of the visit their participation will be complete. We will contact them later to discuss
      results of specialist blood tests and whether or not they have MODY, if they have had genetic
      testing performed.

      We will be collecting blood and urine samples for routine diabetes tests as well as more
      specialist tests that will help define what type of diabetes is present. We'll also collect
      DNA to look for MODY (maturity onset diabetes of the young), the genetic cause of diabetes,
      in some people.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Diagnosed with diabetes on the basis of fasting glucose and/or oral glucose tolerance
             test and/or HbA1c as per WHO criteria.

          -  Diagnosed with diabetes between 6 months and 30 years of age.

          -  South Asian ancestry- defined as self-reported ancestry and at least 2 grandparents
             from the Indian Subcontinent (India, Pakistan, Bangladesh or Sri Lanka).

             within Europe.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  An established secondary cause of diabetes exists (for example recurrent pancreatitis,
             pancreatectomy, new onset diabetes after transplantation, Cushing's syndrome,
             acromegaly, steroid induced).

          -  Enrolled in another study.
