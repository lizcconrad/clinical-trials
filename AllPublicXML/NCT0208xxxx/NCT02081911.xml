  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate whether there is quantitative motor-sparing of
      the quadriceps muscles following adductor canal nerve block versus femoral nerve block.
      Patients will be randomly placed into one of three treatment groups: 1) Femoral nerve block,
      2) Adductor canal nerve block - low volume, or 3) Adductor canal nerve block - high volume.
      Quadriceps function will be assessed in the operating room using a skin patch and electrical
      stimulation. Follow up visits with the patients will continue over the course of 2 days
      during patient's stay at the hospital. A total of 60 patients will be enrolled for the study.

    <measure>Quadriceps function as assessed by non-invasive transcutaneous nerve stimulation of the femoral nerve</measure>
    <time_frame>15 minutes after the placement of the peripheral nerve block (femoral or adductor canal)</time_frame>
    <description>After CSE effect, but prior to peripheral block, quadriceps function will be assessed by non-invasive transcutaneous nerve stimulation of the femoral nerve by placing an ECG electrode over the femoral location (determined by U/S) in the inguinal groove. The threshold amperage that produces patellar motion in response to electrical stimulation will be recorded. This threshold amperage will serve as a baseline value. Following the peripheral nerve block, transcutaneous stimulation will be repeated and, if still possible to elicit quadriceps contractions in response to electrical stimulation, the resulting new threshold amperage will be measured. The new threshold amperage will be expressed as a percentage of the baseline value and serve as a quantitative functional indication of the extent of quadriceps paresis resulting from the peripheral nerve block. The primary outcome will be quadriceps paralysis - yes/no.</description>
