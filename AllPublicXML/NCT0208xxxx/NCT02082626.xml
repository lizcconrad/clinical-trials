  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a study for children with cancer with no curative treatment options. The
      investigators will be giving eribulin, a new chemotherapy agent, for the first time to
      children. This study is designed to determine a safe dose the investigators can give to
      children in larger studies. The investigators will be monitoring the children on this study
      for the safety of the treatment and levels of eribulin in the blood after treatment. The
      investigators will also study the effect of the agent on the cancer.

    <textblock>
      This is a phase I study of eribulin, a novel tubulin inhibitor in children with relapsed and
      refractory solid tumors including lymphoma. Dose escalation will be performed in a classic
      3+3 design starting with 75% of the adult maximum tolerated dose (MTD). Pharmacokinetics will
      be done on each patient. Primary endpoint will be the pediatric MTD.
