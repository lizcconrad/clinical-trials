    <textblock>
      Candidemia has emerged as an important cause of hospital-associated blood-stream infection in
      children. The purpose of this study was to identify differences in distribution of candida
      species, risk factors, treatment, and clinical outcome of candidemia in children. This study
      in children â‰¤18 years with blood culture proven candidemia identified between 2004 and 2012.
      Analyses included the determination of causative candida species, resistance to antifungals
      and clinical outcome, as well as the identification of potential risk factors associated with
      candidemia.

    <description>The presence or absence of potential risk factors for candidemia such as an indwelling central venous catheter (CVC), use of antibiotics (administered for &gt;72 hours), use of antifungals (administered for &gt;24 hours), immunosuppressants, total parenteral nutrition (TPN), admission to the intensive care unit (ICU), mechanical ventilation, neutropenia, hypoalbuminemia and hypophosphatemia.</description>

    <time_frame>up to 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>Death which ensues within 30 days of the onset of candidemia with no apparent alternative cause is recognized as a candidemia-attributable mortality. Patients who died and survived were compared according to candida species (C.albicans, C. parapsilosis, C. tropicalis, C. sake, C.glabrata).</description>
