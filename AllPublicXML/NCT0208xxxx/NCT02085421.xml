  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The proposed pilot study is a randomized controlled study to assess effectiveness of
      transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) to enhance cognitive remediation therapy in
      patients with psychotic disorders. tDCS. Patients will be randomized into two arms: active
      tDCS vs. sham tDCS. The active tDCS will be applied at a current of 1-2 mA (milliamperes) via
      two saline soaked electrode sponges (3 cm x 4.5 cm) applied to the side of the head. The
      investigators hypothesis is that the use of tDCS will enhance the improvement seen with
      cognitive remediation therapy.

    <textblock>
      The proposed pilot study is a randomized controlled study to assess effectiveness of tDCS to
      enhance cognitive remediation therapy in patients with psychotic disorders. All patients will
      participate in cognitive remediation therapy (CRT). After initial consent form has been
      signed, all participants will undergo Matrics Consensus Cognitive Battery (MCCB) testing,
      Wechsler IQ (Intelligence Quotient) testing, and UPSA evaluation. Participants will then
      complete 3 CRT sessions per week, each lasting one hour, for a total of 12 weeks. The CRT
      will use a commercially available CRT software system such as Cogpack marker software as used
      by Haut et al, Lumosity or the PositScience software package. Each CRT session involves an
      in-session assessment of skill acquisition, as collected by commercially available CRT
      software. At the completion of each hour long CRT session, participants will also complete an
      n-back assessment. N-back testing will be run using software package E Prime (Psychology
      Software Tools).

      Patients will be randomized into two arms: active tDCS vs. sham tDCS. The tDCS will be
      applied at a current of 1-2mA via two saline soaked electrode sponges (3 cm x 4.5 cm) each
      CRT session. The anode will be placed over left DLPFC (dorsolateral prefrontal cortex) at F3,
      according to the 10-20 international system for EEG electrode placement. The cathode will be
      placed over the contralateral supraorbital area. This placement is consistent with previous
      protocols targeting working memory. Both active and sham conditions will have identical
      electrode placement.

      After electrodes have been placed, the participants will be instructed to log into CRT
      software using a unique patient identifier. Once logged in to CRT software they will be
      instructed to begin the session.

      The tDCS will be applied at a current of 1-2mA via two saline soaked electrode sponges (3 cm
      x 4.5 cm) for the first 15 minutes of each CRT session in the active condition. In the sham
      condition, tDCS will be ramped up to 1-2 mA via two saline soaked electrode sponges (3 cm x
      4.5 cm) over the first 30 seconds of each CRT session and then turned off.

      Participants will complete the hour long CRT session. The software program instruct patient
      when the end of the session has been reached. At the end of each CRT session, the patient
      will then be instructed to complete an N-back assessment, run by E Prime software.

      At the completion of the 12 weeks of CRT and active vs sham tDCS patients will repeat the
      UPSA and MCCB. Patients will also be asked to return for MCCB and UPSA testing at 3, 6 and 12
      month follow up.

      The time commitment of each generally CRT + n-back testing session will be approximately 90
      minute. Additionally MCCB and UPSA testing will comprise a total of 6.5 hours. IQ testing
      will comprise approximately 1 hour of testing time. The total time commitment will consist of
      approximately 61.5 hours.

    <description>The MATRICS Consensus Cognitive Battery (MCCB) is a standardized battery for use with adults with schizophrenia and related disorders. Advancements in the past decade suggest that there may be opportunities for developing effective medications for improving cognition in people with schizophrenia. The MCCB was developed to help researchers and clinicians measure cognition in individuals who have been diagnosed with schizophrenia and related disorders, and contribute to the development of these types of medications. It is the only measure of cognitive performance that was developed under a national institute of mental health (NIMH) contract with participation from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. Therefore, it is recommended for all clinical trials of cognition-enhancing drugs for schizophrenia.</description>
