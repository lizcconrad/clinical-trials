    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to measure the effectiveness of a wearable therapeutic
      ultrasound device in patients with stage I and stage II knee osteoarthritis. The ability of
      the device to reduce pain, increase mobility, increase range of motion and muscle strength of
      the affected leg, and improve quality of life in patients with knee osteoarthritis will be
      evaluated.

    <textblock>
      This is an eight week study to clinically evaluate the effect of the low intensity long
      duration ultrasound (LITUS) device on symptoms of patients suffering from knee
      osteoarthritis. The device, samÂ® has been FDA-cleared for use. For the first two weeks of the
      study, baseline data will be collected as patients report pain scores (NRS) three times per
      day. During the following 6 weeks, patients will self-apply the wearable LITUS device to
      their affected knee for 4 hours daily. Each day of the study, pain scores (NRS) will be
      recorded immediately before application of LITUS device as well as 30 minutes, 2-hours and
      4-hours after applying the device. A quality of life assessment (WOMAC), muscle strength and
      range of motion assessment (JTech) will be performed prior to the patient beginning the
      protocol and at the conclusion of the protocol.

      Up to 93 subjects will be recruited from neighboring communities to the study site. The study
      is designed to reach a target patient population which includes rural citizens and
      socioeconomic disadvantaged individuals where non-pharmacotherapies do not exist to manage
      pain. Subjects will be randomly assigned to active (60%) and placebo groups (40%). The
      sponsor and investigators are blinded as to which type of device each patient is assigned.

      The study will be monitored by an external monitor and a data safety monitoring board (DSMB).

    <measure>Pain on the Numeric Rating Scale (NRS) Change From Baseline to Study Conclusion</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 6</time_frame>
    <description>The numeric rating scale (NRS) was used to assess change in pain from baseline to study conclusion. NRS range from 0-10 with 0 being no pain and 10 the worst pain possible.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Quality of Life (WOMAC) Change From Baseline</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 6</time_frame>
    <description>WOMAC questionnaire will be utilized (Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Arthritis Index). WOMAC was divided into 3 categories: pain, stiffness, function and total score. The pain category consists of five scores from 0-10, 0 is no pain 10 is worst pain possible for a range of 0 - 50 points. The stiffness category consists of two scores from 0-10, 0 is no stiffness 10 is worst stiffness possible for a range of 0 - 20 points. The function score consists of 17 scores from 0-10, 0 is normal function and 10 is severely limited function, for a range of 0 - 170 points. Categories were multiplied by 10 for analysis. Total score is the sum of pain, stiffness, and function scores (range of 0 - 2400).</description>

    <measure>Range of Motion Change From Baseline in Treated Knee</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 6</time_frame>
    <description>JTech equipment was used to evaluate range of motion range of motion using an inclinometer (www.jtechmedical.com) in flexion and extension of the treated knee. 0 degrees is fully extended and 150 degrees is normal flexion. Positive flexion change indicates improvement in flexion. Negative extension indicates improvement in extension.</description>

        <description>WOMAC questionnaire will be utilized (Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Arthritis Index). WOMAC was divided into 3 categories: pain, stiffness, function and total score. The pain category consists of five scores from 0-10, 0 is no pain 10 is worst pain possible for a range of 0 - 50 points. The stiffness category consists of two scores from 0-10, 0 is no stiffness 10 is worst stiffness possible for a range of 0 - 20 points. The function score consists of 17 scores from 0-10, 0 is normal function and 10 is severely limited function, for a range of 0 - 170 points. Categories were multiplied by 10 for analysis. Total score is the sum of pain, stiffness, and function scores (range of 0 - 2400).</description>
