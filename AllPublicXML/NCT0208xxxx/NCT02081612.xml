      This study looks at the benefit of adding acupuncture to nutrition education for weight loss
      in women with early stage breast cancer post-chemotherapy.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Obesity and weight gain are significant concerns for breast cancer survivors. Given the
      adverse consequences of weight gain after diagnosis, continued efforts to identify
      appropriate weight management interventions aimed at promoting overall health and long term
      survivorship are needed. In this study, the investigators will examine whether adding
      acupuncture to a nutrition education program for weight loss could improve short and long
      term weight loss among breast cancer survivors post treatment with chemotherapy.
