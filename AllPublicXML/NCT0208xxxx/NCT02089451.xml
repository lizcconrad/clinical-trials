    <textblock>
      This trial is conducted in Europe. The aim of the trial is to compare the pharmacokinetic
      properties (the exposure of the trial drug in the body) of faster-acting insulin aspart
      (FIAsp) after different injection regions and routes of administration in healthy subjects.

    <description>Drug: insulin aspart (faster acting insulin aspart) Subjects will receive five single dose level of faster acting insulin aspart. Three single dose s.c under the skin (abdomen, deltoid/upper arm, thigh), one single dose i.m. (intramuscularly, into the muscle) and one single dose i.v. (intravenously, into the vein)</description>
