      Title: A C E S Study: Can an arts based creative engagement intervention (CEI) following
      stroke improve psychosocial outcomes? A feasibility trial of a creative engagement
      intervention for inpatient rehabilitation.

      This is a feasibility randomised controlled trial of a novel intervention for stroke
      rehabilitation examining effects of participation in visual arts activities on psychosocial
      outcomes after stroke.

      The investigators hypothesise that participation in a visual arts based intervention (CEI)
      will improve stroke recovery variables, mood and self-esteem in stroke survivors receiving
      in-patient rehabilitation compared to viewing a portfolio of artwork.

      The results of the study will inform a sample size calculation for a full trial.

      SUMMARY

      Background: Stroke is the main cause of complex adult disability in Britain. Stroke
      rehabilitation is typically task orientated, focusing on physical and functional
      independence. Psychosocial consequences of stroke are serious and mediate recovery,
      influencing family relationships, community reintegration and quality of life. Therefore,
      improving psychosocial outcomes after stroke could improve overall recovery.

      Creative arts programmes are increasingly used to address psychosocial outcomes in long-term
      and mental health conditions. These programmes focus on positive influences of engagement in
      creative art activities facilitated by artists. However, there is little research into
      effects of creative engagement on psychosocial outcomes after stroke.

      Objectives: The purpose of this study is to:

      Conduct a feasibility randomised controlled trial (RCT) to test the effects of a
      participatory visual arts intervention compared to art viewing on psychosocial outcomes
      following stroke in order to assess effect size for sample size calculation in a full RCT.

      The effects of the CEI will be examined in a randomised controlled feasibility trial, which
      will be run at two stroke rehabilitation units in NHS Tayside and will explore the impact of
      the intervention on a range of psychosocial outcomes.

      Patients meeting inclusion criteria will be randomised to a CEI group or an attention control
      group. The CEI group will receive a visual arts intervention of 4-8 sessions during
      in-patient rehabilitation. The control group will receive an art portfolio to view after
      randomisation and baseline assessment, with information about community opportunities to
      engage in art. The groups will be compared on selected psychosocial outcomes. Findings will
      indicate the potential magnitude and direction of change to allow for sample size
      requirements in development of a subsequent randomised control trial to examine effectiveness
      of the CEI.

    <description>Creative Engagement Intervention participants will receive 4-8 art sessions over 3-5 weeks, depending on length of inpatient stay. Sessions will be delivered as 1:1 sessions with the artist lasting up to one hour (depending on patient fatigue levels) and group sessions, with up to 5 participants, lasting up to two hours (depending on patient fatigue levels). Participant with receive one group and one individual session per week of inpatient stay. The sessions will cover 5 activity stages of the intervention, taking the participant through a progressive artwork development process. Participants will explore basic visual art materials and processes and progress to creating artworks with a personal context that they have directed and controlled.</description>

    <description>The Portfolio group will receive conventional rehabilitation activity at each site. In addition, to control for effects of art related attention received by the intervention group, after baseline assessment and randomisation, this group will receive from the research assistant, a portfolio of work produced by previous participants of the Tayside CEI, with details of community programmes that people with stroke can attend after hospital discharge. Participants will be invited to view the portfolio during their stay. Prior to outcome assessment, the research assistant will visit participants again to answer questions and to discuss options for community programmes, if the person is interested.</description>

    <description>The CEI has 5 component stages which map the participant's journey with the Artist
Meeting with Artist, discuss interests, stroke and explore initial creative goals.
Introduction to materials and mark making to create interpretations of established images.
From mark making and interpretations to developing personal project ideas.
Turning personal project ideas into creative finished pieces.
Review of completed work, mounting and display of work, future plans.
It is recognised that participants will progress differently. Components may be repeated or retuned to or may be addressed simultaneously. Participants may progress rapidly and so move from stage 5 back to stages 2, 3 or 4 to progress new work or experience new materials or processes.</description>
