      This study aims to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of tenofovir in preventing HBV
      relapse in HBV carriers with malignant tumor following chemotherapy. Approximately 100
      patients who are planned to receive chemotherapy for malignant tumor will be invited to
      participate in this trail. A 1 or less 1-week tenofovir prophylaxis treatment should be
      administered by all subjects prior to the chemotherapy and eligible subjects will be randomly
      assigned to extend 24-week prophylaxis group A or 48-week prophylaxis group B in a 1:1 ratio
      at the end of the chemotherapy. The subjects could be stopped or withdrawn from this study
      earlier if HBV relapses or need to receive another course of chemotherapy respectively. The
      relapse episode will be followed until 24 weeks after the end of prophylaxis therapy. Data
      collection will take place at screening, every cyclic visit of chemotherapy, at the end of
      chemotherapy, and the following prophylaxis period, then every 4 weeks during the follow-up
      period. Patients in both groups will be treated with tenofovir or other antiviral agent
      according to investigator judgement when HBV relapse after discontinuation of tenofovir
      therapy.
