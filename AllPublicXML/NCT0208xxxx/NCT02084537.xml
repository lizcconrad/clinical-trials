      Prospective, randomized controlled trial comparing Endoscopic Ultrasound (EUS) Guided
      cystogastrostomy or cystoduodenostomy and endoscopic necrosectomy to minimally invasive
      surgical necrosectomy, in patients with necrotizing pancreatitis.

      Patients will be randomly allocated to either treatment arm in a 1:1 ratio. Following
      intervention, patients will be assessed at regular intervals until study completion at 6
      months post-discharge. Primary outcome is a composite of major complications and/or
      mortality, measured to 6 months post-discharge.
