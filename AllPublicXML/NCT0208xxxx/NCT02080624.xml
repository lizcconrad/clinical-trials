  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sturge-Weber syndrome (SWS) is a rare congenital neuro-cutaneous disorder considered as a
      rare or orphan disease. SWS is characterized by a capillary vascular malformation (CM)
      localized on the skin of the face, eyes and central nervous system. Given the localization
      and the extent of the CM, children with SWS are particularly prone to developing severe
      psychological problems. The standard treatment for CM is pulsed dye laser (PDL) although in
      these cases whitening of the lesion is rarely achieved. Combining topical rapamycin, a
      specific inhibitor of the mammalian target of rapamycin, with PDL is hypothesised to be a
      good therapeutic option in these patients.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with SWS will be treated with 2 sessions of PDL in the lateral part of the CM
      separated by an interval of 6 weeks and with 1% topical rapamycin or placebo in the superior
      or inferior half, both applied once a day for 12 weeks. The clinical response will be
      analyzed using a morphologic and chromatographic computerised system and with spectrometry.
      Histological response will be evaluated also. For that purpose, we will make 4 biopsies, one
      in each quadrant (quadrant treated with PDL and placebo, quadrant treated with PDL and
      rapamycin, quadrant treated only with rapamycin and quadrant treated only with placebo)

    <description>After signing this consent form, you will be asked to undergo some screening tests or procedures to find out if you can be in the research study.
A medical history, which involves questions about your health history, any medications you are taking or plan to take, any allergies and the treatments you received for your CM.
A physical exam, during which you will be asked about any problems that you might be having. Additionally, your clinician will check your vital signs (blood pressure, heart rate, weight and height). The doctor will also evaluate your performance status, which indicates how much your illness affects your activity level.
Blood tests, which will be done to make sure your hemogram, triglyceride and cholesterol levels are normal.
A pregnancy test for females will be done to check that you are not pregnant. If theses tests show that you are eligible to participate in the research study, you will begin the study treatment.</description>
