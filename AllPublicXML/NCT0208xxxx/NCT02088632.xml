  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      IncobotulinumtoxinA (Xeomin®) is a neurotoxin which inhibits the release of certain chemicals
      at the nerve terminals. It blocks cholinergic transmission at the neuromuscular junction by
      inhibiting the release of acetylcholine from motor neurons. In addition it blocks the release
      of Substance P (SP) and Calcitonin Gene Related Peptide (CGRP) from C fibers involved in pain
      perception. This study is designed to see if Xeomin® is superior to placebo in the treatment
      of medically refractory trigeminal neuralgia (TN). Subjects will be asked to maintain an
      attack diary throughout the study. They will also be asked to attend 4 office visits; Visit
      1- Screening Visit, Visit 2- Injection Visit, Visit 3- Follow-Up Visit and Visit 4- Final
      Visit. At the end of the study the active (Xeomin®) and placebo groups will be compared to
      see if one group had better relief than the other.
