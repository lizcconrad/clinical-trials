  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Lung recruitability is essential for optimal Positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP)
      selection in ARDS patients. It is defined as the potential for the non aerated or poorly
      aerated lung mass to become aerated due to the increase in airway pressure. PEEP contributes
      to lung recruitment mostly by maintaining some amount of the end-inspiratory recruitment at
      the end of expiration. PEEP also stabilizes patency of the small airways and minimizes the
      repeated opening and closing of them during the breathing cycle, which is implicated in a
      further lung inflammation. The gold-standard method for assessing lung recruitability is lung
      CT scan. For economic and feasibility this technique cannot be used in routine. Therefore,
      techniques that can be used at the bedside to measure lung recruitability are very well
      known. The measurement of recruited lung volume (Vrec) by using pressure-volume curve
      generated by the ventilator is another reference method to approach lung recruitment. It can
      be done at the bedside. Chest-X-Ray (CXR) is an interesting option as done in routine in this
      setting. Furthermore, it allows quantifying aeration thanks numerical image processing and a
      regional approach. In a preliminary one-center study we found a significant negative
      correlation between the amount of Vrec and the reduction in lung density measured by digital
      CXR between 5 and 15 cm H2O PEEP. In present study we would like to extend this previous
      result on a larger number of patients in a multicenter investigation.
