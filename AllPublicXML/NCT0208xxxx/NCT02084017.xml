  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the current standard of wound care following
      vascular operations compared to to a negative pressure wound therapy (vacuum dressing) and
      the rate of surgical site infections (SSIs) in patients undergoing surgery to restore blood
      flow to the lower limb(s).

      Negative pressure wound therapy consists of a closed, sealed system that produces negative
      pressure (vacuum) to the wound surface. The device itself consists of open-cell foam that is
      sealed with an occlusive adhesive dressing (covers and sticks to the incision) and suction is
      maintained by connecting suction tubes to a vacuum pump and waste collector.

      The investigators objectives are to determine whether there will be any reduction in surgical
      site infection and this potential reduction will influence length of hospital stay, emergency
      room visits, antibiotic use and need for re-operation.

      The study is a non-blinded randomized control trial. The study examines the effect on wound
      healing and surgical site infection using negative pressure wound therapy compared to
      standard dressing in high-risk patients (BMI &gt; 30, previous femoral cut-down). The
      investigators expected to find a lower surgical site infection rate in patients using the
      NPWT device.

      Patients after giving informed consent will be randomized to receive either NPWT or standard
      wound therapy following tier lower-limb revascularization operative. Both will be applied
      under sterile conditions immediately post-operatively. The intervention will be left for 4-7
      days depending on the discharge date and the standard dressing will be removed on
      post-operative day two.

      The data will be analyzed with an intention to treat analysis.
