    <textblock>
      This observational study evaluates the impact of high and low chloride containing IV fluids
      on administrative and clinical outcomes. The study uses a large electronic health dataset and
      examines patients receiving fluid replacement and resuscitation. The hypothesis is that high
      chloride solutions are associated with adverse outcomes as measured by administrative data
      and by clinical parameters.
