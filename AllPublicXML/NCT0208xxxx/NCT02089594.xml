      Objective/Hypothesis: An eight-week course of forty low-pressure Hyperbaric Oxygen
      Treatment's (HBOT's) can significantly improve symptoms and cognitive function in subjects
      with the persistent-post concussion syndrome (PPCS) of mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized prospective controlled single-blind crossover clinical trial of 1.5 ATA
      (atmospheres absolute) HBOT versus maintenance medication and counseling. One hundred adult
      subjects (50 at Louisiana State University Health Sciences Center-New Orleans and 50 at
      Oklahoma State University School of Medicine) with mTBI/PPCS who have been symptomatic
      continuously for at least six months from one or more mild traumatic brain injuries will be
      enrolled and randomized to either 40 HBOTs or no treatment. After the 8-week treatment period
      the no treatment group will be crossed over to receive 40 HBOTs.

    <description>HBOT Group: Pressurization will proceed with 100% oxygen at 1.0 pounds per square inch (psi) per minute, the minimal pressurization rate, to 1.5 ATA (atmospheres absolute) or 7.35 psi and will take approximately 7 minutes. Pressurization will then resume until the final depth of 1.5 ATA is achieved. The patient will remain at depth for approximately 45 minutes and the subject will be informed of the onset of depressurization, which will occur at the same rate as pressurization. Total dive time will be 60 minutes.</description>

             for MRI).

          4. Other pre-TBI cerebral neurological diagnoses including stroke, dementia, degenerative
             diseases, multiple sclerosis, congenital neurological disorder.

          8. History of hospitalization for past stroke, non-febrile seizures, or any seizure
             history other than seizure at the time of TBI.

          9. Past or current history of mental retardation.

         10. Pre-/post-TBI history of systemic illness with impact on central nervous system
             (P.I.'s decision).

         11. Pre-injury psychiatric disorders for which the patient was on medication at the time
             of the brain injury responsible for the patient's diagnosis of TBI/PPCS.

         12. Any concurrent systemic illness whose symptomatology confounds the diagnosis of PPCS
             (P.I.'s decision).

         13. Active malignancy undergoing treatment.
