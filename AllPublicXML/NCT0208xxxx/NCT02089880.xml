  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study will specifically evaluate the potential of the C-Brace to improve the functional
      mobility and quality of life in individuals with lower extremity impairments due to
      neurologic or neuromuscular disease, orthopedic disease or trauma, as compared to the stance
      control orthosis.

    <measure>Six minute walk test (6MWT)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline in 6MWT using device 1 at 8 weeks and using device 2 at 16 weeks.</time_frame>
    <description>The test measures the distance that the patient can walk on a flat, hard surface, indoors, in a period of 6 minutes. The walk test is patient self-paced and assesses the level of functional capacity. Patients are allowed to stop and rest during the test, however, the timer does not stop. If the patient is unable to complete the time, the time stopped is noted and reason for stopping prematurely is recorded. This test will be administered while wearing a mask to measure oxygen consumption.</description>

Time will be recorded using a stopwatch and recorded to the one hundredth of a second (ex: 2.15 sec). The test will be recorded 2 times, with adequate rest in between. The average of the 2 times should be recorded.</description>

    <description>The GAITRite system automates measuring temporal and spatial gait parameters via an electronic walkway connected to a computer. The GAITRite electronic walkway contains sensor pads encapsulated in a carpet to collect gait information. The system can be laid over any flat surface. The GAITRite electronic walkway for the study shall be a minimum of 14 feet long. The GAITRite data capture was chosen as measurement of the patient's overall gait quality.
