  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study was to examine the impact of a bystander intervention education
      program on college students' attitudes and behaviors associated with bystander intervention
      and sexual violence.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study used a randomized control trial, longitudinal design to determine the impact of a
      peer education theater intervention on undergraduate student attitudes and behaviors related
      to sexual violence and bystander intervention. Students were assigned to either an
      experimental group (receiving 3-4 doses of the intervention ) or a comparison group
      (receiving 1 dose only) and were surveyed six times over an 18 month period.

    <description>To measure intentions to be a bystander, we used the Bystander Attitude Scale, Revised (BAS-R) which is a modified version of Banyard's Bystander scale (Banyard, Plante, &amp; Moynihan, 2005; see McMahon et al., in press, for scale development information). Participants were asked to indicate how likely they were to engage in the behavior in the future on a Likert scale from 1 - 5, &quot;Unlikely&quot; to &quot;Very likely.&quot; Students' bystander intentions were assessed via (1) a paper survey in June, July or August 2010 (baseline) and (2) a follow-up web-based survey in early September, 2010. All study participants received one dose of the intervention in June, July or August.</description>

    <description>For proclivity to perpetrate, we used an item from Malamuth's (1989) Attraction to Sexual Aggression Scale and we created a question that combined items from Malamuth's scale and Lisak's Perpetrator History (PH) Scale (2000). These measures were assessed via (1) a paper survey in June, July or August 2010 (baseline); (2) a follow-up web-based survey in early September, 2010; and (3) a follow-up web-based survey in early December 2010. After the September, 2010 follow-up survey, participants were randomized to either receive two additional doses in October, 2010 and November, 2010 (experimental group) or no additional doses (control group).</description>

    <description>Two questions from Lisak's Perpetrator History (PH) Scale (Lisak, Conklin, Hopper, Miller, Altschuler &amp; Smith, 2000) were used to assess actual perpetration. Students' past perpetration was assessed via (1) a paper survey in June, July or August 2010 (baseline) and (2) a follow-up web-based survey in early September, 2010. All study participants received one dose of the intervention in June, July or August.</description>
