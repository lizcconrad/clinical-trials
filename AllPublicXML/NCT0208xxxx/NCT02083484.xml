  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an expanded access program (EAP) for participants who have progressed after prior
      systemic therapy including ipilimumab, and V-raf murine sarcoma viral oncogene homolog B1
      (BRAF) inhibitor or mitogen-activated protein kinase (MEK) enzyme inhibitor when indicated.
      Participants cannot be eligible for or have participated in any pembrolizumab (MK-3475)
      clinical trial with the exception of a participant enrolled in the pembrolizumab protocol
      MK-3475-006 who received treatment on the ipilimumab treatment arm and progressed; such
      participants will be eligible to participate in the EAP, regardless of prior treatment with a
      BRAF/MEK inhibitor, as long as all other eligibility criteria for MK-3475-030 are met.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Pembrolizumab has been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of
      patients with unresectable metastatic melanoma and disease progression following ipilimumab
      and if BRAF V600 mutation positive, a BRAF inhibitor. The Expanded Access Program (EAP) for
      this medicine in the U.S. is closed. The EAP will continue outside the U.S.
