  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will randomize participants with a diagnosis of congestive heart failure and at
      least one risk factor for hospitalization to either a tablet computer and web based disease
      management program or a telephone based disease management program. Both interventions are
      home based with heart failure education and symptom monitoring provided by nurse managers.
      The nurse managers are in close communication with both the participants and the
      participants' physicians . The components of the disease management program have been
      developed at Tufts Medical Center and the New England Quality Care Alliance with studies
      showing improved clinical outcomes, including reduced hospitalizations. The goal of this
      study is to transition this successful home monitoring and disease management program to a
      tablet computer and web-based implementation to both improve clinical outcomes (reducing
      hospitalizations and improving self-perceived health status) and improve provider-patient
      satisfaction. We hypothesize that the tablet computer based disease management will decrease
      heart failure hospitalizations.

    <description>After an initial visit where the program is introduced and education regarding adherence, methods for self-monitoring and early reporting of changes in status are reviewed, patients randomized to this arm will be given tablet computers with a web-based heart failure disease management application. Patients will be asked to interact with the system daily with transmission of weight, heart rate, blood pressure and symptom reports to the nurse manager. A nurse manager will check the data daily and contact patients if any parameters exceed pre-specified parameters. Nurse managers will also touch base with the participants at regular intervals as in the control arm. In addition, educational modules will be placed onto individual tablet computers and given to each patient.</description>

    <description>After an initial visit where the program is introduced and education regarding adherence, methods for self-monitoring and early reporting of changes in status are reviewed, the nurse manager will telephone participants weekly for the first month followed by either every two weeks or monthly calls depending on clinical status with the goal of transitioning all participants to monthly calls. During these phone calls the nurse manager will focus on identifying changes in clinical condition and education reinforcement. Participants will be instructed to check and record their weight, heart rate and blood pressure daily and will be encouraged to call if there are any changes in their clinical status.</description>
