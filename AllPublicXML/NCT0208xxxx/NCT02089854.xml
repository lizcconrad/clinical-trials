      The study is a prospective multi-center randomized control clinical trial which is sponsored
      by the researchers. The purpose of this study is to determine the effectiveness of adjuvant
      endocrine therapy for operable ER-beta positive, ER-alpha/PR negative, Her-2 negative breast
      cancer(triple negative breast cancer, TNBC) patients. The ER-beta positive TNBC patients who
      had undergone modified radical mastectomy or breast-conserving surgery were randomly (1:1)
      enrolled to receive toremifene (60 mg per day for premenopausal and perimenopausal patients)
      /anastrozole(1mg per day for postmenopausal patients) or observation within 4 weeks after
      adjuvant chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy if necessary.The follow-up time will be at
      least five years. The disease free survival(DFS) and overall survival(OS) between endocrine
      group and observation group will be compared to evaluate the effectiveness.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  The patients signed the written informed consent.

          -  The patients present with histologically proven operable invasive breast cancers
             without distant metastasis.

          -  The breast tumor's positive ER/PR rate is &lt;1%, and positive ER-beta rate is ≥1% by
             immuno-histochemistry(IHC).

          -  The patients have no history of neoadjuvant hormone therapy.

          -  The patients' Karnofsky performance score ≥70%.

          -  Female patient who is ≥ 18yrs, and ≤ 80yrs.

          -  The patients are non-pregnant, and disposed to practice contraception during the whole
             trial.

          -  The patients underwent neoadjuvant chemotherapy plus surgery or directly modified
             radical mastectomy or breast-conserving surgery (plus sentinel lymph node biopsy or
             axillary lymph node dissection) after diagnosis of breast cancer.

          -  The patients underwent chemotherapy, radiation therapy after surgery according to the
             2013 NCCN guideline.

          -  The results of patients' blood tests are as follows:

        Hb≥90g/L; WBC≥4.0×109/L; Neutrophils≥1.5×109/L; Plt≥100×109/L; alanine
        aminotransferase(ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) ≤ 2.5 × upper limit of

             any time, other malignant disorders within the past 10 years excluding squamous or
