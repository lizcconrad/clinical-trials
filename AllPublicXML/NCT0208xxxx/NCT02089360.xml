  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Blood sample is prospectively taken from consecutive patients underwent coronary angiogram in
      our center, after getting informed consent from the patients. Serum level of advanced
      glycation end products (AGEs) was measured and the clinical features of patients (including
      angiographic results) were entered into our database. Clinical follow-up was performed for
      all patients, and the relationship between AGEs and paitents' outcome were analyzed. Further
      intervention will be adjusted according to the results,including clinical and basic research
      in lab.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Serum levels of HMGB1, HMGB2, ADAM10, etc. will be measured in lab and animal studies will be
      designed to intervene the adverse interaction between abnormal serum concentration of AGEs,
      etc. and worse clinical results.
