      The purpose of this study is to find out if radiology tests of the kidneys as opposed to
      glomerular filtration (GFR) tests (GFR test - a lab test that measures kidney function)
      follow progression of polycystic kidney disease (PKD) the best. PKD patients at risk for
      progression to renal failure (dialysis or transplantation) have been identified and include
      those who have been diagnosed with high blood pressure early, the presence of the PKD1 gene
      (the inherited abnormality responsible for the majority of PKD), men as opposed to women,
      those with episodes of visible blood or increased protein in their urine, and women who have
      experience more than three pregnancies. Individuals who are diagnosed with PKD in the first
      year of life or in utero (before birth) are also at high risk for progression to renal
      failure.

      This study will also facilitate understanding of human diseases at the cellular and molecular
      level. We will be identifying genetic factors that may influence the severity of polycystic
      kidney disease (PKD). You are being asked to provide a sample of blood for the purpose of DNA
      or other biochemical analyses.
