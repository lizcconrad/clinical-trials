    <textblock>
      A randomized, controlled trial of Kangaroo Mother Care (KMC) versus Conventional Care to
      determine the effectiveness of KMC in increasing the rate of weight gain among low birth
      weight neonates and if it will decrease sepsis rate and shorten hospital stay among the
      group.

    <description>Low-birth weight infants both in the intervention and control group were discharged from the study according to the following criteria: baby's general health was good as assessed by the attending physician and in evidence of infection, feeding well and receiving exclusively breast milk, gaining weight (at least 15-20 grams/kg/day for at least 3 days), maintaining body temperature satisfactorily for at least 3 consecutive days in room temperature and the mother and family members were confident to take care of the baby in KMC.</description>

    <description>Mothers in the KMC group were oriented in detail about KMC procedure. The mothers provided skin to skin contact using a specially tailored &quot;kangaroo tube&quot; made of soft flannel cloth. The mothers were encouraged to keep the baby in KMC as long as possible during the day and night for an accumulated time of at least 6 hours per day. The duration of the kangaroo care by each of the mother were recorded and tallied accordingly.</description>

    <intervention_type>Procedure</intervention_type>
    <intervention_name>Kangaroo Mother Care</intervention_name>
    <description>The infants were placed on continuous skin to skin contact between the mother and the baby as soon as possible. The mother kept her newborn infant between the breast, in close contact with her body and covered with the kangaroo tube. Infants wore diaper and a cap during the procedure. Breastfeeding was the standard feeding method.
When the baby was not in KMC, the baby was placed in the bassinet under warm lamp, if needed, adequately clothed and covered.</description>

    <description>This is generally included: an artificial warming system (heated room overhead lamp warmers). Breastfeeding was also the standard feeding method but if indicated, babies can also be fed through tube or cup feeding. The mothers were allowed to visit their babies anytime but skin to skin contact was not allowed.
Babies in both groups were monitored hourly. Their heart rate, respiratory rate and temperature were monitored and recorded. Any untoward events like hypothermia, hypoglycemia, apnea, signs of sepsis, and feeding problems were also noted.</description>
