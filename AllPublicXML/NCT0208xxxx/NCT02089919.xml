  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Most studies of cancer stem cells (CSC) involve the inoculation of cells from human tumors
      into immunosuppressed mice, preventing an assessment on the immunologic interactions and
      effects of CSCs. In this study, the investigators examined the vaccination effects produced
      by CSC-enriched populations from histologically distinct murine tumors after their
      inoculation into different syngeneic immunocompetent hosts. Enriched CSCs were immunogenic
      and more effective as an antigen source than unselected tumor cells in inducing protective
      antitumor immunity.Immune sera from CSC-vaccinated hosts contained high levels of IgG which
      bound to CSCs, resulting in CSC lysis in the presence of complement.CTLs generated from
      peripheral blood mononuclear cells or splenocytes harvested from CSC-vaccinated hosts were
      capable of killing CSCs in vitro. Mechanistic investigations established that CSC-primed
      antibodies and T cells were capable of selective targeting CSCs and conferring anti-tumor
      immunity.

      To assess the feasibility of generating CSC-loaded DC vaccines for clinical use, the
      investigators will harvest peripheral blood and tumor specimen from patients with
      hepatocellular cancer. The investigators will purify T, B cells and generate DCs from the
      PBMCs of the hepatocellular cancer patient.On the other hand, investigators will isolate
      ALDHhigh and ALDHlow tumor cells from the tumor specimen of the hepatocellular cancer patient
      using a similar protocol as investigators reported .

      Aim 1: To demonstrate, in vitro, the relative cellular anti-hepatocellular cancer CSC
      immunity induced by hepatocellular cancer CSC-DC primed cytotoxic T cells.

      Aim 2: To determine, in vitro, specific binding and lysis of hepatocellular cancer CSCs by
      antibodies produced by purified B cells from PBMCs stimulated with hepatocellular cancer
      CSC-DC.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Any patients with a diagnosis of HCC based on histology or the current accepted
             radiological measures.

          2. Age &gt; 18 years.

          3. Patient has an MRI or CT result (positive for HCC) up to 3 months prior to
             recruitment.

          4. AFP &gt;30.

          5. Patient who is not eligible for or failed any HCC treatment.

          6. Karnofsky performance status &gt;70%.

             measured within six weeks prior to treatment allocation):

             Hemoglobin: Within normal range according to institutional standards; Absolute
