  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Aging modifies the metabolic pathway of the neurotransmitter serotonin by reducing the
      synthesis rate and increasing the breakdown rate of serotonin, possibly related to the
      observed enhanced sensitivity of the serotonergic pathway. Since serotonin plays a prominent
      role in neuropsychological functions such as anxiety, mood and memory, the enhanced
      sensitivity of the serotonergic pathway in aging can probably explain the fact that elderly
      are more vulnerable to develop cognitive deficits and depressive symptoms.

      Serotonin synthesis in brain is regulated by its precursor tryptophan (TRP). Because
      tryptophan is an essential amino acid, modifying the availability of tryptophan through
      dietary intake, can directly influence central serotonin metabolism and consequently
      affective and cognitive processes.

      The aim of this study is to test the hypothesis that an acute intake of whey protein with
      high levels of TRP such as alpha-lactalbumin can stabilize the metabolism of serotonin and
      subsequently enhance metabolic and cognitive functions in healthy older adults. The acute
      effects of this dietary protein will be investigated in subjects with mild cognitive
      impairment (MCI), or dementia, compared to control subjects in order to examine whether
      healthy older subject with MCI benefit more from the intake of alpha-lactalbumin and/or whey.
      The investigators will investigate if this meal can optimize serotonin metabolism by
      elevating plasma TRP levels and plasma TRP appearance and enhance splanchnic TRP extraction.
      In addition, the effects on mood and cognitive functions will be examined.

      The study involves for all subjects 3 test days (approximately 8 hours each). On this test
      day the investigators will examine the acute effects of a protein meal. Subjects will receive
      a mixture of alpha-lactalbumin and/or whey and/or casein, carbohydrates and amino acid stable
      isotopes to investigate protein and amino acid kinetics (assigned to alpha-lactalbumin or
      whey or casein group on test day 1, then switch on test day 2 and 3). The subjects will
      receive these stable isotopes by infusion in their blood and by oral intake (e.g.
      simultaneously with protein meal). For study purposes, blood will be drawn approx. 25 times
      during 8 hours on the test day, altogether about 100-120 ml of blood will be drawn on the
      test day.
