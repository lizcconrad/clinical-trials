  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a major complication after cardiac surgery and has been reported
      to be associated with adverse outcome. Previous studies have reported that the incidence of
      AKI in patients undergoing surgery for congenital heart disease is as high as 42% and AKI
      increase the patient mortality, intensive care unit stay and hospital stay. Previous studies
      have reported several risk factors for AKI after congenital heart surgery, however,
      perioperative variables including anesthesia-related factors have not been evaluated fully.
      Therefore, the investigators attempt to find out independent risk factors regarding
      perioperative variables.

      Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a major complication after cardiac surgery and has been reported
      to be associated with adverse outcome. Previous studies have reported that the incidence of
      AKI in patients undergoing surgery for congenital heart disease is as high as 42% and AKI
      increase the patient mortality, intensive care unit stay and hospital stay. Previous studies
      have reported several risk factors for AKI after congenital heart surgery, however,
      perioperative variables including anesthesia-related factors have not been evaluated fully.
      In addition, a neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), which have been reported to be a marker for
      systemic inflammation and associated with prognosis of cardiac and cancer patients might be
      able to predict development of postoperative AKI. Therefore, the investigators attempt to
      assess independent risk factors regarding perioperative variables including
      transfusion-related parameters, preoperative anemia, preoperative hypoalbuminemia, pulmonary
      hypertension, use of nitric oxide, use of hydroxyethyl starch, perioperative medication,
      hemodynamic variables and perioperative NLR.
