  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A retrospective chart review of patients receiving concurrent chemoradiotherapy for
      oropharynx cancer was performed to compare clinical data for patients treated prior to the
      initiation of the NP clinic with those subsequently seen weekly in the NP clinic. The
      variables studied included; rate of hospitalization, dose completion and dose reductions. The
      results revealed an overall improvement in all variables for those patients seen in the
      weekly NP clinic.

      To further analyze this data a randomized, prospective study is proposed to validate the
      findings of the retrospective study. It is predicted that a weekly NP led clinic will
      decrease costly hospitalizations, increase patient treatment completion and improve overall
      patient quality of life and satisfaction.

    <description>A &quot;problem&quot; includes any one of three events: dose reduction, inability to complete treatment, or toxicity related hospitalization. Patients are assigned a 1 if any of these events occurs at least once during treatment or are assigned 0 if they complete treatment with no dose reductions or toxicity related hospitalizations. When data is analyzed and reported, the problem rate will be summarized along with the each individual negative component.</description>

    <description>The nurse practitioner (NP) clinic is staffed by two NPs, one registered nurse, and several medical assistants. Patients can be seen by either NP during their treatment course. Patients will be scheduled to be seen in the (NP) clinic based on randomization assignment.
Each clinic visit focuses on specific concerns and toxicities of the patient and their significant other. This will include physical as well as psychological, social and spiritual needs.</description>
