    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare the 6- and 12-month weight changes associated with
      lifestyle interventions delivered in a large group or small groups of participants. It is
      hypothesized that participants receiving treatment in a small group will have greater weight
      loss than those assigned to a larger group.
