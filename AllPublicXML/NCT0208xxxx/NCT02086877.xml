  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      As survival rates from critical illness improve, strategies to return patients to their
      baseline cognitive and functional status are important research priorities. Up to 100% of ICU
      survivors will suffer some degree of cognitive impairment at hospital discharge and
      approximately 50% will have decrements that persist for years. While the mechanisms for this
      newly acquired brain injury are poorly understood, several risk factors have been identified.
      Unfortunately, it is unclear how to accurately predict long-term cognitive impairment.

      Immediate opportunities to improve cognitive outcomes through risk reduction exist. The
      investigators propose to comprehensively study the prevalence of sleep abnormalities and
      their association with cognitive impairment, as it may yield potential targets for effective
      therapy. Moreover, the investigators will examine for gene x environment associations [APOE
      ε4] that may allow for genetic risk stratification of individuals at greatest risk of
      cognitive impairment. The investigators hypothesize that EEG [a sensitive longitudinal marker
      of brain dysfunction] is a novel and independent predictor of long-term cognitive impairment,
      and possibly a candidate intermediate end point for future clinical trials.

      This study has the potential to identify novel biomarkers and risk factors for post-critical
      illness cognitive impairment, and may lay the foundation for rational interventions to
      mitigate risk in high-risk individuals.
