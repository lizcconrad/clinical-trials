  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the proposed study is to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of the Totally
      Implantable Deep Brain Stimulation System in the ventral intermediate (VIM) nucleus of the
      thalamus implanted for the treatment of tremor due to essential tremor. This study will be
      included in the Pre-Market Approval Application to support the safety of this device in use.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed as a prospective, multi-centered study for 365 days in duration from
      device implantation. A maximum of 12 sites will enroll 160 patients.

      Each patient will be screened and then undergo a baseline evaluation followed by unilateral
      or bilateral implantation of the Deep Brain Stimulation system.

      During the implantation procedure, each patient will undergo a trial of stimulation in the
      operating room. The device may be internalized after a successful intra-operative trial or at
      a later surgery (no later than 4 weeks after initial lead placement). If the device is not
      activated immediately post-surgery, the patient may return to the clinic to determine optimum
      stimulation programming. Device programming will be optimized in as many visits as necessary
      following implantation. The day that the device is fully implanted will be classified as &quot;Day
      0&quot; for each patient.

      After &quot;Day 0&quot; the patient will return to clinic for evaluations at, Day 90 (+ 14 days), and
      Day 180 (+ 14 days) and Day 365 (approximately 12 months + 30 days after Day 0). These
      evaluations consist of the Clinical Rating Scale for Tremor (CRST), the Quality of Life in
      Essential Tremor (QUEST), the Short Form questionnaire (SF36), Patient and caregiver Global
      Ratings and the Patient Satisfaction Rating.

      At Baseline and Day 180, the CRST evaluation session will be video recorded for analysis by
      an independent evaluator unaware of the functioning of the device. Additionally, at the Day
      180 visit, the physician will have the option to provide the patient with amplitude control.
      A comparison of measures within the same person from pre-treatment to post-treatment will be
      performed. Also, pre-treatment and post-treatment group means and standard deviations will be
      determined.

      After the 1 year study patient may be enrolled in another protocol (C-06-03) for an
      additional 4 years. This observational, long term follow up study will continue to monitor
      the safety and efficacy of the Libra Deep Brain Stimulation System.

      If necessary, after the C-06-03 protocol the patients will have continued access to the
      investigational device through a compassionate use protocol (C-13-02).
