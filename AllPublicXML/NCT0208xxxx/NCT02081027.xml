             aripiprazole and risperidone or 2) failure of at least three previous clinically
             adequate drug trials targeting irritability (one trial must include aripiprazole or

             available.

          -  Stable dosing of all concomitant psychotropic medications (including those targeting
             irritability) for four weeks prior to screening visit and during the study.

             measures and shipping control sample for Extracellular Signal-Related Kinase biomarker
             (ERK) assay.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Current use of more than two concomitant psychotropic drugs targeting irritability.

          -  Current use of drugs with known interaction with riluzole

          -  Current use of drugs with concomitant glutamatergic or glutamatergic- modulating
             action medications.

          -  For female subjects of child bearing potential, a positive serum pregnancy test.
