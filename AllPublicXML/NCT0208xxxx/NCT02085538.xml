  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Since the amount of palbociclib eliminated in urine is 6.9%, renal impairment is not expected
      to have much impact on palbociclib. However, the Federal Drug Administration (FDA) Guidance
      recommends a study in subjects with renal impairment when the drug is likely to be used in
      patients with impaired renal function. Palbociclib is intended for chronic use in cancer
      patients who may have some degree of impaired renal function.

    <time_frame>8 days</time_frame>
    <description>AUC (0 - 8)= Area under the plasma concentration versus time curve (AUC) from time zero (pre-dose) to extrapolated infinite time (0 - 8). It is obtained from AUC (0 - t) plus AUC (t - 8).</description>

    <measure>Apparent Oral Clearance (CL/F)</measure>
    <time_frame>8 days</time_frame>
    <description>Clearance of a drug is a measure of the rate at which a drug is metabolized or eliminated by normal biological processes. Clearance obtained after oral dose (apparent oral clearance) is influenced by the fraction of the dose absorbed. Clearance was estimated from population pharmacokinetic (PK) modeling. Drug clearance is a quantitative measure of the rate at which a drug substance is removed from the blood.</description>

    <measure>Apparent Volume of Distribution (Vz/F)</measure>
    <time_frame>8 days</time_frame>
    <description>Volume of distribution is defined as the theoretical volume in which the total amount of drug would need to be uniformly distributed to produce the desired plasma concentration of a drug. Apparent volume of distribution after oral dose (Vz/F) is influenced by the fraction absorbed.</description>

    <measure>Plasma Decay Half-Life (t1/2)</measure>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Unbound Apparent Oral Clearance (CLu/F)</measure>
    <time_frame>8 days</time_frame>
    <description>Clearance of unbound drug is a measure of the rate at which a drug is metabolized or eliminated by normal biological processes. Clearance obtained after oral dose (apparent oral clearance) is influenced by the oral bioavailability. Unbound drug clearance is a quantitative measure of the rate at which an unbound drug substance is removed from the blood.</description>

    <description>AUC (0 - ∞)u= Area under the plasma concentration versus time curve (AUC) from time zero (pre-dose) to extrapolated infinite time (0 - ∞)u for unbound drug. It is obtained from AUC (0 - t)u plus AUC (t - ∞)u for unbound drug.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Unbound Maximum Observed Plasma Concentration (Cmaxu)</measure>
    <time_frame>8 days</time_frame>
