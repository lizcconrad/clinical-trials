      Prospective Randomized double-blind controlled trial comparing the healing rate, infection
      rate, pain score, ease of care and scar formation of Banana leaf dressing versus hydrocolloid
      dressing.

      Adult patients with no uncontrolled medical condition admitted at Philippine General Hospital
      Burn Center requiring split thickness skin graft for their burn. this is to compare the
      efficacy and safety of Banana Leaf Dressing with Hydrocolloid dressing among patients
      undergoing split thickness skin graft for their burn.

    <measure>Healing Assessment and Efficacy of the dressing</measure>
    <time_frame>8th post harvest day</time_frame>
    <description>After 8th post harvest day The degree of healing will be assessed. Direct inspection of the wound will be made by experienced burn surgeon. The degree of re-epithelialization will be graded as follow:
No Re-epithelialization = zero (0); Less than 50% = one (1); More than 50% but not complete = Two (2), and Complete (90% or more) = Three (3). Complete Re-epithelialization is synonymous to healing on which 90% or more of the wound surface is re-epithelialized.</description>

    <measure>Pain Scores</measure>
    <time_frame>taken from 24hours, on the 48th and 72 hour post skin harvest</time_frame>
    <description>This pain score shall be determined on each patient using a visual analog pain intensity scale the score is as follows: 0-1=no pain; 2-3= Mild pain; 4-5=Moderate pain; 7-8= Severe pain; 9-10=Worst possible.</description>

    <description>Banana leaf dressing will be prepared by cutting the mid rib of the leaf cutting the leaf into standard size of 12 x 12 inches to facilitate packing. The leaves are rolled and packed in polypropelene bags and subject to gamma irradiation or packed in paper bags for autoclaving. The Banana Leaf Dressing site will receive a single layer of banana leaf without any topical antibiotic applied to the wound followed by a layer of dry gauze for absorption of exudates. The dressing is secured with cling wrap to maintain an occlusive environment. This is then covered by rolled gauze and elastic bandage.</description>

    <description>The donor under HCD was covered with hydrocolloid (DuoDERM CGF). The hydrocolloid dressing was cut to the size of the donor site with an overlap of at least 2 centimeter around the wound edge. After pulling off the adhesive backing, care was taken to ensure that the adhesive was in direct contact with the raw surface. This was likewise covered with a top dressing of gauze for absorption of exudates and an elastic bandage to secure dressing.</description>
