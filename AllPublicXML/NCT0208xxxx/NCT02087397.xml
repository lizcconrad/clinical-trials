  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This will be an open-label, non-randomized, multi-center, patient sponsored study of
      Adipose-Derived Stromal Vascular Fraction cells (AD-SVF) implantation delivered into the
      corpus cavernous in patients with Erectile Dysfunction.

      The intent of this clinical study is to answer the questions: 1) Is the proposed treatment
      safe and 2) Is treatment effective in improving the disease pathology of patients with
      diagnosed Erectile Dysfunction.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      AD-SVF will be collected from the patient's adipose-derived tissue (body fat). Using local
      anesthesia, Liposuction will be performed to collect the adipose tissue specimen. The adipose
      tissue is then transferred to the laboratory for separation of the adipose tissue derived
      stem cells. In addition, peripheral blood will be collected for isolation of platelet rich
      plasma, which are then combined with the ASC's for direct injection to the Corpus Cavernosum
      (Penis).
