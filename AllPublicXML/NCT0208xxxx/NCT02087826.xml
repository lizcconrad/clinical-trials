  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to examine whether specific genes (e.g. SLC16A11)
      affect how human beings respond to food and a medication that is commonly used to treat type
      2 diabetes. The food the investigators will be studying is specially prepared to contain
      protein, carbohydrate, and fat. The drug the investigators are studying is metformin. The
      investigators hypothesize that physiological responses to the meal and to the medication will
      differ between carriers and non-carriers of genes associated with type 2 diabetes.

    <description>Metformin will be administered during this study. This medication is safely prescribed at a maximum dose of 1000 mg twice daily for the treatment or prevention of type 2 diabetes, as well as for other metabolic conditions. To minimize potential side effects of metformin (e.g., GI upset), participants will take Â½ the maximum dose of this medication (500 mg twice daily) and for only 5 days. Participants will be informed of the potential side effects of metformin. They will be asked to contact study staff and discontinue the medication if symptoms are very uncomfortable.</description>
