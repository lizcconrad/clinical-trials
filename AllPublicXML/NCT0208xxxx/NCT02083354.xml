  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-arm, open-label, multi-center, Phase II study to evaluate dabrafenib and
      trametinib combination therapy in subjects with BRAF V600 mutation-positive, unresectable or
      metastatic Acral lentiginous or cutaneous melanoma. This study will evaluate the objective
      response rate (ORR), progression free survival (PFS), duration of response, overall survival
      (OS), safety and efficacy, to assess steady state (all subjects) exposure to dabrafenib,
      dabrafenib metabolites, and trametinib and characterize the population pharmacokinetics (PK)
      and pharmacodynamics (PD) of dabrafenib and trametinib. Subjects will be enrolled and will
      receive dabrafenib 150 milligram (mg) orally twice daily and trametinib 2 mg orally once
      daily. Treatment will continue until disease progression, death, unacceptable toxicity, or
      withdrawal of consent, or study closure. After treatment discontinuation, subjects will be
      followed for survival and disease progression as applicable.
