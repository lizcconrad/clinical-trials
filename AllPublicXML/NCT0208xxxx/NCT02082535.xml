    <textblock>
      The improvement of treatment of preterm neonates improved their survival, however there is
      still significant portion of preterm infants (specifically very preterm infants) that suffers
      from brain insults and as a result developmental deficits. The brain injury is a consequence
      of hypoxic ischemic events, intracranial hemorrhages, as well as, infections and metabolic
      crisis. The brain injury is a combination of abnormal myelination, axonal damage and neuronal
      death. Although there is reduction in focal brain injury, diffuse brain injury is still
      abundant. Several treatments has been suggested and tested in animal models to prevent the
      brain insults including glutamate receptor blockers, allopurinol, xenon and different types
      of stem cells. However, two main obstacles prevent the use of these medication, first the
      uncertainty of their effect on the developing brain and second the difficulty to time the
      brain insult. Unlike neonatal asphyxia, when the delivery time and clinical signs are used to
      time and grade the brain injury, in preterm infants there is no real time tool to indicate
      severity and timing of brain injury. The disability point out a beneficial therapeutic window
      is a major obstacle in the acute treatment of brain injury in preterm infants. The aim of
      this study is to try and delineate such therapeutic window by using brain injury biomarkers.

      S100b and GFAP are well recognized biomarkers of brain injury in adults, children and
      infants. Serial measurements of S100b in saliva (every 2 days) and GFAP in serum (weekly)
      will be sampled. A database of the clinical status of the infants will be collected, as well
      as, head ultra sound weekly and head MRI a term age. Development will be assessed by at 18
      months. Two hypotheses are stated: One, increase in the levels of S100b and GFAP in their
      timing will be correlated with the severity of the clinical status, Two the duration of
      increased level of S100b and GFAP will be associated with abnormal MRI at term findings and
      abnormal developmental assessment.
