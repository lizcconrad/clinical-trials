  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Every day, more than 40 Australian break their hip, Most are over the age of sixty five. Hip
      fractures are a significant problem for the older people, the hospital system and community
      as a whole because of the increasing numbers of fractures and the cost of hospitalisation and
      ongoing care. After one year, less than half of all people with a hip fracture can walk as
      well as they did before the fracture. Physiotherapy in the acute hospital setting is an
      integral part of patient care, although the intensity of physiotherapy a patient receives is
      variable and the optimal number of treatment sessions per day remains unknown. Studies in
      other patient groups have shown that increased physiotherapy can improve patient outcomes by
      increasing muscle strength and mobility. It can also reduce the negative effects of bed rest
      such as muscle wasting, blood clots in the lungs or leg veins and chest infections such as
      pneumonia. This study aims to investigate the effectiveness of an intensive physiotherapy
      program in hip fracture patients to further understand this and the effect it has on patient
      function.

      In this research the investigators will randomly allocate patients into 2 groups; usual care
      and intensive physiotherapy. The usual care group will have physiotherapy treatment daily
      whereas the intensive physiotherapy group will have an additional daily treatment by a
      physiotherapist as well as a daily treatment by an allied health assistant. The objectives
      are to achieve better functional outcomes in the patient's hospital stay (ie improved
      mobility), reduce the time for patients to be physically ready to go home, increase the
      number of patients able to go directly home or to fast stream rehabilitation (rather than a
      slow stream option).

      If increased intensity of physiotherapy is found to improve patient's mobility outcomes, this
      research will provide the confidence to endorse a change to current clinical practice.
