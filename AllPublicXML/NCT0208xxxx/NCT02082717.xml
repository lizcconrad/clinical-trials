      The purpose of this study is to examine the impact of 4% sodium bicarbonate additive during
      peripheral intravenous potassium chloride replacement therapy for adult patients in a
      Medical/Surgical unit. Using a randomized controlled double blinded experimental study
      design, patients who are 21 years or older are alert, awake, and oriented at the time of
      enrollment and have been ordered peripheral intravenous potassium chloride replacement will
      be recruited from one Medical/Surgical during the first 24-48 hours of their admission.

      The specific aim of the study is:

      Aim 1: To compare patient outcomes (phlebitis, pain at peripheral IV insertion site,
      frequency of changing IV access, and time for administration) between the experimental (4%
      sodium bicarbonate additive during peripheral intravenous potassium chloride replacement
      therapy) and control (standard of practice of no 4% sodium bicarbonate additive during
      peripheral intravenous potassium chloride replacement therapy) groups.

      Aim 2: To compare number and type of nursing interventions done during peripheral intravenous
      potassium chloride replacement therapy between the experimental (4% sodium bicarbonate
      additive during peripheral intravenous potassium chloride replacement therapy) and control
      (standard of practice of no 4% sodium bicarbonate additive during peripheral intravenous
      potassium chloride replacement therapy) groups.

      Aim 3: To compare attrition rates and reasons between the experimental (4% sodium bicarbonate
      additive during peripheral intravenous potassium chloride replacement therapy) and control
      (standard of practice of no 4% sodium bicarbonate additive during peripheral intravenous
      potassium chloride replacement therapy) groups.
