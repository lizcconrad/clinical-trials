  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      We hypothesize that infant and children will show different levels of acceptance of different
      interfaces while they receive inhaled therapy.

      We also hypothesize that children will exhibit different amounts of time with the aerosol
      well aligned with the nostrils during transnasal aerosol delivery.

    <textblock>
      Aerosol medicine is widely used in treating pulmonary diseases in children. Delivering drugs
      via aerosol faces several challenges; some are related to the drug and the delivery methods
      and others to the patient behavior. The latter are crucial and can significantly affect the
      lung deposition of the drug. Infants are known to be obligate nose breathers making the
      transnasal route the natural approach for drug delivery in this age group. Different
      interfaces are already available in the market and are specifically designed to be used in
      children to improve the child acceptability of the interface and by the result to improve
      drug deposition. Due to limitations in the use of radiolabeled aerosols and
      pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics studies in infants and children, in-vitro models were
      developed. These models still lack biological variability which leads to overestimating lung
      deposition. So, real life correction factors are needed to improve current in-vitro modeling.
      Previous unpublished data from our laboratory showed that alignment of the aerosol stream
      with the nostrils is very important for pulmonary deposition.

      Our objectives are to provide real life data of acceptance of different interfaces by infants
      and children and to provide a real life correction factor to improve current in-vitro
      modeling.

    <description>The recordings will be analyzed by the 2 investigators for acceptance of the patient of the interface (likert scale 1 to 5: 5= Complete acceptance, 4= Accepting most of the time, 3= Accepting/rejecting half of the time, 2= Rejecting most of the time, 1= Complete rejection). The data will be expressed as average of value assigned by each of the 2 researchers. Analysis of variance for repeated measures followed by Tukey test will be used to compare the 2 endpoints.

    <description>A Hudson nebulizer will be loaded with 3 mls of normal saline and operated at 7 L/min of wall air for 3 minutes with each scenario with a 5-minute interval between interfaces. The interfaces that will be used are: tight mask, the angled PediNeb, the B&amp;B adapter, mask placed at 2 cm from the face, the PediNeb T-piece, and a capped corrugated tubing placed 2 cm away from the face.</description>

    <description>A Hudson nebulizer will be loaded with 3 mls of normal saline and operated at 7 L/min of wall air for 3 minutes with each scenario with a 5-minute interval between interfaces. The infants will be videotape while they receive inhaled aerosol, and sound will be captured. The camera will be positioned so the face of the parent holding the child will not be visible.</description>
