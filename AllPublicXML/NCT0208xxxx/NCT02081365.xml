  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Dental and health anxiety are common and potentially distressing problems, for both patients
      and health care providers. Anxiety has been identified as a barrier to regular dental visits
      and as an important target for enhancement of oral health-related quality of life. possible
      groups, (1) high dental anxiety and (2) low dental anxiety. The study aimed to develop and
      evaluate a computerized cognitive-behavioral therapy dental anxiety intervention (C-CBT) that
      could be easily implemented in dental healthcare settings.

      A cognitive-behavioral protocol based on psychoeducation, exposure to feared dental
      procedures, and cognitive restructuring was developed. A randomized controlled trial was
      conducted (N=151) to test its efficacy. Consenting adult dental patients who met inclusion
      (e.g., high dental anxiety) and exclusion criteria were randomized to one of two groups, (1)
      immediate treatment (IT) (n=74) or (2) a waitlist control (WL) (n=77).

      Analyses of covariance (ANCOVAs) based on intention to treat analyses were used to compare
      the two groups on dental anxiety, fear, avoidance, and overall severity of dental phobia.
      Baseline scores on these outcomes were entered into the analyses as covariates.

    <description>The Modified Dental Anxiety Scale a five-item self-report measure that assesses fear of dental procedures, including drilling, scaling and polishing (i.e., cleaning), and local anesthetic injections. Sample items include, &quot;If you went to your dentist for treatment tomorrow, how would you feel?&quot; and &quot;If you were about to have your tooth drilled, how would you feel?&quot; Items are rated on a five-point Likert-type scale ranging from 1 (not anxious) to 5 (extremely anxious). Scale 0-25. We considered patients who scored &gt; 19 on the MDAS at baseline or endorsed at least two MDAS items &gt; 4 to have high dental anxiety.</description>

    <measure>Change in Clinical Severity Rating for Specific Phobia Module of Anxiety Disorders Interview Schedule for DSM-IV</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from one week before dental appointment to one-month after dental appointment</time_frame>
    <description>The Anxiety Disorders Interview Schedule for DSM-IV is a semi-structured diagnostic interview for assessing DSM-IV criteria for current anxiety, depressive, somatoform, and substance use disorders. For the present investigation, only the specific phobia module of the ADIS-IV was administered to assess the presence and severity of a current diagnosis of dental phobia. Various aspects of dental phobia were assessed using the specific phobia module of the ADIS-IV. Interviewers assessed participants' anxiety and avoidance of dental procedures on scales that ranged from 0 (none) to 8 (very severe). They also rated patients' overall distress and impairment due to their dental phobia symptoms and assigned a clinician's severity rating (CSR) that also ranged from 0 (none) to 8 (very severe); a CSR &gt; 4 indicated that the participant met criteria for diagnosis of dental phobia.</description>

Sample items include, “If you went to your dentist for treatment tomorrow, how would you feel?” and “If you were about to have your tooth drilled, how would you feel?” Items are rated on a five-point Likert-type scale ranging from 1 (not anxious) to 5 (extremely anxious). Scale 0-25. We considered patients who scored &gt; 19 on the MDAS at baseline or endorsed at least two MDAS items &gt; 4 to have high dental anxiety.</description>

        <description>The Anxiety Disorders Interview Schedule for DSM-IV is a semi-structured diagnostic interview for assessing DSM-IV criteria for current anxiety, depressive, somatoform, and substance use disorders. For the present investigation, only the specific phobia module of the ADIS-IV was administered to assess the presence and severity of a current diagnosis of dental phobia. Various aspects of dental phobia were assessed using the specific phobia module of the ADIS-IV. Interviewers assessed participants’ anxiety and avoidance of dental procedures on scales that ranged from 0 (none) to 8 (very severe). They also rated patients’ overall distress and impairment due to their dental phobia symptoms and assigned a clinician’s severity rating (CSR) that also ranged from 0 (none) to 8 (very severe); a CSR &gt; 4 indicated that the participant met criteria for diagnosis of dental phobia.</description>

        <title>Change in Avoidance Rating for Specific Phobia Module of Anxiety Disorders Interview Schedule for DSM-IV</title>
        <description>The Anxiety Disorders Interview Schedule for DSM-IV is a semi-structured diagnostic interview for assessing DSM-IV criteria for current anxiety, depressive, somatoform, and substance use disorders. For the present investigation, only the specific phobia module of the ADIS-IV was administered to assess the presence and severity of a current diagnosis of dental phobia. Various aspects of dental phobia were assessed using the specific phobia module of the ADIS-IV. Interviewers assessed participants’ anxiety and avoidance of dental procedures on scales that ranged from 0 (none) to 8 (very severe). They also rated patients’ overall distress and impairment due to their dental phobia symptoms and assigned a clinician’s severity rating (CSR) that also ranged from 0 (none) to 8 (very severe); a CSR &gt; 4 indicated that the participant met criteria for diagnosis of dental phobia.</description>

            <description>Before the intervention, participants completed self-report questionnaires and a telephone diagnostic interview. Participants in the immediate treatment group were asked to come in 1.5 hours before a previously scheduled dental appointment to complete the computerized cognitive-behavioral therapy dental anxiety intervention (C-CBT).
The C-CBT consisted of a single-session, one-hour computerized intervention that assisted the participant in building skills for managing his or her dental anxiety.
One month after the dental appointment, participants were contacted by phone and asked to complete follow-up assessments.</description>
