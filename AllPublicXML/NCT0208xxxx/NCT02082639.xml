  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the immunogenicity and safety of two doses of GSK
      Biologicals' HPV-16/18 L1 VLP AS04 vaccine when co-administered with GSK Biologicals' HAV
      vaccine according to 0, 6 month schedule, compared to the administration of either of these
      vaccines alone. The study will ascertain that the immune responses elicited to the two
      vaccines are not adversely impacted compared to when HPV-16/18 L1 VLP AS04 vaccine and HAV
      vaccine are administered alone.

  <overall_status>Withdrawn</overall_status>
  <why_stopped>
    Because the Russian Authorities already approved the 2‐dose Cervarix™ schedule, the study was
    no longer needed for registration and hence it was cancelled.
