      The purpose of this study is to determine whether doxycycline is effective in the treatment
      of relapsed Non Hodgkin Lymphomas (NHL).

    <textblock>
      The long-term objective of this proposal is to develop more effective and less toxic
      therapeutic approaches for relapsed and refractory Non Hodgkin Lymphomas (NHL). Given the
      incurability of indolent lymphomas, innovative strategies for treatment are needed. For
      aggressive lymphomas such as Diffuse Large B Cell Lymphoma (DLBCL), novel treatments are
      particularly relevant since one third of patients have disease that will relapse or is
      refractory to standard therapy. Outcomes for this remaining group of patients are very poor.
      To address this unmet need, we have identified the antimicrobial agent doxycycline as a novel
      drug repurposed for lymphoma treatment based on results from a small molecule screen against
      Diffuse Large B Cell Lymphoma (DLBCL). Through preclinical work in his laboratory, my basic
      science collaborator Dr. Jiyong Zhao has found that doxycycline inhibits proliferation and
      survival in both activated B cell (ABC) type and germinal center B (GCB) type Diffuse Large B
      Cell Lymphoma (DLBCL) cell lines, as well as in Burkitt lymphoma (BL) and follicular lymphoma
      (FL) cell lines. Based on this preliminary data, we propose an open label, single center
      phase II study of doxycycline in patients with relapsed Non Hodgkin Lymphomas (NHL). We have
      selected a dose and schedule (200 mg BID by mouth daily) based on maximum antimicrobial dose
      use, and acceptance of tolerability in several studies. The planned correlative studies
      should help to identify potential biomarkers for response to doxycycline, such as plasma
      matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP9), and provide further insight into potential mechanisms of
      doxycyline action hypothesized from results of prior laboratory studies.

    <measure>Overall Response Rate</measure>
    <time_frame>Three months</time_frame>
    <description>Overall response rate is defined as the percentage of patients with disease progression. Progression is defined as:
Appearance of a new lesion on fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG)-positron emission tomography or computerized tomography
≥50% increase in sum of the product of the node dimensions (SPD) of more than one node or in greatest diameter of any previously identified node &gt;1 cm in its short axis from nadir.
To be considered progressive disease, a lymph node with a diameter of the short axis of less than 1.0 cm must increase by 50% and to a size of 1.5 x 1.5 cm or more than 1.5 cm in the long axis.
At least a 50% increase in the longest diameter of any single previously identified node more than 1 cm in its short axis.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of Patients With Progression Free Survival</measure>
    <time_frame>One year</time_frame>
    <description>Progression free survival is defined as the percentage of patients with stable disease or no death. Stable disease is defined as less than a partial response but is not progressive disease. Partial Response (PR)-At least a 50% decrease in sum of the product of the diameters (SPD) of up to six of the largest dominant nodes or nodal masses as determined byFDG-PET for CT scan. No increase should be observed in the size of other nodes, liver, or spleen. Patients who achieve a CR by the above criteria, but who have persistent morphologic bone marrow involvement will be considered partial responders. When the bone marrow was involved before therapy and a clinical CR was achieved, but with no bone marrow assessment after treatment, patients should be considered partial responders.</description>

  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Exploratory Objective</measure>
    <time_frame>One year</time_frame>
    <description>To investigate change in plasma matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP9) levels as a biomarker of treatment response; to assess plasma matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP9) expression by immunohistochemistry (IHC) and correlate to response in order to test the hypothesis that elevated intratumoral levels of plasma matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP9) can predict response to doxycycline. To assess activation/expression of nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-kb) and Signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT 3) pathways in archived tumor by immunohistochemistry (IHC) to predict response or resistance to doxycycline.</description>

To be considered progressive disease, a lymph node with a diameter of the short axis of less than 1.0 cm must increase by 50% and to a size of 1.5 x 1.5 cm or more than 1.5 cm in the long axis.
At least a 50% increase in the longest diameter of any single previously identified node more than 1 cm in its short axis.</description>

        <title>Percentage of Patients With Progression Free Survival</title>
        <description>Progression free survival is defined as the percentage of patients with stable disease or no death. Stable disease is defined as less than a partial response but is not progressive disease. Partial Response (PR)-At least a 50% decrease in sum of the product of the diameters (SPD) of up to six of the largest dominant nodes or nodal masses as determined byFDG-PET for CT scan. No increase should be observed in the size of other nodes, liver, or spleen. Patients who achieve a CR by the above criteria, but who have persistent morphologic bone marrow involvement will be considered partial responders. When the bone marrow was involved before therapy and a clinical CR was achieved, but with no bone marrow assessment after treatment, patients should be considered partial responders.</description>

        <description>To investigate change in plasma matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP9) levels as a biomarker of treatment response; to assess plasma matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP9) expression by immunohistochemistry (IHC) and correlate to response in order to test the hypothesis that elevated intratumoral levels of plasma matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP9) can predict response to doxycycline. To assess activation/expression of nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-kb) and Signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT 3) pathways in archived tumor by immunohistochemistry (IHC) to predict response or resistance to doxycycline.</description>
