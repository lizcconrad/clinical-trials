  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to evaluate the efficacy of the University of Rochester Medical
      Center's current Massive Transfusion Protocol.

      Upon arrival of trauma level one designated patients the treating team evaluates the
      patient's injuries. If the patient is initiated under the facilities Massive Transfusion
      Protocol and meets other inclusion and exclusion criteria the patient will be enrolled in the
      study. Study procedures include collection of a blood sample following the transfusion of
      each shipment, through shipment 5, of blood products outlined in the current Massive
      Transfusion Protocol.

      Each blood sample will be run on a Thromboelastograph to evaluate the patient's hematostatic
      state through resuscitation. One final blood sample will be collected 24 hours following the
      discontinuation of the Massive Transfusion Protocol and also ran on the thromboelastograph.

      Due to the critical need for medical intervention, consent procedure will be waived at time
      of enrollment. An authorized representative for the patient will be identified and approached
      to obtain consent for use of data collected.
