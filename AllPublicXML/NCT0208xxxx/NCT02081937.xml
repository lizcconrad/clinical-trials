  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients receive anti-CD19-CAR (coupled with CD137 and CD3 zeta signalling
      domains)vector-transduced autologous T cells over a period of 4 or 5 consecutive days in an
      escalating dose. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed intensively for 6
      months, every 3 months for 2 years, and annually thereafter for 10 years.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the safety and efficacy of the chimeric antigen receptor T cells transduced with
      the anti-CD19 (cluster of differentiation antigen 19 ) vector (referred to as CART-19 cells)
      in elderly patients with MCL.

      II. Determine duration of in vivo survival of CART-19 cells. RT-PCR (reverse transcription
      polymerase chain reaction) analysis of whole blood will be used to detect and quantify
      survival of CART-19 TCR (T-cell receptor) zeta:CD137 and TCR zeta cells over time.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      For patients with detectable disease, measure anti-tumor response due to CART-19 cell
      infusions.

      Estimate relative trafficking of CART-19 cells to tumor in bone marrow and lymph nodes.

      Determine if cellular or humoral host immunity develops against the murine anti-CD19, and
      assess correlation with loss of detectable CART-19 (loss of engraftment).

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Male and female with CD19+ relapsed or refractory MCL, and with no available curative
             treatment options (such as autologous or allogeneic SCT) who have limited prognosis
             (several months to &lt; 2 year survival) with currently available therapies will be
             enrolled.

          -  Not eligible or appropriate for conventional allogeneic SCT

          -  Patients who achieve only a partial response to FCR(fludarabine, cyclophosphamide and
             Rituxan) as initial therapy will be eligible.

          -  Beyond 1st CR (complete remission) with relapsed or persistent disease and not
             eligible or appropriate for conventional allogeneic or autologous SCT

          -  Disease responding or stable after most recent therapy (chemotherapy, MoAb, etc...)

          -  Relapsed after prior autologous SCT

          -  Residual disease after primary therapy and not eligible for autologous SCT

          -  Relapsed after prior autologous SCT

          -  Beyond 1st CR with relapsed or persistent disease and not eligible or appropriate of
             conventional allogeneic or autologous SCT

          -  Expected survival &gt; 12 weeks

          -  Creatinine &lt; 2.5 mg/dl

          -  ALT(alanine aminotransferase)/AST (aspartate aminotransferase)&lt; 3x normal

          -  Bilirubin &lt; 2.0 mg/dl

          -  Any relapse after prior autologous SCT will make patient eligible regardless of other
             prior therapy
