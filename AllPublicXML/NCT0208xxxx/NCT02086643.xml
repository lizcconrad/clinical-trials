  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to determine the success rate of the retroclavicular approach for
      the anesthesia of the upper limb in the obese patient population (BMI ≥ 30 kg/m2)

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Classic infraclavicular approach of the brachial plexus involves a needle puncture below the
      clavicle and advancing the needle with a 45-60 degree angle from cephalad to caudad. The aim
      is to advanced the block needle posterior to the axillary artery and to deposit the local
      anesthetic at that point, near the posterior cord. A &quot;U&quot; shaped spread around the artery
      should ensure distribution around all three cords. Ultrasound guidance is highly recommended
      and neurostimulation is optional.

      The retroclavicular approach is a variant to this classical technique. Ultrasound probe is
      positioned initially below the clavicle in a manner similar to the classic approach but is
      then rotated in a clockwise fashion (right arm) or counter-clockwise fashion (left arm) for
      about 25-35 degrees. The puncture site is just behind the clavicle at the most lateral point
      available. If initial entry point is optimal, needle direction is then parallel to ultrasound
      probe. The final aim and position of block needle is identical to classical approach. Entry
      point ensures a parallel alignment of the needle and the ultrasound beam, thus enabling
      almost perfect visualization of both artery, cords and block needle. This is turn optimizes
      safety, rapidity of technique, efficiency and efficacy.

      It is recognized that regional anesthesia is more difficult to perform in obese patients.
      Anatomic landmarks are harder to localize in this population and ultrasound guidance is more
      difficult because of the attenuation of the ultrasound beam by adipose tissue. The
      complication rate of regional techniques is also reported to be higher in the obese patient
      population.

      Since the retroclavicular variant of the infraclavicular approach for the anesthesia of the
      brachial plexus offers a better needle visualisation, we believe that this technique can be
      used successfully in the obese patient population with a low complication rate.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Surgery completion under regional block</measure>
    <time_frame>Success is defined at end of surgery for which block was done, generally within 1 to 3 hours after block is performed</time_frame>
    <description>Success rate is defined as the completion of the intended surgery under regional anesthesia with retroclavicular block without the need for a rescue technique. These techniques are defined as: adding local anesthetic locally by surgeon, rescue intravenous narcotics in excess of 1 microgram per kilogram of patient weight, need for general anesthesia, rescue distal neural blockage by anesthesiologist. Patient sedation with midazolam 1 to 2 mg IV or propofol perfusion up to 50 mcg/kg/min is allowed for patient comfort during the surgery and is not considered a rescue technique.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Sensitive block progression</measure>
    <time_frame>Assessed 10, 20 and 30 minutes after block completion</time_frame>
    <description>Progress of the sensory block in the distribution of the radial, median, ulnar, musculocutaneous, and medial cutaneous nerves of the forearm and hand at 10, 20 and 30 minutes after block completion (mepivacaine-ropivacaine mixed injection). The scale used is: 0:no sensitive block, 1:analgesia (loss of pain but not tactile sensation), 2:anesthesia (loss of pain and tactile sensation).</description>

    <description>Progress of the motor block in the distribution of the radial, median, ulnar, musculocutaneous nerves of the forearm and hand at 10, 20, and 30 minutes after block completion (mepivacaine injection). The scale used is: 0: no motor block, 1: paresis, 2: paralysis. No units are attached to this scale</description>

    <measure>Technique duration</measure>
    <time_frame>Time required in seconds for the retroclavicular block technique completion, generally under 15 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>Number of seconds needed to complete the block, from time of local skin anesthesia until regional block needle removal (local skin anesthesia plus injection of mepivacaine-ropivacaine mixture)</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Needle visualization</measure>
    <time_frame>Assessed after study completion, once all 30 patients will have been completed. Assessment will take place in the first 4 weeks after all 30 patients have been recruited</time_frame>
    <description>Using the Likert standardized scale, two evaluators will individually quantify the ease of needle visualization using the video footage recorded by the ultrasound machine from all the retroclavicular blocks. Likert scale for visualization, is defined as: 1:very bad, 2: bad, 3: adequate, 4:good, 5: very good.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Patient discomfort</measure>
    <time_frame>Assessed 1 minute after block completion</time_frame>
    <description>Using a Visual Analog Scale (VAS), patients will quantify the discomfort they experienced during the block. This assessment will take place in the minutes following mepivacaine injection and block needle withdrawal. The VAS scale is rated from 1-10, 1 being almost no pain and 10 being the worst pain ever.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Patient satisfaction</measure>
    <time_frame>Assessed 48 hours after the block</time_frame>
    <description>Using a VAS, patients will quantify their satisfaction with the retroclavicular technique throughout the study period.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Late Complication Rate</measure>
    <time_frame>Assessed 48 hours after the block</time_frame>
    <description>With a phone call to the patient at 48 hours after injection of mepivacaine-ropivacaine mixture, complications will be searched for (pain at puncture site, paresthesia or paresis in the operated arm, signs of infection at puncture site such as redness or purulent discharge). Response is classified as YES or NO. No units attached to this scale. If patient reports paresthesia or paresis, further questioning over the phone will determine which nerve or cord is involved.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Duration of the Block's Effects</measure>
    <time_frame>Assessed 48 hours after the block</time_frame>
    <description>Duration of the block will be evaluated using 3 criteria: patient's subjective opinion of when the block receded (time of the day), time at which first oral analgesia is taken, and time of first onset of pain. Units involved is time (for example &quot;3 pm&quot;.)</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Use of narcotic for tourniquet pain</measure>
    <time_frame>Assessed while surgery in under process</time_frame>
    <description>If at any point during the surgery, patient complains of tourniquet pain, this will be noted as well as the analgesia given. Units is time of pain (&quot;3 pm&quot;) and analgesia given (&quot;micrograms of fentanyl&quot;).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Rate of Neurostimulation Usage</measure>
    <time_frame>Assessed during the block</time_frame>
    <description>At the discretion of the anesthesiologist performing the block, neurostimulation can be used to supplement ultrasound guidance. This will be recorded as a YES or NO (neurostimulation used or not). No units attached to this rate.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Failure because of poor ultrasound visualization</measure>
    <time_frame>Assessed during the performance of the nerve block</time_frame>
    <description>If, for a given patient, during ultrasound guidance the anatomic structure are too poorly visualized to safely perform the block, no puncture will be attempted and the technique will be considered a failure; an alternative anesthesia technique will be proposed to the patient.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Early Complication Rate</measure>
    <time_frame>Assessed during block performance, throughout surgery and in the PACU. Generally during a period of 4-6 hours after block completion</time_frame>
