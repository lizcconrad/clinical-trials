      The ultimate clinical aim of this proposed phase I trial is to evaluate the toxicity and
      determine the recommended phase II dose of combining the effect of LDFWART following
      administration of docetaxel for 6 cycles in patients with recurrent platinum-resistant
      ovarian cancer.

    <description>This study has 6 treatment cycles given at 3 weeks intervals ± 3 days. A cycle is defined as 1 treatment of morning Docetaxel and afternoon Low Dose Fractionated Whole Abdominal Radiation Therapy (LDFWART).

    <description>Chemotherapy will consist of 6 cycles of Docetaxel. Each cycle will follow standard of care and will be scheduled every 3 weeks ± 3 days. Chemotherapy should be administered in the morning to allow 6-8 hours before Radiation Therapy. On Day 1 of each cycle, chemotherapy will consist of Docetaxel 60 mg/m² infused intravenously over 30-60 minutes (with premedication of dexamethasone 10 mg given IV 30-60 minutes prior to docetaxel administration).</description>

             document.

        Exclusion Criteria:

             extremities above the knees.

          -  2. Patients who have received prior radiation therapy to the head, neck, or lower
             extremities below the knees if greater than 3 years prior to study entry.

          -  5. Patients who have been diagnosed with another prior malignant tumor within 3 years
             of study entry, excluding non-melanoma skin cancer and carcinoma in situ of the
             cervix.

          -  6. Patients with prior history of a severe hypersensitivity reaction to paclitaxel
             (polysorbate 80-Cremophor).
