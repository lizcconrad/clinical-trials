  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study will enroll 110 overweight and obese adolescents ages 11-16 in a lifestyle
      modification program focusing on dietary modification and exercise. Parents will be
      randomized into control and motivational interviewing-based intervention groups. The primary
      hypothesis is that adolescents whose parents are in the intervention group will have improved
      compliance, weight loss and health outcomes compared with adolescents whose parents do not
      receive the intervention.

      Adolescents will participate in a 6-month intensive lifestyle modification that includes a
      structured exercise program, nutrition education and dietary modification and behavioral
      support, followed by a 6-month maintenance phase with monthly booster sessions. Parents will
      be randomized to participate in 4 dedicated &quot;pre-treatment&quot; parent psychoeducational sessions
      vs. control (no psychoeducational sessions). The sessions will explore parents' feelings
      about participation in a weight management program, explore their reasons for wanting to make
      behavioral changes, and enhance motivation. All parents will participate in monthly parent
      support groups while their adolescents are participating in the intervention phase of the
      study. The 6-month adolescent intervention will include biweekly sessions with a registered
      dietitian for dietary education; biweekly interactive group discussion sessions on topics
      pertaining to motivation, strategies for changing health behaviors, setting and keeping goals
      and dealing with peer pressure; and exercise sessions three times a week with 30 minutes of
      cardiovascular exercise and 30 minutes of strength training each session. Comprehensive
      assessments, including nutrition, behavior and exercise assessments, laboratory work, body
      composition measurements and medical assessments will be conducted at baseline, 6 months and
      12 months.
