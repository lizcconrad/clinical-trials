  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main objective of this study is to demonstrate the efficiency ( cost-effectiveness ) of a
      telemedicine system : eNephro Application , compared with traditional care in the management
      of chronic renal failure in different populations :

        -  population 1 : Patients with CKD stage 3B- 4 , the combined endpoint achievement of
           target blood pressure and proteinuria .

        -  population 2 : Patients with ESRD treated by ambulatory dialysis , the cumulative
           duration of hospitalization in short-stay

        -  population 3 : Patients with ESRD treated with Renal Transplantation , the cumulative
           duration of unplanned short stay

      Two statistical analysis will be done :

        -  a main analysis for the one year initial follow-up for each patient

        -  a secondary analysis for the one year initial follow-up estended by one year (proposed
           to each patient at the end of the initial follow-up), that is a 2 years period.

      The intervention tested in this study is a telemedicine system which is a collaborative and
      expert system, consisting of:

        -  A dynamic shared medical record for the collection of administrative , medical,
           biological and clinical data for each patient. All health professionals can access the
           folder and fill in the support. It is the same for patients treated at home.

        -  A secure messaging for communication between health professionals and between patients
           and health professionals

        -  Expert systems analyzing data from each patient

        -  A management tool of therapeutic education

      Each patient and whatever the group will perform as part of its monitoring of the CKD
      assessments at baseline , 6 months, 12 months, 18 months (Populations 1 and 2) and end of
      study (24 months). These evaluations are about compliance, quality of life, anxiety -
      depression state. To enhance costs the point of view retained will be health insurance's
      point of view. Among the various costs, only direct costs are considered: disease management,
      hospitalizations, consultations in hospitals and private practice, prescribed medical
      transportation , home visits by health professionals, additional assessments related to the
      evaluated intervention. A probabilistic matching with the data bases of the National
      Information System of the Social Insurance will be performed. In addition, the acceptability
      of the system of telemedicine by patients in the intervention and health professionals will
      be also evaluated.

      Three populations are recruited with the following inclusion criteria:

        -  age â‰¥ 18 years;

        -  ability to use a tablet device (alone or with assistance);

        -  population 1: stabilised stage 3B or stage 4 CKD with nephrology management of less than
           3 years;

        -  population 2: stage 5D CKD treated by homecare peritoneal dialysis (PD) or out centre
           haemodialysis (HD);

        -  population 3: stage 5T CKD treated by renal transplantation for 3 to 12 months.

      Non-inclusion criteria are:

        -  dialysis after renal transplantation failure;

        -  organ transplantation other than kidney;
