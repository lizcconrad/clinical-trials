    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study was to investigate whether combined assessment of lumbopelvic
      control during sagittal and frontal plane motion (using two common clinical observational
      assessments) discriminates between people with and without LBP than single plane assessment
      alone. It was hypothesized that the two tests used in combination (multiplanar) would perform
      better than each test used independently (single planar) in accurately discriminating patient
      cases from healthy controls.
