  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether priority-based patient navigation will
      improve patient satisfaction, quality of life (QOL), and depression when compared to
      screening-and-referral for socioeconomically disadvantaged women's health patients with
      depression. The investigators goal is to establish patient-driven, effective, generalizable,
      and disseminable interventions to reduce depression-related disparities and improve outcomes.

      -  In this comparative effectiveness study, 200 participants who are patients at the
           University of Rochester Women's Health Practice or Highland Woman's Health and report
           significant depressive symptoms will be randomized to either PSP (Personal Support for
           Progress) or ESR (Enhanced Screening and Referral). Participants assigned to PSP will
           work with a patient navigator to prioritize their concerns, develop a personalized care
           plan, and implement their plan. Participants assigned to ESR will receive a personalized
           report of community resources that may be helpful for their identified needs.

        -  The investigators will use a simple 1:1 randomized design with treatment assignment
           being conducted using a random number generator. All analyses will follow an
           intent-to-treat protocol, such that all participants randomized will be followed for
           data collection and analyzed according to her randomized condition

        -  Each participant will be assessed 4 times for outcome changes: at baseline, post
           treatment (4 months), and two follow up ( at 7 and 10 months).

        -  Assessments are self report on iPads and they are linked directly to a Red Cap database.

    <description>The navigator provides up to 4 months outreach and support to implement the personal care plan. Patients determine the preferred frequency and type of contact with the navigator. . At the end of the four months, the patient and navigator will review the personal care plan, and the navigator will work with the patient as to how she can continue progress through accessing other supports and resources as needed.</description>
