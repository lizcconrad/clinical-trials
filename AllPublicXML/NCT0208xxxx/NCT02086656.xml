      Capecitabine, oxaliplatin, irinotecan and bevacizumab as perioperative strategy of borderline
      and/or high risk resectable colorectal cancer liver metastases
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Previous studies demonstrated a significant association between tumor regression grade of
      hepatic colorectal metastases (TRG1: complete pathological response; TRG2: major pathological
      response; TRG3: partial pathological response; versus TRG4-5 no pathological response) and
      outcome in terms of survival after neoadjuvant treatment. In particular, retrospective data
      showed an association between oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy and improvement of grade and
      percentage of tumor regression; moreover, the addition of Bevacizumab seems to improve TRG
      over chemotherapy alone, conferring also a protection against liver damage due to
      chemotherapy-induced sinusoidal obstruction syndrome.

      This is the rationale that induced us to carry out an evaluation and feasibility assessment
      of a perioperative approach with COI-B regimen in patients affected by high risk or
      borderline resectable colorectal liver metastases, with or without previous resection of
      primary tumor.

- To evaluate the activity of the regimen with regards to major/complete pathological response. Major/complete pathological response is measured by pathologist in terms of tumor regression grade (TRG) as described by Rubbia-Brandt L, Annals of Oncology 2007 (percentage of vial residual cells 0-10%).</description>

          -  Liver-limited metastases or metastases mainly (â‰¥80% total disease burden) limited to
             the liver with extrahepatic disease judged resectable concomitantly or sequentially.
             Primary tumor may be resected or not, but patient must not be symptomatic for T.

          -  Previous adjuvant therapy is allowed if it had been terminated for at least 6 months.

          -  Previous first line treatment (irinotecan or oxaliplatin containing regimen) with
