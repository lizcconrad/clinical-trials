             congenital knee pathology

          -  American Society of Anesthesiologists Physical Status Classification System â‰¤ 3

          -  Medically stable as determined by the Investigator based on pre-study medical history,
             physical/neurological examination, clinical laboratory tests, and 12-lead
             electrocardiogram (ECG) findings

          -  Body Mass Index of 18-40 kg/m2

          -  Stable medical regimen for at least 1 month before randomization

          -  Able to read and understand study instructions in English, and willing and able to
             comply with all study procedures

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  More than 2 other current focal areas of pain, none greater in intensity than the
             target knee and no other active chronic pain conditions that would compromise
             operative knee pain evaluation

          -  Inflammatory arthridities (e.g., rheumatoid arthritis, lupus, ankylosing spondylitis,
             psoriatic arthritis), with the exception of clinically stable/non-active gout that
             does not affect the knee and does not interfere with walking

          -  Operative arthroscopy in the surgical knee in the last 4 months (except for meniscal
             repair which will be no shorter than 6 months before randomization) or in the
             contralateral knee in the last 2 months (or 3 months for meniscal repair), or other
             prior surgery in either knee in the last 12 months, except for diagnostic arthroscopy

          -  Planned use of any of the following for TKA: general anesthesia using potent
             inhalational agents, peripheral nerve block (i.e., femoral nerve block), neuroaxial
             (intrathecal or epidural) opioids postoperatively, or knee capsule injections

          -  Received aspirin or any nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) prior to
             randomization within the washout period required by the surgical team for surgery with

          -  Daily use of benzodiazepines in the 3 months prior to randomization (unless used for

             Parkinson's, Multiple Sclerosis)

          -  Current active depression symptoms

          -  Has had a change in dose or regimen of SSRIs or SNRIs for depression within 1 month of
             randomization

          -  Mini Mental State Exam score &lt; 24 at Screening

          -  Severe pulmonary disease; if symptomatic sleep apnea is currently treated with
             continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) or bi-level positive airway pressure
             (BIPAP), use must be continued postoperatively at least during the inpatient period.
             Patients with sleep apnea associated with a history of postoperative delirium are
             excluded.

          -  Current evidence of alcohol abuse or history of alcohol-related complications within 1
