      This a Phase I, Open-Label, Multicentre Study to assess the safety, tolerability,
      pharmacokinetics and preliminary anti-tumour activity of gefitinib in combination with
      MEDI4736 (anti PD-L1) in Subjects with Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The study consists
      of two phases: Escalation phase and an expansion phase to be conducted in locally advanced or
      metastatic NSCLC subjects
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In Escalation phase: MEDI4736 and gefitinib in NSCLC subjects In Expansion phase: Subjects
      with EGFR mutation positive locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC will be enrolled in
      expansion arms. Initiation of expansion arms with the recommended dose of MEDI4736 in
      combination with gefitinib will be based on an adequate safety and tolerability profile of
      the combination from the escalation phase.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Escalation Phase: safety and tolerability: AEs, laboratory data, vital signs, ECG changes and Echo. Expansion Phase: safety and tolerability of the recommended dose for MEDI4736; AEs, laboratory data, vital signs, ECG changes and Echo.</measure>
    <time_frame>From first dose of study treatment until 90 days after the last dose, assessed up to 32 months</time_frame>
    <description>AEs: Type, incidence, severity, seriousness and relationship to study medications of adverse events (AE) (graded by the National Cancer Institute [NCI] Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events [CTCAE]; Safety Labs: Blood and urine samples for determination of clinical chemistry, hematology, coagulation, thyroid function tests and urinalysis will be taken at the visits; any laboratory abnormalities, and including dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs), ECG measurements and Creatinine Clearance</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>To obtain a preliminary assessment of the anti-tumour activity of gefitinib in combination with MEDI4736 by evaluation of tumour response</measure>
    <time_frame>From baseline assessment to disease progression, assessed up to 30 months</time_frame>
    <description>At each visit subjects will be programmatically assigned a RECIST visit response of CR, PR, SD or PD depending on the status of their disease compared to baseline and previous assessments; Objective response rate: the percentage of subjects who have at least one visit response of CR or PR prior to any evidence of progression . Disease control rate: the percentage of subjects who have at least one visit response of CR or PR or SD prior to any evidence of progression. Progression Free Survival (PFS) : the time from start of study treatment to the first documentation of objective disease progression (PD) or death from any cause.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>To determine the immunogenicity of MEDI4736 in combination with gefitinib: anti-drug antibodies (ADAs)</measure>
    <time_frame>From first dose of study treatment until 90 days after the last dose, assessed up to 32 months</time_frame>
    <description>Assessed by evaluating the number and percentage of subjects who develop detectable anti-drug antibodies (ADAs). The impact of ADAs on overall MEDI4736 PK will also be evaluated.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>To determine the pharmacokinetics of MEDI4736</measure>
    <time_frame>From first dose of study treatment until 90 days after the last dose, assessed up to 32 months</time_frame>
    <description>Individual MEDI4736 concentrations will be tabulated by dose cohort along with descriptive statistics. Noncompartmental PK data analysis will be performed</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>To assess MEDI4736 pharmacodynamics in subjects receiving MEDI4736 in combination with gefitinib.</measure>
    <time_frame>From first dose of study treatment until 90 days after the last dose, assessed up to 32 months</time_frame>
    <description>PD-L1 levels before and after treatment with MEDI4736 will be measured to evaluate its association with response to treatment with MEDI4736 and clinical outcome</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>To determine overall survival (OS) in expansion Arm 1 and Arm 1a patients</measure>
    <time_frame>From final safety follow-up visit after last dose until 1 year after the final patient discontinues investigational product (initial Medi4736).</time_frame>
    <description>Survival information may be obtained via telephone contact with the patient, patients family or by checking the patients notes, hospital records, contacting the patients general practitioner or public death registry, where it is possible to do so under applicable local laws.</description>
