  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Fit Study is a three-year, cluster-randomized controlled trial that will evaluate the
      impact of school-based body mass index (BMI) screening and reporting on child health.
      Seventy-nine California schools will be randomized to one of three groups: 1) BMI screening
      and reporting, 2) BMI screening, and 3) no BMI screening or reporting (control).
      Investigators will assess the impact of BMI reporting on students' BMI trajectories over
      three years. Investigators will also assess the impact of BMI screening on weight-based
      teasing, feelings of stigmatization, and weight-control behaviors among students.

      The Fit Study is a three-year, cluster-randomized controlled trial that will evaluate the
      impact of school-based body mass index (BMI) screening and reporting on childhood obesity and
      psychosocial outcomes. This study will take place during the 2014-15, 2015-16, and 2016-17
      school years. Seventy-nine schools across California will be randomized to one of three
      groups: 1) BMI screening and reporting, 2) BMI screening, and 3) no BMI screening or
      reporting (control). Schools randomized to Groups 1 and 2 will conduct height and weight
      measurements annually with their 3rd-8th grade students. Group 1 and 2 schools will also
      administer the five fitness assessments (mile run or PACER test, curl-ups, push-ups, trunk
      lift, and sit and reach) annually with their 5th-8th grade students. In the fall of Years 2
      and 3, Group 1 schools will mail a report home to parents with students' results from the
      previous spring. All 3rd and 4th grade parents will receive a report with BMI results only.
      Investigators will randomize the parents of 5th-8th grade students to receive a report that
      provides BMI results only or one that provides BMI results with results from the five fitness
      assessments. Schools randomized to Group 3 will not conduct height and weight measurements
      with their students during Years 1 and 2.

      Each fall, investigators will administer a survey to 4th-8th grade students from all schools.
      This survey will assess weight-based teasing, feelings of stigmatization, and weight-control
      behaviors among students. The student survey will also ask questions about students'
      experiences having their heights and weights measured at school. During all years,
      investigators will mail a survey home a subsample of parents to assess parent behaviors
      related to their child's physical activity and nutrition, as well as parent reactions to the
      BMI report. Finally, schools will complete a survey in Spring 2017 to assess their nutrition-
      and physical activity-related policies and programs.

    <description>Investigators will assess change in BMI z-score over 3 years between students in Group 1 (BMI screening + reporting) and students in Group 2 (BMI screening only). Primary analyses will be limited to students who were overweight (BMI â‰¥ 85th percentile) at baseline (Spring 2015). Investigators will also compare change in BMI z-score over 3 years between Group 1 students whose parents received the BMI-only report and Group 1 students whose parents received the BMI + fitness report. In both sets of analyses, ethnicity will be used as an effect modifier.</description>
