  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Each subject will consume (in a randomized fashion) both the intervention beverage (nitrate
      solution) and the placebo, separated by a 1 wk washout period. The investigators will test
      the hypothesis that 7 days of dietary nitrate supplementation will improve metabolic
      efficiency in patients with COPD compared to the placebo.
