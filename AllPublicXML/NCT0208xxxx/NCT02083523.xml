      This study will use a pilot test format to examine the efficacy of a brief Motivational
      Interviewing (MI) intervention developed by the investigator Dr. Douglas Smith called CHOICE
      (Compassionate Helpers Openly Inviting Client Empowerment)with youth referred for substance
      abuse assessments to substance abuse treatment agencies in Chicago and Urbana, IL.

      This study will use a pilot test format to examine the efficacy of a brief Motivational
      Interviewing (MI) intervention developed by the investigator Dr. Douglas Smith called CHOICE
      (Compassionate Helpers Openly Inviting Client Empowerment)with youth referred for substance
      abuse assessments to substance abuse treatment agencies in Chicago and Urbana, IL. The study
      will have two arms: one group will receive the standard CHOICE Motivational Interview (MI)
      while the second group will receive the CHOICE Motivational Interview with a Normative
      Feedback component, called CHOICE+ (CHOICE Plus). The hypothesis is that there will be no
      difference in outcomes between those that receive the standard CHOICE and those that receive
      the CHOICE+ MI.

    <description>The Motivational Interview, or MI, (15-30 minutes) was provided after initial substance use disorder assessments but prior to treatment admission. I twas facilitated by a computer generated report and included: an orientation to the session, discussion of the participants' strengths, an agenda setting procedure, a review of concerns, and a session summary. Therapists conveyed empathy, used reflective listening, tried to elicit and reinforce change talk elements, and elicited action steps from the participants.</description>

    <description>The Motivational Interview with Normative Feedback, or MI + NF, condition/intervention included all procedures described for the MI condition. Additionally, in the MI + NF condition/intervention, the participants' days of marijuana and alcohol use were compared to two sets of norms ( age specific or level of care specific) available for treatment attending youth. Therapists used whichever norm provided a greater contrast with participants' use.</description>

    <description>NOrmative Feedback (NF) contrasts and individual's substance use to available norms for one's reference group (i.e., descriptive norms.) Essentially, NF highlights how an individual's behavior is non-normative, which in turn, is thought to lead to reduced substance use.</description>

    <description>The Motivational Interview (MI) addresses ambivalence about change. It's effects are mediated by how well counselors evoke change talk, or in-session client utterances about the: need for; commitment to; ability to; or steps needed, to change.</description>
