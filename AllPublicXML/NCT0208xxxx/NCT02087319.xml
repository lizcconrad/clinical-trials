      The purpose of study is to examine the advantage of PRP on hair loss and male pattern
      baldness. The investigators will inject PRP into the scalp regions where with little or no
      hair, and evaluate the effect and efficiency of PRP on human hair growth.

    <textblock>
      Hair loss is a disorder in which the hair undergoes aberration growth cycles and falls out
      from scalp. A number of factors like hormones, genetic factors, diet, endocrine
      abnormalities, systemic illnesses, drug intake, and hair shaft abnormalities may cause hair
      loss. Androgen alopecia or male pattern baldness is the most common cause of hair loss caused
      by progressive shortening of the anagen and increased number of hair follicles in telogen,
      which has a significant influence on psychological distress.

      Except medical treatment and baldness surgery, a new interest in treating hair loss and
      baldness has been stimulated by using platelet plasma growth factors obtained from the
      patient's own platelet-rich plasma (PRP). PRP is a portion of plasma fraction of autologous
      blood having a high concentration of thrombocytes, and can be activated by Thrombin to
      release multiple growth factors, including platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), vascular
      endothelial growth factor (VEGF), epidermal growth factor (EGF), insulin-like growth factor
      (IGF), and transforming growth factor beta (TGF-Î²). PRP is known for the capacity to
      stimulate cell proliferation and differentiation. The action of platelet plasma growth
      factors on the development of hair follicles has already been established. PRP has also been
      shown to increase the yield of implanted follicular units during male baldness surgery.

      Our study will focus on the advantage of PRP for the treatment of hair loss and male pattern
      baldness. PRP from autologous blood can be mixed with thrombin in appropriate ratio and
      inject into the regions on scalp which is interested. We will track and evaluate regularly
      the effect and efficiency of PRP on human hair growth.
