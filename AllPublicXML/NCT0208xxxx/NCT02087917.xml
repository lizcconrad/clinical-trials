  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To determine the efficacy of HS-25 (5, 10, 20 or 30 mg) in reducing low density
      lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C) levels after a 4-week period of treatment in adults with
      primary hypercholesterolemia.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a 4-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study designed to assess the
      effects of the cholesterol absorption inhibitor HS-25 on LDL-C levels in adults who have
      untreated LDL-C levels ranging from 130-189 mg/dL and fasting triglyceride levels &lt; 350
      mg/dL. Eligibility is restricted to 18-65 year old men or women who are using a highly
      effective birth control method or are not of childbearing potential. Patients with diabetes,
      a history of myocardial infarction or other clinical evidence of atherosclerotic vascular
      disease are not eligible for participation in the study.

             inclusion in the study.

          -  TG ≤ 350 mg/dL on a cholesterol lowering diet but no lipid modifying drug treatment
