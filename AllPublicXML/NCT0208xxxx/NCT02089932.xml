  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The duration of sensory block after single dose of long acting local anesthetics is not
      sufficient to avoid the postoperative use of opioids. Alpha-2 adrenoceptor agonists such as
      clonidine have been shown to increase the duration of peripheral nerve block. Dexmedetomidine
      is a more potent and selective α-2-adrenoceptor compared to clonidine. To the best of our
      knowledge, the use of Dexmedetomidine in different dose levels as adjuvant to local
      anesthetic was not previously reported for femoral nerve block.

    <description>the time interval between the onset of the sensory block and the complete resolution of normal sensation. Over a period of 30 min after injection of the study medications and every 2 hours postoperatively till complete recovery of normal sensation; a blinded investigator will assess sensory block with pinprick test using a 3-point scale: 0 ═ complete loss of sensation, 1 ═ partial loss of sensation and 2 ═ normal sensation. Pinprick test will be done in comparison to the contralateral area at the sensory distribution of the femoral nerve.</description>
