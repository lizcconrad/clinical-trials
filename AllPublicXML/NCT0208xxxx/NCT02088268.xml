      The purpose of this study is to focus on the effect of platelet-rich-plasma on diabtic ulcer
      foot, as adjuvant treatment along with the standard care of chronic diabetic, and evaluate
      the efficiency and the clinical application of PRP on serious wound healing.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Diabetes is a condition in which the body dose not effectively use sugar so that there is too
      much sugar in the blood. It is estimated that 15% of the diabetics suffer from diabetic food
      ulcers at some point. The healing process can be slow and easily to be infected with some
      pathogens so the patients are at risk in amputation. The wound healing process is a complex
      mechanism involves the interaction of molecular signals and different cell types. Platelets
      play important roles in wound healing. When injury occurs platelets are activated with
      thrombin and clot is formed. In addition to the function of hemostasis, activated platelets
      release many growth factors that trigger angiogenesis, extracellular matrix production and
      cytokine release, which is need for wound healing.

      Platelet-rich plasma (PRP) is a portion of plasma fraction of autologous blood having a high
      concentration of thrombocytes. Thrombin induces the activation of PRP and results in the
      release of multiple growth factors, including platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), vascular
      endothelial growth factor (VEGF), epidermal growth factor (EGF), insulin-like growth factor
      (IGF), and transforming growth factor beta (TGF-β). PRP is known for the capacity to
      stimulate cell proliferation and differentiation. PRP can also interact with macrophage to
      improve tissue healing and regeneration, and exhibit potent activities against several kinds
      of pathogens.

      Our study will focus on the advantage of PRP for aiding wound healing for diabetes. PRP from
      autologous blood can be mixed with thrombin in appropriate ratio and inject into the sites
      around the wound, as adjuvant treatment along with the standard care of chronic diabetic. The
      wound will be checked 1 to 2 times each week for the evaluation of PRP on clinical
      application.
