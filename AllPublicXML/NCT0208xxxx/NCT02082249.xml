        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Subjects completing 12 weeks treatment in Study M12-921 who would benefit from
             long-term treatment from ABT-SLV187. Alternatively, subjects who (i) participated in
             the Phase 2 Study M12-925 (ii) would, in the opinion of the Investigator, benefit from
             ABT-SLV187 treatment in the Study M12-923, (iii) did not discontinue the M12-925 Study
             due to safety reason, and (iv) meet all entry requirements. Lastly, subjects who
             completed another ABT-SLV187 study (e.g., Study M12-927) in South Korea.

          2. The subject must be able to understand the nature of the study and must provide
             written informed consent prior to the conduct of any study procedures (including any
             changes occurring in the subject's current therapeutic regimen).

          3. The subject must be willing to continue on treatment.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Subject is enrolled in another clinical trial.

          2. Psychiatric, neurological or behavioral disorders that may interfere with the ability
             of subjects to give informed consent, or interfere with the conduct of the study.

          3. Medical, laboratory, or surgical issues deemed by the Investigator to be clinically
             significant and in the opinion of the PI, would be a contraindication to continued
             levodopa therapy.

          4. Uncooperative attitude or reasonable likelihood for non-compliance with the protocol.

          5. Subject has current significant suicidal ideation as evidenced by answering &quot;yes&quot; to
             questions 4 or 5 on the suicidal ideation portion of the Columbia-Suicide Severity
             Rating Scale completed at the Week 12 Visit of Study M12-921 or at the Baseline Visit
             of the current study for M12-925 or M12-927 study subjects.

          6. Consideration by the Investigator, for any reason, that the subject is an unsuitable
             candidate to continue to receive ABT-SLV187.
