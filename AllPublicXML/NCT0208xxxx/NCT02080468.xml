  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to assess the effect of ethinyl estradiol
      (EE)/norgestimate, a weak cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4 inhibitor, on the pharmacokinetics (PK)
      of lomitapide and 2 primary metabolites, M1 and M3.

    <textblock>
      This study will be a single center, randomized, open-label, 2 arm study to evaluate the
      effects of EE/norgestimate, a weak CYP3A4 inhibitor, on the PK of lomitapide in healthy
      female subjects when EE/norgestimate is administered simultaneously with lomitapide and when
      administration is separated by 12 hours.
