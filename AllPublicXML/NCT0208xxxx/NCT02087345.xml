  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Dental erosions, the chemical dissolution of enamel without bacterial involvement, are
      considered to be an established complication of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) by the
      Montreal global consensus statement. Given the high prevalence of dental erosions and the
      absence of any pH-impedance data or medical management guidelines for GERD-associated dental
      erosions, reflux characteristics will be characterized using questionnaires, endoscopy and
      esophageal pH-impedance testing, in successive patients dental erosions referred by dentists
      for evaluation of GERD. For assessment of the role of additional factors besides H+ activity
      in the refluxate, a sample of gastric juice will be aspirated during endoscopy and frozen for
      analysis of pepsin and other proteases. Prognostic factors for progression of dental erosions
      will be determined by repeating the evaluation after chronic dosing with esomeprazole 20mg
      twice-daily, which is prescribed to all patients.
