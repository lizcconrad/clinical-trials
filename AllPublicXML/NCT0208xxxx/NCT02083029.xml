  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators' hypothesis is that dysregulation of autonomic function, as revealed during
      a simulated dive reflex, may result in an attenuation of the heart rate response to a greater
      degree in asthmatics who collapse during exacerbations of asthma than that seen in healthy
      individuals and in asthmatics without a history of syncope. The investigators will test this
      by assessing autonomic function through a dive reflex protocol.

    <textblock>
      Tests of autonomic function are notoriously difficult to evaluate. Here the investigators
      required a well validated test of the dynamic cardiovascular response to an abrupt stimulus
      and considered the diving reflex the most reliable and practical. In man, the diving reflex
      acts as a vestigial reflex aimed at conserving oxygen storage during apnoeic facial
      immersion. Facial immersion activates a vagally-induced bradycardia and a sympathetically
      activated alpha-adrenergic peripheral vasoconstriction and hypertension. There are two
      triggers of the diving reflex, facial immersion in water and breath hold, both of which can
      impact on heart rate attenuation. Facial immersion can be further delineated into exposure to
      cold, wetness and pressure.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Syncopal Asthmatics: Asthmatic patients with a history of syncope during asthma
             exacerbations

          -  Normal Asthmatics: Asthmatic patients on BTS Step 3 treatment (LABA/ICS) with no
             history of syncope during exacerbations

          -  Normal volunteers: no history of airways disease or syncope

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  â€¢ Subjects who are pregnant, or have pacemakers in situ are excluded from this study.

               -  Subjects with significant cardiovascular disease are excluded from this study.

               -  Those who are non-English speakers and special groups (i.e. mentally ill,
                  children under 16 years of age, and those suffering from dementia) will be
                  excluded.

               -  No test will be performed on any subject during an acute worsening of asthma or
                  upper airway infection. If the subject has had an upper airway infection in the
                  last three weeks. Another appointment should be made unless the subject is
                  unwilling to come back, in which case testing should continue. The number of days
                  elapsed since the end of the airway infection should be recorded.

               -  If the subject smokes: citric acid or capsaicin challenges must be performed at
                  least one hour after the last cigarette has been smoked.

               -  Subjects taking beta-blockers and calcium antagonists will be excluded from this
                  study. No beta agonists should be taken within 6 hours of starting this study.

               -  If the subject has taken any over the counter (OTC) cough mixture within the last
                  twelve hours: If the subject is willing to come back another time for challenge
                  testing, another appointment should be made. If the subject is unwilling to
                  return another time, testing should proceed and the medication used recorded.

               -  If the subject has had any food or drink products containing caffeine or menthol
                  within the last hour. If the subject is unwilling to wait for 1 hour before
                  starting the test, the subject should return another time. If the subject is
                  unwilling to return another time, testing should proceed and the medication used
                  recorded.

               -  If the participant is currently involved in research, or within 3 months of
                  participation in any type of research, they will be excluded from this study.
