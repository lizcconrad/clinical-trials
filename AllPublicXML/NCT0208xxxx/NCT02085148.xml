    <textblock>
      Dose escalation phase of the study :

      To define the safety profile, maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and recommended phase II dose
      (RP2D) of regorafenib administered orally as a single agent in a 3-weeks-on/1- week-off
      schedule in repeating cycles of 28 days in pediatric subjects with solid malignant tumors
      recurrent or refractory to standard therapy. To characterize the pharmacokinetics (PK) of
      regorafenib The dose escalation phase of the study has been completed.

      Expansion phase:

      To define the safety profile, MTD and the RP2D of regorafenib administered orally in
      combination with backbone chemotherapy (vincristine and irinotecan) at relapse in pediatric
      subjects with rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS) and other solid malignant tumors recurrent or refractory
      to standard therapy.

             known CNS metastases are excluded.

          -  Subjects with uncontrolled baseline hypertension higher than Grade 1 NCICTCAE v. 4.0

          -  Subjects with evidence or history of disorders of coagulation or thrombosis

          -  Cardiac abnormalities and cardiac arrhythmias requiring anti-arrhythmic therapy (beta
             blockers or digoxin are permitted)

          -  History of organ allograft (including allogeneic bone marrow transplant)

             investigator or a dependent person (e.g. employee or student of the investigational
             site)

          -  Unresolved toxicity higher than NCI-CTCAE v. 4.0 Grade 1 attributed to any prior
             therapy/procedure (excluding alopecia, chemotherapy-induced ototoxicity, Grade 2
             chemotherapy-induced neuropathy and, as per above eligibility criteria, anemia with
             hemoglobin ≥ 8 mg/dL and ANC ≥ 1.0 x 10 9/L ).
