      The purpose of this study is to determine the effectiveness of dry needling in improving
      ankle range of motion and functional outcomes. There have been an increasing number of
      studies on dry needling as an intervention for pain but none thus far that have studied
      functional outcome measures of the ankle. The study will include healthy male subjects
      between the ages of 18-30 years old randomized in to 3 intervention groups of: dry needling
      of the triceps surae, triceps surae stretching only, dry needling and stretching. The
      subjects who receive dry needling as an intervention will have the trigger point identified
      and dry needling performed while under musculoskeletal ultrasound visualization. The subjects
      will undergo pre and post intervention testing including Lower Quarter Y-Balance test,
      passive ankle dorsiflexion, closed chain half kneeling dorsiflexion, standing dorsiflexion,
      deep squat, multisegmental flexion as well as Marx Activity Level Scale. There will be 3 days
      between the initial testing/intervention and follow up. These outcomes will be the primary
      variables of interest. Ultrasound, Y balance testing, self stretching, and range of motion
      measurements are safe and pose no risk to the subject. Dry Needling has been found to be very
      safe and effective in the hands of physical therapists with a calculated risk of adverse
      events to be less than 0.04%.
