      This study is designed to estimate the two-way drug interaction between DCV and DTG as a drug
      interaction between DTG and DCV is expected to be low and this study is to be performed as
      confirmation. This will be a single-center, open-label, three-period, crossover study in
      healthy adult subjects. This study to describe and compare steady-state plasma DTG and DCV
      pharmacokinetics following administration of DTG 50 mg q24h with and without DCV 60 mg q24h
      and following administration of DCV 60 mg q24h with and without DTG 50 mg q24h also the
      safety and tolerability was assessed after a repeat dose DTG 50 mg q24h with or without DCV
      60 mg q24h and after a repeat dose DCV 60 mg q24h with and without DTG 50 mg q24h

          -  The subject has participated in a clinical trial and has received an investigational
             product within the following time period prior to the first dosing day in the current
             study: 30 days, 5 half-lives or twice the duration of the biological effect of the
             investigational product (whichever is longer).

          -  Exposure to more than four new chemical entities within 12 months prior to the first
