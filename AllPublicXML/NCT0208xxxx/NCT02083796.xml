  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The hypothesis of this study is that thoracic spine manipulation would reduce pain in
      subjects with SIS and cause changes in scapular kinematics and muscle activity in subjects
      with impingement symptoms and in asymptomatic subjects. With this study, the investigators
      want to answer if possible changes in scapular motion and muscle activity following a TSM
      depend on the symptoms or if it is generic to individuals without shoulder dysfunction and
      not specific to subjects with shoulder impingement.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Subjects with shoulder impingement signs will be evaluated and will be compared with subjects
      asymptomatic for shoulder symptoms. Both subjects will be randomly assigned to one of two
      intervention groups: thoracic spinal manipulation (TSM) or sham intervention. We want to know
      if possible changes in scapular motion and muscle activity following a TSM depend on the
      symptoms or if it is generic to everyone. Also, we want to know if TSM reduces shoulder pain
      immediately and in a short-therm period.
