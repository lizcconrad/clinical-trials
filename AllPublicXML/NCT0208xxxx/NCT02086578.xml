  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if a radiation treatment called &quot;Multi-beam
      Intensity Modulated Radiation Therapy&quot;(IMRT) can reduce side effects related to your implant
      if they are a candidate for radiation therapy. Currently, the standard method of giving
      radiation is with &quot;3D radiation&quot;, which only uses 2-5 beams of radiation. &quot;Multi-beam&quot; IMRT
      works by using 8-12 small radiation beams to give a more &quot;tailored&quot; or &quot;customized&quot; radiation
      dose to the implant, breast, chest wall and lymph nodes. At the same time, multi-beam IMRT
      may lower the radiation dose to the heart, lung and nearby tissues. The goal of the study is
      to reduce complications after irradiation to the implants.

      The study doctors have recently completed a trial using this technique and are now
      specifically looking at its impact on women with implant reconstructions who are undergoing
      post-mastectomy radiation therapy. By delivering a more &quot;customized&quot; dose of radiation to the
      implant, the intent is to reduce side effects of radiation on the implant.

      Patients will undergo mastectomy and axillary dissection with immediate tissue expander
      placement. As is the current practice at MSKCC, patients receiving adjuvant chemotherapy will
      undergo expansion during chemotherapy, with exchange for a permanent implant to be performed
      approximately one month after chemotherapy and radiation to begin approximately one month
      after exchange. Patients who receive neoadjuvant chemotherapy will undergo &quot;rapid expansion&quot;
      of the expander and begin radiation at least 4 weeks following surgery, although it may be
      performed sooner if the patient has recovered from surgery and the treating physician deems
      it safe to proceed with treatment. In these patients, exchange for the permanent implant will
      occur at the discretion of the treating plastic surgeon (approximately 5-8 months after the
      end of radiation).

    <description>The treatment would be considered efficacious if the incidence of implant failure is reduced by at least a relative 30% by the end of the study period (24 months post-IMRT for Group 1, and 30 months post-IMRT for Group 2).</description>

    <description>Physical examination by MD, optional Breast MRI, Breast-Q© at baseline (after permanent implant exchange, physical exam and Breast-Q© may be done after the initiation of IMRT), 12 ± 2 months and 24 ± 2 months post- IMRT. Total length of the follow-up time will be 24 ± 2 months post-IMRT. A subset of 10 left-sided patients will receive 13N-NH3 PET scans within the radiation simulation session. A CT for coronary calcium scoring and a low-dose CT for attenuation correction will also be obtained at this time. Myocardial blood flow will be measured during rest and at peak stress with 13N-NH3 as a perfusion tracer. A follow-up 13N-NH3 PET study with low-dose CT for attenuation correction will be obtained 12-18 months (± 6 months) post-IMRT.</description>
