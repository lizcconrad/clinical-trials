  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Gait and posture disorders are very common in subjects aged 65 and over, and result mainly
      from neuromuscular and cognitive disorders.

      Many studies have shown that 1) vitamin D deficiency is very common in women aged 65 and
      over, 2) individuals with hypovitaminosis D have lower muscle, gait and executive
      performances and are more prone to fail than individuals with no hypovitaminosis D, 3) the
      intake of vitamin D combined or not with calcium may improve muscle strength and cognitive
      performance.

      The investigators hypothesized that the daily intake of 2 yogurts containing 200 IU of
      vitamin D and 400 mg of calcium 1) can improve spatiotemporal gait parameters, posture and
      executive performance, 2) and that this improvement depends of the initial level of vitamin D
      deficiency.
