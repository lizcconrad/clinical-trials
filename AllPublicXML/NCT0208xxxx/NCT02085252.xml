  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess two treatment strategies (leuprorelin treatment and
      active surveillance without androgen deprivation) for indolent prostate cancer and to compare
      their therapeutic benefit for management of patients with low-risk, localized prostate
      cancer.

      The drug being tested in this study is called leuprorelin. Leuprorelin is being tested to
      treat people who have prostate cancer. Study assessments will include adverse events,
      prostatic-specific antigen (PSA) levels, and prostate biopsies.

      The study will enroll approximately 120 patients. Participants will be randomly assigned (by
      chance, like flipping a coin) to a treatment group that will receive leuprorelin 11.25 mg (as
      one injection) or to an untreated observation group. Patients in the leuprorelin group will
      also receive bicalutamide 50 mg, a non-steroidal antiandrogen, once daily for 15 days to
      prevent a flare-up.

      This multi-center trial will be conducted in France. The overall time to participate in this
      study is 12 months. After the screening visit, participants will make 6 visits to the clinic.
