    <textblock>
      This study is designed to pilot an intervention technique to reduce the self-stimulating
      behaviors seen in individuals with autism spectrum disorders using intervention with
      ProFoveate pellets. Self-stimulating behaviors like hand flapping, eye blinking, and rocking,
      can interfere with the individual's ability to interact with their peers. Participants will
      wear the pellets for four week and measures with taken again. Another group of participants
      will not get the pellets. Both groups will be tested at the beginning and end of the study.
      Any variations in self-stimulating behaviors will be documented through parent report,
      Observational data. The investigators hypothesize that they will see changes in self-
      stimulating behaviors as a result of the strategic placement of the ProFoveate™ pellets on
      the ears of one group of the participants.

    <description>The experimental group will receive the ProFoveate™ intervention along with pre (baseline) and post (end line)intervention assessment. Steel pellets (1.2 mm) will be placed strategically on ears following instructions on how to use the ProFoveate™ pellets. Parents will be provided with a Patient Diary Sheet and will be instructed to perform and document daily checks for placement of the pellets. Parents will be given a one month supply of stainless steel pellets at the initial study visit. Child participants will wear the stainless steel ProFoveate™ pellets for four weeks.</description>

    <description>ProFoveate™ intervention for nystagmus is a management approach comprised of non-magnetic, 1.2 mm spheres that can be made from either stainless steel, gold plated stainless steel or titanium, placed strategically about the face and ears and a set of exercises designed to support improved vision for patients with nystagmus.The spheres (i.e., stimulating press balls or pellets) are supplied in packages of 20 with each sphere supplied on a transparent hypoallergenic adhesive tape approximately 7.6 mm in diameter. Within each package, all spheres are individually contained on a single paper backing measuring approximately 8.5 cm by 1.7 cm. Individual pellets (with adhesive tape) are removed from the backing as needed according to the prescribed treatment regimen.</description>
