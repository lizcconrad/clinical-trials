          -  Subject is male or female aged 18 to 70 years, inclusive.

          -  Subject has a grade 1 (mild functional impairment) or grade 2 (moderate functional

             visit.

          -  Subject has pain intensity upon monopodal weight bearing of 5 to 8, inclusive,

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subject has a grade 3 (severe functional impairment) strain or sprain, bilateral
             strain or sprain, or concomitant fracture or wound at the site of the strain or
             sprain.

          -  Subject has had an ankle strain or sprain to the same foot within 6 months before the
