  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It is well known that ICU patients need sedation. Now no ideal sedation drug existed and
      every sedation drug has its advantage and disadvantage,so combined sedation may use the
      advantage and avoid the disadvantage of the sedation drug according to the
      patients'condition. Until now, there is rare study about the combined sedation or sequenced
      sedation of different sedation drug.The purpose of the study is to explore the value of
      combined sedation with midazolam and dexmedetomidine compared to single drug sedation in ICU,
      so as to seek an ideal sedation protocol that could reduce the cost of treatment,obtain the
      appropriate sedation not under sedation or over sedation,reduce the incidence of delirium,
      reduce the adverse event of sedation.

    <measure>Delirium</measure>
    <time_frame>From sedation drug is used to weaning from sedation, up to 28 days.</time_frame>
    <description>Delirium is evaluated when daily sedation interruption is done during sedation. Delirium incidence is recorded using CAM-ICU. Treatment of delirium is recorded including drug,dosage and method of administration.</description>

    <time_frame>From sedation drug is used to weaning from sedation, up to 28 days.</time_frame>
    <description>Heart rate(HR),main arterial pressure(MAP),respiratory rate(RR),pulse saturate of oxygen(SPO2) are recorded every 4 hours. When sedation drug dosage changed and adverse events treated,the vital signs is also recorded.
Gas blood analysis index is recorded when the daily interruption is done and when the SPO2 is less 90% or 10% decrease than normal.</description>
