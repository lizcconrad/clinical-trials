    <textblock>
      Acute kidney injury after cardiac surgery is a major complication after cardiac surgery and
      has been reported to be associated with adverse outcome. There have been many studies
      reporting risk factor of acute kidney injury after cardiac surgery, but the influence of
      perioperative variables related to anesthesia and perioperative medication has not been
      evaluated fully. The investigators attempt to evaluate the influence of perioperative
      clinical variables including preoperative medication, preoperative albumin level, uric acid
      concentration, anesthesia technique, use of hydroxyethyl starch, blood glucose level,
      intraoperative medication, perioperative cardiac function (systolic and diastolic function)
      and hemodynamic variables during surgery on the incidence of acute kidney injury after
      coronary artery bypass graft.

      Acute kidney injury (AKI) after cardiac surgery is a major complication after cardiac surgery
      and has been reported to be associated with adverse outcome. There have been many studies
      reporting risk factor of acute kidney injury after cardiac surgery, but the influence of
      perioperative variables related to anesthesia and perioperative medication has not been
      evaluated fully. The investigators attempt to evaluate the influence of preoperative
      medication, preoperative albumin level, uric acid concentration, NL ratio, anesthesia
      technique, use of hydroxyethyl starch, blood glucose level, intraoperative medication,
      perioperative cardiac function (systolic and diastolic) and hemodynamic variables during
      surgery on the incidence of acute kidney injury after coronary artery bypass graft.
      Preoperative and postoperative diastolic dysfunction may be associated with postoperative
      AKI. In addition, preoperative neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) which has been reported to
      be a marked for systemic inflammation and was associated with prognosis in cardiac patients
      undergoing coronary artery bypass graft or percutaneous coronary intervention. This
      preoperative or immediate postoperative NLR might be able to predict AKI after coronary
      artery bypass surgery.
