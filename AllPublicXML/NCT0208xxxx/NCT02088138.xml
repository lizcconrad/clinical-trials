      The purpose of this study was to determine the effects of Functional Electrical Stimulation
      (FES) on physical performance and quality of life of patients in cardiac rehabilitation.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This randomized controlled trial aimed to evaluate the effects of functional electrical
      stimulation (FES) in patients with stage II and III cardiac rehabilitation (CR) on the
      variables strength, endurance and muscle tropism lower limb, functional capacity and quality
      of life. To this were invited to participate in the study cardiac patients registered in the
      database of the cardiology department of the University Hospital of Santa Maria. The sample
      included patients of both sexes undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting or valve
      replacement. The subjects were divided into two groups: placebo group (PG) or functional
      electrical stimulation group (FESG). To verify the effect of this intervention, before and
      after the protocol patients underwent the following evaluations: one repetition maximum test,
      sit-and-stand test, perimetry thighs, the six-minute walk test and evaluate the quality of
      life through The Medical questionnaire Study 36-item Short-Form Health Survey (SF-36).

    <description>Functional Electrical Stimulation
In the intervention group the FES was applied in the medial and lateral vastus of both thighs targeting the movement of knee extension. The application frequency was 15 Hz, lasting 40 minutes, pulse width of 0.5 ms, time ON 5s, time OFF 10s, ramp-up of 0 or 1s, descent ramp 2s and intensity as tolerance patient.</description>

The placebo group received functional electrical stimulation with the same parameters in the intervention group, except that the intensity of stimulation did not lead to visible or palpable contraction.</description>
