    <textblock>
      This VA-based study will obtain feedback from healthcare workers via validated survey
      instrument on the comfort and tolerability of wearing current models of N95 respirators and
      novel respirator designs currently in development. There will be 4 novel respirators and 1
      commonly used respirator (not locally used) to compare to a locally used respirator, which is
      familiar to participants. Comparisons will be examined between each of the first 5 models
      with the locally used control using Dunnett's t-test.

      This study aims to compare novel designs to products currently in the marketplace by
      comparing scores on a survey tool which measures comfort and tolerability of respiratory
      protective devices. Study participants will be clinical healthcare workers who have
      experience wearing respiratory protective devices in their workplace. We will enroll up to
      400 participants in the study, made up of physicians, nurses, nursing assistants and other
      healthcare employees who have previously been fit-tested to a N95 respirator. Subjects will
      be screened to determine eligibility and must pass fit-testing on the respirator he/she is
      randomized to. Participants will wear the respirator while performing a series of motions
      that simulate movements made by healthcare workers when performing patient care tasks. There
      will be no contact with patients during participation. Feedback via validated survey tool
      will be collected from all study participants on the comfort and tolerability of the
      respirator worn.

    <description>Subject will participate in set study activities wearing the respirator that he/she was randomized to. Following, Subjects will answer questions concerning comfort of respirator utilizing a Likert scale instrument that has been validated to capture comfort and tolerability assessments. This is a single visit study; there is no follow-up. Comfort and tolerability measurements will be compared between new and standard respirator models. The Respirator Comfort, Wearing Experience and Function Instrument (R-COMFI) is made up of 3 subscales: 1) Discomfort subscale (10 items, scored 0 to 2, score range of 0-20), 2) General Wearing Experience subscale (6 items, scored 0 to 2, score range of 0-12), and the 3) Function subscale (5 items, scored 0 to 3, score range of 0-15). An overall comfort and tolerability score is achieved by the sum total of all subscales. The instrument score range is 0-47. Higher scores equate to higher levels of discomfort and inability to tolerate respirator.</description>

        <title>To Collect Healthcare Worker Feedback About Perceived Comfort of Novel Respirator Designs</title>
        <description>Subject will participate in set study activities wearing the respirator that he/she was randomized to. Following, Subjects will answer questions concerning comfort of respirator utilizing a Likert scale instrument that has been validated to capture comfort and tolerability assessments. This is a single visit study; there is no follow-up. Comfort and tolerability measurements will be compared between new and standard respirator models. The Respirator Comfort, Wearing Experience and Function Instrument (R-COMFI) is made up of 3 subscales: 1) Discomfort subscale (10 items, scored 0 to 2, score range of 0-20), 2) General Wearing Experience subscale (6 items, scored 0 to 2, score range of 0-12), and the 3) Function subscale (5 items, scored 0 to 3, score range of 0-15). An overall comfort and tolerability score is achieved by the sum total of all subscales. The instrument score range is 0-47. Higher scores equate to higher levels of discomfort and inability to tolerate respirator.</description>
