  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine feasibility, perceived utility and sustainability
      of training local providers in ultrasound guided regional anesthesia for acute pain
      management in a limited-resource conflict setting.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      To the investigators knowledge, this is the first study of feasibility, perceived utility and
      sustainability of USRA as a pain management tool in a low-resource conflict setting and is
      one of the only large studies to date to assess USRA by local providers for emergent pain
      relief due to injury in patients presenting to an acute care center.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Participant perceived utility of ultrasound guided nerve block</measure>
    <time_frame>study start - ongoing (24 months)</time_frame>
    <description>Participants filled out a data sheet on each block performed. The participant stated yes/no if a block was found to have positive utility</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Participant course satisfaction</measure>

    <measure>Patient pain reduction (VAS)</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 18 months</time_frame>
    <description>Pain reduction was calculated using 1 - 10 of a VAS. The patients was asked to rate pain before and 20 minutes after the procedure</description>
  </other_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Post procedure serious and non serious adverse event</measure>
    <time_frame>before and up to 48 hours after every block performed</time_frame>
    <description>Patients were followed up to 48 hours post procedure in order to monitor for adverse events including residual nerve sensory deficit and/or infection at the injection site</description>

  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Indication for use of USRA by participant</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 18 months of study period</time_frame>
    <description>Participants recorded patient indication for offering USRA when presenting with acute injury including burns gun shot wounds lacerations, bone injuries soft tissue injuries and painful dressing changes</description>
