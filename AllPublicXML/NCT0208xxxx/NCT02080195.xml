      The main goal of the study is to determine if bone marrow transplant (BMT) from a less
      specific pool of donors in combination with high dose cyclophosphamide can induce remission
      of refractory systemic lupus erythematosus.

    <textblock>
      Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a devastating systemic autoimmune disease that
      predominantly affects young women, is more common in African-Americans than in whites, and
      results in poor quality of life. Lupus has no cure, and up to 90% of patients require
      corticosteroids for disease control. More than half of patients with lupus have permanent
      organ damage, much of which is either directly due to or increased by corticosteroids. To
      satisfactorily manage moderate-to-severe SLE, we need effective treatments that will allow
      corticosteroid-sparing.

      High-dose chemotherapy followed by autologous BMT or peripheral blood progenitor
      transplantation (PBSCT) has been proposed as a novel approach to treat severe autoimmune
      diseases. Allogeneic BMT is not currently utilized for the routine treatment of SLE because
      of the significant morbidity (GVHD) and mortality associated with the procedure.

      We have recently developed an approach to BMT using post-transplant cyclophosphamide that
      allows us to safely perform allogeneic BMT from matched, mismatched, unrelated or
      haploidentical donors. Transplant-related mortality, graft-failure and risk of GVHD have been
      very low with this approach. Furthermore, this approach allows us to greatly expand the donor
      pool since any patient shares exactly one HLA haplotype with each biological parent or child
      and half of siblings, an eligible haploidentical donor can be identified rapidly in nearly
      all cases.

      This trial will employ a fludarabine + cyclophosphamide conditioning along with
      posttransplantation cyclophosphamide on for patients with refractory SLE. The purpose of this
      trial is to improve the salvage rate for patients with refractory SLE through a reformatting
      of the immune system.
