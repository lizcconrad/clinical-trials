  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to conduct a study on genetic pathology, obtaining of pure
      cancer tissues is mandatory. Although the endoscopy with biopsy has been a gold standard for
      diagnosing gastric cancer, percentage of cancer cells in biopsy samples is usually 30% or
      less. Recently, confocal laser endomicroscopy has been introduced for real-time
      histopathologic diagnosis in various cancers. The investigators aim to evaluate that biopsy
      using probe-based confocal laser endomicroscopy will increase the percentage of cancer cells
      in biopsy samples.

    <description>In this arm1, an investigator observes a cancerous lesion using white light endoscopy. In addition, contrast dye for confocal laser endomicorscopy (fluorescein sodium 0.1mL/kg) is administered. Then, the cancerous lesion is observed using probe-based confocal laser endomicroscopy. The biopsy would be done 5 times at the most suspcious parts of the cancerous lesion.</description>
