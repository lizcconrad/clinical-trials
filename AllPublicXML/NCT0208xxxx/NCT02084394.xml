  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cardiac surgery is associated with multiple events and issues that increase risk for adverse
      postoperative neurological outcomes including postoperative cognitive dysfunction. The risk
      for postoperative delirium is generally thought to result from some previous health factors
      added to the susceptibility of the cardiac surgery process.

    <textblock>
      Cardiac surgery is associated with multiple perturbations that increase risk for adverse
      postoperative neurological outcomes including postoperative cognitive dysfunction. These same
      perturbations likely also increase the risk for postoperative delirium although there are
      little data that have evaluated this hypothesis.

      As the subject is prepared for surgery 2 contact probes will be placed on the forehead to
      monitor the rSO2 and cerebral blood flow. This monitor can also measureblood flow velocity in
      blood vessels in the forehead.

      This will only be done while the subject is on the cardiac bypass machine during the surgery
      and end shortly after entering the intensive care unit.Prior to surgery and then once a day
      on three of the first four postoperative days, patients will be assessed for the presence and
      severity of delirium with brief standard psychological exams. We will compare rSO2 and CBF
      changes between patients with and without delirium
