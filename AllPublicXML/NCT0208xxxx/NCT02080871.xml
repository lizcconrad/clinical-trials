      This study is a prospective, multicenter, non-randomized single-arm clinical study to
      evaluate the safety and efficacy of the VIABAHN BX for the treatment of arterial occlusive
      disease in patients with de novo or restenotic lesions in the common and/or external iliac
      arteries.

         15. Patient has aneurysmal dilation proximal or distal to the target lesion(s) that would

         16. Patient has a target lesion requiring atherectomy or any ablative device to facilitate
             stent delivery;

         17. Patient has a target lesion situated in such a way that an implanted device will
