  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this open label feasibility study is to determine recruitment rates to a
      randomised trial of glibenclamide compared with insulin (both in addition to maximum
      tolerated metformin) for the treatment of Gestational Diabetes Mellitus (GDM). This
      feasibility trial will inform the design of a future substantive multicentre trial to test
      the hypothesis that combination therapy with glibenclamide and metformin could reduce the
      number of pregnant women with GDM who require insulin and would be superior to metformin and
      insulin in terms of acceptability and cost effectiveness.

      Women with GDM who have &quot;failed&quot; monotherapy with metformin will be recruited and randomised
      to either receive glibenclamide (test arm) or standard care with insulin, both in addition to
      their maximum tolerated dose of metformin. Patients will be recruited from three of the
      antenatal clinics.

      This is a feasibility study in preparation for a large multicentre randomised trial to test
      the hypothesis that the addition of glibenclamide to metformin (combination therapy) could
      reduce the number of pregnant women with gestational diabetes mellitus requiring insulin,
      without compromising glycaemic control or other clinical outcomes. The investigators
      hypothesise that combination therapy with metformin and glibenclamide is likely to be
      preferable to metformin and insulin in terms of acceptability and cost.
