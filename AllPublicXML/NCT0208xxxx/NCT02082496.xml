  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The obesity epidemic is attributable to dietary and behavioral trends acting on a person's
      genetic makeup to determine body mass and susceptibility to obesity-related diseases.
      Furthermore, common forms of obesity have a strong hereditary component and many genetic
      pathways that contribute to obesity have already ben identified.

      Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) is an incretin hormone that potentiates glucose-stimulated
      insulin secretion. However, GLP-1 also acts as an appetite-inhibiting hormone affecting the
      appetite center in the hypothalamus. Today, GLP-1 receptor agonists are available for the
      treatment of type 2 diabetes, and their treatment potential in obesity is an area of active
      research.

      The aim of this study is to explore if the appetite inhibiting effect of GLP-1 is intact in
      people diagnosed with obesity causing genetic disorders and to investigate the physiological
      role of GLP-1 on food intake and appetite regulation in this group.

      -  Exploration of the physiological role of GLP-1 concerning food intake and appetite
           regulation in obese adults diagnosed with obesity related genetic disorders.

        -  Assessment of the effect of GLP-1 on body composition, bone mineral density, energy
           expenditure, cardiac function, glucose tolerance, insulin sensitivity, lipid
           concentrations and neuroendocrine function.

        -  Assessment of the impact of the leptin induced adaptive thermogenesis response in the
           weight reduced study participants.

        -  Investigating the alteration of the composition of gut bacteria as well as subjective
           ratings of satiety and hunger before after supplement with GLP-1.
