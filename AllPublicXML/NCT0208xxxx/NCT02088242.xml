  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Exposure to heat stress can compromise the physiological and cognitive function and be life
      threatening, particularly in a military setting. Various strategies of precondition to heat
      stress that have been explored in the past proved to be inapplicable. We aim to examine the
      influences of Astaxanthin supplementation as a preconditioning strategy to heat stress in a
      human model using a heat tolerance test. This will be achieved by a double-blind, placebo
      controlled supplementation trial, exposing human subjects, before and after consuming
      Astaxanthin or a placebo, to a controlled heat strain environment, while performing moderate
      exercise in a heated chamber.

      34 young, healthy civilian volunteers will participate in this study. After reading and
      signing an informed consent form, all subjects will undergo medical examination and an
      interview with a nutritionist to assess their dietary intake of Astaxanthin. They will then
      undergo 3 days of training on the cognitive testing software.

      During the first stage, while consuming an Astaxanthin free diet, the subjects will
      participate in the physiological tests:heat tolerance test (HTT), thermo-neutral test (TTT)
      and maximal oxygen consumption test (VO2max) on 3 separate days.

      During the second stage, the subjects will be randomly and blindly assigned to either the
      placebo or the Astaxanthin supplementation arms, and undergo 35-40 days of supplementation.

      Physiological testing of the second stage will take place between the 31st and 35th (up to
      40th - optional) days of supplementation and will include HTT, TTT and VO2max on 3 separate
      days.

    <measure>Physiological strain</measure>
    <time_frame>2 months for each participant</time_frame>
    <description>The physiological strain will be determined by monitoring body core temperature and heart rate of the subjects during a heat tolerance test (HTT) and a thermo-neutral test (TTT).The test is performed in a climatic chamber. During the test, the subject walks on a treadmill at a speed of 5 km/hr at a 2% grade for 2h. Body core temperature and heart rate are continuously monitored, and sweat rate is computed from body weight prior to and after the test, corrected for fluid intake.</description>

    <measure>Aerobic capacity</measure>
    <time_frame>2 months for each participant</time_frame>
    <description>The aerobic capacity of the subjects will be determined by performing a maximal oxygen consumption test (VO2max). Volunteer's oxygen consumption (VO2) will be monitored continuously with a metabolic chart (ZAN- the name of the metabolic system), while running for 10 min on a treadmill under comfortable environmental conditions.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Rectal temperature</measure>
    <time_frame>2 months for each participant</time_frame>
    <description>The rectal temperature will be monitored by a rectal thermistor during each heat tolerance test (HTT) and thermo-neutral test (TTT) and will be monitored continuously and viewed by the attending medical staff. Automatically all data will be recorded by the monitoring Biopac system (Biopac is the company in which the monitoring system was made).</description>
