  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will compare the efficacy of CellCept [0.5-2 grams per day (g/day) orally (p.o.)]
      and cyclophosphamide [0.5-1 grams per square meter (g/m2) quarterly] as maintenance treatment
      for patients with lupus nephritis. All patients will receive induction treatment with
      cyclophosphamide (0.5-1g/m2 monthly) for 6 months, and will then be randomized to the
      maintenance phase of the study for a further 6 months, followed by 6 months of treatment-free
      follow-up. The anticipated time on study treatment is 12 months.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Creatinine Clearance</measure>
    <time_frame>18 months</time_frame>
    <description>Creatinine clearance in an indicator of kidney function. An increased level of creatinine in the blood indicates decreased kidney function. Normal adult values are 97 to 137 milliliters per minute (mL/min) for males and 88 to 128 mL/min for females.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Urinary Protein</measure>
    <time_frame>18 months</time_frame>
    <description>Protein in urine is an indicator of kidney function. An increased urinary protein level indicates decreased kidney function. Normal values are approximately 0 to 8 milligrams per deciliter (mg/dL).</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Serum Creatinine</measure>
    <time_frame>18 months</time_frame>
    <description>Serum creatinine is an indicator of kidney function. Creatinine is a substance formed from the metabolism of creatine, commonly found in blood, urine, and muscle tissue. It is removed from the blood by the kidneys and excreted in urine. An increased level of creatinine in the blood indicates decreased kidney function. Normal adult blood levels of creatinine are 0.5 to 1.1 mg/dL for females and 0.6 to 1.2 mg/dL for males, however the normal values are age-dependent as elderly participants typically have smaller muscle mass.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Serum Albumin</measure>
    <time_frame>18 months</time_frame>
    <description>Albumin is a protein made by the liver. A serum albumin test measures the amount of this protein in the clear liquid portion of the blood. Decreased serum albumin levels can be an indicator of liver and/or kidney disease, The normal range is 3.4 - 5.4 grams (g)/dL.</description>

        <title>Serum Creatinine</title>
        <description>Serum creatinine is an indicator of kidney function. Creatinine is a substance formed from the metabolism of creatine, commonly found in blood, urine, and muscle tissue. It is removed from the blood by the kidneys and excreted in urine. An increased level of creatinine in the blood indicates decreased kidney function. Normal adult blood levels of creatinine are 0.5 to 1.1 mg/dL for females and 0.6 to 1.2 mg/dL for males, however the normal values are age-dependent as elderly participants typically have smaller muscle mass.</description>
