      Risk of local recurrence after rectal surgery is nationally 8% after curative surgery to 5%.
      Local recurrence rate after curative surgery varies between 3-7% in the variety of regions in
      the country. It is well known that the surgical technique total mesorectal excision (TME) has
      led to improved prognosis after rectal cancer surgery. TME surgery is difficult to perform
      and different factors affect the quality of TME preparations. Injuries in mesorectal fascia
      has been reported in up to 20% of patients who underwent TME surgery and most surgeons agree
      that this may be important for recurrences. However, it is unclear to what extent a damaged
      mesorectal fascia can be related to a worsening of prognosis in patients with rectal cancer.

      Adjuvant oncological treatment in form of chemotherapy after surgery, is offers patients with
      unfavorable tumors based on the pathological examination. Patients with favorable tumors
      (less advanced) are not offered chemotherapy, even if the surgical technique was not optimal,
      ie. that there is damage in the mesorectal fascia, as evidence for this is lacking.

      The presence of intraperitoneal cancer cells (IPC) is related to histopathological tumor
      stage of colorectal cancer. Incidence of IPC of intraperitoneal tumors (rectal cancer
      patients with tumors below the peritoneal reflection) is unclear.

      Assessment of IPC status with cytology and immunohistochemistry is technically easy and could
      after TME surgery identify those patients who have an increased risk of tumor recurrence. In
      a positive IPC status, the patient would possibly benefit from either postoperative
      radiotherapy if the patient did not receive preoperative therapy, or postoperative
      oncological chemotherapy.

      Tumour cells may be lysed in sterile water, and some surgeons rinse the abdominal cavity and
      the bowel distally to the tumour. Neither rinsing the abdomen or rectum in colorectal cancer
      is routinely occurring and the clinical benefit has not been established. The value of
      rinsing the abdomen after TME-surgery could also be studied by IPC status.

      The study hypothesis is that the IPC status is dependent on the surgical quality of the
      specimen after TME-surgery in rectal cancer patients, and its presence leads to increased
      risk of local recurrence.
