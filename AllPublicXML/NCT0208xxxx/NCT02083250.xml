  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this clinical research study is to evaluate the safety of combining vorinostat
      (also called SAHA) with fludarabine, clofarabine, and busulfan.

      If you are reading and signing this form on behalf of a potential participant, please note:
      Any time the words &quot;you,&quot; &quot;your,&quot; &quot;I,&quot; or &quot;me&quot; appear, it is meant to apply to the potential
      participant.

      This is an investigational study. Fludarabine, clofarabine, and vorinostat are FDA approved
      and commercially available for the treatment of cancer. Busulfan is also FDA approved for use
      with stem cell transplants. The use of these drugs together with a stem cell transplant is
      investigational. The study doctor can explain how the study drugs are designed to work.

      Up to 72 patients will take part in this study. All will be enrolled at MD Anderson.

      Study Groups:

      All participants will receive the same dose levels of fludarabine, clofarabine, and busulfan.
      You will be assigned to a dose level of vorinostat based on when you joined this study. Up to
      6 dose levels of vorinostat may be tested. Up to 3 participants may be enrolled at each dose
      level.

      The first group of participants will receive the first dose level of vorinostat. Each new
      group will receive a higher dose than the group before it, if no intolerable side effects are
      seen. When the highest tolerated dose level is found, more participants may be enrolled at
      that level.

      For a stem cell transplant, the days before you receive your stem cells are called minus
      days. The day you receive the stem cells is called Day 0. The days after you receive the stem
      cells are called plus days.

      Study Drug Administration and Procedures:

      All groups will receive a &quot;test&quot; dose of busulfan by vein over about 45 minutes to 1 hour.
      This low-level test dose of busulfan is to check how fast busulfan is processed by your body
      and cleared from your blood. This information will determine the amount of busulfan you will
      receive. You may receive the busulfan test dose as an outpatient during the week before you
      are admitted to the hospital or as an inpatient 8 days before your stem cell transplant.

      About 11 samples of blood (about 1 teaspoon each time) will be drawn for pharmacokinetic (PK)
      testing. PK testing measures the amount of study drug in the body at different time points
      and will also help determine your dose of busulfan. These blood samples will be drawn at
      various times before you receive the test dose of busulfan and over the next 11 hours. These
      blood draws will be repeated again on the first day of high-dose busulfan treatment (Day -6,
      which is 6 days before the transplant).

      A heparin lock line will be placed in your vein to lower the number of needle sticks needed
      for these draws. If it is not possible for the PK tests to be performed for technical or
      scheduling reasons, you will receive the standard fixed dose of busulfan.

      On Days -6 through -3, you will receive vorinostat as a tablet by mouth once a day, then
      fludarabine by vein over 1 hour, then clofarabine by vein over 1 hour, and then busulfan by
      vein over 3 hours.

      If you are going to be receiving a transplant from an HLA-matched unrelated donor, you will
      also receive antithymocyte globulin (ATG) by vein over 4 hours on the 3 days before the
      transplant. This drug is designed to further weaken your immune system to reduce the risk of
      rejecting the transplant.

      You will be given standard drugs to help decrease the risk of side effects. You may ask the
      study staff for information about how the drugs are given and their risks.

      While you are in the hospital, you will be checked for any side effects as part of your
      standard of care. Blood (about 2 teaspoons) will be drawn every day to check for side
      effects, for routine tests, to check your blood counts, kidney and liver function, and to
      check for infections. Tests may be repeated, if your doctor thinks it is needed.

      As part of standard care, you will remain in the hospital for about 3-4 weeks after the
      transplant. After you are released from the hospital, you must remain in the Houston area to
      be monitored for infections and other transplant side effects until about 3 months after
      transplant. During this time, you will return to the clinic at least 1 time each week. The
      following tests and procedures will be performed:

      °Blood (about 2 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests.

      Around 14-30 days after the transplant (when the transplant &quot;engrafts&quot;, or &quot;takes&quot;), you will
      have a bone marrow aspirate to check the status of the disease. To collect a bone marrow
      aspirate, an area of the hip or other site is numbed with anesthetic, and a small amount of
      bone marrow is withdrawn through a large needle.

      Around Day 30, if you have ALL, you will have a lumbar puncture to check the status of the
      disease. To perform a lumbar puncture (also called a spinal tap), a special needle is
      inserted into the lower back through the space between the bones. The needle is used to draw
      a sample of the fluid that surrounds the spinal cord.

      Around Day 30, and about 3, 6, and 12 months after the transplant, the following tests and
      procedures will be performed:

        -  You will have a physical exam.

        -  Blood (about 2 teaspoons) will be drawn to see how well the transplant has taken.

        -  You will have a bone marrow aspiration to check the status of the disease.

      After the first year from transplant through the end of your participation in the study, the
      study staff may also call you and your local doctor to ask about your health. This call may
      take about 10 minutes.

      Length of Study:

      You will be taken off study 5 years after the end of treatment. You may be taken off study
      early if the disease gets worse, if you have any intolerable side effects, if the stem cell
      transplant does not &quot;take&quot;, if the disease relapses (returns), or if you are unable to follow
      study directions.

      You should talk to the study doctor if you want to leave the study early. If you are taken
      off study early, you still may need to return for routine post-transplant follow-up visits,
      if your transplant doctor decides it is needed.

      It may be life-threatening to leave the study after you have begun to receive the study drugs
      but before you receive the stem cells.
