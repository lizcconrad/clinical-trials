      This study evaluates the effect of an interventional model for preventing and controlling
      overweight and obesity in male and female fifth-graders. First, based on WHO (World Health
      Organization) references obese (BMI-Z score ≥ 2) and overweight (BMI-Z score ≥ 1) students
      from 12 primary schools (randomly allocated to 6 intervention and 6 comparison) will be
      screened. Then from the screened students 30 students with the following inclusion criteria
      will be recruited: not metabolically ill, not on a weight losing diet and not professionally
      athlete. For selected students BMI-Z score as primary outcome will be calculated. Demographic
      data, as well as data on waist and hip circumference, triceps skin-fold thickness, food
      intake for 3 days (2 ordinary week days and 1 weekend) and physical activity will be
      collected at the beginning and at end of the 6-month intervention. The approach of the study
      will be Health Promoting Schools. The intervention includes three components, i.e., nutrition
      education (students and parents), increased physical activity, and changing environment (food
      items offered in schools' canteens). Nutrition education will be imparted (a 30-minute
      session per week) by health instructors; physical activity will be done under the supervision
      of the school coaches (2 one-hour sessions per week). Parents' education (a 1.5-hour session)
      will be monthly. Finally the efficacy of the intervention will be determined and reported.
