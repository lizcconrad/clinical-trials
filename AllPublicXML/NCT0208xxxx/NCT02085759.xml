  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cytokines are chemicals that are naturally made by your body. Certain cytokine levels are
      changed in the blood of patients who develop allergies and/or asthma. Cytokine levels may
      also be changed in some individuals who are overweight or obese. The purpose of this study is
      to determine if certain cytokine levels differ based on a person's weight and whether or not
      they have allergies or asthma. Information gathered in this study will be compared to
      information gathered from subjects who have participated in another similar study for
      patients who have allergies and/or asthma.

      The aims of this study are to:

        1. Characterize the relationship between BMI and Th2 skewing in non-atopic adult subjects.

        2. Compare these results to those previously obtained from atopic adult subjects It is
           expected that the results of this study will demonstrate enhanced Th2 skewing in
           overweight and obese atopic subjects as compared to non-atopic subjects. It is further
           anticipated that the results of this study will be used as preliminary data to generate
           an NIH grant application exploring the link between obesity and atopy.

        Subjects will be male or female, aged 18-50 years, and of any race. Subjects must be
        healthy with no history of allergies or asthma. Subjects will be placed in one of three
        groups based on their BMI: normal, overweight, or obese.
