  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Irreversible electroporation (IRE) is a new, minimal-invasive image-guided treatment method
      for tumors not amenable for surgical resection or thermal ablation, due to vicinity near
      vital structures such as vessels and bile ducts. With IRE, multiple electrical pulses are
      applied to tumorous tissue. These pulses alter the existing transmembrane potential of the
      cell membranes, and create 'nanopores', after which the cell dies through loss of
      homeastasis.

      The purpose of this study is to investigate the efficacy of percutaneous and open IRE in the
      treatment of patients with colorectal liver metastases (CRLM) that are unsuitable for
      resection or thermal ablation due to vicinity to vulnerable structures such as vessels and
      bile ducts. Other objectives are safety, feasibility (technical success) and imaging
      characteristics on follow-up (PET-)CT and PET-MRI and the value of these imaging modalities
      in dianosing local site recurrence (LSR) or residual disease (RD).

      29 patients with histologically confirmed colorectal carcinoma who present with unresectable
      and not thermally ablative CRLM&lt; 3.5cm suitable for IRE will undergo percutaneous or open
      irreversible electroporation of the tumor using CT and ultrasound guidance. All (serious)
      adverse events are registered. One day post-IRE MRI is performed to assess technical success.
      Follow-up will consist of frequent (PET-)CT and (PET-)MRI scanning to localize residual or
      recurrent disease. Overall technique effectiveness is determined 1 year after treatment.

      The investigators hypothesize that IRE for central CRLM will lead to good tumor control
      without causing severe complications.

    <description>The primary objective of this project is to evaluate the efficacy (percentage of lesions that show no sign of recurrence 12 months after the initail IRE procedure) of IRE for CRLM on cross-sectional imaging performed after respectively 6 weeks, and after 3, 6, 9 and 12 months. Research has shown that 95% of all recurrences after RFA of CRLM are diagnosed within one year after treatment. Therefore, one year follow-up will allow for accurate calculation of efficacy. Exact secondary efficacy rate may require follow-up longer than 12 months since this includes lesions that have been re-treated due to local site recurrence/local tumor residue (which will be individualized for each patient after re-treatment of LSR/LTR).</description>
