      Introduction: Periprosthetic joint infection (PJI) is a common cause for reoperation after
      knee and hip arthroplasty surgery. Debridement, antibiotics and implant retention (DAIR) is
      recommended in early infections (&lt; 4 weeks) and stable implants. Aims: To define the success
      rate of DAIR in early infections and to identify predictors for success. Material and
      methods: In a retrospective cohort study we included patients with hip- or knee
      arthroplasties reoperated for an early PJI at Danderyd Hospital 2007-2012. Logistic
      regression analysis was used to identify risk factors affecting success rate. Primary outcome
      variable was the success of the DAIR treatment. Secondary outcome variable vas risk factors
      for treatment failure.

    <description>DAIR treatment protocol embodies an extensive surgical debridement and a radical excision of infected tissue. This is followed by exchange of modular components (articulating surfaces of the implant such as the femoral head, acetabular liner in total hip arthroplasty and the tibial insert, the polyethylene meniscus, in total knee arthroplasty). The wound is then copiously irrigated (&gt; 9 litre) with 0.9 % sodium chloride and then closed.</description>

        Danderyd Hospital is a university hospital affiliated with the Karolinska Institute and is
        one of the four emergency hospitals in Stockholm, with a catchment area of approximately
        500.000 inhabitants. The index cohort was extracted from the local in-hospital surgery
        database at the Department of Orthopaedic Surgery using ICD 10 coding and surgical
        intervention coding for PJI treatment.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        Patients treated with DAIR for early postoperative periprosthetic joint infection after
        knee- or hip arthroplasty surgery (&lt;4-6 weeks postoperatively) at our institution between
        2007-01-01 and 2012-12-01.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Chronic or late presenting periprosthetic joint infection (&gt;6 weeks postoperatively), acute
        hematogenous periprosthetic joint infection, when the periprosthetic joint infection
        diagnosis criteria according to American Musculoskeletal Infection Society (MSIS) 2011
        definition of PJI definitions were not fulfilled and when the initial surgical treatment
        was with other treatment protocol than DAIR including one-stage revision and two -stage
        revision
