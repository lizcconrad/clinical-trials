    <textblock>
      The study was conducted to the following purposes

        1. To investigate the effect of lumbar mobilization on muscle activity in postpartum
           mechanical low back pain.

        2. To investigate the effect of lumbar mobilization on pain intensity in postpartum
           mechanical low back pain patients.

        3. To investigate the effect lumbar mobilization on functional disability in postpartum
           mechanical low back pain patients.

        4. To compare between the effects of lumbar mobilization, tactile stimulation (placebo
           treatment) and traditional treatment in postpartum mechanical low back pain patients.

    <textblock>
      all participants divided randomly into three groups, Group A (Study group) received PA lumbar
      mobilization plus traditional treatment which consisted of Ultrasonic and Infra-red. Group B
      (Placebo group) received placebo mobilization plus traditional treatment. Group C (Control
      group) received traditional treatment only
