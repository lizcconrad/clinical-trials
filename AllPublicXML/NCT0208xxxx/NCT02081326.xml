    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to see if repeat bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) vaccinations can
      confer a beneficial immune and metabolic effect on Type 1 diabetes. Published Phase I data on
      repeat BCG vaccinations in long term diabetics showed specific death of some of the disease
      causing bad white blood cells and also showed a short and small pancreas effect of restored
      insulin secretion. In this Phase II study, the investigators will attempt to vaccinate more
      frequently to see if these desirable effects can be more sustained.

      Eligible volunteers will either be vaccinated with BCG in a repeat fashion over a period of
      four years or receive a placebo treatment. The investigators hypothesize that each BCG
      vaccination will eliminate more and more of the disease causing white blood cells that could
      offer relief to the pancreas for increased survival and restoration of insulin secretion from
      the pancreas.
