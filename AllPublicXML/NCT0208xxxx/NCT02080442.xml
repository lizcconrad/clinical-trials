  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study will involve direct knowledge translation of a laboratory-based study of balance
      training for patients with COPD, first to the investigators PR program and then, after
      disseminating the results, this approach could be used to impact on clinical practice in any
      PR program.

    <description>Training will consist of 30 minute sessions 2-3 times/week for a total of 18-24 sessions, in keeping with best practice guidelines for older adults.12 Sessions will be supervised by physical therapists, using a circuit training approach with different stations designed to target specific areas of impairment. Participants will work through stations in a group setting; however, will receive individualized exercise prescription regarding level of difficulty and exercise progression.</description>
