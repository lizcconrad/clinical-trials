  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patient with advanced liver cancer (cancer that has spread to other parts of the body)
      continues to receive the study drug (G-202) even though patient no longer meets the criteria
      to be a part of the main treatment study. Patient's cancer responded well to receiving G-202
      in the main study and will receive G-202 at the same dose given in the main study.
