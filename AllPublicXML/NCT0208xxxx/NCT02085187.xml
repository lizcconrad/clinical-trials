  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a widespread disease that can have a major
      impact on the lives of individuals. An essential element in the treatment of COPD is
      rehabilitation of which supervised training is an important part. However, not all
      individuals with severe COPD can participate in the rehabilitation provided by hospitals and
      municipal training centres due to distance to the training venues and transportation
      difficulties. The aim of the feasibility study was to evaluate an individualised home based
      training and counselling programme via video conference to patients with severe COPD after
      hospitalization with regard to safety, clinical outcomes, patients' perception,
      organisational aspects and economic aspects.

    <description>Training and counselling by the physiotherapist consisted of 3 weekly sessions, lasting 30-45 minutes, over a 3 week period, i.e. a total of 9 supervised sessions. Heart rate and oxygen saturation were monitored during the exercise training. This included thoracic mobilization exercises, cardio training, strength training and breathing exercises. The training intensity was progressed continuously.
There were 1-2 sessions with the occupational therapist, which consisted of training and counselling on energy conservation techniques. The first session was 60 minutes long and included assessment, counselling and training. This session was delivered in the second week of the intervention. The intervention concluded in the third week, with sessions of 30 minutes as required.</description>
