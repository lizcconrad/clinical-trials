      Specific Aim: Study the impact of the Crohn's Disease Shared Decision Making Program on
      patients' treatment choice, persistence with chosen therapy, decision quality, cost of care,
      and outcomes

      Hypothesis: The Crohn's Disease Shared Decision Making Program will help patients understand
      which treatments are right for them and will lead to a higher acceptance of appropriate
      therapy, improved persistence with chosen therapy, lower costs and improved clinical
      outcomes. To accomplish this aim, Investigators will perform a randomized controlled trial
      to:

        1. Determine how the shared decision making program influences patients' choice of therapy

        2. Evaluate how the shared decision making program affects persistence with chosen therapy

        3. Determine how the shared decision making program affects decision quality

        4. Determine how the shared decision making program influences cost of care and clinical
           outcomes

      Expected Outcome and Impact: Investigators expect that this program will influence patients'
      choice of therapy, persistence with their preferred therapy, and lead to improved clinical
      outcomes. Investigators believe that this product can be successfully operationalized in the
      clinic to establish a new paradigm of how providers can communicate personalized treatment
      options to patients across a broad range of diseases.
