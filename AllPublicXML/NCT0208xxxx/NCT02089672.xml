  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Abnormal heart rhythms or arrhythmias are often managed by a procedure in which a catheter is
      introduced into the heart. These catheters can then cauterize abnormally functioning portions
      of the heart muscle with the hope of returning the heart to a more effective rhythm. In the
      process of performing such a procedure, called a catheter ablation, an operator must be able
      to accurately sense electrical activity displayed on computer screens in different parts of
      the heart, provide sufficient localized energy to the abnormally behaving tissue (ideally
      without damaging uninvolved heart structures), and accurately reassess the electrical
      activity of the heart to ensure the spot in the heart has been cauterized.

      When sensing electrical activity of the heart, specialized catheters produce recordings on a
      computer screen known as electrograms (EGM). To produce this recording conventional catheters
      commonly use a positive and negative electrode, from which the difference between the two
      provides the EGM. The distance between the two electrodes varies from device to device. The
      greater the distance between them, the less accurate the measurement of local electrical
      activity becomes. This may result in poorly localized or excessive use of energy that could
      be damaging to normal heart structures or put the patient at risk for the return or
      development of additional arrhythmias. The IntellaTip MiFi catheter has been constructed with
      a specialized sensing tip that uses &quot;microelectrodes&quot; that are relatively close in proximity
      (&lt;1 mm apart) with the hope of improving the sensing capability of the device.

      This study will analyze the signals obtained from this FDA-approved catheter in people
      undergoing a catheter ablation procedure. The study will examine signals after the procedure
      is finished and will not prolong or differ the process from a standard ablation procedure.
      The goal of this study is to determine the ability of the microelectrodes to distinguish
      ablated, or cauterized versus non-cauterized tissue.

      This trial is an operator-blinded, acute, single-visit observational trial in humans.
      Enrollment will include 25 patients undergoing a radiofrequency ablation procedure in which
      ablation of the cavotricuspid isthmus is planned. Electrogram characteristics of the small,
      imbedded pin electrodes will be compared to standard bipolar EGMs utilizing the ablation tip
      electrode and ring. Absolute voltage, voltage reduction, and frequency spectra will be
      examined before, during, and after ablation. EGM characteristics of standard and
      &quot;ultra-local&quot; recordings will be compared in their ability to accurately identify an
      effective RF lesion as defined below.
