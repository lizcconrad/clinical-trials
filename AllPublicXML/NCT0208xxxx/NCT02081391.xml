  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to evaluate the efficacy of tapentadol oral solution, based on
      the total amount of supplemental opioid analgesic used over 12 hours or 24 hours after
      initiation of investigational medicinal product in children and adolescents who have
      undergone surgery that would produce moderate to severe pain during opioid treatment.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The supplemental opioid medication reflecting the standard of care will be available as
      patient or nurse controlled intravenous morphine or hydromorphone. This supplemental opioid
      medication will be given to control pain, as needed, in both the treatment and placebo
      groups.

      Children and adolescents 6 months and older will be dosed with a dose regimen of 1.25 mg/kg
      for the first 24 hours of treatment. 24 hours after the start of study medication (and based
      on clinical judgment) a dose reduction to 1.0 mg/kg is allowed.

      Participants 30 days to less than 6 months old will be dosed with a regimen of 0.5mg/kg for
      the first 24 hours of treatment. The dose of study drug (IMP) may be reduced after 24 hours
      (if there is a reduced need for analgesia according to the investigator's judgment) to
      0.3mg/kg.

      Participants aged from birth to less than 30 days old will be dosed with a regimen of
      0.1mg/kg for the first 24 hours of treatment. The dose of study drug (IMP) may be reduced
      after 24 hours (if there is a reduced need for analgesia according to the investigator's
      judgment) to 0.075mg/kg.

      A decision to maintain or alter the dose will depend on the effectiveness of the analgesia
      (pain killer) and the adverse event profile observed in each participant over the first 24
      hour dosing period.

      In exceptional cases, if a participant has unbearable pain despite using NCA/PCA, an
      additional bolus (defined as a clinician bolus) of morphine or hydromorphone may be
      administered. The clinician bolus can be given either using the NCA/PCA pump system or by an
      intravenous bolus injection. The opioid given as a clinician bolus or if the NCA/PCA
      intravenous line fails must be the same as that used in the NCA/PCA pump system.

      Dosing with Investigational Medicinal Product will be stopped if:

        -  A switch to exclusively oral opioid analgesic medication is indicated according to the
           local standard of care.

        -  Opioid analgesic medication is no longer needed.

        -  Investigational Medicinal Product has been administered for 72 hours. Safety evaluations
           will include assessment of adverse events, vital signs, laboratory parameters,
           electrocardiogram, and specific scale to assess suicidal ideation. The maximum study
           duration for each participant will be 42 days.
