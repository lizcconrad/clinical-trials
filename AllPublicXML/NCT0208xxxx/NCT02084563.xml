  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to describe the prevalence and prognostic impact of the most
      common genetic abnormalities in patients with Myeloid Neoplasms, including Acute Myeloid
      Leukemia (AML), Myeloproliferative Neoplasms (MPN), Myelodysplastic Syndromes (MDS) and
      Myeloproliferative/Myelodysplastic Neoplasms. Patients will have samples of blood and/or bone
      marrow collected and sent to Hospital Israelita Albert Einstein for analysis and storage.

      Patients with a diagnosis of Acute Myeloid Leukemia will be treated according to an uniform
      protocol.

    <description>Patients with Acute Myeloid Leukemia fit for intensive chemotherapy Patients will receive Induction Chemotherapy, and CR will be evaluated after 28 days.
Patients who achieve CR post-induction chemotherapy will receive post-remission therapy according to risk:
Low risk patients: Consolidation chemotherapy or Autologous stem cell transplantation
Intermediate and high-risk patients: Allogeneic stem cell transplantation Patients who do not achieve CR may receive one second induction cycle, and if CR is achieved may proceed to post-remission therapy as per above. Patients who do not achieve CR after two cycles of induction will be deemed refractory and removed from the study.</description>

    <description>Patients with acute myeloid leukemia not fit for intensive chemotherapy Patients will receive induction chemotherapy with either low dose cytarabine or decitabine. Assignment to each drug will depend on drug availability and physician discretion. No randomization will be done between the drugs.
Cycles will be repeated every 28 days. Patients who achieve CR will continue to post-consolidation therapy with either cytarabine or decitabine, based on the induction therapy received. Patients will receive a maximum of 4 cycles until achieving CR, if no response is seen after 4 cycles patients will be deemed refractory.</description>
