    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well sonidegib and lenalidomide after stem cell transplant
      works in treating patients with multiple myeloma. Sonidegib and lenalidomide may stop the
      growth of cancer cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth and may delay
      multiple myeloma from coming back after a stem cell transplant.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the complete response (CR) rate with lenalidomide and sonidegib (LDE225)
      maintenance following an upfront single autologous stem cell transplant (SCT).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the toxicity of lenalidomide and LDE225 when used as maintenance therapy in
      patients post autologous SCT.

      II. To determine the progression-free survival rate at 1 and 2 years post autologous SCT.

      III. To evaluate progression-free survival and overall survival.

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the proportion of patients achieving a minimal residual disease (MRD)
      negative status.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive sonidegib orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-28 and lenalidomide PO QD on
      days 1-21. Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 18 courses in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients who achieve stringent complete response (sCR),
      CR, very good partial response (VGPR), partial response (PR), minor response (MR), or stable
      disease (SD) (or unconfirmed [u]sCR, uCR, uVGPR, uPR, uMR) continue treatment in the absence
      of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 90 days for up to 3
      years.

                       without hysterectomy) or tubal ligation at least six weeks before taking
                       study treatment; in case of oophorectomy alone, only when the reproductive
                       status of the woman has been confirmed by follow up hormone level assessment

                    -  Male partner sterilization (with the appropriate post-vasectomy
                       documentation of the absence of sperm in the ejaculate); (for female study
                       patients, the vasectomized male partner should be the sole partner for that
                       patient)

                    -  Use a combination of the following (both a+b):

                         -  Placement of a non-hormonal intrauterine device (IUD) or non-hormonal
                            intrauterine system (IUS)

                         -  Barrier method of contraception: condom or occlusive cap (diaphragm or
                            cervical vault caps) with spermicidal foam/gel/film/cream/vaginal
                            suppository

                    -  Note: hormonal contraception methods (e.g. oral, injected, implanted) are
                       not allowed

                    -  Note: woman are considered post-menopausal and not child bearing potential
                       if they have had 12 months of natural (spontaneous) amenorrhea with an
                       appropriate clinical profile (e.g. age appropriate, history of vasomotor
                       symptoms) or six months of spontaneous amenorrhea with serum follicle
                       stimulating hormone (FSH) levels &gt; 40 mIU/mL and estradiol &lt; 20 pg/mL or
                       have had surgical bilateral oophorectomy (with or without hysterectomy) at
                       least six weeks ago; in the case of oophorectomy alone, only when the
                       reproductive status of the woman has been confirmed by follow up hormone
                       level assessment is she considered not of child bearing potential

               -  Male patient must use highly effective (double barrier) methods of contraception
                  (e.g., spermicidal gel plus condom) for the entire duration of the study, and
                  continuing using contraception and refrain from fathering a child for 6 months
                  following the study drug; a condom is required to be used also by vasectomized
                  men as well as during intercourse with a male partner in order to prevent
                  delivery of the study treatment via seminal fluid

               -  Sexually active males who are unwilling to use a condom during intercourse while
                  taking drug and for 6 months after stopping investigational medications and agree
                  not to father a child in this period

          -  Other co-morbidity, which would interfere with patient's ability to participate in the
             trial, e.g. uncontrolled infection, uncompensated lung disease

          -  Concurrent chemotherapy, radiotherapy, or any ancillary therapy for treatment of
             multiple myeloma; NOTE: bisphosphonates are considered to be supportive care rather
             than therapy, and are thus allowed while on protocol treatment

          -  Known allergies to any of the components of the investigational treatment regimen or
             required ancillary treatments

          -  Major surgery within 4 weeks prior to registration

          -  Patients with concurrent uncontrolled medical conditions that may interfere with their
             participation in the study or potentially affect the interpretation of the study data

             gastrointestinal tract or known malabsorption syndromes

             pathway inhibitors

          -  Patients who have neuromuscular disorders (e.g. inflammatory myopathies, muscular
             dystrophy, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and spinal muscular atrophy) or are on
             concomitant treatment with drugs that are recognized to cause rhabdomyolysis, such as
             5-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG CoA) inhibitors (statins), clofibrate and
             gemfibrozil, and that cannot be discontinued at least 2 weeks prior to starting LDE225
             treatment; NOTE: if it is essential that the patient stays on a statin to control
             hyperlipidemia, only pravastatin may be used with extra caution

          -  Patients who have taken part in an experimental drug study =&lt; 4 weeks prior to
             registration

          -  Patients who are receiving treatment with medications known to be moderate and strong
             inhibitors or inducers of cytochrome P450, family 3, subfamily A, polypeptide 4
             (CYP3A4)/cytochrome P450, family 3, subfamily A, polypeptide 5 (5) or drugs
             metabolized by cytochrome P450, family 2, subfamily B, polypeptide 6 (CYP2B6) or
             cytochrome P450, family 2, subfamily C, polypeptide 9 (CYP2C9) that have narrow
             therapeutic index, and that cannot be discontinued before starting treatment with
             LDE225
