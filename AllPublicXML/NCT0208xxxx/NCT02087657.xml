  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      By doing this study, researchers hope to learn the following:

        -  The safety of hyperbaric oxygen administration in the setting of the autologous
           transplant

        -  The effects of hyperbaric oxygen administration on neutrophil count recovery and
           engraftment
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The post stem cell transplant complications of neutropenic fever and mucositis, related to
      the chemotherapy and/or radiation on hematopoietic tissue administered prior to peripheral
      blood stem cell transplant, are reversible upon neutrophil count recovery. The investigators
      will investigate the use of hyperbaric oxygen as an intervention to shorten neutropenia
      post-high-dose chemotherapy and autologous peripheral blood stem cell transplant. The idea of
      using hyperbaric oxygen therapy in autologous stem cell transplantation is based on the
      investigators pre-clinical work that supported the use of hyperbaric oxygen to improve
      umbilical cord blood (cluster of differentiation 34) CD34+ stem cell transplantation.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Presence or absence of a treatment limiting toxicity</measure>
    <time_frame>Toxicity assessment occurs within 24hrs of treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Treatment limiting toxicities are defined as the occurrence of any of the following complications within 24hrs of treatment: seizure disorder, pneumothorax, death, irreversible grade III or any grade IV toxicity that is determined by the treating physician to be at least likely related to HBO therapy.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Reduction in time to neutrophil recovery and engraftment post-cord blood transplant.</measure>
    <time_frame>Daily measurement of neutrophil counts, up to 40 days post transplant.</time_frame>
    <description>Subjects will be followed daily until neutrophil recovery, defined as three consecutive days of achieving a neutrophil count of &gt; 500/mm3. If subjects do not exhibit neutrophil recovery by Day 40 post transplant, they will be considered primary graft failures.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Explore the effects of hyperbaric oxygen (HBO) therapy on erythropoietin (EPO) levels.</measure>
    <time_frame>Assessment at: Day -7 (lymphoma) or Day -3 (myeloma), Pre-HBO (Day 0), Pre-transplant (6-10hrs post-HBO), 24 and 48 hrs after starting hyperbaric oxygen treatment as well as 3 days post-neutrophil engraftment</time_frame>
    <description>Statistical methods will be applied to determine if the mean erythropoietin levels during the first 24 hours and 48 hours correlate with time to neutrophil recovery and engraftment.</description>
  </other_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Examine correlation between change to erythropoietin (EPO) levels and time to neutrophil recovery and engraftment.</measure>
    <time_frame>EPO measurments: Pre-HBO (Day 0), 6-10hrs post-HBO, 24hrs and 48hrs post HBO, as well as 3 days post neutrophil engraftment.</time_frame>
    <description>Erythropoietin blood levels will be correlated to the daily neutrophil counts to assess any relationship between erythropoietin levels and subsequent engraftment and neutrophil recovery.</description>
