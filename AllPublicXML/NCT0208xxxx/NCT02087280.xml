  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      After discharge from inpatient treatment, 30-50% of patients with Anorexia Nervosa require
      re-hospitalization within 4-12 months. So far, high relapse rates are mostly considered as
      lack of the patient's compliance and motivation to recover. However in studies, psychological
      relapse predictors explain only a minor part of the variance in relapse risk. Metabolic
      phenotyping has clinical value to predict weight course in obese patients and we assume that
      it could also be clinically relevant in patients with AN. We hypothesize that in patients
      with a dissipative but not with the thrifty phenotype, positive energy balance during
      refeeding causes an over proportional rise in energy expenditure, counteracts continuous
      weight gain during inpatient treatment, and increases relapse risk within one year after
      discharge. Thus we believe that metabolic phenotype as a biological parameter has prognostic
      value for the disease course in AN.
