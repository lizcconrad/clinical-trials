      The study defines a new model of prenatal care called OB Nest which will be compared to the
      traditional model of prenatal care. OB nest is intended to create an experience for patients
      that feels more connected and patient-centered, allowing the patient to visit the clinic less
      frequently while offering increased communication with the OB nurses and providers through
      new tools provided to the patient. The goal of the project is to promote patient-centered
      care through a new prenatal care program based on constant and direct support from a nursing
      team, meeting the on-demand needs of expecting mothers as they rise, and as thus, redesigning
      the need and timing of on-site appointment with providers. Pregnant women randomized to the
      OB Nest cohort will see the number of pre-planned visits with their providers decreased and
      replaced with more direct and constant support and interaction with an assigned nursing team.

      OB Nest is a model designed to promote increased patient-centered care during pregnancy. OB
      Nest care will allow for more flexibility, decrease interruptions to your productivity, while
      continuing to maintain safety for you and your infant. This model of care is anticipated to
      allow you more access to your health care team during your pregnancy.

      This study will compare OB Nest, a new model of prenatal care, to the existing traditional
      model of prenatal care. The plan is to have about 300 low-risk mothers take part in this
      study. Eligible patients will be randomized to one of two groups; The Traditional Prenatal
      care Group or the OB Nest Group. Mothers will have an equal chance of being assigned to the
      OB Nest group. Mothers randomized to the OB Nest intervention will be assigned to a nursing
      care team comprised of one to three nurses and see their initial eleven planned appointments
      with their provider reduced to six. Mothers will still be able to request additional
      in-office visits with their provider and/or the provider require additional in-office visits
      to monitor mother and infants safety/care.
