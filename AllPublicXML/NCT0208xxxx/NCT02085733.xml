      Background:

      Children presenting with non-traumatic joint pain require different treatment depending on
      the cause of pain. Septic arthritis, which results from a bacterial infection in the joint,
      often requires a surgical procedure as well as a long course of antibiotics. In contrast,
      non-septic arthritis is typically treated by management of symptoms and observation. Current
      diagnostic standards involve microbiologic examination of fluid taken from the affected
      joint. This procedure can require the patient to be sedated, and the fluid culture analysis
      can take up to 72 hours. A single laboratory measure that could be easily obtained and
      quickly analyzed would aid in faster diagnosis, fewer diagnostic tests and lower cost of the
      diagnostic work-up for this condition.

      Recent research on septic arthritis has identified procalcitonin as a potential septic
      arthritis diagnostic indicator. Procalcitonin (PCT) is secreted by cells in the thyroid at
      higher levels when the body is facing infection. Procalcitonin levels rise slowly over the
      first two hours and peak at 24 hours. Levels rise 100-fold in the peripheral blood stream
      during this time frame. Several studies have indicated PCT is promising potential diagnostic
      indicator for septic arthritis. Unfortunately, many of these studies have relatively small
      sample sizes and very few involve pediatric populations. Additional study of PCT and septic
      arthritis in children will help evaluate the viability of PCT as a diagnostic indicator.

      Research Question:

      Can serum procalcitonin assist in clinical differentiation between bacterial (septic) and
      non-bacterial arthritis?

      Methods:

      Patients presenting with possible septic arthritis in the emergency department will be
      recruited for this study. Patients who consent to participate will receive the current
      standard for care, including IV placement, laboratory tests for Erythrocyte sedimentation
      rate (ESR),white blood cell count (WBC), and C-reactive protein (CRP), x-rays and
      consultation with pediatric orthopedics. Patients participating in the study will have a
      portion of the serum collected for typical diagnostic tests analyzed for PCT. Research
      assistants will collect data from medical records of participants, including lab and imaging
      results. Patients who do not undergo surgery will be contacted by phone within 7 days of
      their ED visit to confirm diagnosis.

    <description>The primary outcome will be the presence or absence of septic joint. We will confirm the presence of a septic joint by the growth of bacteria in the synovial fluid or presumed septic arthritis if any of the following three criteria are present: a) &gt; 50,000 white cells in the synovial fluid, b) positive gram stain or c) positive blood culture in the setting of a swollen joint. For patients who do not undergo operative care, we will determine the presence or absence of septic joint by a templated follow-up telephone survey 7 days after enrollment. Patients who do not undergo an operative procedure will be presumed to have non-bacterial causes of their joint pain. Furthermore, culture negative synovial fluid or Lyme positive arthritis will be classified as non-bacterial causes of joint pain.</description>
