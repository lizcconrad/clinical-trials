    <textblock>
      This study will be a single center, open-label, drug-drug interaction study in healthy male
      and female subjects. The study will consist of 2 parts. In Part A, the effects of
      steady-state dosing of a strong CYP3A inhibitor (itraconazole) or inducer (rifampin) on the
      pharmacokinetics of E2006 and metabolites will be assessed. Approximately 30 subjects will be
      sequentially assigned to 1 of 2 treatment groups to receive itraconazole or rifampin in equal
      numbers (approximately 15 subjects per group). The itraconazole treatment group will be fully
      enrolled before enrollment is initiated for the rifampin treatment group. In Part B, the
      effects of steady-state dosing of E2006 on the pharmacokinetics of midazolam, a substrate of
      CYP3A, plus bupropion, a substrate of CYP2B6, will be assessed in approximately 24 subjects.
      The 2 study parts can be conducted in parallel.

         18. Smoking or use of tobacco or nicotine-containing products is prohibited within 4 weeks
             prior to dosing and until Termination Visit

         19. Intake of caffeinated beverages or food is prohibited 72 hours prior to dosing and
             throughout the entire study

         20. Intake of nutritional supplements, juice, and herbal preparations or other foods or
             beverages that may affect the various drug metabolizing enzymes and transporters (eg,
             alcohol, grapefruit, grapefruit juice, grapefruit-containing beverages, apple or
             orange juice, vegetables from the mustard green family [eg, kale, broccoli,
             watercress, collard greens, kohlrabi, Brussels sprouts, mustard] and charbroiled
             meats) is prohibited within 2 weeks prior to dosing until the Termination Visit
