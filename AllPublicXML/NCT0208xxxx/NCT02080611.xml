  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators hypothesize that a garment-integrated sensing system will be able to detect
      with clinical accuracy the position of the spine. The investigator will evaluate this using
      healthy adult volunteers, who will don sensing garments and assume a series of spinal
      postures. Concurrent with garment sensing, the participant's spine position will be measured
      using a motion-capture system that uses reflective markers to detect positions of markers in
      3D space.

      The motion-capture system provides a gold-standard reference measure to which the sensing
      garments will be compared. Because the investigators are evaluating the accuracy of the
      sensing garment, it is only necessary that the investigator test the garments on participants
      with subtly different body shapes. Healthy adult volunteers provide an adequate input to the
      sensing signal.
