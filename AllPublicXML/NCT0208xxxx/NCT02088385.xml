  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hemospray (TC-325, Cook Medical Inc, Winston-Salem, NC, USA), a new adsorptive nanopowder
      hemostatic agent for endoscopic treatment of high-risk bleeding peptic ulcers, provides
      significant ease of administration compared to the combined conventional technique of
      saline-adrenaline injection with mechanical clip or heater probe applications. The Hemospray
      powder is easily applied on ulcers at difficult endoscopic positions and ulcers with fibrotic
      bases, where the combined conventional technique has limited efficacy. Building up on
      preliminary work from small single-arm studies, the investigators aim to establish the
      efficacy and safety of Hemospray in treating bleeding peptic ulcers in comparison with the
      combined conventional technique. The investigators propose a pilot study to establish our
      centre's feasibility of performing a prospective, randomized, parallel group trial, which
      compares the efficacy of Hemospray with the combined conventional technique, in the
      endoscopic treatment of high-risk bleeding peptic ulcers. Patients with high-risk bleeding
      peptic ulcers will be treated with Hemospray to determine its initial hemostasis rate
      (defined as endoscopically verified cessation of bleeding for at least 5 minutes after
      endoscopic treatment), rebleeding rate (recurrent hemorrhage during a 4-week period following
      the initial hemostasis) and its safety profile.
