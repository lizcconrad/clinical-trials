    <textblock>
      The comprehensive geriatric assessment (CGA) is a multidimensional, interdisciplinary
      diagnostic process to determine the medical, psychological, and functional capabilities of an
      elderly person, in order to develop a coordinated and integrated plan for treatment. It
      represents the first stage of the most appropriate care for elderly people who are frail or
      who cannot perform at least three daily tasks unaided.

      It has been shown that the integration of CGA in the decision-making and care management at
      hospital improves inpatient's health and functional status, and reduces mortality rate and
      healthcare expenditures. The effects of CGA in daily practice of general practitioners remain
      unknown.

      Implementation of a systematic CGA for every older old community-dwellers performed by a
      general practitioner remains yet difficult because of number of issues. First, although the
      number of older old community-dwellers keeps increasing, the number of health care
      professional with geriatric skills does not. Second, CGA is a complex and time-consuming
      process. Third, CGA requires a multidisciplinary geriatric team that cannot support alone the
      care of all frail older old community-dwellers due to their limited number. An implication of
      non-geriatricians in CGA is therefore required.

      Recently, it was confirmed that CGA cannot be applied to all older adults, and that the best
      compromise could be the use of a two-step approach. The first step is the identification by
      non-geriatricians of elderly inpatients at high risk of adverse outcomes using a screening
      tool, and the second step is a CGA by geriatricians with a diagnosis purpose.

      None of existing tools used for screening is adapted to the population of elderly people who
      visit general practitioners.Thus, healthcare professionals working in ED need a simple,
      standardized and brief geriatric assessment (BGA) to identify as soon as possible frail older
      old community-dwellers requiring specialized geriatric care.

      The investigators hypothesized that a BGA older old community-dwellers carried out by a
      general practitioner could predict the adverse health events (i.e. hospitalization,
      institutionalisation, medical consultations and death) occurring during a 6-months follow-up
      period before the evaluation.
