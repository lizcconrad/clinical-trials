      The purpose of this study is to verify if the incorporation of a new brace, which assists in
      gait rehabilitation, can contribute to the rehabilitation process for stroke patients.

      Objective To compare the behavior of plantar pressure peak distribution, before and after
      training using a brace for gait rehabilitation.

      Method The brace was developed with the aim of promoting better biomechanical alignment, as
      well as providing proprioceptive information in order to stimulate action in the knee's
      flexor muscle groups, thus facilitating the activation pattern contrary to what occurs during
      genu recurvatum. We conducted a quasi-experimental &quot;before and after&quot; study with twelve
      hemiparetic adult patients who had genu recurvatum in the gait. The plantar pressure peaks
      were compared at the various moments of the study.

    <description>To evaluate the distribution of plantar pressures during walking, for individuals with hemiparesis, before and after training with a brace for gait retraining and control of genu recurvatum.
To observe the gait evolution of 12 patientes after the trainnig with a orthotic device.</description>

    <description>Twice a week, for a period of 5 weeks, before the sessions in the physiotherapy clinic the patients participating in the study were asked to walk at a self-selected speed on flat ground along a corridor 50 meters long, with the brace being used for fifteen minutes of gait retraining of the affected side.</description>

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  the presence of hemiparesis after the stroke, with an evolution time of between 6 and
             24 months, the ability to walk without using assistive aids, and the presence of genu
             recurvatum during the mid-stance in the gait.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  conditions that would preclude evaluation and training with the brace; for example,
             the presence of contractures or fixed deformities in the lower limbs, and moderate to
             severe impairments related to cognition, perception, attention, or language
