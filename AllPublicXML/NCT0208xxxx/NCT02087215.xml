  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Boron as a naturally occurring element has some metabolic and inflammatory actions. The
      antibacterial activity against gram negative bacteria is also known. Boron deficiency is
      shown to be related with impaired wound bone healing in rats. Therefore, special wound care
      formulas containing boron may have some positive effect on wound healing of the patients with
      diabetic foot ulcers.

      Local treatment of diabetic foot ulcers:

        1. Classification of International Working Group of the Diabetic Foot (IWGDF)

        2. pre-treatment measurements including diameter and area

        3. pre-treatment laboratory values including fasting glucose, hemoglobin, hemoglobin A1c,
           leucocyte count and c-reactive protein

        4. pre-treatment wound culture

        5. treatment either by placebo gel containing polymer of carbopol ultrex (1%) or by
           formulation gel: addition of borate as sodium penta boric acid pentahydrate 3% (w/v) and
           two different copolymer as pluronic block namely F68 2% (w/v) and f127 2% (w/v).

        6. post-treatment measurements and values
