      Hispanic Americans are underrepresented in cancer clinical trials. The purpose of this study
      is to develop and test education programs designed to reduce barriers and Increase
      facilitators associated with cancer clinical trials participation for Hispanic Americans.
      Focus groups were conducted with Hispanic American men and women to obtain culturally-linked
      attitudes related to clinical trials participation. This information was used to create a
      prototypic educational program anticipated to increase participation in clinical trials. It
      was then vetted and honed via additional focus groups.

      Simultaneously, a validation study was conducted with Hispanic Americans for a packet of
      psychosocial instruments that could be used for a subsequent randomized controlled trial to
      evaluate the impact of the clinical trials education program.

      The finalized clinical trials education program was tested via a randomized controlled trial.
      Participants assigned to the experimental group received the clinical trials education
      program, while participants in the control arm were administered a comparable, but
      non-relevant education program. Recruitment to this study has been completed.

    <description>Cancer Clinical Trials Education Program is offered to English- and Spanish-speaking Hispanics in the experimental arm. This program was designed to promote increased clinical trials literacy among Hispanic Americans. Increased clinical trials knowledge and a better understanding of clinical trials is anticipated to create more positive attitudes, and perceptions about clinical trials among Hispanic Americans.</description>

    <description>The Neighborhood Watch Program created by the Bureau of Justice Assistance and the National Crime Prevention Council was selected for inclusion in the control arm of this study. It provided participants with a program of equivalent length and format, as well as an equivalent focus on improving the well-being of Hispanic Americans. It also provided an opportunity to evaluate the impact of the Neighborhood Watch Program.</description>
