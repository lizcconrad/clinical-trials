      To determine whether two new oral formulations of a strong pain killer release the drug into
      the body in a similar pattern as the already marketed reference capsule formulation with or
      without food.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Comparisons will be made between two new oral formulations and an existing marketed reference
      capsule formulation to determine whether the release rates of the products are similar or
      equivalent in a fed or fasted state. Determination is by measurement of drug concentrations
      in the blood at serial collection time points pre-dose until 32 hours post-dose, following an
      administration of a single oral dose. Pharmacokinetics parameters of AUC and Cmax are the
      primary endpoints.

    <time_frame>Up to 32 hours</time_frame>
    <description>Areas under the plasma concentration-time curve calculated to the last measurable concentration (AUCt) will be calculated using the linear trapezoidal method. Where possible, the terminal phase rate constants will be estimated using those points determined to be in the terminal log-linear phase. Half-lives (t1/2Z) will be determined from the ratio of ln 2 to LambdaZ. The areas under the plasma concentration-time curve between the last measured point and infinity will be calculated from the ratio of the final observed plasma concentration (Clast) to LambdaZ. This will be added to the AUCt to yield the area under the plasma concentration-time curve between the time of administration and infinity (AUCINF).</description>

        Inclusion Criteria

          -  Healthy male or female subjects aged 18 to 55 inclusive.

          -  Female subjects who are sexually active or become sexually active must be willing to
             use highly effective methods of contraception throughout the study. A highly effective
             method of birth control is defined as one which results in a low failure rate (i.e.
             less than 1% per year) when used consistently and correctly such as sterilisation,
             implants, injectables, combined oral contraceptives, some IUDs (Intrauterine Device),
             or vasectomised partner.

          -  Female subjects less than one year post-menopausal must have a negative serum
             pregnancy test and be non-lactating.

          -  Female subjects who have been post-menopausal for &gt; 1 year and have elevated serum
             follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) or are treated with hormone replacement therapy
             (HRT).

          -  Male subjects must be willing to use contraception with their partners throughout the
             study and for 30 days after completion of the study and agree to inform the
             Investigator if their partner becomes pregnant during this time.

          -  Body weight ranging from 55 to 100 kg and a BMI ≥ 18.5 and ≤ 29.9.

          -  Healthy and free of significant abnormal findings as determined by medical history,
             physical examination, vital signs, laboratory tests and ECG.

          -  Willing to eat all the food supplied throughout the study.

          -  The subject's primary care physician has confirmed within the last 12 months that
             there is nothing in their medical history that would preclude their enrolment into a
             clinical study.

        Exclusion Criteria

          -  Any history of drug or alcohol abuse.

          -  Any history of conditions that might interfere with drug absorption, distribution,
             metabolism or excretion.

          -  Use of opioid or opioid antagonist-containing medication in the past 30 days.

          -  Any history of frequent nausea or vomiting regardless of etiology.

          -  Any history of seizures or symptomatic head trauma.

          -  Paralytic ileus, respiratory depression, hypoxia or elevated carbon dioxide levels in
             the blood.

          -  Participation in a clinical drug study during the 90 days preceding the initial dose
             in this study.

          -  Subjects must not participate in both the pilot and definitive phase or in more than
             one Cohort.

          -  Any significant illness during the 4 weeks preceding entry into this study.

          -  Use of any medication including vitamins, herbal and/or mineral supplements during the
             7 days preceding the initial dose or during the course of this study (with the
             exception of the continued use of HRT and contraceptives). Note: subjects taking oral
             contraceptives containing CYP3A4 inhibitors such as gestodene should be excluded as
             this may lead to elevated plasma concentrations.
