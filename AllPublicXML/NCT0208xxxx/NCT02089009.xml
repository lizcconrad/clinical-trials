      1. To compare quality and usability of images taken by two different camera-systems without
           dilating the pupil.

        2. To compare the retinal vessel diameters based on the images of to different
           camera-systems.

        3. To detect changes in retinal vessel diameters while pregnancy and after delivery.

      1. To compare quality and usability of images taken by two different camera-systems without
           dilating the pupil.

           Quality means in this content that images cover the planned region of interest and
           images should be sharp and good illuminated to see details for medical reading of
           retinal findings.

        2. To compare the retinal vessel diameters based on the images of to different
           camera-systems.

           The diameters of arteries and veins are planned to be measured with an automated
           software algorithm. Are there differences in the calculated results between the two used
           camera devices?

        3. To detect changes in retinal vessel diameters while pregnancy and after delivery.

      Are there detectable changes of the retinal findings between the images taken before and
      after delivery (e.g. bleeding, edema, vessel tortuosity)
