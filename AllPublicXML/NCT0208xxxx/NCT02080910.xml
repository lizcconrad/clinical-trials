  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized controlled trial with a 3-month psychoeducational program as
      intervention, followed by a 3 month observational period. The purpose of this study was to
      examine whether a psychoeducational program focusing on equipping caregivers with
      problem-solving skills would improve caregiver's problem-solving abilities, their
      psychological responses and caregiving resources, and would minimize the use of health and
      social services among stroke survivors.
