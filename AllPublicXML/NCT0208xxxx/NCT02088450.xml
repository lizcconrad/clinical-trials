    <textblock>
      The Syst-Eur Trial is a concerted action of the European Community's Medical and Health
      Research Programme. The trial is carried out in consultation with the World Health
      Organization, the International Society of Hypertension, the European Society of Hypertension
      and the World Hypertension League. Syst-Eur is a multicentre trial designed by the European
      Working Party on High Blood Pressure in the Elderly (EWPHE), to test the hypothesis that
      antihypertensive treatment of elderly patients with isolated systolic hypertension results in
      a significant change in stroke morbidity and mortality. Secondary endpoints include
      cardiovascular events, such as myocardial infarction and congestive heart failure. To be
      eligible patients must be at least 60 years old and have a systolic blood pressure averaging
      160-219 mmHg with a diastolic pressure less than 95 mmHg. Patients must give their informed
      consent and be free of major cardiovascular and non-cardiovascular diseases at entry. The
      patients are randomized to active treatment or placebo. Active treatment consists of
      nitrendipine (10-40 mg/day), combined with enalapril (5-20 mg/day) and hydrochlorothiazide
      (12.5-25 mg/day), as necessary. The patients of the control group receive matching placebos.
      The drugs (or matching placebos) are stepwise titrated and combined in order to reduce
      systolic blood pressure by 20 mmHg at least to a level below 150 mmHg. Morbidity and
      mortality are monitored to enable an intention-to-treat and per-protocol comparison of the
      outcome in the 2 treatment groups.
