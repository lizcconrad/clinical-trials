  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if stabilizing the scapula (shoulder blade) during
      a common shoulder stretch is more effective at improving shoulder range of motion than not
      stabilizing the scapula. Investigators hypothesize that scapular stabilization during
      horizontal adduction stretching will demonstrate greater gains in shoulder range of motion
      than stretching without scapular stabilization.
