    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to ascertain the pharmacokinetics (PK) and
      pharmacodynamics (PD) bioequivalence of a subcutaneous (SC) injection of 1 mg (1 IU) of
      Glucagon (Fresenius Kabi USA) in comparison to the reference product, GlucaGen® (Bedford
      Laboratories), 1 mg (1 IU), SC in healthy adult subjects.

      This investigation will serve as a basis for Fresenius Kabi USA, to obtain regulatory
      approval of a synthetic version of Glucagon (Fresenius Kabi USA), 1 mg (1 IU), SC. The aim is
      to conduct direct comparative pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of 1 mg (1 IU) of
      synthetic Glucagon (Fresenius Kabi USA) with that of GlucaGen® (manufactured by Novo Nordisk
      A/S, marketed by Bedford Laboratories), 1 mg (1 IU), SC in healthy adult subjects. This study
      will examine a comparison of the bioavailability pharmacokinetics of 1 mg (1 IU) of Glucagon
      (Fresenius Kabi USA) by having each subject receive in each period either a single dose of 1
      mg (1 IU) of Glucagon (Fresenius Kabi USA) or a single dose of GlucaGen® (Bedford
      Laboratories), 1 mg (1 IU), via subcutaneous injection. Blood samples will be collected three
      (3) times starting 2 hours prior to dosing and at intervals over 4 hours post dose. The
      concentrations of glucagon and glucose will be measured.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Males and females, 18 years or older, with a body mass index (BMI) of 18- 30 kg/m2
             inclusive.

          2. Good health as determined by lack of clinically significant abnormalities in health
             assessments performed at screening.

          3. Signed and dated informed consent form, which meets all criteria of current guidelines
             of the Medical Research Council (MRC) of Canada and FDA regulations.
