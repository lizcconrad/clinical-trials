  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the utility of treating patients experiencing poor
      graft function after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation with Granulocyte
      Colony-Stimulating Factor (G-CSF) mobilized peripheral stem cell combined (PBSC) with
      ex-vivo-expanded BM-drived mesenchymal stem cells from third-party donors. Our first
      objective was to evaluate the effect of such treatment on poor graft function, and second
      object was to investigate the safety of such treatment.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation(allo-HSCT) is the only cure for many
      hematologic diseases. However, poor graft function (PGF) is an important complication after
      allo-HSCT that occurs in 5-27% of patients, and is associated with considerable mortality
      related to infections or hemorrhagic complications. Treatment of PGF usually involves the
      prescription of hematopoietic growth factors such as granulocyte colony-stimulating factor
      (G-CSF), or second transplantation, but these methods are associated with dismal effect or
      even a significant risk of graft-versus-host disease (GVHD).

      Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are a form of multipotent adult stem cells that can be isolated
      from bone marrow (BM), adipose tissue, and cord blood. Clinical applications of human MSCs
      include improving hematopoietic engraftment, preventing and treating graft-versus-host
      disease after allo-HSCT and so on. Some studies have shown that MSCs combined with PBSC or
      cord blood could be useful to improve engraftment after HSCT. Several reports suggested MSCs
      might be effective in the treatment of PGF.

      However, the efficacy of MSCs as single-drug treatment for PGF is unsatisfactory in our
      previous study. Therefore, in the present study, G-CSF mobilized PBSC will be used combined
      with MSCs in the patients with PGF after allo-HSCT.

    <description>Hematopoietic reconstitution post-transplantation is defined as reconstitution of both neutrophil and platelet numbers. Neutrophil reconstitution is defined as occurring on the first 3 consecutive days with an neutrophil(NEU)&gt;0.5×10^9/L, and platelet (PLT) reconstitution is defined as the first &gt;20×10^9/L for 3 consecutive days.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Participants with Serious and Non-Serious Adverse Events</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 1 year</time_frame>
    <description>Adverse Events include infections, GVHD, primary underlying disease relapse and any other side effects. Infections will be mainly focused within the first 100 days after treatment. Side effects of treatment includes acute toxicity and late side effects. Acute toxicity principally involves the heart,live and kidney. Late toxic side effects involves principally the development of secondary tumors and relapse of the primary disease.</description>

The vital signs of all patients will be closely monitored during and for 24h after administration.If the NEU and PLT levels do not attain the completely response(CR)standards within 28d, a second course of the same treatment will be given.</description>
