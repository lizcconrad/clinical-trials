  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Following obesity surgery gastric bypass (GBP) patients usually lose more than 50% of their
      former obesity within a relatively short time (~ 2 years). But knowledge about the underlying
      psychological and biological mechanisms of decline in body weight, however, is still lacking.
      This project intends to investigate whether obesity surgery is associated with patients'
      cognitive ability and / or gene expression and metabolomics.

      A fasted blood sample (50 mL) will be taken before and 2h after a standardized meal.

      Through epigenetic study, we will analyze the changes in DNA methylation after surgery in
      genes related to metabolism (at the Science for Life Laboratory (SciLifeLab) with 450K Human
      Meth arrays).

      In addition, blood samples from these obese patients analyzed (before and after surgery)
      after ingestion of a predetermined test meal (for example, high protein) to explore changes
      in metabolites profile. Metabolites in the samples will be quantified by the SciLifeLab.
