  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Clinical cancer genetics is an emerging new field in medical oncology, and has been
      incorporated into routine oncology practice in many leading medical institutions in North
      America and Europe. Cancer genetics is the study of genetic factors contributing to
      carcinogenesis. In the last 5-10 years, genes responsible for various well-defined hereditary
      cancer syndromes have been cloned. These include the BRCAJ/2 genes in hereditary breast and
      ovarian cancer syndrome, the A4PC gene in Familial Adenomatous Polyposis, and the mismatch
      repair genes (hMLH1, hMSH2, hPMS1, hPMS2, hMSH6) in hereditary non-polyposis colorectal
      cancer (HNPCC). One of the goals of a clinical cancer genetics service is to identify
      families at risk for hereditary cancer syndromes, provide genetic counseling, and offer
      genetic testing when appropriate. The identification of causative genes in hereditary cancer
      syndromes together with the advent of genetic testing is starting to have an impact on
      clinical management. The ability to identify a gene mutation in a cancer family allows
      predictive testing, stratifying at-risk family members into carriers who will benefit from
      aggressive surveillance and/or preventive options, and non-carriers who may be spared
      unnecessary surveillance. Appropriate use of genetic testing will ultimately result in
      medical cost reduction.

      The investigators hypothesize that the clinical characteristics and genetic factors
      contributing to hereditary cancer in the Singaporean Asian population are distinct from those
      described for Western patients.

        Patients are recruited from the National University Hospital. All cancer patients seen in
        the Cancer Centre, NUH, are screened using a basic family history form.The family history
        is reviewed by the Principal Investigator with the cancer genetics counselor. Eligible
        patients who fulfil the eligibility criteria as described below are invited to participate.
        Written informed consent is obtained. Demographic characteristics and cancer history of the
        study subject is prospectively recorded. Participants are invited to fill out a family
        history questionnaire providing cancer history information on their first- and
        second-degree relatives. Participants are also invited to donate 10ml blood for DNA banking
        and future genotyping. Permission will be obtained from participants to contact family
        members who may be eligible to participate in the study.
