    <textblock>
      To assess coughing force during reflex coughing test in those with severe dysphagia and
      severe aspiration and compare them to than those with stroke patients with no signs of
      dysphagia/aspiration.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Severe aspiration with a compromised cough function can be a risk factor of aspiration
      pneumonia.

      Reflexive coughing can be tested by administration of citric acid via a nebulizer. The
      objective of this study is to measure the cough force produced via citric acid inhalation
      challenge, and determine if those with severe aspiration with severe dysphagia have more weak
      cough force during reflexive cough testing that those post-stroke patients with no signs of
      aspiration or dysphagia after stroke.

      We also aimed to measure the strenght of the respiratory measures with the use of surface
      EMG.
