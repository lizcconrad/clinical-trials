    <textblock>
      The present study used a cluster-randomized controlled trial to evaluate the effects of a
      computer-tailored, pedometer-based Physical Activity (PA) intervention delivered through the
      Internet. An invitation e-mail with study information was sent to managers of 18 white-collar
      workplaces. Eight workplaces consented to participate. All employees of a single workplace
      were allocated at random to either the intervention or a waiting list control group, in order
      to avoid contamination between employees receiving the intervention and those who were not
      receiving the intervention. Subsequently, employees of the participating workplaces were
      recruited by e-mail. Only Dutch speaking employees between 18 and 65 years old, who had
      access to the Internet at work or at home, were eligible. Interested employees could sign up
      by returning a confirmation e-mail to the researchers. On receiving this information, a
      meeting was organized in each of the eight worksites to deliver all documents for baseline
      measurement (T0) to the participants, including an informed consent form, a blinded
      pedometer, an activity log and a self-administered questionnaire. During this meeting,
      information was provided on how to use the pedometer, how to log PA activities and how to
      answer the questionnaire. Moreover, the participants were asked to adhere to their usual PA
      pattern throughout the baseline measurement. After one week, all measurement tools were
      collected, and average daily step counts were calculated. At this point, participants in the
      intervention condition received (1) a booklet with information on how to increase steps, (2)
      a non-blinded pedometer, which they could use for three months, and (3) a username, a
      password and the amount of average daily steps, calculated by the researchers, so that
      participants could use this number when requesting the online computer-tailored step advice.
      Participants in the control condition did not receive any of the above mentioned intervention
      components. One and three months later, all participants again received a blinded pedometer,
      which was worn for one week. When wearing the blinded-pedometer one month (T1) and three
      months (T2) post baseline, intervention participants were allowed to also were the
      non-blinded pedometer. Furthermore, the same self-reported questionnaire was used to measure
      PA level at T1 and T2 in order to test the effectiveness of the intervention.
