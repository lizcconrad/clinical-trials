  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This primary aim of this study was to critically assess whether or not sweat water content
      and sodium concentration were acutely regulated by dynamic changes in antidiuretic hormone
      (arginine vasopressin or AVP) acting on the Vasopressin 2 receptor (V2R) during exercise.
      Secondary aims were to evaluate running performance and core temperature to further
      characterize the role of AVP in the coordinated balance of fluid and temperature homeostasis
      during exercise. The primary hypothesis was that activation of the V2R in sweat glands would
      result in water reabsorption and fluid conservation during endurance exercise.

      Ten healthy habitual runners (&gt; 50km running per week) between 18-60 years of age
      participated in this double blind randomized control trial. Each subject presented to the
      exercise lab on four separate occasions. Trial 1 was a familiarization trial to determine
      each subject's maximal aerobic capacity and peak treadmill running speak (VO2 Peak test).
      Trials 2, 3 and 4 utilized the same exact protocol, differing only in pharmacological
      intervention. In a randomized, double-blind order (both participant and investigator blinded
      to the intervention), either a placebo pill, the V2 receptor antagonist tolvaptan (Samsca™,
      30mg tablet), or the V2 receptor agonist desmopressin (DDAVP™, 0.2mg tablet) was ingested
      along with the CorTemp™ Core Temperature Sensor two hours before commencement of the Exercise
      Trial with 240mL of bottled water. The exercise protocol consisted of 60 minutes of treadmill
      running at 60% of peak speed (steady-state) followed by a performance test (the VO2 Peak
      test). Blood, saliva and urine, were collected before the exercise trial (baseline) and again
      after both the steady-state run and performance runs. Sweat was obtained from sweat patches
      after both the steady-state and performance runs. Core temperature, fluid intake, performance
      time, body weight, thirst and sodium palatability ratings were also assessed. Free access to
      water was allowed during the trial and all urine produced during the trial was measured and
      collected. The main outcome measure was sweat sodium concentration.

    <description>Changes in sweat sodium concentration will parallel changes in urine sodium concentration with use of the V2R antagonist, agonist and placebo if the primary hypothesis is true (sweat sodium is regulated by the V2R, similar to how urine sodium is regulated by principle cells located within in the kidney collecting duct)</description>

    <description>Measurement of salivary sodium concentration will allow us to determine if the V2R antagonist, agonist and placebo interventions activate aquaporin-5 (AQP5) water channels that are also located in sweat glands. If the V2R acts on the sweat glands through AQP5, there should be parallel changes in sweat, urine and saliva sodium concentrations with each pharmaceutical intervention.</description>

          <description>This study was a double-blind randomized controlled trial in which all ten subjects participated in three trials under three separate pharmacological interventions: V2R antagonist, agonist and placebo conditions. A standardized exercise protocol was performed in the laboratory, separated by one week.
