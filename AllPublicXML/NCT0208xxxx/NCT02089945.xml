    <textblock>
      Narrowing of the aortic valve in the heart, known as severe aortic stenosis, can impede blood
      delivery and is associated with poor quality of life and death. In the elderly with
      considerable medical burden, a relatively new non-invasive valve replacement technique called
      Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation (TAVI) can be used instead of open-heart surgery.
      However, long term changes in cognition after TAVI remain unclear and previous studies have
      suggested an increased risk of cognitive decline in patients following the surgical
      procedure. In this pilot study, the investigators will characterize changes in cognition,
      physical capacity, overall quality of life and neuropsychiatric symptoms (depression and
      apathy) over 6 months after TAVI.

      Cardiovascular disease including valvular heart disease, contributes to an estimated 36% of
      all deaths over the age of 70. In particular, severe aortic stenosis is the most common
      valvular heart disease in the elderly in the Western world and is associated with reduced
      quality of life and increased mortality. TAVI has been shown to improve survival, with an
      all-cause mortality at 1 year similar to surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR) with
      favourable outcomes long-term including improved functional capacity and quality of life.
      Recent evidence from randomized controlled trials suggests an increased risk of neurological
      events (e.g. cognitive decline) up to 1 year after TAVI in comparison to both SAVR and
      medical treatment. Studies have shown no change in short-term memory, working memory, verbal
      learning, delayed recognition and verbal fluency 3 months after TAVI. In addition, patients
      with severe aortic stenosis have an increased risk of mortality and future health
      complications. This study will be an observational, prospective cohort pilot study to examine
      changes in cognitive performance and functional outcomes after TAVI. We propose to recruit 34
      patients for this study. Cognitive performance will be measured using a standardized
      cognitive battery prior to TAVI and 6 months post-TAVI. Functional capacity, changes in
      neuropsychiatric symptoms and quality of life will also be assessed prior to TAVI and 6
      months post-TAVI. We hypothesize there will a change in cognitive performance, functional
      capacity, mood outcomes and quality of life over 6 months after TAVI.
