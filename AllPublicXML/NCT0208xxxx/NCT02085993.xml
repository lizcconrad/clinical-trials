    <textblock>
      Cross-sectional study, observation made by healthcare professionals of subjects or
      caregivers, administering romiplostim at their first standard-of-care visit 4 weeks after
      training with the home administration training pack. Further observations can also be
      recorded in the study if made within 16 weeks of enrolment. Data will be collected from the
      subjects' dose diary at their first standard of care visit to ensure there were no problems
      with administration while not at the clinic.

      This cross-sectional study involves direct observation by a healthcare professional of a
      series of subjects and caregivers in the act of administering romiplostim at their first
      standard-of-care visit occurring 4 weeks after training with the HAT pack. Further
      observations, if they occur, will also be recorded in the study if made within 16 weeks of
      enrolment. (Additional observations are voluntary and are not required for study
      participation; they occur only if the healthcare professional requests them.) Additionally,
      data will be collected from the subjects' dose diary at the first standard of care visit to
      ensure there were no problems with administration while not at the clinic.

        ITP patients being treated with romiplostim will be approached for possible study
        participation. At each participating site, patients that meet the following criteria will
        be enrolled as a study subject. Adult ITP patients, treated per EU Summary of product
        characteristics (SmPC), or caregiver new (or at least a 3 month gap) to administering
        romiplostim, that has received HAT pack training and is available at a standard-of-care
        medical visit 4 weeks (range 2 to 8 weeks) after HAT pack training, the patient provides
        informed consent.
