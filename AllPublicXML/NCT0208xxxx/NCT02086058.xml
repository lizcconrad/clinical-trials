    <textblock>
      The aim of this study (the hypothesis) is to identify differences in the gene expression
      profile in the bladder muscle and hereby gain greater knowledge about the muscular mechanisms
      that cause overactive bladder and daytime urinary incontinence in children older than 5
      years. A secondary aim is to examine how this gene expression profile differs from children
      with a neurogenic overactive bladder and how the gene expression profile changes from
      childhood till adulthood. Such new knowledge will result in a more precisely targeted and
      hence effective treatment of overactive bladder.

      The results will be obtained by retrieving bladder biopsies from children and adults
      suffering from an overactive bladder or a neurogenic bladder. These biopsies will undergo
      molecular analysis and the investigators will compare them with biopises from bladder healthy
      adults and children.

    <description>We will evaluate the gene expression (which genes are up- and/or down regulated) in the bladder in healthy children compared to children suffering from an overactive bladder. This gene expression will then be compared to the gene expression in bladder tissue from adults, to evaluate what happens in the bladder from childhood to adulthood.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

        Group 1: Group 1 (non-neurogenic bladder/overactive bladder):

          -  age 5-14 years of age

          -  patients must have filled out 48-hour bladder diaries

          -  a minimum of 4 micturitions per day (assessed from the bladder diaries)

          -  functional daytime urinary incontinence

          -  overactive bladder as defined by urgency

          -  no signs of neurogenic bladder dysfunction on invasive urodynamics

          -  a non-remarkable clinical examination

          -  normal BMI (between 3-97 percentile)

          -  informed oral and written consent from the child and both parents/legal guardian. In
             the informed consent the parents /legal guardian have given permission to the
             authorities (The Danish Ethical Committee), so that they may get information about the
             child during monitoring and quality inspection visits.

          -  no effect of prior treatment of at least 6 months urotherapy

          -  no effect of prior treatment of at least 3 months of anticholinergic treatment

          -  planned to undergo a cystoscopy under anesthesia

        Group 2:

          -  5-14 years of age or &gt;18 years old

          -  diagnosed with a neurogenic bladder (i.e. caused by myelomeningocele)

          -  informed oral and written consent from the child and both parents/legal guardian. In
             the informed consent the parents /legal guardian have given permission to the
             authorities (The Danish Ethical Committee), so that they may get information about the
