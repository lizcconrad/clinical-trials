  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The blood concentration of the antibiotic colistin is determined in patients in whom kidney
      function is reduced such that a renal replacement therapy is needed.

      Hypothesis:no dose reduction is needed in patients undergoing continuous renal replacement
      therapy over 24h because colistin is sufficiently removed by this procedure.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      After administration of intravenous Colistin multiple blood samples are drawn over one dosing
      interval on day 1, 3, and 5 of treatment.

      Patients are monitored for signs of neuro- and nephrotoxicity
