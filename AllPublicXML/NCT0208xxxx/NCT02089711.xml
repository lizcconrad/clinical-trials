    <textblock>
      This study is being initiated to create a normal database including measures of optic nerve
      head (ONH), peripapillary retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL), and macula using the Heidelberg
      Spectralis OCT device. The range will be determined for each structural parameter across
      normal eyes in Japanese subjects, and the measurements stratified according to age.

      This multi-center, prospective, observational (non-interventional) study is the second in a
      series to measure structural parameters of the optic nerve head, the peripapillary retinal
      nerve fiber layer, and the macula using the Heidelberg Spectralis OCT device. This study is
      conducted in normal Japanese volunteers. The main goal of the study is to provide the range
      of these structural parameters in normal eyes. The study will include at least 224
      (enrollment target: 249) normal volunteers; each study site will recruit 32 to 40 subjects
      with an age range of 18 to 90 years and an approximately equal number of females and males.
      All subjects will undergo Spectralis OCT imaging, biometric and ophthalmoscopic examination,
      disc photography and visual field testing in one single visit. All examinations performed on
      the subjects are non-significant risk procedures because the medical devices are cleared for
      marketing in Europe and in the U.S.

        At least 224 Japanese subjects (enrollment target: 249 subjects) will be selected from
        qualifying normal volunteers. Age ranges will be from ≥18 to 90 years. Recruitment will be
        from persons who respond to recruitment initiatives at the individual centers or have
        signed a release saying that they are willing to be approached for participation in
        research.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subject is not an employee of the eye clinic.

          -  Age ≥18 to 90.

          -  Able and willing to undergo the test procedures, give consent, and to follow
             instructions.

          -  Healthy eye without prior intraocular surgery (except cataract surgery) and without
             clinically significant vitreal, retinal or choroidal diseases, clinically significant
             diabetic retinopathy (subject may have diabetes), or disease of the optic nerve. Small
             Drusen are acceptable in older subjects.

          -  Japanese decent (self-reported).

          -  Negative history of glaucoma.

          -  Intraocular pressure ≤21mmHg.

          -  Best corrected visual acuity ≥0.5.

          -  Refraction between +6 and -6 diopters and astigmatism ≤ 2 diopters.

          -  Axial length ≤ 26.0 mm

          -  Normal visual field with Glaucoma Hemifield Test and Mean Deviation within normal
             limits, or not abnormal visual field by judgment of the ophthalmologist.

          -  Clinically normal appearance of the optic disc, with normal appearing neuroretinal rim
             with respect to color and shape. The optic disc is examined ophthalmoscopically and by
             evaluation of stereo photographs.

          -  When both eyes are eligible, both eyes enter the study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Unreliable visual field. The reliability indices should be used as guide as well as
             the perimetrist's notes.

          -  Unusable disc stereo photos.

          -  Inability to undergo the tests.

          -  Insufficient quality of Spectralis OCT images (this is not determined until after
             Spectralis OCT examination, and is an unusual circumstance).

        Minimum requirements are:

          -  Retina completely included in image frame,

          -  Quality Score ≥ 20 in the stored ART mean images, and

          -  For ONH-R scan: Center position error ≤ 100 μm.

        Note: Inability of a subject to perform one of the two scan patterns or insufficient image
        quality in one scan pattern does not exclude the subject or eye from the study.
