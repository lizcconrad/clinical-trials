    <textblock>
      This will be an open label study to assess the influence of renal impairment on the
      pharmacokinetics (PK) of GLPG0634 and its metabolite after once daily oral administrations of
      100 mg GLPG0634 for 10 days in subjects with renal impairment and matched healthy controls.

      Also, safety and tolerability of once daily oral doses of GLPG0634 for 10 days in subjects
      with renal impairment and matched healthy controls will be evaluated.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will be divided in two parts.

      In Part 1, 3 subjects with severe renal impairment or end-stage renal disease (ESRD) not yet
      requiring dialysis (Group 1) will be recruited first. Thereafter, 3 subjects with normal
      renal function (Group 2) will be recruited. If a substantial effect on the PK in renal
      impaired subjects is observed on Day 10, the sponsor may elect to stop Part 1 of the study
      without enrolling the complete set of subjects and Part 2 will be initiated. In case no
      substantial effect on the PK is observed, 3 further subjects in both Group 1 and 2 will be
      recruited and analysed. If a substantial effect on the PK is observed, the study will proceed
      to Part 2. Part 2 of the study will not be conducted, if in Part 1 no substantial difference
      in PK is seen.

      In Part 2, Group 3 (mild renal impairment) and Group 4 (moderate renal impairment) will be
      recruited first. After completion of the mild and moderate impairment groups, Group 5 (normal
      renal function) will be recruited.
