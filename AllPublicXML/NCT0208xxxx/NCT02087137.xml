  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Normal aging is associated with decline in some aspects of memory, and this can be a risk
      factor for reductions in everyday functioning. The Baycrest Memory and Aging Program teaches
      positive adaptation to age-related memory changes, including strategies for minimizing the
      everyday impact of normal memory change and positive lifestyle change to maximize brain
      health. Prior research has shown that the Memory and Aging program is effective in increasing
      participants' knowledge about memory, use of memory strategies, and confidence in memory
      function, as well as adoption of healthier lifestyle practices and reduction in intention to
      use unneeded health care resources.

      Although not one of the stated goals of the program, informal feedback from participants
      suggests that the educational content and skills training in the Memory and Aging Program has
      led some participants to change behaviours in ways that lead to significant improvements in
      their everyday functioning. For example, graduating participants often volunteer examples of
      how they have applied what they have learned to succeed in everyday memory tasks such as
      learning a new name or keeping track of future plans. Based on this participant feedback, it
      is hypothesized that the knowledge, skills, and confidence gained by Memory and Aging Program
      participants may lead to positive behaviour changes that, in turn, lead to improved everyday
      functioning. The present study will test this hypothesis using a randomized controlled
      pretest-posttest design.

    <description>The Memory and Aging Program intervention consists of five 2-hour sessions conducted over five consecutive weeks. The content of the program includes: (a) the provision of factual information (i.e., about memory, age-related memory changes, lifestyle factors affecting memory, and memory strategies) in an informal lecture format; and (b) memory intervention (i.e., practice and application of several evidence-based memory strategies) in a hands-on interactive format.</description>
