      This is an open-label, single-dose, randomized crossover study of single oral 10-mg tablet
      doses administered either after an overnight fast or in combination with a standard high-fat
      meal in healthy subjects.

      The study will have 2 phases: Prerandomization and Randomization. The Prerandomization Phase
      will consist of 2 periods: Screening and Baseline (Baseline Period 1), during which each
      subjectï¿½s study eligibility will be determined and baseline assessments will be conducted.
      During this phase, each eligible subject will be randomized to 1 of 2 treatment sequences to
      receive single oral doses of E2006 10 mg under fasted and fed conditions. The Randomization
      Phase will consist of 3 periods: administration of the first randomized dose (Treatment
      Period 1), baseline for the second randomized dose (Baseline Period 2), and administration of
      the second randomized dose (Treatment Period 2).

        Inclusion Criteria

          1. Healthy males or females, ages 18 to 55 years

          2. Body mass index greater than 18 and less than or equal to 32 kg/m2 at Screening

          3. All females must be of nonchildbearing potential, defined as postmenopausal women
             (defined as at least 12 months consecutive amenorrhea, in the appropriate age group
             and without other known or suspected cause) or subjects who have been sterilized
             surgically or who are otherwise proven sterile (eg, bilateral tubal ligation with
             surgery at least 6 months prior to dosing, hysterectomy, or bilateral oophorectomy
             with surgery at least 2 months prior to dosing). In addition, females must have a
             negative serum B-human chorionic gonadotropin test result at Screening.

          4. Males who are not abstinent or have undergone a successful vasectomy, who are partners
             of women of childbearing potential must use, or their partners must use a highly
             effective method of contraception (eg, condom plus spermicide, condom plus diaphragm
             with spermicide, intrauterine device starting at least 1 menstrual cycle prior to
             starting study drug and throughout the entire study period and for 30 days [longer if
             appropriate] after the last dose of study drug)

          5. Are willing and able to comply with all aspects of the protocol

          6. Provide written informed consent

        Exclusion Criteria

             gastroparesis, or any gastrointestinal procedure for the purpose of weight loss
             (including Lapband(TM)), which would slow gastric emptying and potentially affect PK
             profiles of E2006

          3. Subjects with a known history of clinically significant drug or food allergies or a
             known allergy or hypersensitivity to capsule or tablet ingredients

             donated plasma within 1 week of dosing

         10. Subjects who used hormonal replacement therapy within 3 months prior to dosing

         11. Subjects who used any drugs, over-the-counter medications, nutritional supplements

             to dosing or who are currently enrolled in another clinical trial

         16. Subjects with a disease that may influence the outcome of the study, such as
             psychiatric disorders and disorders of the gastrointestinal tract, liver, kidney,
             respiratory system, endocrine system, hematological system, neurological system, or
