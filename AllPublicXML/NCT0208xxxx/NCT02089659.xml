    <textblock>
      This study will investigate the influence of hepatic insufficiency on the pharmacokinetics
      (PK) of doravirine (MK-1439). In Part 1, PK of doravirine in participants with moderate
      hepatic insufficiency will be compared with that of healthy control subjects matched with
      regard to mean age and weight. If a clinically meaningful increase in doravirine exposure is
      observed in participants with moderate hepatic insufficiency in Part 1, study Part 2 will
      evaluate PK of doravirine in participants with mild hepatic insufficiency.
