  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will be an open-label, randomized, single dose, 3-period crossover PK study. This
      study will comprise 3 treatment periods with a 4-day washout between periods. On Day -1,
      subjects will be randomized to 1 of 6 treatment sequences. On Days 1, 5, and 9, subjects will
      be administered Treatment A, B, or C according to the randomization schedule.

        -  Treatment A: a single dose of 160 mg ACY-1215 CLF (20 mg/mL) in the fed state

        -  Treatment B: a single dose of 120 mg ACY-1215 ALF (10 mg/mL) in the fed state

        -  Treatment C: a single dose of 120 mg ACY-1215 ALF (10 mg/mL) in the fasted state

      Subjects will be confined to the Clinical Research Unit (CRU) from the time of Check-in (Day
      -1) to Day 10. Predose blood and urine samples will be obtained prior to each ACY-1215
      administration. Following administration of ACY-1215 in each period, blood and urine samples
      will be collected at specified timepoints or intervals through 24 hours postdose for the
      determination of the PK of a single oral dose of ACY-1215. Subjects will be discharged from
      the CRU on Day 10, following the completion of the last PK collection and successful
      completion and evaluation of discharge safety tests. Subjects will return to the clinic for a
      Follow-up visit 5 to 7 days after the last dose of ACY-1215 (Days 14 to 16) for additional
      safety evaluations.
