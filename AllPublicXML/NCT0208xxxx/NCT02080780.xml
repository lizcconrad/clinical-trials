      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the drug-drug interaction potential of
      clarithromycin XL on Diltiazem hydrochloride (DTZ) 2% cream.

      This study was designed to investigate the potential effect of clarithromycin XL at steady
      state (administered orally, once daily on Days 4 through 9 as 2 x 500 mg tablets, 1000 mg per
      day, for a total of 6000 mg) on the PK of a single topical dose of diltiazem hydrochloride 2%
      cream applied to the perianal area (~2.5 cm [1 inch]; ~8.5 mg). This was a Phase 1 study with
      a single treatment arm. Efficacy was not assessed; therefore the study was of open-label
      design.
