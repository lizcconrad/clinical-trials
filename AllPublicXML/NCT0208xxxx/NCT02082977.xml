    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, multicenter, 2-part study to determine the recommended Phase 2 dose
      (RP2D) for GSK2816126 given twice weekly by intravenous (IV) infusion. Part 1 will be
      conducted in adult subjects with relapsed/refractory diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL),
      transformed follicular lymphoma (tFL), other Non-Hodgkin's lymphomas (NHL), solid tumors
      (including castrate resistant prostate cancer) and multiple myeloma (MM) to determine the
      safety and tolerability of GSK2816126. Expansion cohorts (Part 2) are planned to further
      explore clinical activity of GSK2816126 at the RP2D in subjects with Enhancer of Zeste 2
      (EZH2) wild type and EZH2 mutant positive germinal center B-cell like diffuse large B cell
      lymphoma (GCB-DLBCL), tFL and MM.

             Monitor, will not affect the evaluation of the effects of this clinical trial
             treatment on currently targeted malignancy, can be included in this clinical trial;
             Curatively treated non-melanoma skin cancer and any carcinoma-in-situ.
