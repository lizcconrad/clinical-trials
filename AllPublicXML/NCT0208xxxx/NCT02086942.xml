  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase 2 study will be conducted at 10 centers and enroll patients from August 2013 to
      August 2017.Firstly, All patients included will provide written informed consent. Secondly,
      they will be randomized equally to receive modified VCD regimen arm 1 or modified VCD regimen
      arm 2. In total, 47 patients per arm (or 94 in total) are required. The treatment consists of
      four 4-week cycles of induction therapy followed by intensive therapy with another five
      modified VCD regimens and maintenance treatment with CP regimen. Then, patients will be
      followed up for 24 months after chemotherapy. The investigators will record all the
      laboratory and clinical investigations to assess response at different points of the study.
      We also monitor and assess adverse events (AEs), as graded according to NCI-CTCAE Version
      3.0.Response categories were based on the International Myeloma Working Group uniform
      response criteria.In addition, 20 patients (10 in VCD regimen arm 1 group, 10 in VCD regimen
      arm 2 group) from ten centres will be enrolled in the pharmacodynamic substudy.

    <description>Induction therapy：modified VCD regimen1 for 4 cycles,28 Days per Cycle.Intensive therapy：modified VCD regimen1 for 5 cycles.
Maintenance treatment:CP for 12 cycles. Interval between every two cycles for one month.
Interventions:
Drug: Bortezomib 1.6mg/m2 SC,Days 1, 6, 11, 16; Drug:Cyclophosphamide 300mg/m2 VD,Days 1-3; Drug: Dexamethasone 40 mg/d VD,Days 1, 6, 11,16; We undertook a pharmacodynamic substudy at selected sites. Blood samples were collected in cycle 1 on day 1, 6,11,16 before the dose was given and at several time points after dosing. We analysed whole blood samples to measure 20S proteasome chymotryptic activity, with a standard method. Pharmacodynamic parameters were calculated by analysis of percentage inhibition of 20S proteasome activity-time data.</description>
