      The purpose of this research study is to evaluate the effects of the chemotherapeutic drug,
      Trastuzumab (Herceptin) on the heart. Trastuzumab (Herceptin) is used to treat specific types
      of breast cancer and is known to cause weakening of the heart. Unfortunately, little is know
      as to why this this happens. The investigators want to identify any factors that may lead to
      the early detection, treatment and prevention of the cardiotoxicity (heart problem)
      associated with this drug.

      As a subject participating in this study the following information will be collected:
      complete past medical history including age, height, and weight will be done with each
      echocardiogram; blood pressure at clinic visits during treatment with trastuzumab, type of
      cancer will be noted, type of chemotherapy, doses of chemotherapy, type and dose of
      chemotherapy in the past, type and dose of radiation therapy received, names and doses of
      cardiac medications, results of cardiac tests, results of lab tests, family history of heart
      disease, and social history which will include risk factors for developing heart disease
      including tobacco and alcohol use. This information will be entered into a database for the
      investigators to try and detect any factors that may lead to the cardiotoxicity (heart
      problem) that may be caused by Trastuzumab (Herceptin).

      Any transthoracic echocardiogram (heart ultrasound) ordered will be further evaluated for
      special parameters that may help to detect weakening of the heart earlier than a normal
      ultrasound. An echocardiogram (heart ultrasound) is when a probe is placed on the chest and
      pictures are taken using sound waves and a special camera.
