      To record diaphragm excursion in infratentorial brain lesions patients with dysphagia during
      coughing and compare them to those with supratentorial brain lesion patients with dysphasia
      and those with no dysphagia at a university affiliated rehabilitation department.

      Our previous work has shown that stroke patients with dysphagia have impaired diaphragm
      excursion in comparison to those with no dysphagia. It has been postulated that respiratory
      and cough function are primarily controlled by respiratory and swallowing centers located in
      the brainstem.We postulated that those with infratentorial brain lesions would have more
      impaired cough and respiratory function than those with non-brainstem lesions and
      supratentorial brain lesions.

      However there has been no studies whether those with infratentorial brain lesions have more
      impaired cough function and decreased diaphragm excursion than those with supratentorial
      brain lesions.
