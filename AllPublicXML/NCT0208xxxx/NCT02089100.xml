  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The previous reported phase I study allows us to prospectively define the optimal total dose
      in different metastatic locations (88). However, several questions are still unanswered such
      as the adequate timing of the stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) in oligometastatic
      disease. Indeed, there are two different oligometastatic states: &quot;de novo&quot;, i.e. occurring at
      first metastatic presentation without any previous systemic therapy; and &quot;secondary&quot;, defined
      as residual disease after systemic treatment.

      The investigators wish to prospectively study the role of metastases SBRT with curative
      intent in de novo oligometastatic disease.

      This clinical trial would be the first randomized study studying SBRT at onset of the
      metastatic disease. If this trial shows a PFS improvement, it will definitively change the
      standard of treatment and it will highlight SBRT as a key treatment of metastatic disease. It
      will confirm the oligometastasis hypothesis as well as the Simon Norton hypothesis (92).
