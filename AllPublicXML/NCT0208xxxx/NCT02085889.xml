  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background: The association of fructose and lactose intolerance and malabsorption with the
      symptoms of different functional gastrointestinal disorders (FGID) is unclear. The mechanisms
      behind the multi-organ symptoms remain unclear. Both FGID and saccharide intolerances are
      common (&gt;10% of any given population). Dietary modification based on intolerance diagnostics
      could provide an effective treatment for FGID, which are otherwise difficult to treat.

      Aim: To investigate the prevalence and interrelationships of fructose and lactose intolerance
      (symptom induction) and malabsorption (breath test gas production) and their association with
      clinical GI as well as non-GI symptoms in FGID and the outcome of standard dietary
      intervention. Mechanisms related to symptom genesis will be investigated using metabolomic
      analysis of plasma and urine by gas chromatography/time-of-flight mass spectrometry
      (GC/TOFMS).

      Methods: Fructose and lactose intolerance (defined by positive symptom index) and
      malabsorption (defined by increased hydrogen/methane) will be determined in successive male
      and female FGID patients in a single center using breath-testing. Symptoms will be recorded
      using standardised questionnaires and the Rome III criteria. The prevalence of the
      intolerances in the different FGID subgroups and the associations between breath testing
      results, clinical symptoms and the outcome of dietary modification will be assessed. Factors
      predictive of the outcome of dietary modulation will be screened for. GC/TOFMS will be used
      to assess the human and microbial metabolome in urine and plasma.
