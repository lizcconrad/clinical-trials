  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Rapid tests are increasingly used in medical practice, notably to screen for HIV. Their use
      has been associated with a faster linkage to care and lower rates of loss to follow up. Rapid
      tests are also well accepted by patients and clinicians.

      No rapid test is currently approved in Canada for screening of hepatitis C. Hepatitis C
      diagnosis is done through based on blood testing and the screening algorithm may require up
      to 3 visits to clarify the hepatitis C status.

      The Oraquick HCV test is a rapid test done on blood or saliva that can replace the first step
      of the regular screening algorithm. With this test the initial screening and the confirmation
      test can be done in one visit.

      The primary endpoint of this pilot-project is to evaluate clinical characteristics of
      Oracquick HCV (sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values) and to
      compare them to those of the standard screening algorithm in a population of active or
      ex-users of injected drugs. The project also intend to evaluate if the rapid test can reduce
      the rates of loss to follow up and increase the linkage to hepatitis C specialized care. This
      last endpoint will be evaluated through phone call follow up 6 months after the screening.

      One hundred and fifty patients will be included. Half will be tested with the standard
      algorithm and the Oraquick HCV test (group A) and half will be tested only with the standard
      algorithm.

      Results of group A will be used to determine the clinical characteristics of Oraquick HCV.
      Results of groups A and B will be used to evaluate rates of loss to follow up, costs avoided
      by the use of the rapid test and linkage to care of infected patients.

    <description>Oraquick HCV Antibody test will be compared to a composite goldstandard:
If both the Oraquick test and the standard test are negative, the results will be considered as a true negative.
If both the Oraquick test and the standard test are positive, the results will be considered as a true positive.
If the tests are discordant, HCV RNA testing will be performed. If HCV RNA is positive, the result of the test who predicted the positive result will be a true positive and the result of the other test will be a false negative. If the HCV RNA is negative, the result of the standard test will be considered as the true value (either positive or negative).</description>
