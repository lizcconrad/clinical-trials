  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Obesity is associated with increased risk for mortality, atherosclerotic cerebrovascular
      disease, coronary heart disease, colorectal cancer, hyperlipidemia, hypertension, gallbladder
      disease, and diabetes mellitus, resulting in over 111,000 deaths annually in the United
      States (Calle et al., 1999; Flegal et al., 2005). In the US, 65% of adults are overweight or
      obese (Hedley et al., 2004). Unfortunately, the treatment of choice for obesity (behavioral
      weight loss treatment) only results in a 10% reduction in body weight on average and most
      patients regain this weight within a few years (Jeffery et al., 2000). Further, most obesity
      prevention programs do not reduce risk for future weight gain (Stice, Shaw, &amp; Marti, 2006).
      The limited success of treatment and prevention interventions may be due to an incomplete
      understanding of the processes that increase risk for obesity. Recent data suggest that obese
      adults show abnormalities in reward from food intake and anticipated food intake relative to
      lean adults, but the precise nature of these abnormalities is unclear and it has not been
      established whether these abnormalities predate obesity onset or are a consequence. It is
      vital to elucidate risk factors for obesity onset to advance understanding of etiological
      processes and determine the content of prevention and treatment programs.

      The goals of this study are to (1) determine whether adolescents at high-risk for obesity, by
      virtue of having two obese parents, show abnormalities in reward from food intake
      (consummatory food reward) and anticipated reward from food intake (anticipatory food reward)
      compared to adolescents who are at low-risk for obesity, (2) determine whether abnormalities
      in consummatory and anticipatory food reward increase risk for weight gain and obesity onset,
      (3) examine moderators that may amplify the relations of consummatory and anticipatory food
      reward to unhealthy weight gain, and (4) examine changes in consummatory and anticipatory
      food reward in those participants who show obesity onset relative to those not showing
      obesity onset.
