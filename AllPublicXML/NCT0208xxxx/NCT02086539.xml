      This study aims to determine the effectiveness of 4 different recruitment techniques for
      enrollment into a cholesterol study. 2,000 people that meet initial eligibility criteria for
      the study will be randomized into one of 4 groups and will all receive the same recruitment
      letter inviting them to participate in the study by enrolling on an online platform. Group 1
      will receive the recruitment letter in a normal sized envelope, Group 2 will receive the
      recruitment letter in an 8.5 x 11 inch envelope, Group 3 will receive a recruitment letter
      shipped via USPS priority mail and a Group 4 will receive a recruitment letter with the image
      of an Amazon gift card and told they will receive a $25 gift card if they enroll in the
      study. All other groups are told that they will receive a $25 check upon enrollment in the
      study.
