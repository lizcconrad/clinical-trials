  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cardiovascular diseases (CVD) are still considered the main cause of mortality and morbidity
      all over the world. In the last years, efforts have been made to define more effective
      therapeutic and preventive strategies.Periodontal diseases have been considered a probable
      risk factor for CVD with a great amount of evidence from observational studies. Although
      there are some interventional studies evaluating the systemic effects of periodontal therapy,
      there is little information regarding the impact of periodontal treatment on the prevention
      of cardiovascular events. To the best of our knowledge, there are no randomized controlled
      trials published to date assessing the effect of periodontal therapy in primary prevention of
      CVD.

    <description>The group (TG) consisted of periodontal treatment comprising one session of supragingival scaling and personalized oral hygiene instructions, followed by one to four sessions of subgingival scaling and root planing (SRP) by quadrant, under local anesthesia, in a period of 14 days. Individuals were be followed monthly during the first 6 months. In the follow-up sessions, professional plaque removal, oral hygiene instructions, cardiac support along with counseling reinforcement were be provided.</description>
