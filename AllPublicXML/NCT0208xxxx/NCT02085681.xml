  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to compare the effectiveness of identifying diabetic retinopathy
      using tele-medicine based Digital Retinal Imaging in Diabetes Clinics with that of the
      conventional referral system.

      Hypothesis: Tele-medicine based digital retinal imaging involving a diabetes centre will
      identify proportionately more diabetic patients with DR and lead to higher acceptance rate
      with subsequent ophthalmic referral and management

  <detailed_description>

      The design is a cluster randomized trial of tele-medicine versus usual care in diabetic
      patients. The primary outcome of the study is the proportion of patients with confirmed DR at
      Aravind Eye Hospital (AEH). DR will be graded using the International Clinical Diabetic
      Retinopathy Disease Severity Scale. A sample size of 616 patients in both arms is required to
      detect a risk ratio of 1.8 or above at 90% power, 1% alpha and a design effect of 2. Eight
      clinics will be recruited and equally randomized to tele-medicine or usual care stratified by
      distance from AEH. Inclusion criteria include a confirmed diagnosis of diabetes, age over 50,
      no retinal exam in the previous year. In the tele-medicine arm patients will be offered
      fundus imaging and patients diagnosed with DR or probable DR will be counselled to visit AEH
      to confirm DR. In the usual care arm, the eligible patients will be counselled and referred
      to undergo an eye examination at AEH. In both the arms the counselling and the awareness
      creation materials will be standardized. Fundus imaging will be offered at the end of the
      study to those who refuse initially and all those in the usual arm who did not attend AEH.

Based on the presence or absence of DR the patients will be referred to the eye hospital for detailed retinal examination.</description>
