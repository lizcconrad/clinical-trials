      Primary Objective:

      Efficacy: To assess the progression-free survival rate at 10 months in patients on
      maintenance therapy with capecitabine plus aflibercept.

      Secondary Objectives:

      To evaluate:

        -  Efficacy: Progression Free Survival (PFS)

        -  Efficacy: Overall Survival (OS)

        -  Efficacy: Objective Response Rate (ORR) as per Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid
           Tumors (RECIST version 1.1) criteria

        -  Health related Quality of Life (HRQL): EORTC QLQ-C30 scores and EQ5D-3L

        -  Safety

      Exploratory Objective:

      To collect blood and tumor samples to perform investigations for potential biomarker testing.

      Total study duration for a participant can be up to 28 months.

      This trial is being conducted in countries where the INN designation for the study molecule
      is &quot;aflibercept&quot; and this term is therefore used throughout the synopsis. In the US, the US
      proper name is &quot;ziv-aflibercept&quot;.
