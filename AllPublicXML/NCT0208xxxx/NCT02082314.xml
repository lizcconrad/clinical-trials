  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Bone metastases are a cause of significant morbidity in cancer patients. In patients who die
      from breast, prostate, and lung cancer, autopsy studies have shown that up to 85% have
      evidence of bone metastases at the time of death (1). These metastases frequently give rise
      to complications that reduce patients' quality of life. These include: pain, fractures, and
      decreased mobility, ultimately reducing performance status.

      Radiofrequency ablation therapy with cementoplasty/vertebroplasty for painful bone metastases
      has been shown to be feasible, efficacious, and safe. However, patient reported outcomes have
      yet to be determined.

        The study population will be derived from patients with advanced cancers with spinal/pelvic
        metastases who have been referred to interventional radiology and have consented to
        receiving RFA and/or cementoplasty for their disease. Such patients will be followed with a
        daily diary for 10 days after treatment. The Brief Pain Inventory will be used to assess
        pain and functional interference on these days.
