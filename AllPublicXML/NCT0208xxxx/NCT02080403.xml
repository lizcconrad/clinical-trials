      The objective of the study is to assess the efficacy and safety of PerioChip® (Chlorhexidine
      gluconate chip) in the treatment of patients with Peri-implantitis.

      The hypothesis of the study is that PerioChip® in adjunct to mechanical subgingival
      debridement is more effective in the treatment of peri-implantitis when compared to the
      common method of mechanical subgingival debridement alone. The primary efficacy measure will
      be the reduction in probing pocket depth at 6 months as measured at sites of qualifying
      target implant.

      This is a research study that uses the drug PerioChip® (active ingredient chlorhexidine
      gluconate) as an experimental treatment for &quot;periimplantitis&quot;. This condition is defined an
      inflammation affecting the tissues (gums and bone) around an already stable implant,
      resulting in loss of supporting jaw bone. It is caused by many factors but current research
      links the condition with the presence of bacteria in the mouth which are responsible for
      periodontitis (gum disease). If left untreated, this can lead to decreased bone support,
      weakening of the implant and potential lost of the implant.

      Nonsurgical treatment (deep cleaning with instruments to remove plaque) and rigorous diligent
      oral care at home are commonly used to treat both periimplantitis (gum disease around an
      implant) and periodontitis (gum disease around teeth).

      The medication PerioChip® is a small dental chip (its size is smaller than a match head, and
      it is completely flat). The chip contains chlorhexidine gluconate, an antimicrobial agent
      which is not an antibiotic. The chip is inserted into the gum sulcus that is present around
      the tooth or implant and biodegrades naturally within 7 to 10 days while releasing the
      medication.

      The purpose of this study is to determine the efficacy of PerioChip® in addition to a
      standard deep cleaning treatment regime, as compared to standard deep cleaning alone.in a
      large patient population, and to collect additional safety data about the treatment.
