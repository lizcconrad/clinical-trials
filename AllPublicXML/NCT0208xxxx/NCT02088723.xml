    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if the elevation of the head of the bed in patients
      with obstructive sleep apnea can decrease the apnea-hypopnea index. First the investigators
      will do a standard polysomnography and see if the patients are included analysing the
      criteria like apnea-hypopnea index equal or more than 5. Within 2 weeks the patient will do
      the second polysomnography but this will be with a elevation of the head of the bed (15 cm of
      elevation of the bed doing a inclination). Then the investigators will compare the data of
      apnea-hypopnea index in the standard polysomnography versus the index with the elevation of
      the head of the bed.

      There are many researches that demonstrate that the position of the patient modified the
      apnea-hypopnea index(IAH). In supine position the IAH will increase comparing with lateral
      position during th sleep. However few studies were done with the elevation of the head of the
      bed.

      First the investigators will do a standard polysomnography and see if the patients are
      included analysing the criteria like apnea-hypopnea index equal or more than 5. Within 2
      weeks the patient will do the second polysomnography but this will be with a elevation of the
      head of the bed (15 cm of elevation of the bed doing a inclination). Then the investigators
      will compare the data of apnea-hypopnea index in the standard polysomnography versus the
      index with the elevation of the head of the bed.The main outcome will be to analyze the apnea
      hypopnea index comparing standard polysomnography (sPSG) with elevated polysomnography
      (ePSG).

    <description>During the polysomnography there are sensors that detect the airflow by cannula pressure and thermistor. WIth those equipment during the all night the patient will be registered and seen if there is absence of flow (apnea) and/or reduction of flow (hypopnea). The apnea and hypopnea index is done by dividing the number of respiratory events by recording time in hours of sleep (events per hour).</description>
