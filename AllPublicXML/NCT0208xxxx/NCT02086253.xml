  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Endothelial dysfunction of conduit arteries contributes to the increased morbidity and
      cardiovascular mortality in patients with essential hypertension and appears increasingly as
      an independent therapeutic target. We have shown previously that besides a decrease in the
      availability of NO and other endothelium-derived vasodilators factors, the
      epoxyeicosatrienoic acids, an increase in the vasoconstrictor endothelin-1 (ET-1) may play a
      role in the pathophysiology of this endothelial dysfunction. Indeed, the local concentrations
      of endothelin-1 during the endothelium-dependent dilation of the radial artery in response to
      a sustained increase in blood flow decreased significantly in healthy volunteers controls but
      not in hypertensive patients. This lack of adaptation of the endothelinergic system could be
      due to a decreased clearance of endothelin-1 by endothelial ETB receptors, potentiating the
      vasoconstrictor action of endothelin-1 mediated by ETA receptor activation at the muscular
      level. However, to validate this hypothesis , it is needed to demonstrate the physiological
      role of ETA receptor and ETB in sustained flow-mediated dilatation of conduit arteries.

    <description>This study will evaluate the effect of ETA receptor and combined ETA/ETB receptor blockade on the magnitude of the flow-mediated dilatation of the radial artery in response to distal skin heating in 8 healthy subjects.

    <time_frame>One hour after BQ-788 and/or BQ-123 brachial infusion</time_frame>
    <description>This study will evaluate the effect of ETA and/or ETB blockade on the variations in the local concentrations of ET-1, NO and EETs during sustained flow-mediated dilation in 8 healthy subjects. For this purpose, local blood samples will be drawn before (34°C) and at the end of hand skin heating (44°C). Plasma nitrite, indicator of NO availability will be quantified by chemiluminescence.Plasma EETs will be quantified by LC-MS. Plasma ET-1 will be quantified with an immunoassay.</description>
