  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, multi-center, fixed sequence study in subjects with BRAF V600 mutation
      positive tumors. Subjects will receive single oral doses of 10 milligram (mg) of rosuvastatin
      and 3 mg of midazolam in the morning of Day 1 (alone), Day 8 (with first dose of dabrafenib
      150 mg), and Day 22 (during repeat dose dabrafenib 150 mg twice daily [BID]). Dabrafenib 150
      mg BID will be administered from Day 8 to Day 23. Blood samples for PK analysis will be
      obtained over 32 hours post-dose on Day 1, Day 8, and Day 22. The last dose of dabrafenib
      will be taken in the morning of Day 23 and the last blood sample in the evening of Day 23.
      Subjects will be considered to have completed the study once the 32 hour PK sample has been
      collected on Day 23. Once they have completed the study, eligible subjects may have the
      option to enter study BRF114144, an open-label roll-over study of dabrafenib (no follow-up
      visit required) and continue receiving dabrafenib.

             but &gt; 1 cm in the longest dimension. Subjects with small (&lt;= 1 cm in the longest
             dimension), asymptomatic brain metastases that do not need immediate local therapy can
             be enrolled. Subjects on a stable dose of corticosteroids for more than one month, or
             those who have been off corticosteroids for at least 2 weeks can be enrolled. Subjects
