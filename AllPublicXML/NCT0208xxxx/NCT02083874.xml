        Inclusion Criteria: Participants must be seeking treatment for cannabis use disorder and
        report having experienced cannabis withdrawal symptoms in past quit attempts (as defined by
        participants' experiencing 3 or more symptoms after cessation of prolonged cannabis use or
        continuing use to avoid withdrawal symptoms). They must meet the criteria for a DSMV
        current cannabis use disorder and test positive to THC on urinary dip stick test on
        admission. They must be aged 18-65 and speak English.

        Exclusion Criteria: The aim is to exclude individuals with concurrent conditions that
        jeopardise patient safety or confound study data interpretation. These include (a) presence
        of another substance use disorder, operationalized as (i) more than twice weekly use of an
        illicit drug in the last 90 days (other than cannabis), (ii) alcohol AUDIT scores of
        greater than 15, or a current history of alcohol dependence, (iii) substance use treatment
        in the last 30 days, or (iv) current prescription drug abuse or dependence
        (benzodiazepines, opioids or psychostimulants); (b) evidence of unstable or severe medical
        conditions or cognitive or psychiatric impairment (including developmental disorder,
        schizophrenia or other psychotic disorders) that may prevent participation; (f) known or
        suspected allergy to propylene glycol, corn oil; (h) women of child bearing age not on a
        reliable contraceptive or men intending to start a family with one month of trial
        participation; (i) pregnant or lactating women; (j) not available for follow-up; (k) no
        access to telephone; or (l) unwillingness to provide written confirmation that they have
        been informed about, and will comply with, exclusion from driving when receiving
        medication. Only persons meeting all criteria will be assessed by trial medical officers
        and research staff as appropriate.
