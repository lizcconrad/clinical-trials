  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to evaluate the effectiveness of a nurse led intervention for
      high risk patients with diabetic foot ulceration and/or amputation.

      The effectiveness is defined in two ways 1) as a reduction in complication rates (time till
      ulceration recurrence, new ulcerations, amputation or reamputation) and 2) as a reduction in
      hospital readmissions for foot-related complication (one year survival probability: failure =
      readmission for ulceration recurrence, new ulcerations, amputation or re-amputation).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Diabetes mellitus (DM) is associates with numerous complications. One of these is decreased
      peripheral circulation impaired sensation leading to the development of foot ulcers that lead
      to amputations of toes, feet and limbs. These complications not only have devastating effects
      on the individual in terms of loss of functionality but also impact the patient's ability to
      carry out and enjoy occupational, recreational and family functioning activities.
      Furthermore, foot ulcers and associated problems often lead to prolonged hospitalization and
      loss of productivity. All of these have personal as well as societal economical implications.

      This pilot randomized clinical trial (RCT) aims to evaluate the feasibility of an additional
      patient education program to current management of foot care in patients with DM.

      The study aims to test an alternative to current standard of care for patients with foot
      ulcers. A RCT is the preferred method to establish efficacy for this alternative nurse
      managed intervention; and if found to be effective, the current study will also allow an
      evaluation of the cost effectiveness of this intervention and the potential economic
      reduction in cost to the health care system.

      The potential implications are major in terms of quality of life, reduction in morbidity in
      disability days, and cost savings. It is anticipated that this intervention is at least as
      effective as hospital stay, and being surrounded by their own loved ones without the threats
      that a hospital setting presents. The findings will be important to consider whether clinical
      practice can be changed to benefit patients. If the study results show that the subjects in
      the IG have better skills in monitoring and treating their diabetic foot ulcerations and
      eventually avoid developing further complications the intervention can be applied to future
      patients.
