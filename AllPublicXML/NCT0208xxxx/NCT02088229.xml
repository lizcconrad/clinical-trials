    <textblock>
      This longitudinal interventional case series will utilize the patients at the University of
      Michigan W.K. Kellogg Eye Center scheduled to begin treatment for diabetic macular edema.
      Baseline measures will be taken which include structural assessments such as circulatory
      capacity utilizing fluorescein angiography, in addition to retinal layer integrity and
      thickness using high resolution optical coherence tomography. Also, functional assessments
      such as visual acuity, contrast sensitivity, photostress recovery, dark adaptation,
      perimetry, and cellular fluorescence will be tested. Adverse events will be recorded and
      compared with historical controls to ensure that currently accepted interventions are safe.
      Finally, potential confounding variables for DME including those related to the eye, systemic
      factors, and patient demographics will be recorded to assess the influence of these variables
      on treatment response.

      The primary objective is to develop hypotheses that might better explain the retinal
      structural (anatomical) and/or functional (physiological) mechanisms of visual impairment in
      eyes receiving treatment for diabetic macular edema (DME).
