  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cerebral small vessel disease (CSVD) is a major cause of cognitive impairment and disability
      in the general population, secondary to the accumulation of asymptomatic elementary lesions.
      CSVD is directly correlated with age and cardiovascular risk factors and therefore would be
      challenging in term of public health care in the future. While HIV patients share the same
      cardiovascular risk factors and they are often diagnosed with cognitive impairment and
      frailty, CSVD has not been yet described in this population.

      The global aim is to compare the prevalence of CSVD in a well controlled HIV+ population
      compared to HIV- controls matched with age and sex.

      500 HIV+ patients and 250 age- and sex- matched controls will undergo a screening of the CSVD
      with a 10 minutes MRI (FLAIR and T2*).

      Prevalence of the CSVD will be compared between HIV+ patients and controls. General and
      HIV-specific parameters from their electronic medical records will be compared between
      HIV+/CSVD+ and HIV+/CSVD- patients.

      We are expecting to prove that CSVD is more frequent in HIV+ population.
