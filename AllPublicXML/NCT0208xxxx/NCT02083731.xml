  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) in the
      treatment of refractory cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection after allogeneic hematopoietic stem
      cell transplantation (allo-HSCT).
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Viral infections are common complications after allo-HSCT. With wide use of HLA-mismatch,
      unrelated and cord blood donors as alternative sources of hematopoietic stem cells, and
      anti-thymocyte globulin (ATG) as the standard prophylaxis of graft versus host disease (GVHD)
      in HLA-mismatch and unrelated donor transplantation, allo-HSCT recipients are at increasing
      risk for viral infections.

      Till now, CMV remains one of the most important viruses and causes of death in the recipients
      of allo-HSCT. Approximately 75% of CMV-seropositive recipients develop CMV reactivation, and
      20-30% of these patients develop CMV disease without intervention. Ganciclovir is the
      first-line treatment of CMV diseases. However, bone marrow suppression, which is the main and
      common side effect, limits the utility of ganciclovir in allo-HSCT recipients. Besides,
      ganciclovir and other antiviral agents resistance has been reported up to 28%. Since it has
      been known that specific immune response to CMV is important to control reactivation,
      CMV-specific CTL has been used in prophylaxis and treatment of CMV viremia in several
      studies. However, the production of CTL requires time. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) are a
      form of multipotent adult stem cells that can be isolated from bone marrow (BM), adipose
      tissue, and cord blood. In vivo experiment showed that MSCs have antimicrobial activity.

      In this trial, we will use MSCs in the recipients with refractory CMV infections.

    <description>Adverse Events include GVHD, primary underlying disease relapse and any other side effects. Side effects of treatment includes acute toxicity and late side effects. Acute toxicity principally involves the heart,live and kidney. Late toxic side effects involves principally the development of secondary tumors and relapse of the primary disease.</description>

    <description>MSCs will be used to treat refractory CMV infection or CMV-associated diseases. MSCs will be intravenously infused at a dose of 1×10^6 cells/kg. If anticipates do not attain the complete remission standards within 14d, a second course of the same treatment will be given.</description>
