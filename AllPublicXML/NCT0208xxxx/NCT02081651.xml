  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cow's milk allergy is the most common food allergy in children. The scenery clinical and
      epidemiological of cow's milk allergy is significantly changed in the last decade. The
      severity of the clinical manifestations is still rising, and now cow's milk allergy has
      become the leading cause of hospitalization for food -induced anaphylaxis in our country. In
      addition, the overall prevalence of cow's milk allergy is increasing for a gradual reduction
      in the ability to acquire immunological tolerance to cow's milk protein in the first years of
      life. These mutations dictate the need to identify strategies to stimulate the acquisition of
      immunological tolerance in children affected by cow's milk allergy . The mechanisms of
      acquired immunological tolerance are not yet fully defined . The current view suggests the
      existence of a dynamic mechanism , consisting of various cellular compartments , which is set
      in a crucial environmental factors arising mainly from the diet and its effects on the
      intestinal microbiota. These acquisitions have contributed to the definition of a new concept
      in the field of human nutrition: immunonutrition. The immunonutrition is the ability, through
      the intake of specific nutrients on the immune system to interfere directly or indirectly
      through modulation of the composition and function of the intestinal microbiota. The
      proponent group has recently shown that it is possible to stimulate a more rapid acquisition
      of immunological tolerance in children affected by CMA through the administration of
      extensively hydrolysed casein containing the probiotic Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG (LGG)
      (Berni Canani et al. J Pediatr 2013) . Several lines of evidence suggest that this effect is
      induced by a combination of direct immunomodulatory action exerted by some small peptides
      derived from the beta - casein and the action of lactobacillus GG. It 's well known that the
      Lactobacillus GG is able to adjust the composition and functions of the microbiota in the
      child with CMA and directly adjust some immunological mechanisms involved in the pathogenesis
      of this condition. At the same time other groups have demonstrated the possibility that a
      high percentage of patients with IgE-mediated CMA is able to tolerate foods containing
      hydrolyzed cow's milk proteins with different processes. It has also been speculated that
      these strategies can facilitate the acquisition of immune tolerance in patients with cow's
      milk allergy. One of these foods is Parmigiano -Reggiano cheese, which is characterized by an
      ' extensive hydrolysis of the proteins in cow's milk , which degrade the caseins present and
      generate large amounts of peptides and free amino acids and by the presence of appreciable
      quantities of Lactobacillus GG in the samples to maturing higher . In a recent study it was
      shown that 58% of patients suffering from IgE-mediated CMA is able to tolerate a daily intake
      of normal amounts of this food , especially in the absence of a sensibilization to IgE
      specific to the beta lactoglobulin. These new findings allow us to hypothesize the use of
      Parmigiano REggiano cheese as a possible strategy immunonutrition can stimulate the
      acquisition of immune tolerance in patients with CMA .
