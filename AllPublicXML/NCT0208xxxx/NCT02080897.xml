  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the role of palliative surgery in improving Quality
      of Life (QoL) and symptom control for patients who present with a Soft Tissue Sarcoma (STS)
      and metastatic lung disease. Responses to clinical Edmonton Symptom Assessment System -
      Sarcoma Modified ( ESAS-SM) questionnaire for patients who have undergone surgery for
      resection of the primary tumour will be compared to those that are unable to have surgery.
      Data collected from this questionnaire can highlight the benefits in patients' QoL who
      receive palliative surgical resection, and whether these benefits surmount those who are not
      treated with palliative surgery.
