      Evaluate Survivorship for the Biomet® Comprehensive® Reverse Shoulder Mini Baseplate.

    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this prospective clinical data collection is to evaluate
      survivorship for the Biomet® Comprehensive® Reverse Shoulder Mini Baseplate. Secondary
      objectives include validation of implant sizing and hardware options as well as collection of
      mid-term clinical outcomes including adverse events, scapular notching, and Constant Score.

      All shoulders on which data will be collected are legally marketed and none of the devices
      are investigational or experimental. FDA has cleared this device via Premarket Notification
      510(k) K080642. This data collection effort will document the clinical outcomes of the
      Comprehensive® Reverse shoulders. The data gathered will be collated and used to provide
      feedback to designing engineers, support marketing efforts, and answer potential questions
      from reimbursement agencies.
