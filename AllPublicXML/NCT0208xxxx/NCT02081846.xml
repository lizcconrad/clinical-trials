    <textblock>
      To identify barriers to successful transitions that are most meaningful to patients and
      families, and use these identified barriers to iteratively adapt an existing nurse home visit
      program to address these barriers. This study will also test the efficacy of a nurse home
      visit intervention in improving post-discharge outcomes through a randomized controlled
      trial.

    <description>Hypothesis: Patients who receive the nurse home visit intervention will have a significantly lower occurrence of unplanned rehospitalization, ED (emergency department)/urgent care revisit, and/or unscheduled follow-up within 30-days post-discharge when compared to the patients enrolled in the control group after 30 days post-discharge. The dependent variable will be a dichotomized indicator of any occurrence of unplanned rehospitalization, ED revisit, and/or unscheduled follow-up within 30-days post-discharge. Differences in this outcome between intervention and control groups will be evaluated using logistic regression with the stratification variables (neighborhood poverty and complex versus noncomplex teams)</description>

    <description>Post-Discharge Difficulty Coping Scale (Weiss, et. al): measured at post-discharge phone call
Number of days until normalcy: measured at post discharge phone call. Parents asked to recall the number of days it took to &quot;return to a 'normal' routine&quot; including the return to work and school (with option of not yet be back to normal).
Number of red flags: measured at post-discharge phone call. Parents asked to recall &quot;any red flags or warning signs&quot; to indicate the &quot;child's condition was getting worse.&quot;</description>

    <description>We will complete a single center, parallel, randomized, standard-of-care-controlled prospective study to determine the efficacy of a nurse home visit program, an intervention adapted from those studied in other populations (i.e., adults, high-risk infants) and re-engineered through Aim 2, in improving pediatric patient transitions from hospital to home</description>

    <description>Control patients will be randomized to receive standard-of-care at discharge. This care at our institution includes pediatric hospitalist to PCP (primary care physician) verbal and written communication prior to discharge, written documentation for the family regarding prescribed medication regimen, recommended follow-up with outpatient PCP and relevant consultant(s), and delivery of prescribed medications from the hospital pharmacy to the patient's bedside.</description>
