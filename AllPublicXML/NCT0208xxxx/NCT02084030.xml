      The aim of this study is to perform a whole-genome linkage analysis for identification of the
      susceptibility loci for POCD

      BACKGROUND: Postoperative cognitive dysfunction is probably the most frequent type of
      postoperative cognitive impairment. As it mainly affect the elderly population, POCD is
      receiving increasing attention. However, the pathophysiology of POCD remains incompletely
      understood. No study had elucidate why somebody are apt to suffer from POCD, but others not.
      In current study, we try to use GWAS technology to find out whether there is a correlation
      between POCD and gene specificity.

      DESIGNING: 120 patients will be screened who are schedule to receive selective on-pump
      cardiac surgery， 5 ml blood of the patient will be collected before anesthesia induction.
      Investigetors will measure the cognitive function of the patients one day before surgery and
      7 d after surgery and identify whether the patient suffer from POCD used in MMSE test.
      Randomly select 36 patients who suffer from POCD and 36 patients without POCD(control), GWAS
      technology will be used to screen the susceptibility gene between these two groups.

      EXPECTED RESULTS ：Find out some susceptibility genes correlate to POCD.

      CONCLUSIONS: The patients who are apt to suffer from POCD have some special susceptibility
      genes differ from normal people.
