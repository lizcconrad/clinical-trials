  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Renal failure patients were treated with linezolid (LZD) for proven or suspected infections
      by multiresistant Gram-positive cocci. The aim of this study is to determine if dose
      adjustment of LZD is needed as a function of renal impairment or not, especially that a
      significant component of LZD is eliminated unchanged in urine.

    <time_frame>Participants will be followed for the duration of study, an expected average of 6 weeks.</time_frame>
    <description>Tolerability was assessed based on changes in vital signs (temperature, blood pressure, pulse, and heart rate), measured before dosing in each period and approximately every 4 hours thereafter, and laboratory tests (hematology, biochemistry, liver function, and urinalysis), and performed at baseline and at the end of the study. In addition, a physician questioned volunteers about any adverse events occurring during the study, addressed them as necessary, and recorded them on the appropriate form. This physician was not blinded to treatment, but had no involvement in the study.</description>

             consent.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Had a history of clinically significant organ dysfunction other than renal disease or those
        diseases associated with renal disease (as in case of acute RF or ESRD patients) Had
        physical examination or laboratory test results outside the inclusion such as; sitting
        systolic BP (SBP) of &gt;140 or &lt;100 mmHg, diastolic BP (DBP) &gt; 90 or &lt;60mm Hg (as in case of
        healthy volunteers and acute RF patients), or a pulse rate of &gt; 95 or &lt; 50 beats/min at
        screening; history of orthostatic hypotension; history of serious intolerance, allergy or
        sensitivity to linezolid ; history of blood dyscrasias; history of alcohol, smoking, or
        drug abuse; donation of blood during the 8 weeks prior to the study or plans to donate
        blood during or within 8 weeks of completing the study; unable to tolerate vein puncture
        and multiple blood samplings; any surgical/medical condition that might alter the
        absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion of linezolid ; or can't follow
        instructions, according to the investigator's opinion.
