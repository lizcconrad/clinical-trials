    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the safety and the efficacy of a laser in the
      treatment of vulvovaginal atrophy (VVA), that is to assess the change in the severity of the
      vaginal dryness symptom, by means of a visual analogic scale (10 cm VAS).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The laser handpiece (probe) will be deposited in the vaginal canal and the laser energy will
      be delivered through the handpiece. Subjects will receive a total of three (3) treatments
      every six (6) weeks (+/-1 week). Subjects will return one week (+/- 3 days) post the first
      treatment, as well as three (3) months (+/- 2 weeks) and twelve (12) months (+/- 2 weeks)
      post the third treatment.
