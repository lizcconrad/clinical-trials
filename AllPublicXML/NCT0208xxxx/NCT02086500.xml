      The purpose of this study is to determine if 1 gram of prehospital tranexamic acid given
      during air medical transport to a level 1 trauma center in patients at risk of hemorrhage is
      associated with lower 30 day mortality.

      Background: Traumatically injured patients continue to be plagued with uncontrolled
      hemorrhage resulting in significant morbidity and early mortality. A primary driving force
      for this unbridled hemorrhage is known to be the early coagulopathy which complicates severe
      injury. Trauma induced coagulopathy has been postulated to be an equilibrium imbalance
      between pro and anticoagulant factors, platelets, endothelium and fibrinolysis soon after
      injury. Recent evidence demonstrates that the early use of the antifibrinolytic agent
      tranexamic acid (TXA) after trauma center arrival results in improved survival in patients at
      risk for bleeding. Bringing this proven treatment to the prehospital arena and intervening
      earlier in those patients who would otherwise not be candidates for treatment has the real
      potential to further reduce or prevent the vicious hemorrhagic cascade, improve clinical
      outcomes and provide insight into the underlying mechanisms responsible for and which
      maximize its benefit.

      Objective/Hypothesis: The primary hypothesis will be that prehospital infusion of tranexamic
      acid in patients at risk for bleeding will reduce the incidence of 30 day mortality. The
      secondary hypotheses include that prehospital tranexamic acid will reduce the incidence of
      hyperfibrinolysis, acute lung injury, multiple organ failure, nosocomial infection,
      mortality, early seizures, pulmonary embolism and early resuscitation needs, reduce or
      prevent the early coagulopathy as demonstrated by improving presenting INR and rapid
      thromboelastography parameters, reduce the early inflammatory response, plasmin levels,
      leukocyte, platelet and complement activation, and determine the optimal dosing of tranexamic
      acid post-injury.
