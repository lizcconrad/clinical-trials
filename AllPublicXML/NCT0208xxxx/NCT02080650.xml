  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This pilot study will aim to determine whether circulating tumor cells (CTCs) can be captured
      using the novel cMET based ferrofluid. The primary objective of this pilot study will be to
      describe the numbers of c-MET expressing cells that can be detected by the c-MET CTC capture
      technique. These data will be separated by disease site. The investigator will also describe
      the detection rates of both the c-MET CTC capture and the EpCAM CTC capture techniques in
      each patient, also separated by disease site.
