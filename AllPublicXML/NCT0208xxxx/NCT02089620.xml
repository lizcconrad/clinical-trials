  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Premenstrual syndrome (PMS) is deÔ¨Åned as the recurrence of psychological and physical
      symptoms in the luteal phase, which remit in the follicular phase of the menstrual cycle
      [1].PMS will be prospectively diagnosed using the Royal college of Obstetricians and
      Gynecologists (RCOG) recommended daily record of severity of problems (DRSP) . Women will be
      asked to fill the diary for 2 months, only women with 30% increase in the DRSP score in the
      week before menses in both months will be diagnosed as having PMS.

      Women with PMS will be invited to participate in the study.The invitation will include a
      clear full explanation of the study and patients will provide written consents. All patients
      consenting to participate will be included in the trial.

      Yasmin, Calver and Placebo will be enclosed in sequentially numbered similar bottles which
      will be numbered using a computer generated random table. Women will be asked to choose a
      sealed envelope, each envelope will contain the number allocated to the jar and special
      instructions on how to use the medication. Yasmin will be taken once daily for 21 days
      starting from the 2nd day of menstruation, Calver and placebo will be taken continuously.
      Neither the patients nor the physician will be aware of the drug used. Patients will be
      categorized in 3 groups: group1 who will receive Yasmin cyclically for 3 months (Yasmin,
      schering, cairo, Egypt) and daily oral placebo, group 2 who will receive Calver continuously
      for 3 months (Calver, Marcryl/Vertex, Cairo Egypt) and oral placebo for 21 days, group 3 who
      will receive a daily placebo and a placebo similar to COC for 21 days and will act as a
      control group.
