    <textblock>
      Aqueous (EUA) cream, cetomacrogol (CMG) and emulsifying ointment (HEB) are in South Africa's
      essential drug list (EDL) but are not available to most rural patients. To assess whether
      accessible moisturizers can be used as alternatives in atopic eczema (AD), a randomized
      controlled trial of patients with mild-to-moderate AD, aged 1-12 years was conducted. Two
      separate sub-studies were conducted using a randomized controlled single (assessor) blind
      trial design. Study 1 compared UEA vs. liquid paraffin (unscented baby oil) for baths, all
      patients used HEB as moisturiser. In Study 2, 4 moisturisers were compared -HEB, CMG,
      petroleum jelly and petroleum jelly/Glycerine (2:1). Assessments (SCORAD, POEM, NESS and
      IQDOL) carried out at baseline, week 4, 8 and 12. Routine topical steroids and antihistamines
      were continued as prescribed.
