      The purpose of this study is to compare the sentinel lymph node (SLN) detection rate of early
      breast cancer patients between using Indocyanine green (ICG) and Methylene blue with a novel
      surgical navigation system.

    <textblock>
      Assessment of the sentinel lymph node (SLN) in patients with early stage breast cancer is
      vital in selecting the appropriate surgical approach. However, the existing methods,
      including methylene blue and nuclides, possess low efficiency and effectiveness in mapping
      SLNs, and to a certain extent exert side effects during application. Indocyanine green (ICG),
      as a fluorescent dye, has been proved reliable usage in SLN detection by several other
      groups. In this paper, we introduce a novel surgical navigation system to detect SLN with
      ICG. This system contains two charge-coupled devices (CCD) to simultaneously capture
      real-time color and fluorescent video images through two different bands. During surgery,
      surgeons only need to follow the fluorescence display. In addition, the system saves data
      automatically during surgery enabling surgeons to find the registration point easily
      according to image recognition algorithms. We aim to show that the usage of our surgical
      navigation system with ICG to detect SLNs in breast cancer patients is technically feasible.
