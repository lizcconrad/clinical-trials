  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this randomized clinical study is to assess pain and dysfunction in 225 volunteer
      subjects who have chronic low back pain.

      The hypothesis of this study is that custom-made shoe will improve patients' low back pain
      and dysfunction. Additionally, custom-made shoe orthotics plus chiropractic treatment will
      further improve patients' low back pain and dysfunction while maintaining that improvement
      during the one year study follow-up period.

      Specific Aims:

        1. To determine the changes in perceived pain levels (Numeric Pain Rating Scale) and
           dysfunction (Oswestry Disability Index) in patients with chronic low back pain after six
           weeks of custom-made shoe orthotic use with or without chiropractic care as compared to
           no care.

        2. To determine the changes in perceived pain levels and dysfunction in patients with
           chronic low back pain after twelve weeks of custom-made shoe orthotic use.

        3. To determine the changes in perceived pain levels and dysfunction at 3, 6, and 12 months
           following the 12 week treatment period.

    <time_frame>This primary outcome measure will be collected at the Randomization Visit and Week 6.</time_frame>
    <description>The Numeric Pain Rating Scale (NPRS) is a numeric scale from 0-10, wherein patients can select (by circling or otherwise selecting) the one number along that line that best describes the pain being inquired about during the specified time period. The NPRS is one of the most frequently used methods for the measurement of clinical pain.</description>

    <measure>Modified Oswestry Disability Index (MODI)</measure>
    <time_frame>This primary outcome measure will be collected at the Randomization Visit and Week 6.</time_frame>
    <description>The Modified Oswestry Disability Index, a condition specific questionnaire covering 10 areas of daily living and expressing the degree of disability as a percentage. The measured areas include: pain intensity, personal care, lifting, walking, sitting, standing, sleeping, social life, traveling, and employment. Each category is scored on a continuum from 0 to 5 points, for a possible total score of 50 out of 50, popularly described as &quot;100% disability.&quot;</description>
