    <textblock>
      Ultra-high density mapping with multielectrode catheter may improve slow conduction channels
      identification in ventricular tachycardia substrate ablation procedures compared to
      conventional point by point mapping.

      This study compares the ability of both mapping catheters to detect slow conduction channels
      in areas of myocardial scar and their utility to assess substrate modification after
      ablation.

      This is a prospective, randomized controlled study. Twenty patients with sustained
      ventricular tachycardia and structurally abnormal ventricle(s) will be prospectively
      enrolled. In all patients a detailed pre and post-ablation electroanatomical mapping will be
      performed, and these maps will be merged with CT and/or MRI images. Patients will be randomly
      assigned to two groups. In Group A patients both pre and post-ablation mapping will be
      performed firstly by conventional point by point mapping using a Navistar Thermocool
      catheter, and secondly by multielectrode contact mapping using a Pentaray catheter. In this
      group, target ablation sites will be guided by point by point map. In Group B patients, both
      pre and post-ablation mapping will be performed firstly by multielectrode contact mapping
      using a Pentaray catheter, and secondly by conventional point by point mapping using a
      Navistar Thermocool catheter. In this group target ablation sites will be guided by
      multielectrode contact mapping.

      Slow conduction channels will be identified by color-coded voltage map adjustment of the
      lower and upper thresholds and also the presence of fractioned electrograms with the delayed
      component showing sequential orthodromic activation. The entrances of these channels will be
      the target of the ablation sites (scar dechanneling technique).
