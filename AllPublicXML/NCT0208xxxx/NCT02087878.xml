      To collect and store blood and biopsy samples obtained from CD or UC patients exposed to
      adalimumab and diagnosed with Hepatosplenic T-cell Lymphoma (HSTCL), for the purpose of
      identifying potential biomarkers and genetic mutations in patients who have developed HSTCL.

        The study population will include patients of any age with CD or UC in the US with HSTCL
        who are identified through the Sponsor's adverse event reporting systems and who were
        exposed to HUMIRA prior to the diagnosis of HSTCL.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Male or female who has received a single dose of HUMIRA prior to a confirmed diagnosis
             of HSTCL.

          -  Confirmed diagnosis of CD or UC as documented by a Gastroenterologist or physician who
             diagnosed the CD or UC.

          -  Confirmed diagnosis of HSTCL as determined by a biopsy performed on a specimen taken
             from the patient.

          -  Patients 18 years old and older must voluntarily sign and date an IRB/EC approved
             Informed Consent Form. For patients younger than 18 years old, a parent or legal
             guardian is required to voluntarily sign and date an IRB/EC approved Informed Consent
             Form. Pediatric patients will be included in all discussions if possible, in order to
             obtain their assent.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Male or female who has not received at least a single dose of adalimumab prior to a
             confirmed diagnosis of HSTCL.

          -  Unconfirmed diagnosis of HSTCL, CD or UC, respectively.

          -  The patient or the patient's HCP is unwilling to participate in this study.

          -  The parents or legal guardians (in the case of patients younger than 18 years of age),
             who are unable and/or unwilling to consent to the patient's participation in this
             study.
