    <textblock>
      Obesity rates in reproductive aged women in the United States are rising. It is now
      universally accepted that obesity is associated with many adverse pregnancy outcomes and
      post-operative complications following cesarean section. Recent studies have also shown an
      increased rate of cesarean section in obese women, adding to the already elevated rate of
      complications and adverse outcomes. Given the increased a priori risk for obese patients, it
      is vital that the investigators reexamine management practices routinely used for normal
      weight women in this specific high-risk population. Passive descent has been shown to
      increase the spontaneous vaginal delivery rate in non-obese women; however, high quality
      studies have never been performed in obese women. the investigators hypothesize that passive
      descent could improve the spontaneous vaginal delivery rate in nulliparous, obese women with
      regional anesthesia. This study will randomize women to passive descent for ninety minutes or
      active pushing upon entry into the second stage. Further, given that passive descent is
      widely accepted in the midwifery literature and clinical practice, the investigators
      anticipate that a high-quality study in the physician literature could increase the dialogue
      between practitioners and lead to development of best practices in this high-risk population.
