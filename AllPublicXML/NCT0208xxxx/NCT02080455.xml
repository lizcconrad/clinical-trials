  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to assess the effect of atorvastatin, a weak
      cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4 inhibitor, on the pharmacokinetics (PK) of lomitapide and its 2
      primary metabolites, M1 and M3.

      This study will be a single center, randomized, open-label, 2-arm study to evaluate the
      effects of atorvastatin, a weak CYP3A4 inhibitor, on the PK of lomitapide in healthy male and
      female subjects when atorvastatin is administered simultaneously with lomitapide and when it
      is administered 12 hours after lomitapide.
