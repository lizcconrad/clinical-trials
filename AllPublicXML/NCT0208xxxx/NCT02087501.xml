      Clinical Investigation Design A prospective, open-label, non-randomized, interventional
      clinical study, sponsored by Endospan Ltd. Patients will be followed-up for five years.

      Investigational Device The Horizon™ Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm Stent Graft System and its
      designated Delivery System.

      Purpose The purpose of the study is to evaluate the safety and performance of the Horizon™
      AAA Stent Graft System for the treatment of infrarenal abdominal aortic and/or aortoiliac
      aneurysms. The results of this study will be used as supportive data for CE Marking
      submission in the European Union (EU).

      Objectives The primary objectives of the study are to evaluate the safety and performance of
      the Horizon™ AAA Stent graft System.

      Primary End Points Safety endpoints include proportion of patients free from device related
      Major Adverse Events (MAEs) within 1 month of the endovascular procedure. Performance
      endpoints include successful delivery and deployment of the device; and absence of the
      following at 1 month follow-up: aneurysm growth ≥5mm, type I or III endoleaks, stent graft
      occlusion, conversion to open surgery, rupture and stent graft migration.

      Subject population Thirty (30) patients having infrarenal abdominal aortic and/or aortoiliac
      aneurysms, having Iliac/femoral access vessel morphology that is compatible with vascular
      access techniques and devices.

      Treatment All patients will be treated by implantation of the Horizon™ Abdominal Aortic
      Aneurysm Stent graft System.

      Possible benefits:

      It is believed that the Horizon™ AAA Stent Graft System implantation may offer a number of
      benefits over conventional and recently developed treatment options for patients suffering
      from AAA. These other treatment modalities include open surgery and the more recently evolved
      EVAR.

      The Horizon™ AAA Stent graft System has a low profile of 14Fr and is implanted through a
      percutaneous approach. The modular bottom-up construction requires a single-sided femoral
      access and there is no need for cannulation of the contralateral limb, a requirement present
      in the majority of commercially available devices. These features are anticipated to result
      in a simplified procedure with less surgical trauma, shorter procedure time, lower levels of
      radiation exposure and shorter hospitalization periods. Moreover, the device is flexible
      enough to reach also tortuous anatomies and its fixation elements reduce the concern of
      migration and type I endoleaks.

      As such, it is believed that the Horizon™ AAA Stent graft System may have potential clinical
      advantages and may exhibit benefits over commercially available stent-grafts.

      Hypothesis:

      In this clinical study safety and performance primary endpoints are compared between HORIZON™
      and those reported for the Lifeline Registry of Endovascular Aneurysm Repair (Control).
