    <textblock>
      This active vs active comparative trial will evaluate the safety and efficacy of incremental
      doses of atropine in combination with pseudoephedrine 120 mg/chlorpheniramine 8 mg in adult
      patients with a history of seasonal allergic rhinitis. Hypotheses are defined by total nasal
      symptom scores (TNSS) recorded by subjects in diaries where efficacy will be established by
      statistical significance where p &lt; 0.05.
