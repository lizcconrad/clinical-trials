  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is being done to analyze the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of treatment for
      advanced melanoma (MEL) and renal cell carcinoma (RCC) using combination regimens of
      pembrolizumab + pegylated interferon alfa-2b (PegIFN-2b) and pembrolizumab + ipilimumab
      (IPI). The primary hypothesis is that these combinations will be sufficiently well-tolerated
      to permit continued clinical investigation.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The trial is being done in three parts: Part 1A (MEL and RCC) will define the maximum
      tolerated dose (MTD)/maximum administered dose (MAD) for the drug combinations; a recommended
      Phase 2 dose (RP2D) for each combination will be identified. Part 1B (MEL-single arm
      expansion) will better characterize safety and efficacy and provide preliminary efficacy data
      for the penbrolizumab + IPI combination in participants with MEL. Part 2 (MEL and RCC) is a
      randomized portion of the trial and will evaluate preliminary efficacy of the drug
      combinations given in 6-week cycles for advanced MEL participants. Part 2 was removed from
      the study with Amendment 3 of the protocol. Part 1C (MEL) is added as the third part of the
      study with Amendment 3. Part 1C will evaluate safety and efficacy for different doses and
      dosing intervals for IPI in combination with pembrolizumab in participants with advanced MEL.
