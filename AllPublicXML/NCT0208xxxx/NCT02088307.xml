      The goal of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of cardiovascular nutraceutical
      supplement, CardioLife™ in patients with diagnosed Cardiovascular Disease (CVD). CardioLife
      is a novel nutraceutical intended for the prevention and management of cardiovascular risk
      factors, enhancement of cardiac performance and the treatment of cardiac dysfunction. This is
      an oral vitamin supplement comprising of the following main ingredients: garlic co-enzyme
      Q10, Arjuna, Hawthorn, Guggul, Red Yeast Rice, Policosanol, Nattokinase, Tumeric/curcumin,
      ashangandha, L-carnitine, grape seed extract, and vitamin B12.
