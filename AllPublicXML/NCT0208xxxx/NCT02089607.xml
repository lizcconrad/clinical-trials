  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Subjects for this study will have been diagnosed with a bulge or aneurysm in their abdominal
      aorta, which is the blood vessel in the abdomen (belly) that supplies blood to most of the
      lower body including major organs and the legs.

      The purpose of this study is to gather safety and effectiveness of the Zenith t-Branch and
      customized physician-specified stent-graft with a combination of fenestrations and/or
      branches to repair the aneurysm.

      The Zenith t-Branch and physician-specified fenestrated and branched endovascular graft is a
      tubular graft made of polyester fabric sewn to stainless steel stents that keep the graft
      open. As an aneurysm expands, the walls become weak and may rupture, causing a major loss of
      blood with a high risk of death and other serious complications. To avoid this risk the
      aneurysm will be repaired by putting a graft in place of the aneurysm. The graft will be
      inserted through arteries in the leg (called endovascular repair). This procedure uses
      catheters that go inside the blood vessel to place a stent graft above and below the
      aneurysm.

      The upper portion of the graft includes 1 to 5 small holes (fenestrations) or cuffs (side
      branches) that allow the graft to be located above the renal arteries without blocking blood
      flow to them. These small holes or branches are the investigational part of this research
      study. This is needed when there is not enough healthy aorta below the renal arteries. At
      least one artery may also be treated with an alignment stent (small tubular stainless steel
      structures) to help keep the arteries open and aligned with the fenestrations or branches.
      The Zenith t-Branch and physician-specified fenestrated and branched endovascular graft will
      be referred to as the Zenith Fenestrated-Branched System.

      This is a traditional device feasibility study intended to generate preliminary safety and
      efficacy information that may be used to plan an appropriate future study, or to inform
      further product development.

      The study is a prospective, non-randomized, non-blinded, single-arm, single-center study.

      The purpose of this study is to evaluate clinical outcomes and quality of life measures in a
      consecutive cohort of patients treated by endovascular aortic repair of thoracoabdominal
      aortic aneurysms (types I to IV) using a Zenith t-Branch or a customized physician-specified
      stent-graft with a combination of fenestrations and/or branches.

          3. Saccular aneurysms deemed at significant risk for rupture based upon physician
             interpretation.

        General Exclusion Criteria:

             to provide access for repair (e.g., staged iliac conduit, cervical debranching), to
             facilitate the procedure by allowing open revascularization of a target artery not
             amenable to revascularization with the investigational device, such as an internal
             iliac artery, subclavian artery or visceral artery with early bifurcation, tortuosity
             or occlusive disease preventing successful placement of alignment side stents.

          7. Participation in another investigational clinical or device trial, with the exception
             of participation in another investigational endovascular stent-graft protocol or
             percutaneous aortic valve protocol, not encompassed by the IDE protocol and performed
             remotely from the fenestrated procedure (&gt; 30 days). Examples include remote (&gt;30
             days) participation in a thoracic, abdominal or iliac branch device trial, or
             participation in a percutaneous aortic valve trial.

          8. Patients with ruptured aortic aneurysms requiring urgent or emergent repair, with the
             exception of patients with contained, stable ruptures with anatomy suitable for an

        Medical Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Known sensitivities or allergies to stainless steel, nitinol, polyester, solder (tin,
             silver), polypropylene, polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE), urethane or gold

          2. History of anaphylactic reaction to contrast material that cannot be adequately
             pre-medicated

          3. Leaking or ruptured aneurysm associated with hypotension

          4. Uncorrectable coagulopathy

          5. Mycotic aneurysm or patients with evidence of active systemic infection.

          6. History of connective tissue disorder (e.g., vascular Ehlers Danlos, Marfans
             syndrome), with the exception of those patients who had prior open surgical aortic
             replacement, where a surgical graft would serve as landing zone for the
             investigational stent-graft.

          7. Body habitus that would inhibit X-ray visualization of the aorta and its branches.

        Anatomical Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Inadequate femoral or iliac access compatible with the required delivery systems.

          2. Inability to perform a temporary or permanent open surgical or endovascular iliac
             conduit for patients with inadequate femoral/iliac access

          3. Absence of a non-aneurysmal aortic segment in the distal thoracic aorta above the
             diaphragmatic hiatus with:

               1. A diameter measured outer wall to outer wall of no greater than 38mm and no less
                  than 21 mm;

               2. Parallel aortic wall with &lt;20% diameter change and without significant
                  calcification and/or thrombus in the selected area of seal zone

          4. Visceral vessel anatomy not compatible with Zenith t-Branch or physician-specified
