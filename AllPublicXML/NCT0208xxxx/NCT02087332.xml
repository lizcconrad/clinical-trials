      Study hypothesis is that the time from randomization to the increase of natriuresis (%), time
      to standardization of natriuresis daily profile, blood pressure profile and the percentage
      reduction of central hemodynamic parameters will be relatively changed over the study period
      by more than 15%.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Men and women in the age from 40 to 70 years.

          2. Established diagnosis of II-III grade essential arterial hypertension

          3. NYHA II-III chronic heart failure

          4. Salt-sensitivity

          5. Stable therapy for 3 months prior enrollment to the study including any diuretic,
             ACE-inhibitor, beta-blocker.

          6. Signed informed consent for participation in the study.

          7. Women with child-bearing potential should agree to use effective birth control methods
             from screening up to completion of the study, excluding situations when their sexual
             partner(s) are surgically sterilized, or whеn women do not have any sexual contacts.
             Effective methods of birth control are contraception methods which are used constantly
             and regularly (including implantable contraceptives, injectable contraceptives, oral
             contraceptives, transdermal contraceptives, intrauterine devices, diaphragms with
             spermicides, male or female condoms or cervical cap).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Unlikely cooperation with a patient in the study period, disability

          2. Identification of salt - resistance at screening

          3. Patients that have had myocardial infarction, unstable angina pectoris, percutaneous
             coronary intervention heart failure, hypertensive encephalopathy, cerebrovascular
             accident (stroke) or transient ischaemic attack for the last 3 months.

             disease which is confirmed by GFR &lt; 40 ml/min/1.73 m2 calculated by Cockroft-Gault
             formula.

          6. Secondary arterial hypertension, severe or uncontrolled AH at the study enrollment
             (BP&gt; 180 mm Hg or DAP &gt; 110 mm Hg)

          7. Any severe, decompensated or unstable diseases or conditions which, on the
             investigator's opinion, endanger patient's life or aggravate disease prognosis
             (decompensated heart failure, anemia, severe diabetes mellitus, autoimmune,
             oncological diseases, hepatic, allergic reactions, connective tissue diseases, etc.)

          8. Acute infectious diseases.

          9. Hypersensitivity to components of Britomar or Diuver

         10. Pregnancy, lactation period.

         12. Scheduled coronary artery surgery (for example, stent implantation or coronary artery
             bypass grafting) or any other non-cardiological major surgery.

         13. 13. Administration of drugs which affect natriuresis level (any diuretics which are
             not related with the study product). Patients are excluded from the study if they have
             taken the drugs for the last 48 years up to Visit D -10, in the screening period
             and/or treatment period/follow-up period of the study.

         14. Use of narcotic drugs or alcohol abuse for the last 6 months and
             inability/unwillingness to refrain from narcotic drugs and excessive alcohol intake in
             the study period. The excessive alcohol intake is average alcohol &gt;2 units of alcohol.
             A unit of alcohol for various beverages is 12 ounce (350 ml) of beer, 5 ounce (150 ml)
             of wine or 1.5 ounce (45 ml) of 80% alcohol.

         15. Any other reason which would hinder patients' compliance with study requirements or
