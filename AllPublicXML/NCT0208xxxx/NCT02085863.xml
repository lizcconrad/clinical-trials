      This is a single center, randomized, double blind, placebo controlled, 2-way crossover
      drug-drug interaction (DDI) study to assess the effect of laquinimod on the PK and PD of

          2. Women of childbearing potential who are willing to continuously use the oral
             contraceptive (OC) product containing EE 30 μg and LNG 150 μg from at least the
             commencement of their last normal period prior to the first dose of study medication
             and for a total of 4 consecutive cycles.

          3. Willing to use a double barrier method of contraception (condom or diaphragm with
             spermicide) from screening until 30 days after the last laquinimod/placebo treatment.
             During administration of OC, the double barrier method should also be used.

          4. Body Mass Index ranging from 18-30 kg/m2, inclusive.

          5. Must be in a good health as determined by medical history, electrocardiogram (ECG),
