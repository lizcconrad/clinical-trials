      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the potential role of a long acting anesthetic
      (ropivacaine) in providing an extended period of pain relief for patients undergoing
      ultrasound guided core biopsy of the breast. One group of patients will receive lidocaine
      alone for local anesthesia. A second group of patients will similarly receive lidocaine prior
      to tissue sampling, followed by infiltration of the biopsy area with ropivacaine.

      Our hypothesis is that patients who receive a long acting anesthetic (ropivacaine) along with
      the popular short acting anesthetic (lidocaine), will be pain free after the breast biopsy
      procedure for a longer period of time than the patients who only receive lidocaine (the short
      acting anesthetic). This will lessen the emotional and physical trauma associated with the
      procedure and give patients a better experience thereby improving patient care.
