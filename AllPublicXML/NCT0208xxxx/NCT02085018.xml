  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a disease of unknown cause in which areas of normal
      lung tissue are replaced by scars. As a result it becomes harder for the lungs to extract
      oxygen from the air. IPF is commonly progressive, and around 50% of patients diagnosed with
      the disease die after approximately 3 years. The most common, troublesome symptoms of IPF are
      breathlessness on exertion, and cough. No drug treatments have been unequivocally shown to
      improve the death rate, or to significantly impact upon symptoms, in IPF.

      In recent years it has been recognised that cough can be caused by small amounts of liquid
      coming up from the stomach and &quot;going down the wrong way&quot; into the lungs, a process commonly
      known as &quot;reflux&quot;. As liquid in the stomach is usually acidic, patients' lungs may repeatedly
      be exposed to small amounts of acid. Reflux is unusually common in IPF and could potentially
      contribute to the debilitating cough found with the disease. However there are many potential
      causes for cough in IPF.

      Stomach acid can be efficiently &quot;switched off&quot; by drugs called &quot;proton pump inhibitors&quot;, one
      of which is called omeprazole. If reflux of stomach acid does contribute to cough in IPF,
      omeprazole might be expected to reduce cough. The purpose of this study is therefore to test
      whether omeprazole does reduce cough in patients with IPF. Sixty patients with IPF will be
      randomly allocated to have 3 months of omeprazole or a placebo. Neither the patient nor the
      doctor will be aware which treatment has been given, ie this is a randomised &quot;double-blind&quot;,
      placebo--controlled trial. Patients' cough frequency will be measured before and after
      treatment and the change in cough frequency compared in those receiving omeprazole and those
      receiving placebo. Change in cough frequency is the main thing we aim to compare, but a range
      of other measurements will be assessed such as the numbers of patients eligible to take part,
      agreeing to randomisation and providing outcome data, patients' lung function, symptom
      scores, the amount of reflux, and the amount of inflammation in the lungs.
