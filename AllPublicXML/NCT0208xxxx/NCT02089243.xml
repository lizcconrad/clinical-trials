      Background: There are a variety of treatment options for medically refractory medial temporal
      lobe epilepsy. Evidence from randomized trials indicates vagus nerve stimulation therapy can
      be used as a proven therapy for medically refractory medial temporal lobe epilepsy. Resective
      surgery is one of the most commonly used methods to treat medically refractory medial
      temporal lobe epilepsy. The aim of this study is to compare the effects of vagus nerve
      stimulation therapy and resective surgery in the treatment of the medically refractory medial
      temporal lobe epilepsy.

      Methods/Design: In this article, we report the design and protocol of a randomized controlled
      trial to treat medically refractory medial temporal lobe epilepsy with vagus nerve
      stimulation therapy or resective surgery. In total, 40 patients aged 12 to 60 years with
      medically refractory medial temporal lobe epilepsy will be assessed. There are two treatment
      groups. These patients are randomly assigned to be in one of the following two treatment
      groups, i.e. 1) undergo temporal lobe resection group, 2) receive vagus nerve stimulation
      therapy group. The primary outcome is to assess whether vagus nerve stimulation produces a
      reduction in mean monthly seizure frequency that is comparable to resection at 3 months, 6
      months, 9 months and 12 months of follow-up. The secondary outcomes include the
      neuropsychological, seizure severity, seizure type, quality of life, mood assessment,
      operative and postoperative complications and long-term side effects, compared to resection.

      Discussion: The result of this trial will assess the efficacy of using vagus nerve
      stimulation therapy or resective surgery to treat medically refractory medial temporal lobe
      epilepsy, and to determine a better therapy for treating medically refractory medial temporal
      lobe epilepsy.

      Published data suggest that patients with temporal lobe epilepsy who continue to experience
      seizures after trials of two or three antiepileptic drugs are unlikely to become seizure-free
      with further attempts at resection. Such patients may experience poor quality of life and
      functional outcomes from continuing seizures and the adverse effects associated with further
      attempts at resection. Vagus nerve stimulation is a minimally invasive treatment for epilepsy
      with well-established effectiveness as an adjunctive treatment for partial seizures
      refractory to resection, but there are no vagus nerve stimulation is a minimally invasive
      treatment for epilepsy with well-established effectiveness as an adjunctive treatment for
      partial seizures refractory to resection, but there are no controlled randomized clinical
      trials comparing the effectiveness of Vagus Nerve Stimulation therapy with resection in such
      patients.

    <description>Surgical follow-up typically occurred 2 weeks postoperatively and, subsequently, on a variable schedule as indicated. The adjustments in device parameters were performed, individually, and solely at the discretion of the primary epileptologist with a formal protocol guiding changes. Retrospective chart review was performed to collect follow-up and outcome data. At the time of last available clinical follow-up, the following data were collected: mean weekly seizure frequency (from seizure logs kept by caretakers or patient or caretaker report averaged of the last 3 months prior to Ô¨Ånal follow-up), complications of VNS therapy, duration of VNS therapy, timing and all subsequent surgical procedures.</description>
