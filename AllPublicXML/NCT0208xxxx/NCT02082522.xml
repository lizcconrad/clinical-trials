  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Photodynamic therapy (PDT) is a combination of a drug, porfimer sodium (Photofrin), which is
      activated by a light from a laser that emits no heat. This technique works to allow the
      medical doctor to specifically target and destroy abnormal or cancer cells while limiting
      damage to surrounding healthy tissue. The activation of the drug is done by lighting the
      abnormal areas using a fiber optic device (very fine fiber like a fishing line that permits
      light transmission) inserted into a flexible tube with a light called cholangioscope for the
      bile duct. The light will activate the porfimer sodium concentrated in the abnormal tissue,
      leading to its destruction.

      This research study will evaluate the efficacy and safety of PDT with porfimer sodium
      administered with Standard Medical Care (SMC) compared to SMC alone on the overall survival
      time of patients with non-operable advanced cholangiocarcinoma, a rare cancer of the bile
      ducts. It will involve 200 patients across North America and Europe. Other countries may
      participate if needed. Participation will last at least 18 months.

    <description>Photodynamic therapy (PDT) involves the i.v. injection of Photofrin followed by the illumination of the tumor using a fiber optic device. Two days after the injection, a laser light (180 J/cm(2)) will be applied to the tumor. A second light application will be given 96-120 hours after Photofrin injection if PDT could not initially be performed on all sides of the tumor. Post illumination, all patients will undergo stenting as part of standard medical care procedure. Up to 3 additional courses of PDT using a light dose of 120 J/cm(2) may be given at 3-month intervals. Standard Medical Care (SMC) is defined as stenting procedure plus chemotherapy regimen.</description>
