      Phase I, open-label study in 15 healthy adult subjects receive 6 mg of auranofin orally once
      every 24 hours for 7days. Blood samples will be taken for 17 weeks following the last dose of
      auranofin for determination of terminal phase pharmacokinetic parameters. Stool samples will
      also be obtained for the measurement of gold.

    <textblock>
      Auranofin is a gold-containing chemical salt, granted as an orphan drug status for use in the
      treatment of amebiasis. Amebiasis is a parasitic infection caused by the protozoon Entamoeba
      histolytica. It affects about ten percent of the world's population, being especially common
      in areas with poor health infrastructure. This is a Phase I open label, multiple dose study
      to evaluate the pharmacokinetics of Auranofin following oral dose administration for 7 days
      to healthy subjects. 15 healthy male and female volunteers age 18-45 years, inclusive
      enrolled in one site. The study duration is 48 weeks and up to 23 weeks of subject
      participation. The primary objective characterizes the pharmacokinetics of gold, given as
      auranofin, during and after 7 days of once daily oral dose administration. The secondary
      objective monitor the safety of Auranofin during and after 7 days of oral administration.

        complete physical examination including vital signs, and clinical laboratory tests.
        Non-childbearing potential is defined as amenorrheic for at least 2 years plus a serum
        follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) level &gt; 30 IU/L, or documented bilateral oophorectomy
        and/or hysterectomy, or tubal ligation. -Body mass index (BMI) of 18 to 30 [weight (kg)]/
        [height (m)^2] inclusive; and a total body weight &gt; 50 kg (110 lbs) and &lt; 122 kg (250 lbs)
        at the Screening Visit. -Male subjects willing to use appropriate contraception for the
        duration of the study. -Willing and able to comply with scheduled visits, dosing plan,
        laboratory tests, and other study procedures.

        -Evidence or history of clinically significant hematologic, renal, endocrine, pulmonary,
        gastrointestinal, cardiovascular, hepatic, psychiatric, musculoskeletal, immunologic,
        neurologic or dermatologic disease (including drug allergies that are clinically
