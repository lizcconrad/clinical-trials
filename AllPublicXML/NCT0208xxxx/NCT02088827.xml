  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The rates of sedentary activity are increasing. Studies have shown that time spent on doing
      sedentary activities is an independent risk factor for cardiovascular disease. Prior studies
      have shown that interrupting inactivity improved the body's handling of blood glucose and
      gene expression. The investigators plan to explore this further by examining the effects of
      interrupting 4 hours of inactivity with 2 minutes of moderate intensity exercise every 20
      minutes on the following metabolic parameters: blood pressure, cortisol, C-Reactive Protein,
      glucose and insulin levels.

      There is a current trend towards increasing time spent in sedentary behaviour. More jobs are
      being automated, and more time is spent in front of a computer, playing video games and
      watching television.Current studies suggest that sedentary behaviour is an independent risk
      factor for cardiovascular disease. Increasing time spent in sedentary behaviour has been
      linked to all-cause mortality, markers of cardiovascular disease and metabolic syndrome.
      However, the data is mainly from cross-sectional studies and based on self-recall, limiting
      the ability to draw definitive conclusions.

      Current exercise guidelines recommend at least 150 minutes of moderate to vigorous intensity
      exercise per week. It may be difficult for some elderly people to meet these guidelines.
      Older adults with diabetes are already at a higher risk fo conditions that are affected by
      sedentary behaviour and may stand to benefit the most from intervention.

      This study proposes to study the effects of breaking up sedentary activity with moderate
      intensity exercise on multiple metabolic parameters in older adults with diabetes.
