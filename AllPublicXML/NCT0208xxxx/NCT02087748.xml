      The purpose of this randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled, within-subject study is to
      evaluate the efficacy of topical diclofenac sodium gel (DSG) 1% in reducing pain associated
      with delayed onset muscle soreness (DOMS). Following exercise, subjects reporting significant
      DOMS received topical DSG 1% applied to 1 leg and placebo applied to the other every 6 hours
      for 48 hours.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Mean Reduction in SPID Scores of DOMS on Walking Over 24 Hours</measure>
    <time_frame>7 days</time_frame>
    <description>The primary outcome is the analgesic efficacy of Topical Voltaren® gel compared to placebo in the reduction of the pain associated with DOMS. The statistical comparison of interest will be the mean reduction in DOMS scores upon walking in the leg receiving Topical Voltaren® gel vs the leg receiving placebo over the first 24 hours post treatment. Pain intensity was assessed at predefined time points (Predose, 3, 9, 15, 21, and 24 hours after first drug administration) using an 11-point Numeric Rating Scale (NPRS) where a score of zero indicates &quot;no pain&quot; and &quot;10&quot; indicates &quot;pain as bad as you can imagine&quot;. Pain Intensity Differences at each predefined time point (calculated as post-baseline NPRS values - baseline NPRS values) were analyzed. The theoretical maximum range of Sum of pain intensity differences (SPID24) is from -50 (indicative of an increase in pain) to 50 (indicative of a decrease in pain).</description>

    <description>The secondary outcome is the mean reduction in DOMS scores at rest in the leg receiving Topical Voltaren® gel versus the leg receiving placebo over the first 24 hours post treatment initiation.
Pain intensity was assessed at predefined time points (at Predose, 3, 9, 15, 21, and 24 hours after first drug administration) using an 11-point Numeric Rating Scale (NPRS) where a score of zero indicates &quot;no pain&quot; and a score of 10 indicates &quot;pain as bad as you can imagine&quot;.

    <description>The secondary outcome is the mean reduction in DOMS scores while standing in the leg receiving Topical Voltaren® gel versus the leg receiving placebo over the first 24 hours post treatment initiation.
Pain intensity was assessed at predefined time points (at Predose, 3, 9, 15, 21, and 24 hours after first drug administration) using an 11-point Numeric Rating Scale (NPRS) where a score of zero indicates &quot;no pain&quot; and a score of ten indicates &quot;pain as bad as you can imagine&quot;. Pain Intensity Differences at each predefined time point (calculated as post-baseline NPRS values - baseline NPRS values) were analyzed. The theoretical maximum range of Sum of pain intensity differences (SPID24) is from -50 (indicative of an increase in pain) to 50 (indicative of a decrease in pain).</description>

        <title>Mean Reduction in SPID Scores of DOMS on Walking Over 24 Hours</title>
        <description>The primary outcome is the analgesic efficacy of Topical Voltaren® gel compared to placebo in the reduction of the pain associated with DOMS. The statistical comparison of interest will be the mean reduction in DOMS scores upon walking in the leg receiving Topical Voltaren® gel vs the leg receiving placebo over the first 24 hours post treatment. Pain intensity was assessed at predefined time points (Predose, 3, 9, 15, 21, and 24 hours after first drug administration) using an 11-point Numeric Rating Scale (NPRS) where a score of zero indicates &quot;no pain&quot; and &quot;10&quot; indicates &quot;pain as bad as you can imagine&quot;. Pain Intensity Differences at each predefined time point (calculated as post-baseline NPRS values - baseline NPRS values) were analyzed. The theoretical maximum range of Sum of pain intensity differences (SPID24) is from -50 (indicative of an increase in pain) to 50 (indicative of a decrease in pain).</description>
