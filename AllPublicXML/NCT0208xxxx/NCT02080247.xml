      A randomized controlled trial that compared the use of two topical zinc oxide based diaper
      rash products in a structured care regimen for the treatment of IAD in hospitalized adults
      and older children.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with IAD were recruited at Philippine General hospital to participate in a
      randomized controlled trial of two topical zinc oxide based diaper rash products used as part
      of a structured care regimen. All patients recruited to either arm of the trial received a
      structured care regimen for treatment of IAD for six days following study entry. At least
      twice daily and as required by incontinence episodes, treatment and care was provided by
      nurses and nursing aids trained in the study regimen to ensure its consistent implementation.
      Wet or soiled diapers were removed and the affected area was gently cleansed. Vigorous
      cleaning was avoided. A thin layer of the study topical ointment was applied prior to putting
      on a new diaper. Packs containing all the materials required were prepared for each patient
      daily, including the same brand of diapers for all patients, skin cleansing products and
      materials, and the assigned study ointment. Data were collected each day relating to their
      IAD using the Kennedy Skin Condition Assessment Scale.

    <measure>Complete healing of Incontinence Associated Dermatitis</measure>
    <time_frame>6 days up to complete healing of the Incontinence Associated Dermatitis</time_frame>
    <description>The Primary outcome is complete healing of IAD. Complete healing will be defined with the Kennedy IAD Severity Score. It is a cumulative severity score ranging from zero (no IAD) to 9 (an area &gt; 50 cmÂ² affected, redness or inflammation that is uniformly severe in appearance, extreme erosion of the epidermis and dermis with moderate volume and persistent exudate). The score is generated by the IAD Skin Condition Assessment Tool developed by Kennedy and Lutz, which requires assessors to attribute scores of 0-3 for three domains: size of area affected, skin redness or inflammation, and erosion. The sum of these scores is the IAD Severity Score. The size of IAD affected area will be calculated by multiplying the longest portion of the affected area measured in a head to toe orientation by the widest portion of the affected area measured from side to side (in centimeters). Disposable paper tape measures should be used to prevent cross-infection.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Pain scale measured by Wong Baker</measure>
    <time_frame>6 days up to complete healing of the Incontinence Associated Dermatitis</time_frame>
    <description>IAD associated pain will be assessed using Wong Baker pain scale. The Wong Baker scale is the most appropriate pain scale for children or adults with cognitive impairment and VAS for older minors and adults. Wong baker pain scale is a simple visual instrument originally designed for assessing pain in children, but has been used in adult populations.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Participant or next of kin/parent/guardian agree to study inclusion and sign the
             informed consent form or the assent form according to detailed guidance in the consent
             / assent section.

          -  Ages: children (at least 12 years old and up to 18 years old ) and adults (18 years
             old and above)

          -  Participant is incontinent* of urine and/or feces and has concomitant Incontinent
             Associated Dermatitis (IAD). (*Including functional incontinence, whereby the ability
             to control micturition or defecation is intact, but the patient is unable to toilet
             normally due to immobilization or other reason.).

          -  There is a reasonable expectation that the participant will be hospitalized for at
             least 7 days and will be able to complete the study. (NB Study Participant Withdrawal
             Criteria b - Any participants discharged from hospital by their attending physician
             before completion of study participation will automatically be withdrawn from the
             study. Study participation will not under any circumstances lead to delay in a
             participant's discharge from hospital.).

          -  Participant has no known allergy or history of adverse reaction to any of the
             ingredients in either product or to any topical preparations or skin care products.

          -  Participant has a diagnosis of IAD with a severity score greater than or equal to 3 as
             determined by the investigator.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Participant has a pre-existing pressure ulcer of stage 3 or 4 or other full thickness
             wound within the study area

          -  Participant has an active dermatological condition, or a history of recurrent
             dermatological conditions, other than IAD, that may affect healing of IAD or imply
             difficult healing of IAD. Where uncertainty exists, the Investigators will arrange a
             consultation with a Consultant Dermatologist

          -  Participant has any severe acute or chronic medical condition such that trial
             participation may constitute a risk or may interfere with their medical care or their
             attending physician advises against participation.

          -  Participant has in the preceding week been treated with systemic or topical agents
             (other than topical treatments for IAD) that may affect the IAD healing process (for
             example steroids).

             e. Participant has a known allergy or previous adverse reactions to any of the
             ingredients in either product.

          -  Participant has a diagnosis of IAD with a severity score less than 3 as determined by
