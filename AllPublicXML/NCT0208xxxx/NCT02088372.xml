      E1™ Vitamin E doping of highly cross-linked polyethylene is a proposed method for insuring
      long-term oxidative stability of highly cross-linked ultra-high molecular weight polyethylene
      for use in total joint arthroplasty. In vitro research and development studies have shown
      that this material has improved wear performance, retention of mechanical properties, and a
      high resistance to oxidation due to the anti-oxidative properties of Vitamin E. Biomet Inc,
      has received FDA clearance to market tibial polyethylene components made of E1™ for use in
      the Vanguard total knee replacement system.

      Vanguard Total Knee System™ The Vanguard™ Knee System was designed to incorporate features
      from prior designs, including: ACG, Maxim, &amp; Ascent. The Vanguard Knee includes a streamlined
      design, rounded sagittal profile, and a deeper trochlear groove. The femoral component is
      available in Cruciate Retaining (CR), Posterior Stabilizing (PS), and Super Stabilized (SSK).
      Tibial Bearings are available in various levels of constraint required by the surgeon (CR,
      PS, AS, etc.).

      For this study, ONLY Vanguard with PS Bearing will be used.

      The purpose of the study is to evaluate clinical performance of Vanguard Knee with E1 Bearing
      in TKA in Korean patient population. The clinical performance will be evaluated based on
      patient outcomes, radiographic assessment and survivorship.
