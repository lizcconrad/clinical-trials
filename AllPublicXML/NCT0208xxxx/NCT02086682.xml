  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The introduction of unfractionated heparin (UFH), which prevents clotting of the
      extracorporal circuit, was one of the key advances that led to the rapid development and
      expansion of hemodialysis services. However, anticoagulation during hemodialysis of the
      patient at high risk for bleeding remains a frequently encountered problem in both inpatient
      and outpatient dialysis practice.

      Streamline bloodlines are designed to eliminate blood-air contact. This is thought to help
      reduce heparin use and decrease clotting rates. The goal of this study is to prospectively
      examine impact of the Streamline airless blood tubing set, in an inpatient setting, on
      dialysis circuit clotting rates, anticoagulation use, and dialysis efficiency.

      The introduction of unfractionated heparin (UFH), which prevents clotting of the
      extracorporeal circuit, was one of the key advances that led to the rapid development and
      expansion of hemodialysis use, and remains the mainstay in hemodialysis practice today.

      However, anticoagulation during hemodialysis of the patient at high risk for bleeding remains
      a frequently encountered problem in the nephrology practice. The need for anticoagulation to
      prevent clotting of the extracorporeal blood circuit and the need to prevent anticoagulation
      related bleeding complications in the patient has led to the development of numerous
      strategies; the safest from a bleeding standpoint being anticoagulant-free hemodialysis.

      Streamline® bloodlines (Medisystems® Corporation, Lawrence, MA) are designed to eliminate
      blood-air contact. A pressure pod measures arterial and venous pressures without any
      blood-air contact. The venous chamber is run without an air gap. It is also designed so that
      blood flows in a circular vortex manner. This airless system is thought to provide several
      benefits: improved dialysis efficiency and blood flow rates, reduced heparin use and clotting
      rates.

      The goal of this study is to prospectively examine the Streamline® airless tubing system in
      an inpatient setting and its association with clotting rates, and dialysis efficiency.

    <time_frame>The patients will be followed for the duration of hospital stay, an expected average of 2 weeks.</time_frame>
    <description>A clinically significant clotting event can happen at anytime during the dialysis session. It is defined as clotting event that results in frequent alarms, interruption of dialysis, requirement of a new dialysis setup, or inability to return blood to the patient.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Mean Clotting Score</measure>
    <time_frame>The patients will be followed for the duration of hospital stay, an expected average of 2 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>A clotting score will be assigned based on the clotting assessment scale that is provided by the manufacturer, Medisystems. The dialysis nurse will perform the assessment at the end of dialysis after the rinse back. The scale incorporates five variables that are scored independently. Adding the above scores will result in the final score. 0 = no clotting in the equipment, 14 = severe clotting in the equipment.</description>
