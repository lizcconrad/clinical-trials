  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There will be four study lenses tested; one marketed lens, and three prototype study lenses.
      Subjects will be randomized to one of the four study lenses which will be worn in a daily
      wear modality, with a two week replacement.

             staining, or any other abnormalities of the cornea which would contraindicate contact
             lens wear.

          4. Any ocular infection.

          5. Any corneal distortion resulting from previous hard or rigid permeable contact lens
             wear.

Central, interior, nasal, temporal and superior locations were evaluated. The average grade for each lens and time point was reported.</description>

Limbal Redness was assessed in 4 regions Inferior, Nasal, Temporal and Superior and Graded using an Efron Grading scale for limbal redness in 0.5 unit increments (Grade 0:None, Grade 1:Trace, Grade 2: Mild, Grade 3: Moderate and Grade 4: Severe). The average Grade across all four regions can range from 0 to 16 where lower values indicate better performance. The average Grade for each individual region can range from 0 to 4. The average grade across all regions was reported for each lens and time point.</description>
