      A pivotal, prospective, multi-center, randomized, controlled, double-blinded study combining
      active Nexstim NBS-guided 1Hz rTMS or sham-rTMS targeting the healthy hemisphere with
      standardized task oriented rehabilitation will be conducted in patients with post-stroke
      motor impairment. The therapy will be provided for 6 weeks and primary outcome assessed 6
      months later.
