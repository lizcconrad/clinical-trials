      After the screening procedures confirms eligibility:

      Study Drugs: The participant will receive both Imprime PGG and rituximab weekly, for four
      weeks.

      Clinical Exams: At the participant's weekly visit there will be have a physical exam and
      general health and specific questions about any problems they might be having and any
      medications the participant may be taking.

      Scans (or Imaging tests):The Investigator will measure the participant's tumor 10 weeks after
      Week 4 of treatment by CT scan. Additional scans will be performed at 6 months and 12 months
      following the end of treatment.
