      This research study is designed to investigate the effects of a simple cognitive task (a
      memory reactivation cue following by playing the computer game &quot;Tetris&quot;) on flashbacks and
      other post-traumatic stress symptoms after a road traffic accident. Patients presenting to a
      hospital emergency department soon after a road traffic accident will be randomly allocated
      to either the simple cognitive task intervention or usual care. Participants will be followed
      up at one week and one month. It is predicted that participants given the simple cognitive
      task intervention will develop fewer flashbacks and less severe clinical symptoms than those
      who are not. This will inform the potential future development of a simple technique to
      prevent distressing psychological symptoms after a traumatic event.
