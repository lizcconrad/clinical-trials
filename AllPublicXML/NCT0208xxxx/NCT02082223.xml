      A pilot to test feasibility of improving patient/caretaker quality of life and resilience.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Our overall goal is to investigate if pre-operative interventions can address patients' and
      patients' care givers quality of life/resilience deficits and thus improve outcomes. This
      initial pilot study will test the feasibility of offering patients and their care givers
      prehabilitation interventions prior to complex gastrointestinal surgery such as
      pancreatectomy, esophagectomy, proctectomy, or hepatectomy.

    <description>Patient &amp; caregiver input regarding 'single biggest concern right now' (modified BEACON buttons) will be elicited. Information gathered by the study team which includes a trained nursing coach and the patient/caregiver will together develop an individualized 'toolbox' of possible interventions to improve preoperative quality of life.
Candidate interventions include, but not limited to: Participation in SMART program, caregiver participation in Caregivers study protocol MC1295 (IRB 13-002943), nutritional recommendations (deficiencies, immuno-nutrition), low impact resistance training/tai chi, referral to financial or counseling services, establishment of information sources &amp; plans for concerns not frequently covered in clinical practice such as sleeplessness, spiritual assistance.</description>
