      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of sodium risedronate
      tablets (Benet 75 mg Tablets) in osteoporosis patients in daily medical practice, as well as
      to examine &quot;the status of treatment compliance&quot; - i.e., whether sodium risedronate tablets
      are taken properly in accordance with the prescribed once-monthly regimen

      This surveillance was designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of sodium risedronate
      tablets (Benet 75 mg Tablets) as well as to evaluate the status of treatment compliance in
      osteoporosis patients in daily medical practice.

      The usual dosage for adult is 75 mg of sodium risedronate administered orally with a
      sufficient volume (approximately 180 mL) of water once monthly after waking. For at least 30
      minutes after administration, patients should avoid lying in a supine position and should
      avoid taking food, drink (except for water) or other oral drugs. For more details, see the
      &quot;Precautions related to dosage and administration&quot; section of the package insert.
