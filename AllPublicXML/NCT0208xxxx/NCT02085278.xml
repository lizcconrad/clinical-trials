      This is a clinical trial/study for patients diagnosed with brain arteriovenous malformation
      (AVM). An AVM is an abnormal connection between the arteries and veins of the brain. Patients
      considered for this trial are 21 years and younger with AVM suitable for embolization
      treatment (a procedure used to block the abnormal connection between the arteries and veins
      of the brain) with Onyx Liquid Embolic System (Onyx LES) or TruFill n-Butyl Cyanoacrylate
      (n-BCA) Liquid Embolic System (both are liquid substances used in the embolization procedure
      to block the abnormal connection).

      -Why is this study being done?

      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety of the Apollo Embolization Delivery Micro
      Catheter device (device that looks like a long thin hallow tube) when used in Pediatric
      patients with vascular malformations.

      The Apollo Onyx Delivery Micro Catheter device is manufactured by Micro Therapeutics, Inc.
      d/b/a ev3 Neurovascular. Apollo Onyx™ Delivery Micro Catheter device is not approved for use
      in the U.S, although it is widely used and approved for use in Europe (CE0297).

      This clinical study is sponsored by Dr. Alejandro Berenstein of St.Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital,
      New York who is also the principal Investigator of the study. Total duration of study is up
      to 30 months with approximately an 18 months enrollment period. Patients follow up period is
      up to 12 months upon enrollment.

    <time_frame>Within 24 hours after embolization</time_frame>
    <description>The study's primary endpoint is the incidence of catheter entrapment. Catheter entrapment entails any part of the Apollo Micro catheter Delivery Device, excluding the catheter tip, being inadvertently left within the vasculature at the end of the procedure</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Incidence of unintentional catheter tip detachment.</measure>
    <time_frame>Within 24 hours after embolization</time_frame>
    <description>Defined by the separation of the detachment joint during the procedure either during navigation, prior to embolization completion, or upon catheter retrieval when distal tip is not entrapped in Onyx cast.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Incidence of migration of the detached catheter tip.</measure>
    <time_frame>Within 24 hours after embolization</time_frame>
    <description>Defined by an observed change in position of the detached tip during post embolization imaging.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Incidence of catheter/procedure-related adverse events.</measure>
    <time_frame>At one year post procedure</time_frame>
    <description>The adverse events include but not limited to vascular occlusion (a sudden blockage of a blood vessel usually with a blood clot), vascular thrombosis (acute and subacute) (blood clots in a vessel that break loose and enter another vessel), allergic reactions, thrombocytopenia (significant decrease in red blood cell clotting factors), Death, neurologic deterioration (nervous system decline) including stroke and death, pulmonary embolization or complications (blockage of blood vessels in the lung), perforation or dissection of the vessel (tear of the blood vessel).</description>
