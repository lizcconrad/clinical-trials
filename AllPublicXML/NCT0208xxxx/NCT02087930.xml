  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Food allergy (FA) derives from a dysregulation of oral tolerance mechanisms. Studies suggest
      a crucial role for enteric microflora in oral tolerance development. An altered composition
      of intestinal microflora results in an unbalanced local and systemic immune response to food
      allergens. There are qualitative and quantitative differences in gut microbiota composition
      in children with food allergy. These findings support the concept that specific beneficial
      bacteria from human intestinal microflora, designated probiotics, could restore intestinal
      microflora homeostasis and prevent or treat FA.
