      The purpose of this study is evaluate the effects of walking training with partial body
      weight support on static (floor) and dynamic (treadmill) surfaces in individuals with
      hemiparesis due to stroke. For this purpose, two training protocols will be employed in three
      experimental groups: G1 will do the walking training with partial body weight support on
      static surfaces and G2 will do the walking training with partial body weight support on
      dynamic surfaces
