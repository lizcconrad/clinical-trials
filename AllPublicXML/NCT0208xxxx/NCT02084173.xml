  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      With the aging of western societies in the coming years combined with increasing alcohol
      consumption among elderly, the number of elderly with alcohol problems is expected to rise
      considerably.

      Elderly patients are often lonely; suffer from feelings of loss, fear to be a burden on their
      children and on society, and feel powerless. On the surface their alcohol related problems
      seem less severe that those of the middle-aged patients while in reality co-morbidity and
      social issues complicate alcohol dependency.

      Currently, no specific treatment tailored for alcohol use disorder among elderly is
      available. Consequently they receive either no treatment, are given brief advising from the
      general practitioner or are referred to treatment at specialized treatment institutions with
      no specific treatment for elderly.

      The investigators propose a study aimed at developing and testing an outpatient behavior
      therapy program for alcohol use disorders for seniors (60 years and older), which - if
      effective - can be easily implemented in routine care. Three centers from Denmark, Germany
      and USA (New Mexico) will participate. All three centers have a long and extensive experience
      with alcohol treatment and alcohol research. Patients fulfilling the DSM 5 criteria for
      alcohol use disorder are eligible for the study.

      After informed consent participants will be randomly assigned to either Motivational
      Enhancement Therapy (MET), four sessions/one session per week or MET followed by Community
      Re-enforcement Approach (CRA), eight sessions/one session per week - thus 12 weeks of
      treatment in total. 50% will receive MET and 50% MET+CRA. Primary outcome is percentage of
      patients with abstinence or controlled use (alcohol intake of equivalent blood alcohol
      content equal to or less than 0.5‰.). A total of 1000 patients will be enrolled. Participants
      will be assessed with a battery of international validated instruments measuring drinking
      pattern as well as key elements of treatment.

      Participants are assessed before initiation of treatment, at the end of MET treatment (four
      weeks), at the end of MET+CRA treatment (12 weeks), at 6 months, and at 12 months.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Seniors (+60 years) with alcohol use disorders according to DSM 5

          -  Passing an &quot;inclusion quiz&quot; based on 10 questions pertaining to the implications of
             participating in the study, e.g. knowledge about that it is voluntary to participate,
             a person declining to participate will receive the standard treatment offered by the
             treatment clinic, an acceptance of participating can always be withdrawn. The quiz
             will be conducted after informed consent, and be in a multiple-choice format.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  We strive for ecological validity and will only exclude patients who are unable to
             participate in the therapy or are suffering from severe conditions judged to risking
             the validity of the study:

               1. 7 or less correct answers in the &quot;inclusion quiz&quot; - indicating cognitive problems
                  or not fully understanding the implications of participating in the study.

               2. Psychotic disorder with positive and/or negative symptoms

               3. Severe depression at time of inclusion

               5. Suicidal thoughts/behaviour at time of inclusion

               6. Use of illicit opioids and/or illicit stimulants (all other forms of medication
                  is allowed, including opioids on prescription - they will be recorded and may be
                  included as covariates in the analyses)

               7. Participating or have participated in other alcohol treatment programs within the
                  last 30 days of inclusion. Pure detoxifications are not an exclusion criteria
