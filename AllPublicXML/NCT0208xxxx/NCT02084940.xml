  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      PCOS is a common endocrinopathy affecting 5-10% of women in their reproductive age
      characterized by hyperandrogenism, chronic anovulation and polycystic ovaries. This syndrome
      is a serious problem in IVF since there is a high risk of developing ovarian hyperstimulation
      syndrome (OHSS) during ovarian stimulation with gonadotropins. The introduction of GnRH
      antagonist in IVF has reduced the incidence of severe OHSS, still maintaining a good ovarian
      response and pregnancy rate. Recently, a long acting GnRH antagonist, Degarelix, was
      introduced for prostatic cancer treatment. Furthermore a recent paper reported its use also
      for the induction of multiple follicular growth in a program of oocyte donation. The aim of
      this study is to evaluate the feasibility of GnRH antagonist depot use in a protocol of
      controlled ovarian hyperstimulation in PCOS women at risk of developing OHSS in IVF cycles.
