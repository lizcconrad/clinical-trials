      The purpose of the study is to compare the accuracy of the diagnosis of endoleak in patient
      with EVAR comparing Adaptive statistical iterative reconstruction (ASIR) CTA and Model-based
      iterative reconstruction (MBIR- VEO TM).

      Background:

      The aortic aneurysm is a common and serious disease share its complications (rupture ) ,
      often fatal. It is recognized that pass a certain diameter surgical or endovascular treatment
      reduces mortality by avoiding treatment in extreme provider of high morbidity and mortality
      emergency. Endovascular anevrysm repair (EVAR) treatment has proven effective but
      unfortunately this treatment presents complications ( endoleak ) should be sought
      systematically by repeated checks CT . The irradiation in these patients is a major problem
      with repeated exposure radiation. The follow up of these patients requires repeated CT
      because endoleaks can be delayed.

      Iterative reconstruction of previous generation have reduced the dose , we dispose the last
      Model-based iterative reconstruction (&quot; VEO &quot; ) for a further reduction of patient dose .
      This technique has not yet been evaluated in the detection of endoleaks.

      The purpose of the study is to compare conventional CTA (ASIR50) ( gold standard now) with
      Model-based iterative reconstruction (MBIR- VEO TM) in the detection ( and classification )
      of endoleaks in patients traited by EVAR.

      All patient admited in Radiology to follow up his EVAR is included in the study and receive
      both CT: Adaptive statistical iterative reconstruction (ASIR) CTA and Model-based iterative
      reconstruction (MBIR- VEO TM) and the result of thoses 2 CT are compared by 2 readers
      (blinded of the result) The BMI , other complications, the DLP , dose reduction and quality
      of the examination is noted .
