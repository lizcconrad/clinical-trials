  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose is to compare the efficacy of an intraosseous anaesthesia using a computerized
      system (QuickSleeper) to a conventional infiltration anesthesia. Our hypothesis is that
      anesthesia via QuickSleeper system can reduce pain during anesthesia and obtain a more rapid
      local anesthesia compared to the anesthesia via conventional technique by infiltration.

      Design: split-mouth design AND parallel-arm design

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Local anesthesia is commonly used in oral health care and intra-mucosal infiltration
      anesthesia is most commonly used by practitioners. Anesthesia may cause children a great deal
      of anxiety because of the fear of the injection. The latter can be painful if the product is
      delivered too quickly in the mucosa. Recent developments in the techniques and anesthesia
      systems allow reducing pain during the injection. In particular, computerized systems
      (electronically assisted local anesthesia) allow a slow injection limiting pressure.
      Moreover, these systems look like a pen which prevents the negative impression of the image
      related to the syringe metal. The intraosseous electronically-assisted anesthesia could be an
      interesting alternative to conventional infiltration anesthesia by making the act less
      stressful but also less painful for the child.
