  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Brain metastases occur in 20-40% of patients with metastatic cancer. The standard treatment
      is based on whole brain radiation therapy and local treatment of metastases as neurosurgery
      or radiosurgery. However, many cases can not receive a standard local treatment, and local
      relapse occurs in almost 50% of cases treated with only whole brain irradiation. There are
      retrospective studies of increased radiation dose at the site of metastasis with
      hypofractionated stereotactic radiotherapy (HSRT) with favorable results, but there are no
      controlled studies regarding the safety of radiation dose in these situations. This study is
      a phase I study to evaluate the maximum tolerance dose (MTD) with HSRT as a way to increase
      the dose of radiation after the WBRT for patients with 1-3 brain metastases not eligible for
      surgery or RS.

        -  Held on the seventh day post-WBRT(or next business day if the date coincides with a
           weekend or holiday):

        -  Patient in supine position

        -  Preparation of individualized mask &quot;Mask Patient One set is 41,100 (BrainLAB AG,
           Heimstetten, Germany)

        -  Brain MRI with contrast and volumetric reconstruction of 1 mm without mask and without
           fiducial markers

        -  Brain CT with contrast, 1-mm slices with tracking and stereotactic fixation.

        -  isodose prescription: higher isodose that meets the following criteria: Coverage of at
           least 95% of the PTV with the prescription dose (V100 ≥ 95%) and 95% Of the prescription
           dose covering at least 99% of the PTV (V95 ≥ 99%).

        -  Maximum dose allowed in or outside the PTV: 20% of prescription dose, while respecting
           the tolerance of the organs described below.

        -  Scores compliance with RTOG

        -  Dose escalation scheme

      Study model It'll be recruited 3 patients to the initial scheme of 4 fractions of 5 Gy on
      each brain metastasis with HSRT and if no patient has unacceptable toxicity, more 3 patients
      for subsequent scheme will be recruited. If 2 patients had unacceptable toxicity, the study
      ends and it'll be considered the study initiated with toxic regimen. If 1 patient has
      unacceptable toxicity, it'll be recruited 3 more patients for this scheme and if 1 or more
      patients had unacceptable toxicity, the scheme will be considered toxic and the study will be
      closed. If no patient develops unacceptable toxicity, the study will follow to the next
      cohort of 3 more patients with next dose level. The same criteria of recruitment will be
      performed till any scheme reach the MTD or up to the scheme of 4 fractions of 9 Gy.

        -  The number of fractions of HSRT will be kept in 4 fractions for all cohorts.

        -  The initial dose is 5 Gy per day.

        -  Increasing the dose of one cohort to another will be more than 1 Gy per day of HSRT. For
           example: If the scheme of 4 fractions of 5 Gy will not have unacceptable toxicity, the
           study continues to recruit patients for the scheme of 4 fractions of 6 Gy, and so
           subsequently.

        -  The study will recruit patients to the fractionation scheme up to four fractions of 9 Gy
           according to the BEDGy3 be similar to a maximum dose of RS studies to brain metastasis
           of 24 Gy in one fraction.

        -  At the discretion of the responsible investigator for the safety of the study, the
           number of patients may be increased in each cohort during the study.
