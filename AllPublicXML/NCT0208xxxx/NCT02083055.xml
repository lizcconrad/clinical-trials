  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study was to evaluate the positive anesthetic properties such as reduce
      intraoperative analgesic requirement, time to extubation and recovery, and early
      postoperative pain of dexmedetomidine used as a hypotensive agent compared with
      nitroglycerin.

      The subject included the healthy patients who underwent orthognathic surgery and gave written
      the informed consent. The sample size was calculate from the amount of fentanyl use in
      orthognathic surgical case and difference more 30% was significant. Randomization was done by
      random number table to 2 groups. Both groups received standardized controlled hypotensive
      anesthesia and surgery. D group used dexmedetomidine as the hypotensive drug and N group use
      nitroglycerin. The main outcome were the amount of fentanyl use, time to eye opening, follow
      simple command, extubation, early postoperative pain, and early postoperative amount of pain
      killer. All recorded by anesthesiologist on data sheet.

      compare statistical analysis used compare mean by unpaired student t test.
