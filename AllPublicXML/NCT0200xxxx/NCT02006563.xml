      -  Metabolic Tumor Volume (MTV), identified by Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopic Imaging
           (MRSI) is different from the Clinical Target Volume (CTV) used for radiation dose
           delivery in the treatment of brain tumors.

        -  If MTV &gt; CTV, the investigators hypothesize that the difference in volumes (cc) is
           related to worse clinical outcome. Furthermore, in case of local recurrence, the lesion
           is located in the MTV area that is outside of the CTV.

        -  Alternatively, if CTV &gt; MTV, then the difference in volumes is related to higher
           treatment toxicity.

        It is estimated that approximately 39% of the patients with primary brain tumors, seen in
        the Department of Radiation Oncology, Sylvester Cancer Center are women. Further, it is
        estimated that 58% of patients are White, 6% are African American, 36% are Hispanic and 0%
        are other based upon standard NIH definitions.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients must have histologically confirmed primary brain tumor.

          -  Patients may be enrolled prior to surgery, after surgical resection or with
             unresectable tumors.

          -  Patients must be 18 years or older.

          -  Patients who do not have metal in the body (e.g. pacemakers, implants) that would
             preclude them from undergoing MRI/MRS exam

          -  Patients who do not suffer from claustrophobia (fear of enclosed spaces)

          -  Karnofsky performance status â‰¥ 60.

          -  Patients whose size would allow them to fit into the bore of the MRI instrument.

          -  Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients younger than 18 years.

          -  Inability to undergo MRI/MRS exam because of metal in the head or body, such as
             implants, pacemaker, or biostimulation device. Claustrophobia (fear of enclosed
             spaces).

          -  Karnofsky performance status &lt; 60.

          -  Patients too large (&gt; 300 lbs.) to fit into the bore of the MRI instrument.

          -  Inability to understand the informed consent document.
