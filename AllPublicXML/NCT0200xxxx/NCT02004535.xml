  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to investigate benefits of binaural hearing for
      non-traditional cochlear implant candidates (with Asymmetric Hearing Loss). Asymmetric
      candidates are patients with severe to profound hearing loss in one ear and better hearing in
      the other ear. (One ear is deaf and the other ear has better hearing and in most cases uses a
      hearing aid.) The investigators hypothesize that cochlear implantation of the poorer ear
      provides a functional increase in word and sentence understanding in quiet or noise,
      perceived benefit, localization ability, and other measures of auditory performance relative
      to use of the better hearing ear alone.

      Multichannel cochlear implants have been highly successful in restoring speech understanding
      in adults and children who have congenital or acquired bilateral profound or
      severe-to-profound sensorineural (permanent) hearing loss. As implant technology has
      continued to develop and post-implant performance of patients has improved, the patient
      selection criteria has broadened to include patients with less severe hearing loss. Further,
      results from studies where patients received bilateral cochlear implants have demonstrated
      not only improved performance but the feasibility of integrating signals from both ears.

      In contrast to persons with bilateral severe-to-profound hearing loss, persons who have only
      one ear with profound or severe-to-profound hearing loss and the other ear with substantially
      less hearing loss have not, to date, been considered cochlear implant candidates. This is
      because it has been assumed they will do well enough with a conventional hearing aid in the
      better ear. A problem with this assumption is that even with an appropriately fit better ear
      hearing aid, many of these hearing-impaired individuals still experience significant
      difficulties in speech understanding in their everyday listening environments, along with
      significant communication handicaps that interfere with their employment and quality of life.

      Previous studies that have examined the performance of patients who have more symmetrical
      hearing loss and who wear a cochlear implant on one ear and a power hearing aid on the other
      ear, have illustrated that the two inputs can be combined and provide binaural hearing
      benefits. It is hypothesized in this study that patients with an asymmetrical sensorineural
      hearing loss may also receive significant binaural benefit from having a cochlear implant on
      the poorer ear along with an appropriately fit hearing aid on the better ear. That is, this
      study examines whether patients with asymmetrical sensorineural hearing loss can utilize both
      types of input (acoustic to one ear and electric to the other) effectively, and combine them
      to receive binaural hearing assistance for improving speech understanding, localization
      ability, and patient satisfaction.
