      Still not well resolved access, execution and interpretation of spirometry in primary care
      medicine. This seriously affects the quality of care of chronic respiratory diseases.

      OBJECTIVE: To compare the effectiveness of two methods for quality control in performing
      spirometry in primary care teams (EAP) participating in the &quot;Healthcare Process Chronic
      Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD )&quot; (multidisciplinary program between primary care
      medicine and hospital for improved care COPD).

      METHODS: Randomized controlled trial of clusters of EAP participants ( n = 17 ). The quality
      control of spirometry in each EAP randomize into three branches:

        1. Supervision from the pulmonary function laboratory of the Hospital ; computer.

        2. Program incorporated into automated spirometer.

        3. Spirometric usual practice (control group without any support on the quality ).
           Spirometry EAP participants include year follow-up study . All sites use the same model
           spirometer and have received the same previous training . In a 2nd phase results
           implementing the most effective method shown in the 1st phase was studied.

      EXPECTED RESULTS : The method for quality control more effective to obtain and maintain the
      quality spirometry.

      POTENTIAL IMPACT EXPECTED : performing spirometry quality in the EAP , improve early
      detection (secondary prevention ) , the diagnosis of the severity and developmental control
      of COPD.
