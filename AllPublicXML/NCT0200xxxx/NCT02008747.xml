    <textblock>
      Atrial fibrillation and chronic neuropathic pain are adverse events occurring after
      posterolateral thoracotomy for lung resection. The continuous application of magnesium
      sulphate may have a prophylactic effect. The investigators record the incidence of atrial
      fibrillation during a seven day period after thoracotomy as well as the incidence of chronic
      neuropathic pain during a three months period, comparing one group with a continuous
      application of magnesium sulphate against one group without magnesium sulphate.
