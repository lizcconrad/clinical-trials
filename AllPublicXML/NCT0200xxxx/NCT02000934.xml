    <textblock>
      This study is an open-label, multicenter, phase 1, dose escalation study of TAK-659 in adult
      participants with advanced solid tumor and lymphoma malignancies. This study will be the
      first to administer TAK-659 to humans. The participants population during dose escalation
      (Part A) will consist of adults previously diagnosed with any form of a solid tumor or
      lymphoma for which standard, curative, or life-prolonging treatment does not exist or is no
      longer effective. This first-in-human (FIH) study will include 5 dose expansion cohorts in
      refractory and/or relapsed Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL), Diffuse Large B Cell Lymphoma
      (DLBCL), indolent Non Hodgkin Lymphoma (iNHL), Mantle Cell Lymphoma (MCL), Post Transplant
      Lymphoproliferative Disorder (PTLD) (Part B) following completion of dose escalation (Part
      A).

                  targeting Spleen tyrosine kinase (SYK); considered not appropriate for treatment
                  or retreatment with purine analog-based therapy (CLL); or considered ineligible
                  for at least 1 prior therapy (PTLD); or relapsed or refractory to &gt;= 2 prior
                  lines of chemotherapy (including standard first line therapy including Rituximab
                  and an anthracycline [or equivalent if contraindicated] and one additional
                  systemic multiagent chemotherapy as second-line salvage therapy that may have

             sterile, or if of childbearing potential who agree to use 2 effective method(s) of

          7. Voluntary written consent must be given before performance of any study related
             procedure not part of standard medical care, with the understanding that consent may
             be withdrawn by the participant at any time without prejudice to future medical care.

             antigen-positive; or known or suspected active hepatitis C infection (testing not

          9. Evidence of currently uncontrolled cardiovascular conditions as listed in the
             protocol.

             absorption or tolerance of TAK-659 including difficulty swallowing tablets; diarrhea &gt;
             Grade 1 despite supportive therapy.

         11. Lack of suitable venous access for required blood sampling.
