  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this Phase I/IIa study is to identify a safe and tolerable dosage regimen of
      intravenously administered otelixizumab. In addition, the C-peptide decline in new onset type
      1 diabetes mellitus (NOT1DM) patients and possible immunological mechanisms will be
      investigated with a view to identifying trends and early immunological biomarkers which could
      predict response in halting/slowing Beta-cell destruction in this patient population.

      This exploratory study will explore the safety and tolerability between the well tolerated
      but non-efficacious cumulative dose of 3.1 mg and a cumulative dose of 48 mg at which
      efficacy based on C-peptide analysis was demonstrated, albeit with evidence of Epstein Barr
      Virus (EBV) reactivation and Cytokine Release Syndrome (CRS). Exploration of the tolerability
      dose response is considered a necessary first step to determining the therapeutic index of
      otelixizumab.

             investigational product (whichever is longer).

          -  Exposure to more than four new investigational drugs within 12 months prior to the
             first dosing day.

             sinusitis, localized cellulitis, candidiasis, or urinary tract infections, must be
             assessed on a case-by-case basis by the investigator regarding whether they are
             serious enough to warrant exclusion).
