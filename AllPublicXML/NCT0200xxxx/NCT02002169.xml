  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background: The investigators developed a Shower Technique protocol (STP) for hemodialysis
      (HD) patients with healed central venous catheter (CVC) exit sites, designed to permit
      showering but not increase infection risk.

      Research question: Is it feasible to conduct a randomized control trial comparing the rate of
      CVC related bacteremia (CRB) in adult satellite HD patients using STP versus standard CVC
      care alone with 6 month follow up? Study Design: This pilot study is a multi-centre
      randomized control trial. Eligible participants will be randomized to STP versus standard
      care after meeting predefined criteria to confirm healed tunneled CVC exit site.

      Primary Outcome: Feasibility will be determined based on 5 outcome measures: accuracy of the
      CRB rate documentation in the satellite setting, percentage of patients screened, recruited,
      educated successfully in the STP (intervention arm), and aspects of STP (% of contaminated
      patients in the control arm).

      Study Setting: In satellite units affiliated with 2 academic and 3 community centres in south
      central Ontario, Canada.

      Patient Population: Adult satellite HD patients dialyzing via CVC with healed CVC exit sites.

      Intervention: STP and standard CVC care; or Control: standard CVC care; Analysis: Each
      measure of feasibility has its statistical threshold for success. If the threshold is reached
      in 4 of the 5 measures, the full HIPPO SAT study will be deemed feasible.

      Discussion: A pilot feasibility study of the larger study is critical due to the potential
      challenges associated with recruitment, compliance and contamination.

      CVC related infections are associated with increased morbidity and hospitalization rates,
      high treatment costs, and poor survival compared to use of an arteriovenous access. To
      prevent infection, patients should preserve the integrity and dryness of their CVC dressings.
      Showering should be avoided, as it is difficult to attain full protective coverage of the
      exit site using dressings and barriers. Wet dressings place patients at increased infection
      risk, especially if their CVC exit site is not fully healed. However, in a survey of 274 CVC
      dependent HD patients, 64% indicated that the recommended prohibition to shower was
      moderately to extremely inconvenient and reduced their quality of life. Additionally 77% of
      patients admitted to showering at least once while they had a CVC.

      While submersion of the CVC in water is discouraged by clinical practice guidelines, they
      also state that if precautions can be taken to reduce the likelihood of bacterial CVC entry
      then showering may be acceptable. However, this guidance is opinion based with no evidence to
      support specific precautions. Thus, to address the patients' desire to shower safely, at
      least 2 separate dialysis facilities in Ontario, Canada have developed a showering procedure
      as an alternative method of CVC care. Preliminary data from a small proof-of-concept study of
      65 patients suggests acceptable CRB rates (0.46/1000 CVC days) using such showering
      procedures. The study was conducted in satellite HD units on a select population of patients
      who were infection-free for 6 months using the same CVC. Satellite units offer dialysis in an
      outpatient setting for those patients who are stable and require less intensive care than
      in-centre patients. The satellite HD population is typically younger and healthier, and
      likely more able to perform showering procedures than in-centre patients. With increasing
      patients in satellite HD, it is crucial that a pragmatic, yet effective, prophylactic CVC
      infection strategy be formally tested and established for this setting.

      Following the proof-of-concept study, nephrologists, vascular access coordinators, and HD
      centres from five dialysis centres across Ontario, collaborated to create a formal Shower
      Technique Protocol (STP) which includes chlorhexidine applicators after showering to minimize
      the risk of bacterial entry at the CVC exit site. STP is designed specifically for patients
      with a fully endothelialized CVC tunnel and healed exit site. Participants allocated to STP
      are able to shower and change their dressing up to 3 times per week. Prior to more widespread
      implementation of the STP, it is critical to determine whether it is safe for use in patients
      with healed CVC exit sites. In other words, to confirm that CRB rates in patients using STP
      are not greater than the CRB rates in patients using the gold standard of CVC care. It is
      unknown whether using the STP improves patient satisfaction with their CVC care.

The percentage of patients in the Shower Technique arm passing the shower technique test at 3 and 6 months

    <description>Once written consent is obtained, the participant will undergo formal testing for CVC exit site healing. The tests of CVC exit site healing are as follows: 1) Deep Breath Stability Test measures the migration of the CVC as marked by a 2 cm indicator on the CVC from the skin at CVC exit. There should be &lt; 3 mm movement between complete exhalation and inhalation; 2) CVC Seal Test is a visual inspection against an objective checklist to determine healing; and 3) Blinded Photo Test where two photos are taken of the CVC exit site to be evaluated for healing by independent blinded trained assessors. Both assessors must agree that the exit site is healed to pass the test.</description>

    <description>Participants will be given a minimum 30 minute personalized educational session by the study coordinator. They will be taught safe and clean techniques for showering with their CVC.

    <description>Standard CVC Care consists of cleansing with chlorhexidine 2% or povidone (if allergic to chlorhexidine) at the CVC exit site by trained HD nurses followed by placement of a dry gauze dressing by the HD nurse 1x/week or when clinically indicated. In order to participate in the standard CVC care arm, participating sites must have in their policy that it is trained HD nurses who will apply the Polysporin Triple Ointment after standard cleansing with chlorhexidine 2% or povidone during HD, according to guideline recommendations or as per hospital patient care standards and nursing regulations.</description>
