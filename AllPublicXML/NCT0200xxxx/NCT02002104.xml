    <textblock>
      The replacement of autologous blood vessels by artificial grafts is urgently needed in
      clinical applications. Expanded polytetrafluoroethylene (ePTFE) grafts are the most
      clinically used artificial blood vessels because of its chemical and mechanical stability.
      But, when used as arteriovenous (AV) grafts for haemodialysis, small diameter ePTFE grafts
      have a high failure rate of 40% in three years in vivo because of the functional lack of an
      intact endothelial cell layer. Here we developed a two-step modification including chemical
      etching and plasma activation to enhance the hydrophilicity of ePTFE. Peptide motifs (eg.
      cyclic RRE, RGD) known to bind integrins on the endothelial cells were immobilized on ePTFE
      grafts. Functional peptide immobilization significantly increased the adherence and growth of
      HUVEC cells on ePTFEs. Patch ePTFE implantation in the pig's descending aorta was used to
      evaluate the in vivo endothelialization of these modified ePTFE grafts. At 28 days
      implantation, newly formed endothelial layers on peptide-immobilized ePTFE grafts were
      demonstrated by SEM and histological analysis. These preliminary data showed the potential to
      grow an intact endothelial layer to improve the patency rate of the modified ePTFE grafts.

        Native arteriovenous fistulas are not available in up to 40 percent of patients with renal
        dialysis. Therefore, the replacement of autologous blood vessels by artificial grafts is
        urgently needed. Expanded polytetrafluoroethylene( ePTFE) grafts are the most clinically
        used artificial blood vessels.
