  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Health care has an increasingly demand for mobile applications (App), but studies are rare,
      which explore the added value and benefits for patient and physician. Patients in different
      disease groups or physicians from different specialties are likely to have different demands.
      Research should focus on selected groups to better understand their individual demands. Our
      study intends to identify the added value of mobile symptom tracking in a selected subgroup
      of patients. We designed an App for breast cancer patients, who receive ambulant chemotherapy
      in a breast center. The patients track regularly their well-being and adverse events (AE)
      with the smartphone- or web-app and share it with the physician in the medical consultation.
      The data entry was designed to meet patient needs based on previous usability testing.

      The reporting of AE and well-being are standardized according to the definitions by CTCAE 4.0
      and ECOG-Index to ensure the reliability of patient self-reporting.

      The primary outcomes are the number of reported AE, the influence on their subjective
      well-being and the acceptance of context specific information. We will include 150
      participants in this study. The calculated power is 91% respectively 80% for a 10 %
      improvement of well-being and a 2.2 increase of detected AEs.

      The results will be compared to patients without App and to patients with App but without
      shared information.

    <time_frame>5-6 weeks for each patient</time_frame>
    <description>Patients report their adverse events independently in a mobile app for a period of 3 cycles of chemotherapy. The reporting of AE and well-being are standardized according to the definitions by CTCAE 4.0 and ECOG-Index to ensure the reliability of patient self-reporting. Medical consultations take place periodically every 2-3 weeks. Planned medical consultations: start-consultation with the begin of chemotherapy, first consultation before the 2nd chemotherapy cycle and second (final) consultation before the 3rd chemotherapy cycle.
The observation time of each patient is 5-6 weeks.</description>
