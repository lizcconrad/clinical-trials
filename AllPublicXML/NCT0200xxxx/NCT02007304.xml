    <textblock>
      The purpose of is to determine the preventive effects of Chinese herb supplement with panax
      ginseng and salvia miltiorrhiza prior to eccentric resistance exercise on arterial stiffness
      and vascular reactivity by using a double-blind randomized control design and to examine the
      effects of a 12-week progressive eccentric resistance exercise training on arterial
      elasticity and vascular reactivity, and whether a long-term supplementation would ameliorate
      arterial stiffening effects elicited by exercise-induced inflammation and improve endothelial
      function.
