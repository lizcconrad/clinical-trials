        currently and for at least 6 months prior, who are beginning a new prescription treatment
        for their GHD. Patients will be selected by sites as per inclusion and exclusion criteria

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Able to speak read and write English

          -  GHD (Growth Hormone Deficiency) treatment naïve which is defined as not being on a
             prescription treatment for their GHD currently and for at least 6 months

          -  Beginning a new prescription GHD treatment and expected to be on this treatment for
             GHD for a minimum of 6 months

          -  GHD of either one of the following criteria: a) Adult onset: subjects who have GHD,
             either alone or associated with multiple hormone deficiencies (hypopituitarism), as a
             result of pituitary disease, hypothalamic disease, surgery, radiation therapy, or
             traumatic brain injury (TBI), b) Childhood Onset: Subjects who were growth hormone
             deficient during childhood as a result of congenital, genetic, acquired, or idiopathic
             causes

          -  Confirmed diagnosis of growth hormone deficiency (if a subject satisfies any one of
             the three following criteria): a) For the insulin tolerance test (ITT) or glucagon
             test both performed within the last five years: the validated cut-off for GHD in
             adults is a peak GH response of below 3.0 ng/mL (3 microg/L), b) For growth hormone
             releasing hormone (GHRH) +Arginine test performed within the last five years: for
             those subjects with a body mass index (BMI) below 25 kg/m^2, a peak GH below 11 ng/mL
             (microg /L); for BMI 25-30 kg/m^2, a peak GH below 8 ng/mL (8 microg/L); for BMI above
             30 kg/m^2, a peak GH below 4 ng/mL 341 (4 microg/L ), c) Three or more pituitary
             hormone deficiencies at screening

          -  Informed consent obtained before any study-related activities. (Study-related
             activities are any procedure related to recording of data according to the protocol)

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Mental incapacity, unwillingness or language barriers precluding adequate
             understanding or cooperation

          -  Patients who have been on a prescription medication for treatment of GHD in past 6
             months

          -  Patients with a total Beck Depression Inventory II (BDI-II) score greater than 25

          -  Females who are pregnant, breast-feeding or intend to become pregnant or are not using
             adequate contraceptive methods (adequate contraceptive measures as required by local
             law or practice)

          -  Acute severe illness associated with weight loss in the last 6 months (defined as a
             loss of more than 5.0% total body weight)

          -  Active Cushings syndrome within the last 24 months

          -  Subject with overt diabetes mellitus

          -  Previous participation in this study
