  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of the study is to examine the efficacy of Ondissolve for the
      prevention/rescue of Acute and Delayed Phase radiation induced nausea and vomiting (RINV) in
      patients undergoing single or multiple fraction, emetogenic palliative radiation therapy for
      painful bone metastases. The study population will be 30 patients seen in the RRRP at the
      Sunnybrook Odette Cancer Centre receiving palliative radiation therapy considered emetogenic
      for bone metastases. Patients will take the study medication (Ondissolve 8 mg) twice on each
      day of radiation therapy, at least one hour prior to treatment and repeat approximately 6-8
      hours later the same day. Patients undergoing multiple fraction radiation therapy will take
      Ondissolve on weekends or holidays in between treatment. Secondary objectives include to
      evaluate key secondary endpoints related to RINV, and to investigate the ease and length of
      administration of protocol medicine. We hypothesize that Ondissolve will be effective in the
      prophylaxis of RINV, and the ease of use and administration will provide an appropriate
      delivery method for those unable to tolerate the oral form of ondansetron.
