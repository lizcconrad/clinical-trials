  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The curative treatment of thoracic (lung and oesophagus), digestive (gastric, pancreatic,
      hepatic, colorectal), and urologic (renal, bladder, prostatic) cancers needs a surgical
      resection. For patients aged of 70 years old and more, this surgery is associated to an
      increased morbid-mortality especially because of more frequent co-morbidities. Comprehensive
      geriatric assessment (CGA) allows distinguishing patients for whom a resection surgery can be
      complicated by high morbid-mortality or a loss of autonomy. It has been proved that for old
      patient population without cancer, CGA associated with a geriatric intervention plan (GIP)
      allows autonomy preservation, decrease of institution admission, and survival improvement.
      The reference study showed that a CGA associated to a GIP improves survival of old patients
      who had a cancer surgery. However this study included patients from 60 years old and the GIP
      consisted in 3 home visits and 5 phone calls during the 4 weeks following hospital discharge.

      We propose to perform a prospective and randomized study to evaluate the impact of a CGA with
      GIP in 70 years old and more patients with a thoracic, digestive or urologic cancer
      resection, respectively 1, 3, 6 and 12 months after discharge. CGA and GIP will focus on 8
      distinct fields: autonomy, co-morbidities, co-medication, mobility, nutritional status,
      depression, cognitive function and social status. The impact of such a strategy on autonomy
      and survival has never been studied.
