  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Most arthroscopic surgeries of the shoulder are currently performed as an outpatient. The
      postoperative analgesia should be optimal. General anesthesia allows for any arthroscopic
      surgery but does not provide a satisfactory postoperative analgesia . The locoregional
      anesthesia is recommended and includes several techniques: the interscalene nerve block, the
      suprascapular nerve block, intra-articular injection of local anesthetic and subacromial
      infiltration. The interscalene nerve block is currently the gold standard for anesthesia and
      postoperative analgesia for arthroscopic shoulder surgery with a success rate above 80% .
      However it must be carried out by teams experienced in the locoregional anesthesia because it
      is operator -dependent. The suprascapular nerve block is a simple technique that can be
      performed by the surgeon after surgery , effective in arthroscopic shoulder surgery , less
      invasive than the interscalene nerve block and exposing the patient to fewer complications.
      However, his interest was not assessed in the repair of tendons of the rotator cuff. The main
      hypothesis of this study is that the suprascapular nerve block is as effective as the
      interscalene nerve block in the prevention of early postoperative pain after arthroscopic
      repair of the infra and / or the supraspinatus rotator cuff tendons, without increasing the
      analgesic consumption while reducing the risk of complications related to regional
      anesthesia.

    <description>Interscalene block is performed preoperatively with ultrasound guidance and neurostimulation 0.8 milliampere. The block is performed using &quot;in-plane&quot; approach with a needle of 50 mm for a neurostimulation. During the injection, it is verified that the diffusion extends to the anterior and posterior space. If the posterior distribution is limited, the needle is remobilized to obtain an overall diffusion: a bolus of 20 mL of ropivacaine 0.75% is made by the anesthetist. The effectiveness of the nerve block is checked before the start of surgery.</description>

    <description>The suprascapular block is performed at the end of surgery when the incisions are closed but before the removal of the surgical drapes. The material used is a compound of a 10 cc syringe sterile equipment, a green intramuscular needle (14 gauge) and a bulb 10 cc of 0.75% Ropivacaine. The injection of 10 cc is realized by the technical princeps</description>
