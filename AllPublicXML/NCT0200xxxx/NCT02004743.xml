  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre is Canada's largest trauma centre, treating 1,100 patients
      annually. A traumatic experience can lead to post-traumatic stress disorder, which increases
      hospital stays, emergency visits and disability. Despite developing leadership to manage a
      &quot;Code Orange&quot; mass trauma, Sunnybrook lacks guidelines in the psychological management of
      patients who have experienced trauma. The department of psychiatry currently holds a
      Traumatic Brain Injury clinic and PTSD services for youth but lacks both immediate
      intervention, prevention and adult services. This research will enable us to gain best
      evidence expertise to develop guidelines as well as a sustainable PTSD treatment program,
      with clear outcomes to assess effectiveness, psychiatric morbidity, use of healthcare,
      disability and substance abuse.

      The five world-expert-consensus intervention resilience based principles will be
      operationalized in guidelines for the management of trauma patients, their caregivers and in
      routine nursing and trauma team care from the Emergency to the ward, and discharge, through
      to outpatient care. It is hypothesized that this will improve the psychological recovery of
      patients at risk of developing PTSD after a traumatic injury. In addition, early screening
      and intervention for increased risk of PTSD will be implemented one month after the trauma.
      It is hypothesized that such trauma informed psychological management, early screening and
      expert treatment using prolonged exposure will reduce hospital stays, functional disability,
      as well as longer-term psychiatric morbidity, including substance abuse.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study is a longitudinal interventional study, with a control group who have treatment for
      their trauma with no guidelines for psychological management, staff training, patient and
      family intervention/education. In the intervention group, who will have all of the above,
      participants will be stratified according to risk factors for PTSD and randomized 1:1 in &quot;low
      risk&quot; and &quot;at risk&quot; groups-those who will have a prolonged exposure intervention and those
      who will not.

    <description>The aim of the study is to observe whether there's a presence and severity (if applicable) of Posttraumatic symptoms in patients who've received the intervention, compared to those who have not.
Presence and severity of PTSD symptoms will be measured by:
follow-up at 1 month, 3 months &amp; 6 months which involve specific PTSD self-report symptom measures: PTSD Symptom Scale
Structured Clinical Interview for the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual for Mental Disorder (SCID) Semi-structured interview performed at 6 months either over the phone or in person</description>

    <description>The Beck Depression Inventory - Second Edition (BDI-II) will be used at recruitment, 1 month, 3 months, and 6 months follow-up to measure the presence and/or change in depressive symptoms of the patient.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Anxiety &amp; dissociation symptoms</measure>
    <time_frame>recruitment &amp; 1 month</time_frame>
    <description>Patients will be assessed for anxiety and dissociation symptoms at recruitment and follow-up at 1 month with the Stanford Acute Stress Reaction Questionnaire (SASRQ).</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in substance use</measure>
    <time_frame>recruitment, 1 month, 3 months &amp; 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>PTSD is highly correlated with substance use. By implementing a preventative intervention, one aim is to reduce overall substance use. This will be assessed using the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT) and the Drug Abuse Screening Test (DAST) at recruitment, 1 month, 3 months and 6 months.</description>
