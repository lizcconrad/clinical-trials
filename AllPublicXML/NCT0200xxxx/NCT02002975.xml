      This study is designed to determine the onset of new cerebral and cardiovascular events and
      changes in metabolic syndrome parameters in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus on
      long-term pioglitazone (Actos Tablets) treatment.

    <textblock>
      This is a special drug use surveillance on long-term use of pioglitazone (Actos Tablets) in
      patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, designed to determine the onset of new cerebral and
      cardiovascular events and changes in metabolic syndrome parameters, and to analyze the
      association between patient baseline characteristics, including any metabolic
      syndrome-related risk factors, and the onset of new cerebral and cardiovascular events in an
      exploratory setting.

      Participants will be patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. The planned sample size is
      20,000.

      The usual adult dosage is 15 to 30 mg of pioglitazone administered orally once daily before
      or after breakfast.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients must have type 2 diabetes mellitus and have undergone measurements for all of
             the following parameters to be included in this survey:

        Waist circumference, height, body weight, blood pressure, HbA1c, fasting triglyceride,
        HDL-cholesterol

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients meeting any of the following criteria (1) to (5) will be excluded:

               1. Patients with any contraindications to pioglitazone (Actos Tablets) treatment as
                  specified below:

                  Cardiac failure, history of cardiac failure, severe ketosis, diabetic coma or
                  precoma, type 1 diabetes mellitus, serious hepatic dysfunction, serious renal
                  dysfunction, severe infection, perioperative state, serious trauma, history of
                  hypersensitivity to any ingredients of Actos, pregnancy or possible pregnancy

               2. Patients aged &lt; 20 or ≥ 75 years

               3. Patients who currently have or have had any of the following: myocardial
                  infarction, angina pectoris, cardiomyopathy, hypertensive heart disease
                  (including left ventricular hypertrophy with cardiac hypofunction*), atrial
                  fibrillation, atrial flutter, valvular disease, aortic dissection, cerebral
                  infarction, cerebral hemorrhage (including subarachnoid hemorrhage). (*Reduced
                  cardiac function is roughly defined as having a brain natriuretic peptide [BNP] ≥
                  40 pg/mL.)

               4. Patients who have taken pioglitazone (Actos Tablets) within 3 months before

               5. Patients who have been enrolled in the Blopress special drug use surveillance
                  &quot;hypertension: survey on metabolic equivalents (MetS) (Challenge-MetS)&quot; at each
