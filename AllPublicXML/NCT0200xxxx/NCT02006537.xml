    <textblock>
      This study will investigate the safety and pharmacokinetics (PK) of a single dose of
      GSK2256294 in healthy young and elderly subjects to explore the effects of food, gender and
      age on drug exposure. The biliary metabolites in healthy young males will be investigated
      using the Entero-test after a single oral dose of GSK2256294. This study will be conducted in
      two cohorts (Cohort 1 and Cohort 2). Cohort 1 is open label in order to characterise the PK
      profile of GSK2256294 in healthy young males and also to investigate the biliary metabolites
      of GSK2256294. Cohort 2 uses a crossover design to allow comparison of the PK parameters of
      GSK2256294 between in the fed and fasted state within subject and also to compare the PK
      parameters of GSK2256294 between male and female subjects. A washout period of a minimum of 2
      weeks has been chosen to allow and adequate washout of GSK2256294.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Safety - All Cohorts

          -  12 lead ECG without any clinically significant abnormality as judged by the
             Investigator, and ECGs QT duration corrected for heart rate by Fridericia's formula
             (QTcF) &lt;450 milliseconds (msec) determined by the average of triplicate ECGs.

          -  Male subjects with female partners of child-bearing potential must agree to use one of
             the contraception methods listed in the protocol. This criterion must be followed from
             the time of the first dose of study medication until 2 weeks post-last dose.

          -  Body weight &gt;=60 kilogram (kg) and body mass index (BMI) within the range 19 - 35 kg
             per meter square (kg/m^2) (inclusive).

          -  Alanine aminotransferase (ALT), alkaline phosphatase and bilirubin &lt;=1.5xUpper limit
             of normal [ULN] (isolated bilirubin &gt;1.5xULN is acceptable if bilirubin is
             fractionated and direct bilirubin &lt;35%).

          -  Healthy as determined by a responsible and experienced physician, based on a medical
             evaluation including medical history, physical examination, laboratory tests and
             cardiac monitoring. A subject with a clinical abnormality or laboratory parameter
             outside the reference range for the population being studies may be included only of
             the Investigator agree that the finding is unlikely to introduce additional risk
             factors and will not interfere with study procedures. Consultation with the GSK
             Medical Monitor is required.

          -  Capable of giving written informed consent, which includes compliance with the
             requirements and restrictions listed in the consent form.

          -  Safety - Cohort 2 Only

          -  A female subject is eligible to participate if she is of: Non-childbearing potential
             defined as pre-menopausal females with a documented tubal ligation or hysterectomy
             [for this definition, &quot;documented&quot; refers to the outcome of the
             investigator's/designee's review of the subject's medical history for study
             eligibility, as obtained via a verbal interview with the subject or from the subject's
             medical records]; or postmenopausal defined as 12 months of spontaneous amenorrhea [in
             questionable cases a blood sample with simultaneous follicle stimulating hormone (FSH)
             &gt;40 milli international units per milliliter (mIU/mL) and estradiol &lt;40 picogram per
             milliliter (pg/mL) (&lt;147 picomole per liter) is confirmatory]. [Females on hormone
             replacement therapy (HRT) and whose menopausal status is in doubt will be required to
             use one of the contraception methods listed in the protocol if they wish to continue
             their HRT during the study. Otherwise, they must discontinue HRT to allow confirmation
             of post-menopausal status prior to study enrolment. For most forms of HRT, at least
             2-4 weeks will elapse between the cessation of therapy and the blood draw; this
             interval depends on the type and dosage of HRT. Following confirmation of their
             post-menopausal status, they can resume use of HRT during the study without use of a
             contraceptive method.]

          -  Other - Cohort 1 Only.

          -  Cohort 1 only: Male aged between 18 and 45 years of age inclusive, at the time of
             signing the informed consent.

        Cohort 1 only: BP &lt;=130/80.

          -  Other - Cohort 2 Only

          -  Cohort 2 only: Male and females (of non-child bearing potential) aged &gt;=60 years of
             age, at the time of signing the informed consent.

          -  Cohort 2 only: BP &lt;=160/100.

          -  Where participation in the study would result in donation of blood or blood products
             in excess of 500 mL within a 56 day period.

          -  Exposure to more than four new chemical entities within 12 months prior to the first
             dosing day.

        Current or chronic history of liver disease, or known hepatic or biliary abnormalities
        (with the exception of Gilbert's syndrome or asymptomatic gallstones).

          -  History of regular alcohol consumption within 6 months of the study defined as: an
             average weekly intake of &gt;14 drinks for males or &gt;7 drinks for females. One drink is
             equivalent to 12 grams of alcohol: 12 ounces (360 mL) of beer, 5 ounces (150 mL) of
             wine or 1.5 ounces (45 mL) of 80 proof distilled spirits.

          -  A positive pre-study Hepatitis B surface antigen or positive Hepatitis C antibody
             result within 3 months of screening.

          -  A positive test for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) antibody.

          -  A positive pre-study drug/alcohol screen.

          -  Subjects with a history of any type of malignancy with the exception of successfully
             treated squamous cell cancer of the skin.

          -  History of sensitivity to the study medication, or components thereof or a history of
             drug allergy that, in the opinion of the Investigator or GSK Medical Monitor,
             contraindicated their participation.

          -  Urinary cotinine levels indicative of smoking or history or regular use of tobacco- or
             nicotine-containing products within 6 months prior to screening.
