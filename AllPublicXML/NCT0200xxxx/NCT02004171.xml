  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Electronic cigarettes have shown promise but have yet to proven effective for smoking
      cessation. This trial will evaluate the effectiveness of electronic cigarettes in smokers who
      are trying to quit smoking compared with a standard therapy, the nicotine inhaler. The
      investigators hypothesize that electronic cigarettes will be comparable to the nicotine
      inhaler in terms of smoking cessation.

      Cigarette smoking remains the leading cause of preventable death and disease worldwide.

      The purpose of this trial is to evaluate the effectiveness of electronic cigarettes for
      smoking cessation compared to a similar nicotine replacement therapy, the nicotine inhaler.
