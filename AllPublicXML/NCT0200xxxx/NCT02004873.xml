      The purpose of this clinical study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the Micra
      Transcatheter Pacing System and to assess long term performance.

  <detailed_description>

      The study is being conducted in 56 sites located around the world, including 30 sites in the
      United States (U.S.).

      Up to 780 subjects were planned to be enrolled (i.e. consented) to allow up to 720 subjects
      to be implanted enabling at least 600 subjects to be followed for at least 12-months
      post-implant.

      There are two primary objectives in this study (one safety and one efficacy). The primary
      safety objective of the study is to evaluate major complications related to the Micra system
      or procedure. The primary safety endpoint was pre-specified to be evaluated at 6-months (183
      days) post-implant. The primary efficacy objective, Micra pacing capture thresholds, was also
      pre-specified to be evaluated six months post-implant. This study also has a separate long
      term safety objective that will provide additional long-term safety data following potential
      regulatory submissions.

      All subjects will be followed until official study closure (official study closure is defined
      as when Medtronic and/or FDA requirements have been satisfied per the Clinical
      Investigational Plan and/or by a decision by Medtronic or regulatory authority).

      Additionally, the Micra Accelerometer Sensor Sub-Study (MASS) is being conducted at 4 centers
      already active in the Micra study in Austria, Spain, Hungary and France. Forty (40) subjects
      were enrolled in the Sub-Study, and enrollment in the Sub-Study was complete as of March 31,
      2016. The purpose of the Sub-Study is to test feasibility for future enhancements in the
      Micra device functionalities.

      An algorithm was designed to sense the atrial contraction using the Micra accelerometer.

    <measure>Pacing Capture Threshold</measure>
    <time_frame>6 Months Post Implant</time_frame>
    <description>Subjects that have an adequate pacing capture threshold (PCT) at the 6-month post-implant visit, which is defined as PCT &lt;=2 volts at 0.24 ms pulse width and the increase in PCT from implant to 6 months &lt;=1.5 volts. The pacing capture threshold is the minimal electrical stimulus required to produce consistent cardiac depolarization. It is the minimum amount of energy that is required for a pacemaker to pace the heart.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Ventricular Capture Management Threshold</measure>
    <time_frame>6 Months Post Implant</time_frame>
    <description>Subjects that have a ventricular capture management threshold (VCMT) that is within 0.5 Volts of the manual (auto decrement) PCT (at 0.24 ms pulse width) at the 6-month post-implant visit. The VCMT is an automatically measured pacing capture threshold that is measured by the Micra device's pacing algorithm. In contrast, the manual (auto decrement) pacing capture threshold is measured by the clinician during a study visit.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Rate Response Operation of Micra</measure>
    <time_frame>3 Months and 6 Months Post Implant (combined analysis)</time_frame>
    <description>Assessment of whether the Micra sensor-indicated rate derived from the input of the accelerometer during the Minnesota Pacemaker Response Exercise Protocol (M-PREP) treadmill test conducted at the 3-month and 6-month follow-up visits was proportional to the workload. The sensor-indicated rate (in min^-1) and workload (in METS) were normalized for each subject relative to their minimum and maximum possible values so the normalized values have a minimum possible value of zero and a maximum possible value of 1. These normalized values were used in a random effect linear regression model to assess the relationship between the sensor-indicated rate and workload via estimation of the Kay-Wilkoff slope parameter. The tests at 3-month and 6-month visits were combined in one analysis.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects who have a Class I or II indication for implantation of a single chamber
             ventricular pacemaker according to ACC/AHA/HRS 2008 guidelines and any national
             guidelines

             included in the study. Medtronic notified all sites on July 23, 2014 that the

        <title>Rate Response Operation of Micra</title>
        <description>Assessment of whether the Micra sensor-indicated rate derived from the input of the accelerometer during the Minnesota Pacemaker Response Exercise Protocol (M-PREP) treadmill test conducted at the 3-month and 6-month follow-up visits was proportional to the workload. The sensor-indicated rate (in min^-1) and workload (in METS) were normalized for each subject relative to their minimum and maximum possible values so the normalized values have a minimum possible value of zero and a maximum possible value of 1. These normalized values were used in a random effect linear regression model to assess the relationship between the sensor-indicated rate and workload via estimation of the Kay-Wilkoff slope parameter. The tests at 3-month and 6-month visits were combined in one analysis.</description>
