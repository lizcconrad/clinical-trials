    <textblock>
      Colonoscopy is a routinely performed examination of children and adolescents in the
      diagnostic process of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). It is necessary that the bowel is
      clean so the colonoscopy can be optimally performed. The cleansing of the bowel by means of
      laxatives prior to the examination is, however, considered difficult by many children.
      Getting smaller children to cooperate and to drink a substantial volume of laxative fluid
      prior to the examination can be particularly difficult. There are several possible cleansing
      procedures and combinations of procedures for the cleansing of the colon, for example by
      means of polyethylene glycol and sodium picosulphate, which are the two most commonly used
      methods. Cleansing by means of polyethylene glycol can, due to the necessary intake of a
      substantial quantity of fluid, be particularly frustrating for patients. Often the only way
      to carry out the preparation is with the insertion of a nasogastric tube, which can cause
      discomfort for some children. Cleansing the colon by means of sodium picosulphate, which
      involves an intake of a small quantity of fluid, has been suggested to be a good sufficient
      method resulting with a satisfactory result in terms of bowel cleanliness. However, studies
      have so far encompassed only a smaller number of children and further studies are needed to
      confirm that there is no difference between the two methods in terms of resultant bowel
      cleanliness.

      The purpose of this randomized controlled study is to compare preparation by means of
      polyethylene glycol and preparation with sodium picosulphate prior to colonoscopy in
      children.

      One hundred children scheduled for colonoscopy in southern Sweden will be randomized into
      either patient group 1 (for preparation with polyethylene glycol) or patient group 2 (for
      preparation with sodium picosulphate). For the random sampling, data-driven selection will be
      implemented. A CONSORT Flowchart (2012) will be encompassed by the study. To assess the
      cleanliness of the intestinal tract (and volume of fluid in the intestine), the Ottawa Scale
      will be used (Rostom &amp; Jolicoeur, 2009). All colonoscopy examinations will be performed by
      the same paediatric gastroenterologist, to whom no information about which preparation method
      was used by each child will be disclosed. Furthermore, the gastroenterologist will, meet with
      the children first after the investigation has been completed. All information regarding the
      investigation will be given to the patient by the admitting physician. During the colonoscopy
      the gastroenterologist will evaluate the intestinal cleanliness and submit the reports in
      sealed coded envelopes to the nurse in charge of the patient.
