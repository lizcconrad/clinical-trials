  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary aim is to confirm the efficacy of a new non-invasive method for measuring the
      oxygen uptake during general anesthesia of patients undergoing surgery under cardiopulmonary
      bypass. The method has already been successfully tested in the laboratory under controlled
      conditions. In the patient group chosen, oxygen uptake is simultaneously calculated, for
      comparison purposes, from monitoring measurements made routinely as part of normal patient
      care in these cases, using a pulmonary artery catheter - an invasive technique from which
      severe complications occasionally arise, including death.

      A secondary aim is to elucidate the time course of uptake of the anaesthetic vapor,
      isoflurane, during this kind of surgery.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In a series of 30 patients undergoing cardiopulmonary bypass, the change in nitrogen
      concentration between fresh gas entering the anesthetic breathing system and the exhaust gas
      leaving it in an otherwise closed system is used to determine total gas uptake by the
      principle of insoluble gas dilution. Oxygen and anaesthetic agent uptakes are then
      automatically determined by a computer directly linked to a rapid gas analyzer, every 15
      seconds.

      As a control, oxygen is calculated using the reverse Fick method. Measured arterial and mixed
      venous oxygen saturations were used to do this, and the cardiac output which was determined
      by thermodilution.
