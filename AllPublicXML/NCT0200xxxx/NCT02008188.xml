  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to use an Advisory/Automated Adaptive (AAA) Control system for
      insulin delivery in adults with Type 1 Diabetes (T1DM) in an outpatient setting to evaluate
      the system's ability to significantly improve blood glucose levels. This protocol represents
      a culmination of prior clinical trials in development of this AAA control system and benefits
      from the synthesis of those components.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Our overall goal is to evaluate the feasibility of the AAA control system by comparing, in a
      randomized cross-over study, the three stages of AAA Control (Advice, Automation, and
      Adaptation) to state-of-the art Continuous Glucose Monitor (CGM)-augmented insulin pump
      therapy in supervised home-like setting. To achieve this goal, the study will take place in
      an outpatient setting.

      To test the feasibility of &quot;bedside&quot; closed-loop control we will use an approach comprised of
      standard sensor-augmented pump therapy during the day using off-the-shelf devices and
      overnight closed-loop control using experimental devices in supervised outpatient setting. We
      hypothesize that the AAA control system will prevent nocturnal hypoglycemia and will increase
      time within target (80-140 mg/dl) overnight for 5 consecutive nights compared to 5
      consecutive nights with CGM-augmented pump alone. Additionally we have an exploratory
      hypothesis that overnight control will lead to improved time in target during the day.

    <description>During the outpatient data collection period, subjects will be equipped with a DexCom Gen4 CGM. Subjects will be provided with instructions on how to upload CGM data through the DexCom software and how to download insulin pump data to record insulin pump information.

    <description>During the experimental week, subjects will wear a standard CGM and insulin pump during the day and will follow their usual diabetes care. During the nighttime hours, the subjects will return to the study site and will resume closed-loop control overnight from 23:00-07:00. This study design will also allow for testing of system transitions from CGM-augmented pump therapy to closed loop control and back to CGM-augmented pump therapy.</description>
