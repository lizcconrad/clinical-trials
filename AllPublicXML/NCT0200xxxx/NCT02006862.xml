      Schizophrenia

      Treatment may be divided as follows :

      Treating first episode- Treatment of acute- Maintenance therapy , relapse prevention -
      Treatment -resistant schizophrenia Treating first episode

      • The oral antipsychotics ( APS ) second generation ( atypical ) considered the treatment of
      choice : olanzapine , risperidone , quetiapine , aripiprazole , ziprasidone , amisulpride ,
      paliperidone

        -  Sertindole used in patients who can not tolerate at least one of the remaining APS

        -  Advantages monotherapy

        -  The dose of medication ( FA ) is preferable to the lower limits of normal dose as
           defined

        -  The appropriate duration of therapy should be continued for 12-24 months after the
           recession of the episode .

      Treatment of acute phase .

        -  first-line treatment is oral second generation APS . The doses appropriate to move
           within the therapeutic range as defined

        -  For patients who received first-generation APS and had either reduced efficacy or
           intolerable side effects, the treatment of choice is to switch to oral second-generation
           APS

        -  If patients receiving first-generation APS with good response and no side effects ,
           remain in these

        -  The length of acute treatment is six weeks less

        -  Where there is a risk of increased body weight ( BW) or onset of diabetes mellitus ( DM
           ) as the treatment with atypical APS requires close monitoring and control routine
           Investigations

        -  After the acute phase and high rates of relapse , treatment appropriate to continue for
           12-24 months

        -  If it is determined appropriate treatment discontinuation should be done gradually and
           with close monitoring to identify relapse symptoms

        -  In cases of acute psychotic and / or stimulants patients is necessary rapidly quelled .
           In these cases, the oral preparations are to be preferred . If required injectable
           formulations , the drugs of choice is lorazepam , haloperidol , olanzapine , ziprasidone
           , aripiprazole intramuscular administration.

        -  In each case of using haloperidol appropriate be combined with anticholinergic . Is not
           necessary to monitor the vital signs of the patient.

      Maintenance therapy , relapse prevention

        -  If the patient has benefits the acute phase of a particular FA continue the same

        -  For oral or injectable long-acting antipsychotic used in maintenance therapy

        -  For patients who received first-generation APS who had either reduced efficacy or
           intolerable side effects, the treatment of choice is to switch to oral second
           -generation APS

        -  If patients receiving first-generation APS with good response and no side effects ,
           remain in these

        -  Where there is a risk of increased OR for diabetes or as to the treatment with atypical
           antipsychotics should be closely monitored and Investigations routine check or even
           switch to another atypical or typical APS

        -  If the patient is happy with a VAT does not modify

        -  We prefer monotherapy

        -  The duration of therapy appropriate to be extended by 5.2 years for patients with a
           relapse and more than five years (perhaps lifelong ) for more than one relapse

        -  If the patient has received at least two APS ( including one informal ) for at least 6-8
           weeks each without adequate clinical response , consider the resistant form of the
           disease and the possibility of using clozapine . In some cases it is useful to add a
           second APS to treatment with clozapine

        -  Long-acting APS is an option for the treatment if the patient's wishes or when there are
           issues of adherence to treatment. The long acting formulations should be prescribed to a
           specified limit .

      resistant schizophrenia

        -  Examine possible factors of non-response in FA : dose , duration, compliance , substance
           abuse , physical illness , polypharmacy

        -  If the disease is refractory to treatment with standard APS , the clinician may
           initially tried using informal APS

        -  If the patient has received at least two APS ( including one informal ) for at least 6-8
           weeks each without adequate clinical response , consider the resistant form of the
           disease and the possibility of using clozapine as soon as possible

        -  In some cases it is useful to add a second APS to treatment with clozapine .
