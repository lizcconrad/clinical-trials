  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Obesity is an epidemic in Western society and is the biggest risk factor for insulin
      resistance and type 2 diabetes. The investigators have recently shown that exposure to
      hyperbaric oxygen (HBO) leads to an increase insulin sensitivity in males ubjects and that
      this improvement can be measured in all men, not just those with diabetes. The aim of this
      study is to investigate the time course of this effect and explore the mechanisms involved.
      The investigators suspect that insulin sensitivity as measured by
      hyperinsulinaemic-euglycaemic clamp will be increased within the time-frame of one 2-hour
      hyperbaric oxygen exposure, and that the improvement will be measurable in females as well as
      males.

    <description>Participants will undergo 2 treatments of hyperbaric oxygen. Each treatment consists of 90 minutes compression at 2 atmospheres of pressure, with 30 minutes decompression back to 1 atmosphere. During this time, patients will be treated with 100% oxygen delivered via a hood system.</description>
