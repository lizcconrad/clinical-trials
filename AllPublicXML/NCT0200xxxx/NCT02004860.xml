  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Seborrheic dermatitis is a chronic inflammatory dermatological disease, evolving by relapses,
      affecting mainly the face and scalp. It would be important to have a maintenance treatment
      for severe forms of seborrheic dermatitis witch is both effective and relatively well
      tolerated to reduce the frequency of relapses, prolong remissions obtained after attack
      treatment and reduce the use of topical steroids.
