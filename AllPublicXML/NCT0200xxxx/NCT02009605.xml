      This study is designed to evaluate the efficacy of icotinib at routine dose in previously
      treated non/light-smoking patients with advanced squamous cell lung cancer. An objective
      response (OR) was defined as a patient having a best overall response of either complete
      response (CR) or partial response (PR) according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid
      Tumors, confirmed at least 28 days following the date of the initial response.

    <description>Progression free survival was defined as the time from the date of first dose of study medication to the date of first documentation of tumor progression or death due to any cause, whichever occurred first.</description>

    <measure>Overall survival</measure>
    <time_frame>14 months</time_frame>
    <description>Overall Survival was assessed via calculation of the time to death due to any cause. If a participant was known to have died, the time to death was defined as the time from the date of randomization to the date of death. Otherwise, a participant was censored at the last date they were known to be alive.</description>
