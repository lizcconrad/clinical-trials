  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the pharmacokinetics (blood levels) and
      pharmacodynamics (the action or effects a drug has on the body) of canagliflozin in children
      and adolescents with type 2 diabetes mellitus aged 10 to 17 years (inclusive). Other purposes
      are to investigate safety and assess the ease of swallowing the tablets.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The participants who meet the eligibility criteria, will receive a single dose of placebo (an
      inactive substance that is compared with a drug to test whether the drug has a real effect in
      a clinical trial) and this will be followed by baseline 24 hour pharmacodynamic assessments.
      On the next morning participants will receive the first canagliflozin dose and will be
      discharged home to continue canagliflozin treatment for 13 additional days. There will be 2
      treatment groups (8 participants in each): the first group will receive canagliflozin 100 mg
      daily, the second group will receive either canagliflozin 300 mg or canagliflozin 50 mg
      daily. The canagliflozin dose for the second treatment group will be determined after the
      sponsor has evaluated the results from the first 5 participants. On day 14 of treatment the
      participants will be admitted again for 24 hour pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamics
      assessments. The participants will continue to take their normal dose and schedule of
      metformin during the entire study. The total duration of the study is approximately 50 days.
