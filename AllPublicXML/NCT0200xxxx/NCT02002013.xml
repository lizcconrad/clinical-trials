      Translating reliable evidence on fluid resuscitation of intensive care patients into clinical
      practice - Improving patient outcomes and containing public health costs

      The Fluid-Translation of Research into Practice Study (TRIPS) is an international, single
      day, cross-sectional study planned for the second quarter of 2014, coordinated by the George
      Institute for Global Health, with the purpose of documenting prescribing practices for fluid
      resuscitation in intensive care units (ICUs) worldwide. This international cross-sectional
      study follows on from the publication of large-scale randomized controlled trials and
      meta-analyses of fluid resuscitation, which provide evidence of how fluid resuscitation may
      affect patient-centered outcomes.

      Fluid-TRIPS is a repeat of the Saline versus Albumin for Fluid Evaluation (SAFE)-TRIPS which
      was an international cross-sectional survey conducted in 2007 that had 391 ICU's participate
      from 25 countries and provided insight into international fluid resuscitation practice at
      that time. Along with establishing if fluid resuscitation practices have changed since
      SAFE-TRIPS, Fluid-TRIPS also aims to determine the relationship between fluid choice and
      evidence, along with understand other factors that may influence the choice of bolus fluid in
      clinical practice.
