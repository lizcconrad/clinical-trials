    <textblock>
      This research project has two goals. The first goal is to find one or more questionnaires
      that can accurately identify children who are experiencing high levels of stress or emotional
      health issues during a regular clinic visit. The second goal is to find out whether children
      who are experiencing stress or emotional health problems are able to attend a day camp
      programme and complete activities at home that are designed to help them cope better with
      stress. We also want to find out if the day camp and home activities are helpful.

      This research will investigate the psychological stress experienced by children who have had
      surgery for a complex heart problem. Measures of quality of life among children with heart
      problems indicate that those 8 to 12 years of age have lower quality of life scores than
      younger or older children.

      Children who survive a critical illness requiring a multi-day stay in a pediatric intensive
      care unit are at risk for a variety of psychiatric morbidities. Depression, anxiety and
      post-traumatic stress disorder occur in 7% to 28% of patients.

      A systematic review of psychological adjustment among children with heart problems indicates
      that parent reports (but not child self-reports) are useful in detecting problems with
      psychological adjustment. While parent reports tend to identify increased social and
      behaviour problems, child self-reports indicate more frequent symptoms of depression compared
      to healthy peers.

    <description>Children identified during the screening phase of the project as having elevated, but not clinically defined, levels of psychosocial stress will be invited to participate in the intervention phase of this research if they are between 8 and 11 years of age.
Screening will identify 6 girls and 6 boys eligible and willing to participate in the intervention phase of the project.</description>

    <description>The intervention will be delivered using a day camp structure, on a weekend or during school break in July 2011. Separate interventions will be offered for boys and girls. Each intervention will include two full days (0900 to 1600) of group activities lead by the researchers. Details of the &quot;camp&quot; activities will be developed by the researchers, based on the types of psychosocial stress identified during the screening phase of the project.</description>
