  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the efficacy of different lens treatments (normal
      spectacle lens, ortho-K, &amp; Myovision) on myopia control in Chinese adolescent patients.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Different lens treatments include normal spectacle lens, orthokeratology, and Myovision (a
      specially designed spectacle lens commercially available with peripheral defocus controlled
      as relative myopia).

      This study is to evaluate the efficacy of these three methods in controlling myopia
      progression. Until now, there is no sufficient clinical evidences to compare different lens
      treatments.

    <description>Spherical Equivalent Refraction (SER), which usually changes from time to time, will be measured 3 times by an open field auto-refractometer. The first SER examination was considered as the baseline data, and will be repeated 6 and 12 months later.</description>

    <description>Spectacles are the most common lens treatment to correct myopia. This arm is set to be as a control group for the other two arms. Myopia patients who enter in this group will wear a normal pair of glasses after the baseline examinations (axial length, refraction...).</description>

    <description>Myovision is a kind of specially designed, commercially available spectacle lenses that could control the peripheral refraction of myopia patients. Latest studies have changed the understanding of myopia--correcting both central and peripheral vision during lens treatment is indicating to be an effective way of slowing down eye growth. Patients who entered this group will wear a pair of Myovision after baseline examinations.</description>

    <description>Orthokeratology has recently been reported as an effective way to control eye growth for myopia adolescents. Patents who enter this group will wear ortho-K lenses during sleep after baseline examinations.</description>
