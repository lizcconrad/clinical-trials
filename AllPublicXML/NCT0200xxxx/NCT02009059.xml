  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In pre-hospital care, there are few non-invasive thermometers that are proved both robust and
      accurate. The aim of this study is to investigate the accuracy of a certain ear-canal based
      thermometer on patients undergoing thoracic surgery in deep hypothermia.

      The study is a prospective cohort study on patients undergoing elective thoracic surgery in
      deep hypothermia. The goal is to assess the accuracy of non-invasive temperature devices
      compared to a gold standard representing core temperature.

      At the study hospital, Oslo University Hospital Rikshospitalet, patients undergoing thoracic
      surgery will already have several routes of temperature monitoring as part of standard
      procedure. Before cardiopulmonary bypass bladder temperature is normally used as a reference
      for core temperature. After cardiopulmonary bypass is established, temperature is monitored
      directly in the circulating blood, hence reflecting core temperature.

      For measuring the epitympanic temperature we will use the Metraux Epitympanic Thermometer
      (Walpoth, Galdikas et al. 1994), a nasopharyngeal temperature probe (Mon-a-Therm, General
      Purpose Temperature Probe 12Fr/Ch, Covidien) and a new transcutaneous device (SpotOn 3M). The
      temperature will be measured in degrees Celsius. The first reading will be noted just after
      induction of anaesthesia and compared to the bladder temperature. After cardiopulmonary
      bypass (CPB) is established and therapeutic hypothermia is induced, the values for both
      non-invasive and blood temperature will be recorded every minute. After reaching the target
      temperature according to the blood temperature, we will continue recording the non-invasive
      temperature until relative similarity is established. The process will be repeated during
      re-warming.
