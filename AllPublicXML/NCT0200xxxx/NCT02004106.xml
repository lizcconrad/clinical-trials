  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This open-label, multi-center, dose-escalation study will evaluate the safety,
      pharmacokinetics, and therapeutic activity of RO6895882 in participants with Carcinoembryonic
      Antigen (CEA)-positive solid tumors who have progressed on the standard of care therapy. The
      study will be conducted in 3 parts. Part 1 will be a single ascending dose study in single
      participant cohort at low RO6895882 dose (less than or equal to [&lt;/=] 6 milligrams [mg]).
      Part 2 will be a dose-escalation study of RO6895882 monotherapy given every week (qw), every
      2 weeks (q2w), and possibly every 3 weeks (q3w). Part 3 will be an expansion phase of the qw,
      q2w, and possibly q3w at maximum tolerated dose (MTD) (as determined in Part 2). Part 3 will
      only be conducted if the risk/benefit assessment, as evaluated by the Sponsor and the
      investigators, is in favor of the participants. Participants will be treated until disease
      progression, unacceptable toxicity or withdrawal from treatment for other reasons or death
      for a maximum duration of 24 months.

             standard of care therapy

          -  Locally confirmed CEA expression in tumor tissue (more than [&gt;] 20 percent (%) of
             tumor cells staining with at least moderate intensity) or centrally confirmed CEA
             expression if no archival tumor tissue and fresh biopsy is collected

          -  Radiologically measurable and clinically evaluable disease

          -  Life expectancy of greater than or equal to (&gt;/=) 12 weeks

          -  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status (PS) 0-1

          -  All acute toxic effects of any prior radiotherapy, chemotherapy or surgical procedure
             must have resolved to Grade &lt;/=1, except alopecia (any grade) and Grade 2 peripheral

          -  Participants with Gilbert's syndrome will be eligible for the study. A diagnosis of
             Gilbert's syndrome will be based on the exclusion of other diseases based on the
             following criteria: (i) unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia noted on several occasions;
             (ii) no evidence of hemolysis (normal hemoglobin, reticulocyte count, and Lactate
             dehydrogenase); (iii) normal liver function tests; (iv) absence of other diseases
             associated with unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia
