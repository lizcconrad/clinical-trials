      To assess the feasibility of donor-derived interferon (IFN)-γ positive select-ed
      virus-specific T-cells using the cytokine capture system® (CCS) and the safety of subsequent
      infusion in recipients of hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) with treatment
      refractory post-transplant viral infections. The CCS has already been successfully used in
      clinical studies in Germany and United Kingdom (UK).

    <description>The present study will evaluate and validate in a single-center, open-label, single arm fashion the safety and feasibility of direct infusions of donor-derived pathogen-specific IFN-γ positive T-cells in recipients of HSCT with post-transplant viral infection according to the previously clinically certified CCS® [3-6]. The Investigator will first generate and apply IFN-γ positive selected T-cells to recipients of HSCT with CMV, EBV or adenovirus as previously published. The Investigator aim is to include 6 patients from the University Hospital of Basel.
With confirmed safety the investigator will in the future perform an efficacy study and extend this treat-ment for other clinically relevant pathogens including human herpesvirus (HHV)-6, HHV-8, polyomaviruses JC and BK and fungi including Aspergillus fumigatus and Candida albicans, to other immunosuppressed patients such as solid organ transplant (SOT) recipients.</description>
