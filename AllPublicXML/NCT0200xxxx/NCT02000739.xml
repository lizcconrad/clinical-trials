    <textblock>
      Genetic mutations associated with cancer are being discovered and new treatments are being
      created to treat people whose cancer tumors have certain genetic mutations. Genetic
      sequencing of a tumor can be done, and in this study that information is sent to a company
      called &quot;N-of-One.&quot; They will match each patient's tumor's genetic profile to targeted
      therapies. The targeted therapies may be use of FDA-approved drugs, off-label use of
      FDA-approved drugs, or use of experimental drugs in clinical research studies open at various
      locations in the region.

      The purpose of the study is to compare the length of time it takes for a tumor to grow in
      people who receive the standard treatment for metastatic cancer to the length of time it
      takes for a tumor to grow in people who receive a drug specifically targeted for their
      cancer's genetic mutation.

      Investigators will do a kind of genetic testing called &quot;DNA sequencing&quot;. Everyone who takes
      part in this trial will have genetic testing done on their cancer tumor tissue here at
      Dartmouth. The results of the DNA sequencing will be sent to N-of-One as noted above.

      The treatment participants get will depend on the results of the DNA sequencing and the
      availability of targeted therapies that match the genetic profile of the tumor identified by
      the DNA sequencing.

      If there is no genetic mutation that can be identified with current DNA sequencing,
      participants will receive the standard treatment for metastatic cancer.

      If there is a genetic mutation that can be identified with current DNA sequencing and a drug
      has been developed for this mutation, participants may be able to receive that drug. If there
      is more than one drug available, the participant and his/her oncologist will decide which is
      the best one for the participant.

      Because there are many drugs that may be used in this study, the investigator cannot advise
      in advance whether or not the drug a participant might receive has been approved by the U.S.
      Food and Drug Administration (FDA).

      Treatment with a personalized targeted therapy plan based on cancer genetics will improve
      time to disease progression (TTP) compared to standard therapies.

      By comparing A) a patient's TTP on targeted therapy vs. B) their TTP on their most recent
      prior therapy, investigators will minimize the variability in TTP observed across cancer
      subtypes, and be able to enroll patients with any type of solid tumor in a statistically
      unbiased manner. Based on the literature, investigators expect at least 35% of patients
      treated with a genetically-informed targeted therapy to exhibit a longer progression-free
      interval than would be expected with standard therapies. This &quot;TTP ratio&quot; for each patient is
      calculated using the formula:

      TTP ratio: (TTP on targeted therapy) / (TTP on most recent non-targeted therapy)

      An individual patient's benefit from genetically-informed targeted therapy is defined as a
      TTP ratio ≥ 1.3

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Histologically confirmed metastatic cancer that has progressed by RECIST criteria on
             at least 1 prior therapy in the metastatic setting.

          -  Patients must have not received anti-cancer therapy (i.e., EGFR, BRAF, AR, ER or Her2
             targeted agents , chemotherapy, radiation or surgery) within the last 4 weeks, and
             must have recovered to Grade 2 or better from all treatment-related adverse events.

          -  Karnofsky performance status ≥ 60%

          -  Women should not be lactating or pregnant. If of childbearing age, she must have a

             birth control during the study.

          -  Patient must be mentally competent and provide written informed consent for study
             participation.

          -  Tumor tissue must be obtained through a clinically indicated biopsy or surgical
             procedure, performed as standard-of-care for progression of disease.

          -  Patient must consent to the use of blood, plasma, and tumor tissues for research

             responsible for making every effort to obtain reimbursement and/or find the lowest
             possible cost of drug to minimize out of pocket costs.

             that could interfere with subject's safety, obtaining informed consent or compliance
             to the study.

          -  Any ongoing toxicity from prior anti-cancer therapy that is Grade 3 or higher and /or
             progressing in severity.
