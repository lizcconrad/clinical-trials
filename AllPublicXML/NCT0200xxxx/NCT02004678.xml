    <textblock>
      DS-1150b is being developed by Daiichi Sankyo for the treatment of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus.
      This is a Phase I, single-blind (subjects and principal investigator blinded, Sponsor
      unblinded), placebo‑controlled, randomized, 2‑part, sequential, single ascending dose, single
      center study to assess the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of
      single oral dose of DS‑1150b in healthy subjects and subjects with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus.
