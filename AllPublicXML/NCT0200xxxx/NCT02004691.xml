      Primary Objective:

      The primary objective of this phase 2/3 study is to evaluate the efficacy of olipudase alfa
      (recombinant human acid sphingomyelinase) administered intravenously once every 2 weeks for
      52 weeks in adult patients with acid sphingomyelinase deficiency (ASMD) by assessing changes
      in: 1) spleen volume as measured by abdominal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) (and, for the
      United States [US] only, in association with patient perception related to spleen volume as
      measured by splenomegaly related score [SRS]); and 2) infiltrative lung disease as measured
      by the pulmonary function test, diffusing capacity of the lung for carbon monoxide (DLCO).

      Secondary Objectives:

        -  To confirm the safety of olipudase alfa administered intravenously once every 2 weeks
           for 52 weeks.

        -  To characterize the effect of olipudase alfa on the patient perception related to spleen
           volume as measured by the SRS after 52 weeks of study drug administration. (For the US,
           the effect of olipudase alfa on the splenomegaly related score is part of the primary
           objective).

        -  To characterize the effect of olipudase alfa after 52 weeks of study drug administration
           on the following endpoints assessed sequentially:

        -  The effect of olipudase alfa on liver volume;

        -  The effect of olipudase alfa on platelet count;

        -  The effect of olipudase alfa on fatigue;

        -  The effect of olipudase alfa on pain;

        -  The effect of olipudase alfa on dyspnea.

      The total duration per patient is at least 3 years and up to 5 years and 3 months. This
      includes up to approximately two month of screening, 52 weeks of primary analysis period, up
      to 4 years and 3 months of extension treatment period, an end-of- study visit within 2 weeks
      of the last treatment, and a safety follow-up 30 to 37 days after the last treatment.
