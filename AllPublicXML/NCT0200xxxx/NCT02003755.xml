    <textblock>
      Cerebral palsy (CP) is a group of disorders of the development of movement and posture but
      often changing motor impairment syndromes. The spastic subtypes are the most common
      manifestations of cerebral palsy who perform movement difficultly due to hypertonia. Decease
      of spinal cord pathway, hyperactivity of alpha and gamma motoneuron and reduction of
      presynaptic inhibition may cause tendon reflex increase and hypertonia in individuals with
      CP. There are many ways to improve the hypertonia. In the past studies, the fast repeated
      range of motion could reduce muscle's activation effectively. The polyarticular movement
      training might increase joint range of motion and reduce the muscle activation. But the
      polyarticular movement training is difficulty for some individuals with CP. The single joint
      movement training may achieve the same effect as the polyarticular movement training. The
      purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of continuation passive range of motion
      (CPM) training whether could get the improvement of soleus hypertonia in individuals with CP.
