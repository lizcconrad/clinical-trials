  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Previous research has suggested central nervous system inflammatory activity to be critically
      involved in disease development and progression in schizophrenia, with a complex interplay of
      inflammatory mechanisms leading to the development of brain abnormalities and medical
      symptoms related to schizophrenia. However, the mutual interactions of different inflammatory
      pathways and their relation to disease course have not been sufficiently studied. This study
      therefore aims to explore the interaction of neuroinflammatory mechanisms in patients with
      schizophrenia and to assess whether the inflammatory activity in schizophrenia is
      state-dependent and occurs mainly during psychotic episodes.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Be a man or woman between 18 and 40 years of age, inclusive.

          -  Have signed an informed consent document indicating that they understand the purpose
             of and procedures required for the study and are willing to participate in this study.

          -  Be medically stable on the basis of physical examination and vital signs performed at
             Screening.

          -  Be medically stable on the basis of clinical laboratory tests performed at Screening.
             If the results of the serum chemistry panel, hematology, or urinalysis are outside the
             normal reference ranges, the subject may be included only if the investigator judges
             the abnormalities or deviations from normal to be not clinically significant or to be
             appropriate and reasonable for the population under study.

          -  Be willing and able to adhere to the prohibitions and restrictions specified in the
             protocol.

        Schizophrenia subjects:
