  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It is known that the care that is offered to overweigh of class I obese people leads to an
      initial weight loss.

      However, after 12 months, people start to gain their weight back. French National Authority
      for Health suggests that physicians warn their patients against restrictive diets that can
      are the origin of weight's fluctuation can be health threatening. This weight regain is
      linked to numerous factors, mainly dietary compensation phenomenon tied to cravings (Lecerf,
      2013. Obésité : pourquoi les regimes échouent-ils ? Nutr Clin Metab (in press)).

      Due to the difficulties to keep the weight loss, it seems interesting to consider
      alternatives like reflexotherapy. This method seems to act in reducing the dietary urges
      causes by stress, by cravings or by frustration.

      This technique would allow to re-establish normal hormones' or neurotransmitters'
      concentrations mainly involved in the food intake.

      This could be a complementary response to the limits of the classic treatments for weight
      maintenance management, but it needs to be confirmed by a specific study.
