    <textblock>
      The MERCURY Study demonstrated the accuracy, feasibility and reproducibility of Magnetic
      Resonance Imaging (MRI) to stage rectal cancer in a prospective, multidisciplinary,
      multi-centre study. However, there were differences in patient outcome, dependent upon the
      position of the tumour in the rectum and its height above the anal verge. Whilst the outcome
      was excellent for patients who underwent an anterior resection, the outcome, based upon
      margin involvement and quality of the specimen, was poor for patients who underwent an
      abdomino-perineal excision for low rectal cancer.

      It is proposed that accurate MRI staging pre-operatively will allow the correct patients to
      receive neo-adjuvant chemoradiotherapy (CRT), and also pre-warn the surgeons if the resection
      margins appear threatened so that the operation can be modified to take this into account.
      The primary aims of the Low Rectal Cancer Study (MERCURY II) are to assess the rate of CRM
      positivity rate in low rectal cancer and to assess the difference in global quality of life
      at two years post surgery in patients according to plane of surgery with or without sphincter
      preservation.

      The aim of this study is to reduce the positive margin rate of 30% to around 15%. The study
      is an international multicentre, prospective, observational study, whereby patients with
      biopsy-proven low-rectal cancer (lower edge of the tumour &lt; 6cms from the anal verge on MRI),
      will be recruited from participating centres, having given informed, written consent. Data
      from the radiology, surgical and pathological aspects will be collected and analysed
      centrally at the Royal Marsden Hospital. The patient's medical records will be reviewed for
      five years post surgery, and the patients will also be followed up by quality of life
      questionnaires. This project aims to show that in low rectal cancer, improved local control
      and survival can be achieved through a reduction in the involved CRM rates by MRI-planned
      surgery and selective pre-operative therapy. It also aims to assess the ability to predict
      disease recurrence and to provide an assessment of disease-free survival and overall
      survival.
