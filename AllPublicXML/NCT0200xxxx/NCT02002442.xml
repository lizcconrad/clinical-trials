      The primary aim of this study is to evaluate and compare the efficacy of a 60 second rinse
      with chlorhexidine, essential oil-based mouthwash, cetylpyridinium chloride mouthwash, or
      saline solution on bacterial contamination in the buccal vestibule when used preoperatively
      using the real-time Polymerase Chain Reaction (qPCR).

      We hypothesize that preoperative rinse with chlorhexidine mouthwash will result in greater
      reduction of bacterial counts than with essential oil-based, cetylpyridinium chloride, or
      saline mouthwashes.

      The secondary aim of this study is to evaluate the effect of the tested mouthwashes in
      reducing the bacterial counts over time.

      We hypothesize that preoperative rinse with chlorhexidine mouthwash will result in a
      reduction of bacterial counts for longer duration than with essential oil-based,
      cetylpyridinium chloride, or saline mouthwashes.

    <description>An investigator will give the patient the assigned mouthwash based on the randomized group allocation. 30ml of the mouthwash will be given to the subject in a sterilized calibrated tube. The subject will be asked to rinse for 60 seconds. Then, the patient will spit the mouthwash.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patient who is treatment planned for dental implant placement and qualifies for dental
             implant placement according to the standards of care in the Department of
             Periodontology at Tufts University School of Dental Medicine.

          -  Aged 18 years and above.

          -  Partially edentulous.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Antibiotic therapy within 2 weeks of the study.

          -  Active infection in the oral cavity.

          -  Known allergy to any of the agents used in the study.

          -  Self-reported pregnancy (as the surgical procedure of dental implant placement is
             elective and typically deferred until after the delivery).

          -  Fully edentulous.

          -  Patient with severe periodontitis (Clinical attachment loss of 5mm or more in the
             majority of intraoral sites).

          -  Regular use of mouthwashes (once/day).
