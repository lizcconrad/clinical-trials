  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the association between the Independent
      Activities of Daily Living (I-ADL) component of the Comprehensive Geriatric Assessment (CGA)
      and poor tolerance to radiation treatment in older and younger patients with non-ovarian
      gynecological cancers.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There are little data regarding the impact of functional age on tolerance to radiotherapy for
      gynecologic cancers. A comprehensive geriatric assessment (CGA) tool which measures
      functional status (including the Instrumental Activities of Daily Living (I-ADL)), among many
      other important geriatric related conditions, was developed by Hurria and colleagues.
      Geriatric assessment variables including functional status predicted for toxicity in older
      patients receiving chemotherapy and surgery for multiple cancer types., 2 We hypothesize that
      I-ADL can be used to predict treatment tolerance in patients of all ages receiving pelvic
      and/or paraaortic region radiation therapy for gynecologic malignancies.

Hospitalization secondary to treatment related toxicity during or up to 4-8 weeks post radiation therapy.
Unplanned dose reductions in either radiation or concurrent chemotherapy secondary to treatment related toxicity during radiation therapy
Unplanned change in concurrent chemotherapy regimen secondary to treatment related toxicity during radiation therapy.</description>
