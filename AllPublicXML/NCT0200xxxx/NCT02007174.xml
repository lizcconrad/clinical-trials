  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Blockade of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) with bevacizumab has been used to treat
      abnormal vascular conditions of the anterior segment of the eye. In pterygium, anti-VEGF
      agents have been recently proposed as primary treatments, such as perioperative adjuvants, as
      well as treatments for pterygia recurrences after surgery. The aim of the present study was
      to prospectively evaluate the effect of three subconjunctival bevacizumab injections in
      patients with an early pterygium recurrence. Materials and Methods: The current study was a
      non-randomized single central trial. The method of ensuring allocation concealment was
      sequentially numbered. Patients with an early pterygium recurrence were selected and invited
      to participate in the study. Recurrence was defined as the presence of corneal vessels with
      concomitant conjunctival hyperemia within the first trimester after primary pterygium
      removal, and only patients with primary pterygium recurrence were included. Patient related
      factors such as pregnancy, women seeking to become pregnant, and lactating women were
      excluded from the study. All patients received three subconjunctival bevacizumab (2.5 mg/0.05
      ml) injections (basal, 2 and 4 weeks) in the recurrence area of the pterygium, and were
      photographed at the third, sixth and twelfth months after the last bevacizumab injection.
      Photographic analyses were performed taking into account two pterygium areas: the first
      measure included only the vessel area in the corneal surface, while the second measure
      included, both, conjunctival and corneal vessel area (corneal-conjunctival area of
      hyperemia). Neovascularization area of each pterygium was determined using digital slit lam
      pictures, which were analyzed using Photoshop CS4, in order to get pixels measurements of the
      lesion.

    <description>Measurements were performed according to Welch et al. modified technique as following: the distance in millimeters from the limbus to the apex of the lesion on the cornea (horizontal length) was performed using the slit-lamp beam (BQ 900, Haag-Streit, Koeniz, Switzerland). A standard magnification of 16 was used and the variable aperture was focused from the limbus to the apex.</description>

    <time_frame>One year</time_frame>
    <description>The frequency of symptoms (redness, watery eyes, itching, burning, foreign body sensation, and fluctuating vision) were evaluated according to Nava-Castañeda et al Questionnaire (2003). Symptoms were graded as follows: 0, never; 1, rarely (once a week); 2, occasionally (several times a week); 3, frequently (once a day); 4, usually (several times a day); and 5, continually (every hour of the day). In addition, the severity of these signs/sympots were scored at each visit on a scale of 0 to 3, with 0 representing the absence of the symptom, 1 mild, 2 moderate, and 3 severe. A total symptoms score, which is a measure of the overall severity of the patients,s conjunctival condition, was calculated by multiplying (for each individual symptom/condition) the numerical values corresponding to frequency and severity, and then adding the products for all symptoms.</description>

    <description>In order to reduce the patient bias, the control eye received a sham laser treatment, under slit lamp, topical anesthesia using 0.5% tetracaine hydrochloride eye drops (Ponti-Ofteno, Laboratorios Sophia, Jalisco, Mexico) and topical 1 mg fluorescein Sodium staining (Bio-Glo, Hub Pharmaceuticals, Rancho Cucamonga CA). Post sham laser care treatment included topical eyedrops of 0.3% tobramycin and 0.1% dexamethasone (Trazidex, Laboratorios Sophia) three times daily, and 0.5 carboxymethylcellulose lubricating eye drops (Refresh-Tears, Allergan, Irving, California, USA). Topical antibiotics and corticosteroids were tapered and discontinued after two weeks.</description>

    <description>Argon laser therapies were performed on an outpatient basis only by one ophthalmologist. Under slit lamp, topical anesthesia using 0.5% tetracaine hydrochloride eye drops (Ponti-Ofteno, Laboratorios Sophia, Jalisco, Mex) and topical 1 mg fluorescein Sodium staining (Bio-Glo, Hub Pharmaceuticals, Rancho Cucamonga CA) was applied. Argon laser was applied along the vessels of the pterygium apex with power between 450mW to 780 mW, spot size of 100 u with 10 milliseconds duration. Additional grill pattern treatment was given to pterygium body using a 200 microns spot size. Treatments were given in one only session.
