    <textblock>
      Irritable Bowel Syndrome(IBS) is a chronic relapsing disorder with unknown etiology
      characterized by abdominal pain and bowel habit changes without an organic pathology.
      Pathophysiology is not fully understood, bacterial overgrowth is one of the reasons. Because
      of that, use of drugs effective on the gut flora has been raised; Rifaximin is one of them.
      This study investigated the effectiveness of Rifaximin on IBS.

      This randomized, double-blinded, controlled study began with 500 patients(144 of them removed
      because of incompliance). Patients those without organic bowel pathology and whom meet the
      Rome-III criteria, aged between 19-50 yo were enrolled in the study. Patients with known
      Rifaximin allergy, lactose intolerance, and those having treated for IBS whit in last 1 month
      as well as those with alarm symptoms (melena, fever, weight loss, anemia, rectal bleeding)
      were excluded. After routine biochemistry, blood count, and stool tests, Rifaximin tablet was
      given to a group as 1200 mg. daily in 3 divided doses, placebo tablet was given to another
      group in same doses for 10 days. Improvement in symptoms were scored and recorded on 10.day,
      3. and 6.week. In addition to descriptive statistical methods(mean±SD), Student's-T and
      Mann-Whitney U-tests were used for comparison of quantitative data, chi-square and McNemar
      tests were used for comparison of qualitative data. Significance was accepted if p &lt;0.05.
