    <textblock>
      Stroke is one of the main severe disease of public health importance. Increasing evidence
      suggests that inflammatory mechanisms plays a significant role in stroke. So, immune targets
      are supposed to be an effective one. The sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor regulator
      Fingolimod(FTY720)is an effective immunology modulator which has been widely used in
      autoimmune disease and has been testified effective on stoke animal models.

      This study will enroll 87 stroke patients who have been diagnosed with stroke and meet the
      inclusion criteria.

      After successfully meeting initial screening criteria, investigators will contact the family,
      explain the study, and send a consent form for their review.

      After that, patients will be given 0.5mg/day oral fingolimod over a course of 3 consecutive
      days , then investigators will make a neurofunctional assessment before and 7days, 30 days
      and 90days after oral fingolimod. And Magnetic Resonance of the brain before, 7days, 14days
      and 90days after oral fingolimod. Furthermore 5ml intravenous blood for flow cytometry is
      also taken before and 1day,3days,7days after fingolimod use.
