  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well anti-cluster of differentiation (CD)19 monoclonal
      antibody MOR00208 and lenalidomide work in treating patients with relapsed, refractory, or
      previously untreated chronic lymphocytic leukemia, small lymphocytic lymphoma, or
      prolymphocytic leukemia. Monoclonal antibodies, such as anti-CD19 monoclonal antibody
      MOR00208, can block cancer growth in different ways. Some block the ability of cancer to grow
      and spread. Others find cancer cells and help kill them or carry cancer-killing substances to
      them. Biological therapies, such as lenalidomide, may stimulate the immune system in
      different ways and stop cancer cells from growing. Giving anti-CD19 monoclonal antibody
      MOR00208 and lenalidomide may kill more cancer cells.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the overall response rate (ORR) at 6 months for patients with relapsed or
      refractory chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL)/small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL)/prolymphocytic
      leukemia (PLL) treated with the combination of MOR00208 plus lenalidomide.

      II. To determine the overall response rate (ORR) at 6 months for patients with
      treatment-naive CLL/SLL/PLL treated with the combination of MOR00208 plus lenalidomide.

      III.To obtain preliminary data on toxicity profiles and efficacy with the combination of
      MOR00208 plus lenalidomide in patients with Richter's Transformation IV. To obtain
      preliminary data on efficacy of MOR00208 in patients with progressive disease on ibrutinib
      monotherapy

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the overall response rate (ORR) at 12 months for patients with untreated
      CLL/SLL/PLL or relapsed/refractory disease treated with the combination of MOR00208 plus
      lenalidomide.

      II. To determine the complete response (CR) rate, nodular partial response (nPR) rate,
      partial response (PR) rate, and stable disease (SD) rate for patients with untreated
      CLL/SLL/PLL or relapsed or refractory disease treated with the combination of MOR00208 plus
      lenalidomide.

      III. To summarize the progression free survival (PFS), time to next treatment, and overall
      survival (OS) for each of two cohorts of patients treated with this regimen.

      IV. To evaluate toxicity with this regimen, including frequency and severity of toxicities,
      dose reduction requirements, and adverse events requiring drug discontinuation.

      V. To perform baseline analysis of patients enrolled on this trial including fluorescence in
      situ hybridization (FISH), stimulated karyotype, zeta-chain-associated protein kinase 70
      (Zap-70) methylation, and immunoglobulin variable region heavy chain (IgVH) mutational status
      and describe relationships between these biomarkers and ORR or PFS for each of two cohorts
      with this regimen.

      VI. To determine the effect of this regimen on total immunoglobulins, CD4+ and CD8+ T cells,
      natural killer (NK) cells, and interleukin-21 receptor (IL-21R) expression on CLL cells.

      VII. To determine whether NK cells and T cells are activated in response to MOR00208 alone or
      in combination with lenalidomide.

      VIII. To estimate the rate of minimal residual disease (MRD) in patients achieving CR, and
      whether this correlates with PFS.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive anti-CD19 monoclonal antibody MOR00208 intravenously (IV) over 2 hours on
      day 1 (days 1, 2, 8, 15, and 22 of course 1) and lenalidomide orally (PO) daily on days 1-28
      (days 9-28 of course 1). Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 12 courses in the absence
      of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

             immunoglobulin (IVIG) may have false positive hepatitis serologies; patients who are
             on IVIG who have positive hepatitis serologies must have a negative hepatitis B
             deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) to be eligible

          -  Patients with a history of prior malignancy other than CLL that requires active
             systemic therapy that will interfere with interpretation of efficacy or toxicity, or
             limit survival to 2 years; patients with basal or squamous skin carcinoma, cervical
             carcinoma in situ on biopsy, localized breast cancer requiring hormonal therapy or
             localized prostate cancer (Gleason score &lt; 5) are eligible

          -  Patients with substance abuse or other medical or psychiatric conditions that, in the
