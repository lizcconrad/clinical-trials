    <textblock>
      The DeFRA questionnaire is a new validated algorithm derived from FRAX. Here we use the DeFRA
      as a &quot;primary anamnestic from&quot; to identify subjects at risk of osteoporosis in a population
      never screened before and never treated for this disease.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There is an increasing recognition that the management of osteoporosis requires the
      characterization of fracture risk to be based on absolute risk rather than single measures
      such as bone mineral density (BMD). However, the threshold for pharmacological intervention
      for osteoporosis remains controversial.

      The aim of the present project is to perform a large scale study to identify subjects at risk
      of osteoporosis by administering the DeFRA questionnaire in a population never screened or
      treated before for osteoporosis.

      DeFRA questionnaire will be administered before and after DEXA scanning, to further validate
      the questionnaire and to highlight the predictive value of this protocol as a tool to screen
      the general population.
