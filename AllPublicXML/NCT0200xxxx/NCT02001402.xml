    <textblock>
      As we all know,hormone replacement therapy (HRT) is the main therapy to climacteric
      symptoms.But HRT has also some disadvantages including breast cancer,cardiovascular disease
      and so on, especially long period of HRT. It makes us to find the non-hormone therapy. So we
      want to investigate the exercise on the effect of climacteric symptoms.Doing exercise is
      helpful for avoiding and treating many disease,including climacteric symptoms.In our previous
      research,we found that playing exercise can treat moderate climacteric symptoms.

        About 2000 nurese aged 40-55 living in peking will be investigated.We will measure the
        symptoms of perimenopausal syndrome by kupperman index、HRQOL（health -related quality of
        life) to evaluate the severity of menopausal syndrome and quality of life.We choose nurses
        whose KMI is above 15 and divided them into intervention group and control group.In
