  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the effect of Avastin (15mg/kg iv) in combination with Docetaxel and
      Xeloda, given as pre-operative therapy to patients with primary breast cancer. Avastin will
      be administered every 3 weeks, for the first 5 cycles of chemotherapy. The anticipated time
      on study treatment is 3-12 months.

    <time_frame>Baseline, 20-24 weeks (final surgery, performed 2 to 4 weeks after the last chemotherapy cycle [Week 18])</time_frame>
    <description>Percentage of participants with pCR plus the percentage of participants without pCR who achieved CR or PR as measured by the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) criteria. CR was defined as complete disappearance of all target lesions and non-target disease, with the exception of nodal disease. All nodes, both target and non-target, must have decreased to normal (short axis less than [&lt;] 10 millimeters [mm]). No new lesions. PR was defined as greater than or equal to (≥) 30 percent (%) decrease under baseline of the sum of diameters of all target lesions. The short axis was used in the sum for target nodes, while the longest diameter was used in the sum for all other target lesions. No unequivocal progression of non-target disease. No new lesions.</description>
