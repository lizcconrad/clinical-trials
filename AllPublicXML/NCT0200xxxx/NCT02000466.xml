  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this pregnancy registry study is to detect and describe any abnormal pregnancy
      outcomes in women intentionally or unintentionally vaccinated with FluLaval Quadrivalent. The
      Registry requires voluntary, prospective reporting of eligible pregnancies by patients and
      health care providers (HCPs). Data such as vaccination with FluLaval Quadrivalent during
      pregnancy or within 28 days preceding conception, potential confounding factors (such as
      exposure to other medications) and information related to the outcome of the pregnancy will
      be collected prospectively.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Some pregnancy exposures may be reported after pregnancy outcome has been identified
      (retrospective reports). The Registry will capture retrospective reports, but these reports
      will not be included in the analyses of prospective reports.

      Pregnancy outcome data will be collected using questionnaires within 3 months of the
      estimated date of delivery (EDD) and approximately 6 months and 12 months after the EDD from
      30 November 2013 to 31 May 2018.

        Pregnant women, residing in the US, exposed to FluLaval Quadrivalent and who are
        volunteering to take part in the Pregnancy Registry before the outcome of the pregnancy is
        known.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        A subject will be included in the Registry if all of the following criteria are met:

          -  Exposure to vaccine occurs during pregnancy or within 28 days preceding conception.

          -  Subject is a US resident.

          -  A HCP is identified (name, address and phone number).

          -  Subject can be identified (by GSK or HCP).

        Data from registered subjects will be included in the analyses if the following criterion
        is met:

        • Pregnancy is ongoing and the outcome is unknown.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Data from registered subjects will not be included in the analyses if the following
        criterion is met:

        • Outcome of pregnancy is known at the time of initial report. Types of known outcomes
        include prenatal testing reports in which the results are abnormal or outside the reference
        range, indicating possible abnormality in the fetus. Pregnancies in which prenatal testing
        indicates a normal pregnancy would also be excluded because inclusion of such pregnancies
        could potentially bias results toward a lower overall estimate of risk for defects.
        Typically pregnancies &gt; 16 weeks gestation will have undergone prenatal testing that can
        identify whether a child has congenital abnormalities.
