  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test whether VLY-686 can reduce chronic pruritus in subjects
      with treatment-resistant pruritus associated with atopic dermatitis in comparison with
      placebo.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study to be conducted at two sites in
      Germany. Sixty-eight (68) subjects with chronic pruritus associated with atopic dermatitis,
      will be randomized to either the placebo group or the active treatment group with VLY-686.
      The study is divided into three phases: the screening phase, the evaluation phase, and the
      post-therapy follow-up phase. The screening phase comprises a screening visit when subjects'
      preliminary eligibility for the study will be evaluated and a wash-out period when subjects
      will stop use of any current topical or systemic treatment. The evaluation period comprises 4
      weeks of randomized double-blind treatment. The post-therapy follow-up period consists of a
      wash-out followed by a clinic visit for safety assessments and to check for residual efficacy
      of the treatment.
