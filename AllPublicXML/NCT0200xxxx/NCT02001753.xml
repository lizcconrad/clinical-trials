  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Magnetic resonance (MR) imaging is a widely used and well-established noninvasive medical
      diagnostic imaging tool. By using a static and a gradient magnetic field in combination with
      a radiofrequency field (RF), MR provides excellent contrast among different tissues of the
      body. Although long-term effects on human health from exposure to strong static magnetic
      fields seem unlikely, acute effects such as vertigo, nausea, change in blood pressure,
      reversible arrhythmia, and neurobehavioural effects have been documented from occupational
      exposition to 1.5 T. Cardiac MR (CMR) imaging requires some of the strongest and fastest
      switching electromagnetic gradients available in MR exposing the patients to the highest
      administered energy levels accepted by the controlling authorities. Studies focusing on
      experimental teratogenic or carcinogenic effects of MR revealed conflicting results. Since
      CMR is emerging as one of the fastest growing new fields of broad MR application, it is of
      particular concern that a recent in vitro study with CMR sequences has reported on
      CMR-induced DNA damages in white blood cells up to 24 h after exposure to 1.5 T CMR.
      Therefore, we hypothesized that CMR can induce the damage of endothelium and endothelial
      progenitor cells in type 2 diabetes
