      Background and Purpose: Fitness is the foundation for health and quality of life for
      individuals. Recent changes in lifestyle and eating habit in Taiwan have significantly
      increased the prevalence of metabolic syndrome that may lead to poor fitness and subsequent
      coronary artery disease, cardiovascular disease and diabetes. Although workers at the
      National Taiwan University Hospital (NTUH) have undertaken regular health fitness
      examination, the examination did not include the posture and movement analysis and no
      exercise intervention was provided to those with metabolic syndrome. This study is therefore
      aimed to conduct comprehensive health fitness examination for workers at NTUH and to examine
      whether exercise intervention could decrease the risk factors and enhance fitness in those at
      risk or with metabolic syndrome. Methods: This study will consist of two parts. In the first
      part, 1102 workers at NTUH will be administered comprehensive fitness examination (body mass
      index, waist circumference, muscle strength, flexibility, balance, cardiopulmonary test, and
      posture and movement analysis) and will be assessed with the Physical Activity Readiness and
      the Perceived Musculoskeletal Pain Scale and the International Physical Activity
      Questionnaire. Those workers who are at risk or have metabolic syndrome (N=240) will be
      assigned into the control, home-based exercise, and intensive exercise group with 80 in each
      group with their will. The home-based exercise group will receive exercise instruction
      biweekly for three months; the intensive exercise group will receive moderate aerobic
      exercise and strengthening exercise three times a week for three months. The other workers
      who are insufficient fitness status (N=240) will be assigned into the control, home-based
      exercise, and intensive exercise group with their will. The home-based exercise group will
      receive exercise instruction biweekly for a month; the intensive exercise group with 80 in
      each group will receive moderate aerobic exercise and strengthening exercise three times a
      week for a month. Descriptive statistics will be used to estimate the prevalence of 1, 2 and
      ≧3 metabolic risk factors, and poor fitness. One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) will be
      used to examine the relation between metabolic syndrome risk factors and fitness. One-way
      ANOVA will be used to compare the demographic characteristics of the control, home-based
      exercise, and intensive exercise group. Two-way ANOVA repeated measures will be used to
      examine the metabolic syndrome risk factors and fitness in the three groups across time.
      Clinical relevance: Our results will help understand the health fitness of workers at NTUH
      and will assist in establishing effective exercise program for those at risk or with
      metabolic syndrome.

    <description>posture and movement analysis Posture is more than how subject look when sitting or standing. Good posture is defined as the ideal spine alignment and body positioning that puts the least strain on the body. Good posture distribute weight and forces evenly so that no one body region is overstressed. Good posture reduces the stress on joints, protects the ligaments supporting the spine, and allows muscles to work efficiently to reduce fatigue. Bad posture puts abnormal stress on the spine and can cause premature development of conditions such as spine arthritis and degenerative disc disease. Good posture put the weight line straight along ear, acromial and great trochanter.</description>
