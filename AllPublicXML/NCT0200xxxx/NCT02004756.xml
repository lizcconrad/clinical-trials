      Primary Objective: To determine if impairments in cardiac and musculoskeletal function and
      metabolism exist in Fontan children.

      Secondary Objectives:

        1. To determine if impairments do exist, are they related to exercise capacity.

        2. To determine if a 12-week exercise training intervention improves cardiac and/or
           musculoskeletal metabolism.

      Hypothesis: The investigators hypothesize that abnormalities in cardiac and skeletal function
      are evident, influence exercise capacity, and can be improved with exercise training.

      This proposed research provides an interdisciplinary approach to understanding exercise
      intolerance by examining cardiac and musculoskeletal metabolism in a unique cohort of
      children with congenital heart disease. Study findings may more importantly lead to
      evidence-based exercise interventions that promote improvements in overall physical health,
      quality of life, and functional status for Fontan children. Furthermore, this pilot study
      will lead to the development of a novel research protocol which may be applied to larger
      Fontan and other congenital heart disease cohorts. This study will also provide preliminary
      data to develop and conduct a larger clinical research project.

    <description>Blood oxygen level dependent functional magnetic resonance imaging (BOLD fMRI), and 31P-MRS will allow for the precise measurement of cardiac and musculoskeletal function, circulatory perfusion and vascular reactivity, and aerobic and anaerobic metabolism, respectively. Cardiac function will be examined via MRI and exercise echocardiography.</description>

    <description>The Fontan cohort will subsequently complete a 12-week moderate intensity exercise intervention whereby individualized activity-based home interventions will be prescribed (i.e., sample activities: walking, jogging, swimming, cycling, soccer). More specifically, individualized weekly exercise programs for participants will be provided incorporating two specific exercise components.</description>
