      To investigate whether instantaneous wave-Free Ratio(iFR)/Fractional Flow Reserve(FFR) guided
      treatment strategy makes the postulated treatment strategy by Coronary Angiogram(CAG) guide
      change and to analyze the cost-effectiveness of its dual diagnosis.

      To investigate difference between SYNTAX score evaluated CAG and functional SYNTAX score
      evaluated physiological assessment of coronary stenosis and its clinical effectiveness.
