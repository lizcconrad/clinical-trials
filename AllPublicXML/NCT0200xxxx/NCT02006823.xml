  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will explore ways to improve the effectiveness of patient Self Management at a
      time when genetic test results guide new treatments that will dramatically increase the
      possibility of cure of the hepatitis C virus.The study will also focus on the interactions
      between provider and patients and the ways that technical work, adaptive work and adaptive
      leadership foster patient self-management.This proposed 2 year exploratory mixed-methods 12
      longitudinal case study will explore patients' and providers' explanations for how and why
      they engage in technical work, adaptive work, and adaptive leadership and the ways in which
      these strategies promote or pose barriers to patients' self-management of Chronic Hepatitis C
      in the context of the new genetic test results and treatments. Specific aims are to:

      1: Examine how technical work, adaptive work and adaptive leadership influence patients'
      perceptions of their likelihood of cure and how this work relates to self-management during
      12 to 24 weeks of treatment for Chronic Hepatitis C. Research questions are: 1.1) How do
      patients describe their interactions with the providers? 1.2) How do these interactions shape
      patients' perceptions of the likelihood of cure? 1.3) How do patients' understanding of their
      interactions with the provider promote the use of or pose barriers to self-management during
      treatment?

      AIM 2: Describe providers' use of technical work, and adaptive leadership approaches during
      clinical encounters,to include nurse education visits. Research questions are:

      2.1) What technical work, and adaptive leadership approaches do providers use when sharing
      treatment information with patients during the clinical encounters. 2.2) What explanations do
      providers give for how and why they use technical work and adaptive leadership approaches?
      AIM 3: Describe the trajectories of illness perceptions(Control/Cure sub-scale - Illness
      Perception Scale), symptoms (M.D. Anderson Symptom Inventory) , viral load, and
      self-management (Patient Activation Measure) in relation to patient and provider reports of
      technical work, adaptive work, and adaptive leadership from the index clinical encounter to
      the follow-up treatment response encounter (ranging from 12 to 24 weeks).

    <description>Self Management as measured by the Patient Activation Measure which is an measure of their responses. The study team will plot a trajectory line using the Patient Activation Measure across all time points. The team is interested in knowing if this measure changes based on the patients self-management and his/her interaction with the health care provider.</description>
