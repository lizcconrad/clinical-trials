  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed to define dose-limiting toxicity and determine preliminary evidence of
      efficacy of Carfilzomib (CFZ) in combination with bendamustine and dexamethasone for patients
      with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma (MM).

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Multiple myeloma (MM) is a malignant plasma cell disorder resulting in approximately 11,000
      deaths in the United States each year. It is estimated that between 60,000-80,000 people are
      currently under treatment for refractory or relapsed MM. Prognosis and survival have improved
      over the last 20 years, but the disease is still universally fatal despite efforts to develop
      new and more effective chemotherapeutic regimens. Therefore, new regimens need to be
      developed for patients prior to peripheral blood stem cell transplant and for those unable to
      tolerate the toxicity of transplant.

    <description>Subjects will receive Carfilzomib on Days 1, 2, 8, 9, 15, and 16 every 28 days with dose escalation from 27, 36, 45 to 56 mg/ m2 .

Bendamustine will be given IV on days 1 and 2 with dose escalation up to 90 mg/m2 and dexamethasone 20 mg orally or intravenously on 1, 2, 8, 9, 15, 16, 22 and 23 of each 28-day cycle. Study treatment will be given until 8 cycles of treatment are completed or until disease progression, whichever comes first.</description>

             including hypersensitivity to all anticoagulation and antiplatelet options, antiviral
             drugs, or intolerance to hydration due to preexisting pulmonary or cardiac impairment.
