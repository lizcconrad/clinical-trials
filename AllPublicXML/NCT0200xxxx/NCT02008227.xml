  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This global, multicenter, open-label, randomized, controlled study will evaluate the efficacy
      and safety of atezolizumab (an anti-programmed death−ligand 1 [anti-PD-L1] antibody)compared
      with docetaxel in participants with locally advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer
      (NSCLC) after failure with platinum-containing chemotherapy. Participants will be randomized
      1:1 to receive either docetaxel or atezolizumab. Treatment may continue as long as
      participants are experiencing clinical benefit as assessed by the investigator, i.e., in the
      absence of unacceptable toxicity or symptomatic deterioration attributed to disease
      progression.

    <description>TTD in patient-reported lung cancer symptoms (pain in chest or in arm/shoulder, dyspnea, or cough) was a composite endpoint defined as the time from randomization to the earliest time the participant's scale scores showed a 10 point or greater increase after baseline in any of the symptoms. A &gt;/=10-point change in the score perceived by participants was considered as clinically significant. The QLQ-LC13 consisted of 1 multi-item scale and 9 single items that assessed the specific symptoms (dyspnea, cough, hemoptysis, and site specific pain), side effects (sore mouth, dysphagia, neuropathy, and alopecia), and pain medication use of lung cancer participants receiving chemotherapy. Scale score range: 0 to 100. Higher symptom score = greater degree of symptom severity.</description>

          <description>OS duration is defined as the difference in time from the date of randomization to the date of death due to any cause. Data for participants who were not reported as having died at the time of analysis were censored at the date they were last known to be alive. Participants who had no post-baseline information were censored at the date of randomization plus 1 day. OS was estimated using KM methodology.</description>

        <description>TTD in patient-reported lung cancer symptoms (pain in chest or in arm/shoulder, dyspnea, or cough) was a composite endpoint defined as the time from randomization to the earliest time the participant’s scale scores showed a 10 point or greater increase after baseline in any of the symptoms. A &gt;/=10-point change in the score perceived by participants was considered as clinically significant. The QLQ-LC13 consisted of 1 multi-item scale and 9 single items that assessed the specific symptoms (dyspnea, cough, hemoptysis, and site specific pain), side effects (sore mouth, dysphagia, neuropathy, and alopecia), and pain medication use of lung cancer participants receiving chemotherapy. Scale score range: 0 to 100. Higher symptom score = greater degree of symptom severity.</description>

        <title>EORTC QLQ Core 30 (C30) Questionnaire Score: Single Items</title>
        <description>EORTC QLQ-C30 included global health status (GHS)/quality of life (QOL), functional scales (physical, role, cognitive, emotional, social), symptom scales (fatigue, pain, nausea/vomiting), and single items (dyspnea, appetite loss, insomnia, constipation, diarrhea, financial difficulties). Most questions from QLQ-C30 were a 4-point scale (1/Not at All to 4/Very Much), except Items 29-30, which comprise GHS scale and were a 7-point scale (1/Very Poor to 7/Excellent). For this instrument, GHS/QOL and functional scales were linearly transformed so each score ranged 0-100, where lower scores indicate poorer functioning (e.g., worsening) and higher scores indicate better functioning (e.g., improvement). Symptom scales/items were also linearly transformed so each score ranged 0-100, where higher scores indicate worse symptoms (e.g., more severe/worsened) and lower scores indicate less symptoms (e.g., less severe/improvement).</description>

        <title>EORTC QLQ-C30 Questionnaire Score: Functional Subscales</title>
        <description>EORTC QLQ-C30 included GHS/QOL, functional scales (physical, role, cognitive, emotional, social), symptom scales (fatigue, pain, nausea/vomiting), and single items (dyspnea, appetite loss, insomnia, constipation, diarrhea, financial difficulties). Most questions from QLQ-C30 were a 4-point scale (1/Not at All to 4/Very Much), except Items 29-30, which comprise GHS scale and were a 7-point scale (1/Very Poor to 7/Excellent). For this instrument, GHS/QOL and functional scales were linearly transformed so each score ranged 0-100, where lower scores indicate poorer functioning (e.g., worsening) and higher scores indicate better functioning (e.g., improvement). Symptom scales/items were also linearly transformed so each score ranged 0-100, where higher scores indicate worse symptoms (e.g., more severe/worsened) and lower scores indicate less symptoms (e.g., less severe/improvement).</description>

        <title>EORTC QLQ-C30 Questionnaire Score: GHS Scale</title>
        <description>EORTC QLQ-C30 included GHS/QOL, functional scales (physical, role, cognitive, emotional, social), symptom scales (fatigue, pain, nausea/vomiting), and single items (dyspnea, appetite loss, insomnia, constipation, diarrhea, financial difficulties). Most questions from QLQ-C30 were a 4-point scale (1/Not at All to 4/Very Much), except Items 29-30, which comprise GHS scale and were a 7-point scale (1/Very Poor to 7/Excellent). For this instrument, GHS/QOL and functional scales were linearly transformed so each score ranged 0-100, where lower scores indicate poorer functioning (e.g., worsening) and higher scores indicate better functioning (e.g., improvement). Symptom scales/items were also linearly transformed so each score ranged 0-100, where higher scores indicate worse symptoms (e.g., more severe/worsened) and lower scores indicate less symptoms (e.g., less severe/improvement).</description>

        <description>EORTC QLQ-C30 included GHS/QOL, functional scales (physical, role, cognitive, emotional, social), symptom scales (fatigue, pain, nausea/vomiting), and single items (dyspnea, appetite loss, insomnia, constipation, diarrhea, financial difficulties). Most questions from QLQ-C30 were a 4-point scale (1/Not at All to 4/Very Much), except Items 29-30, which comprise GHS scale and were a 7-point scale (1/Very Poor to 7/Excellent). For this instrument, GHS/QOL and functional scales were linearly transformed so each score ranged 0-100, where lower scores indicate poorer functioning (e.g., worsening) and higher scores indicate better functioning (e.g., improvement). Symptom scales/items were also linearly transformed so each score ranged 0-100, where higher scores indicate worse symptoms (e.g., more severe/worsened) and lower scores indicate less symptoms (e.g., less severe/improvement).</description>

        <description>QLQ-LC13 consisted of 13 questions relating to disease symptoms specific to lung cancer and treatment side effects typical of treatment with chemotherapy and radiotherapy experienced during past 1 week. The 13 questions comprised 1 multi-item scale for dyspnea and 10 single-item symptoms and side effects (coughing, hemoptysis, sore mouth, dysphagia, peripheral neuropathy, alopecia, pain in chest, pain in arm or shoulder, pain in other parts. Response range: (1) not at all to (4) very much. Scores for each item were transformed to 0 to 100, where higher symptom score = greater degree of symptoms. Results have been reported for alopecia.</description>

        <title>EORTC QLQ-LC13 Questionnaire Score: Coughing</title>
        <description>QLQ-LC13 consisted of 13 questions relating to disease symptoms specific to lung cancer and treatment side effects typical of treatment with chemotherapy and radiotherapy experienced during past 1 week. The 13 questions comprised 1 multi-item scale for dyspnea and 10 single-item symptoms and side effects (coughing, hemoptysis, sore mouth, dysphagia, peripheral neuropathy, alopecia, pain in chest, pain in arm or shoulder, pain in other parts. Response range: (1) not at all to (4) very much. Scores for each item were transformed to 0 to 100, where higher symptom score = greater degree of symptoms. Results have been reported for coughing.</description>

        <title>EORTC QLQ-LC13 Questionnaire Score: Dysphagia</title>
        <description>QLQ-LC13 consisted of 13 questions relating to disease symptoms specific to lung cancer and treatment side effects typical of treatment with chemotherapy and radiotherapy experienced during past 1 week. The 13 questions comprised 1 multi-item scale for dyspnea and 10 single-item symptoms and side effects (coughing, hemoptysis, sore mouth, dysphagia, peripheral neuropathy, alopecia, pain in chest, pain in arm or shoulder, pain in other parts. Response range: (1) not at all to (4) very much. Scores for each item were transformed to 0 to 100, where higher symptom score = greater degree of symptoms. Results have been reported for dysphagia.</description>

        <description>QLQ-LC13 consisted of 13 questions relating to disease symptoms specific to lung cancer and treatment side effects typical of treatment with chemotherapy and radiotherapy experienced during past 1 week. The 13 questions comprised 1 multi-item scale for dyspnea and 10 single-item symptoms and side effects (coughing, hemoptysis, sore mouth, dysphagia, peripheral neuropathy, alopecia, pain in chest, pain in arm or shoulder, pain in other parts. Response range: (1) not at all to (4) very much. Scores for each item were transformed to 0 to 100, where higher symptom score = greater degree of symptoms. Results have been reported for dyspnea.</description>

        <title>EORTC QLQ-LC13 Questionnaire Score: Hemoptysis</title>
        <description>QLQ-LC13 consisted of 13 questions relating to disease symptoms specific to lung cancer and treatment side effects typical of treatment with chemotherapy and radiotherapy experienced during past 1 week. The 13 questions comprised 1 multi-item scale for dyspnea and 10 single-item symptoms and side effects (coughing, hemoptysis, sore mouth, dysphagia, peripheral neuropathy, alopecia, pain in chest, pain in arm or shoulder, pain in other parts. Response range: (1) not at all to (4) very much. Scores for each item were transformed to 0 to 100, where higher symptom score = greater degree of symptoms. Results have been reported for hemoptysis.</description>

        <title>EORTC QLQ-LC13 Questionnaire Score: Pain in Arm or Shoulder</title>
        <description>QLQ-LC13 consisted of 13 questions relating to disease symptoms specific to lung cancer and treatment side effects typical of treatment with chemotherapy and radiotherapy experienced during past 1 week. The 13 questions comprised 1 multi-item scale for dyspnea and 10 single-item symptoms and side effects (coughing, hemoptysis, sore mouth, dysphagia, peripheral neuropathy, alopecia, pain in chest, pain in arm or shoulder, pain in other parts. Response range: (1) not at all to (4) very much. Scores for each item were transformed to 0 to 100, where higher symptom score = greater degree of symptoms. Results have been reported for pain in arm or shoulder.</description>
        <time_frame>Day 1 of each treatment Cycle up to EOT (up to approximately 2.25 years); 6 week following PD (up to approximately 2.25 years); survival follow-up-1 (up to approximately 2.25 years) (1 Cycle= 21 days)</time_frame>

        <description>QLQ-LC13 consisted of 13 questions relating to disease symptoms specific to lung cancer and treatment side effects typical of treatment with chemotherapy and radiotherapy experienced during past 1 week. The 13 questions comprised 1 multi-item scale for dyspnea and 10 single-item symptoms and side effects (coughing, hemoptysis, sore mouth, dysphagia, peripheral neuropathy, alopecia, pain in chest, pain in arm or shoulder, pain in other parts. Response range: (1) not at all to (4) very much. Scores for each item were transformed to 0 to 100, where higher symptom score = greater degree of symptoms. Results have been reported for pain in chest.</description>

        <title>EORTC QLQ-LC13 Questionnaire Score: Peripheral Neuropathy</title>
        <description>QLQ-LC13 consisted of 13 questions relating to disease symptoms specific to lung cancer and treatment side effects typical of treatment with chemotherapy and radiotherapy experienced during past 1 week. The 13 questions comprised 1 multi-item scale for dyspnea and 10 single-item symptoms and side effects (coughing, hemoptysis, sore mouth, dysphagia, peripheral neuropathy, alopecia, pain in chest, pain in arm or shoulder, pain in other parts. Response range: (1) not at all to (4) very much. Scores for each item were transformed to 0 to 100, where higher symptom score = greater degree of symptoms. Results have been reported for peripheral neuropathy.</description>

        <description>QLQ-LC13 consisted of 13 questions relating to disease symptoms specific to lung cancer and treatment side effects typical of treatment with chemotherapy and radiotherapy experienced during past 1 week. The 13 questions comprised 1 multi-item scale for dyspnea and 10 single-item symptoms and side effects (coughing, hemoptysis, sore mouth, dysphagia, peripheral neuropathy, alopecia, pain in chest, pain in arm or shoulder, pain in other parts. Response range: (1) not at all to (4) very much. Scores for each item were transformed to 0 to 100, where higher symptom score = greater degree of symptoms. Results have been reported for pain in other parts.</description>
        <time_frame>Day 1 of each treatment Cycle up to EOT (up to approximately 2.25 years); 6 week following PD (up to approximately 2.25 years); survival follow-up-1 (up to approximately 2.25 years) (1 Cycle= 21 days)</time_frame>

        <description>QLQ-LC13 consisted of 13 questions relating to disease symptoms specific to lung cancer and treatment side effects typical of treatment with chemotherapy and radiotherapy experienced during past 1 week. The 13 questions comprised 1 multi-item scale for dyspnea and 10 single-item symptoms and side effects (coughing, hemoptysis, sore mouth, dysphagia, peripheral neuropathy, alopecia, pain in chest, pain in arm or shoulder, pain in other parts. Response range: (1) not at all to (4) very much. Scores for each item were transformed to 0 to 100, where higher symptom score = greater degree of symptoms. Results have been reported for sore mouth.</description>
