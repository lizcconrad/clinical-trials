  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The treatment of CML and the expected survival has been revolutionised since the introduction
      of tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) such as nilotinib. Despite their effectiveness, these
      drugs will never totally remove CML affected cells from the body. In order to achieve this
      goal, and potentially enable CML patients to live without the daily need for TKIs, other
      features of the patient's immune system may need to be harnessed. One possibility is using
      externally administered interferon (IFN) to augment the response induced by the TKI.

      This study will assess the response in terms of length of survival, detection of minimal
      disease levels and time until disease worsens in patients with chronic phase CML who are
      taking nilotinib and pegylated Interferon. Patients will commence taking nilotinib for 3
      months, and once tolerated, will simultaneously be treated with injected pegIFN for up to 2
      years. Patients can continue taking nilotinib beyond this time providing they are receiving
      benefit. Options are available for patients to decrease or increase their dose or to switch
      to another TKI, imatinib, to ensure a balance between drug effectiveness and minimal side
      effects is achieved.

        correlative study).

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Presence of any of the following criteria will exclude the subject from enrolment in the
        study.

                  electrolytes are not within normal ranges, electrolytes should be corrected and
                  then the patient re-screened for QTc

             childbearing potential must agree to employ an effective method of birth control
             throughout the study. The type of birth control is a decision which should be made
             between the treating clinician and the patient

         15. Known history of uncontrolled depression or any other psychiatric disease likely to be
             exacerbated by study treatment. A formal psychiatric assessment at baseline is not
             required.

         16. Current participation in another therapeutic clinical trial (participation in clinical
             trials that do not involve active interventions is not an exclusion for the study.)

         17. Previous adverse reaction to the trial drug/s
