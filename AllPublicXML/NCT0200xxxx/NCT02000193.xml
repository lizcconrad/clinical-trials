      This is a prospective, single arm phase II study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of
      fulvestrant as a maintenance hormone therapy after first-line chemotherapy for postmenopausal
      HR positive advanced breast cancer.

      Approximately 58 women who have stable disease or responded to first line chemotherapy with
      at least 4 and less than 8 weeks of treatment for metastatic breast cancer will be enrolled
      to this study and receive fulvestrant 500mg as a maintenance therapy. The treatment will
      continue until the objective disease progression or intolerable AE.

      Efficacy will be determined based on tumor assessments performed by each investigator
      according to RECIST (Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors ) 1.1. Safety will be
      monitored based on the frequency and severity of adverse events (AEs), as assessed by Common
      Terminology Criteria (CTC) grade version 4.0.

      Tumor assessments will be assessed by computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging
      (MRI) every 12 weeks for all patients until documented evidence of objective disease
      progression.

      Reporting of SAEs (serious adverse events) to regulatory authorities will be done by the
      investigator in accordance with local regulations.

        Provision of informed consent Histologically proven HR positive breast cancer

        Postmenopausal woman, defined as a woman fulfilling any 1 of the following criteria (based
        on the NCCN definition of menopause [National Comprehensive Cancer Network 2008]):

        Prior bilateral oophorectomy Age ≥60 years Age &lt;60 years and amenorrheic for 12 or more

        follicle stimulating hormone and oestradiol in the postmenopausal range.

        Patients have completed first-line chemotherapy for metastatic breast cancer The first-line
        chemotherapy must be given to patients with visceral disease or progressive disease
        requiring a fast response Responded(CR or PR) or stabilized(SD&gt;=24 weeks) to first-line
        chemotherapy for metastatic breast cancer The duration of 1st line chemotherapy for
        advanced breast cancer had been at least 4 cycles and at most 8 cycles WHO performance
        status 0, 1 or 2-

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Presence of life-threatening metastatic visceral disease, defined as extensive hepatic
             involvement, or any degree of brain or leptomeningeal involvement (past or present)
             Prior hormonal treatment for metastatic breast cancer are not allowed More than one
             line of cytotoxic chemotherapy for metastatic breast cancer Her-2 positive Other
             malignant tumor (concurrent or previous). Any severe concomitant condition which makes
