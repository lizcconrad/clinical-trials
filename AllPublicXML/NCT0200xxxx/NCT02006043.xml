      In this phase II, open, single arm study, it will be evaluated of the efficacy and safety of
      erlotinib in 2nd/3rd line of EGFR WT and c-Met negative advanced NSCLC.The treatment goes as
      follows:Erlotinib 150mg/day taken orally until disease progression or intolerable
      toxicities.The primary end point of the study was 6 months PFS rate.

             in solid tumors(RECIST1.1) criteria

          3. Must have at least one prior platinum-based chemotherapy regimen for advanced NSCLC
             and now exhibit progressive disease (PD), and must have recovered from any serious
             treatment related toxicity

          4. Neither with EGFR mutation nor c-met expression on Ventana Benchmark instrument(Met
             negative expression definition: ≥50% of the cells do not stain or stain with weak
             intensity (clinical score 0 or 1+) )

          5. ECOG Performance Status 0 ~2

          6. Adequate hematological function: Neutrophil count ≥ 1.5 × 109/L, Platelets ≥ 100 ×
             109/L and Hemoglobin ≥9 g/dL (may be transfused to maintain or exceed this level).

          7. Adequate liver function: Total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 × upper limit of normal (ULN); AST
             (SGOT) and ALT (SGPT) &lt; 2.5 × ULN in the absence of liver metastases, or &lt; 5 × ULN in
             case of liver metastases.

          8. Male or female.

          9. Age ≥ 18 years and ≤75 years

         10. Written (signed) informed consent. Able to comply with study and follow-up procedures.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients with prior exposure to agents directed at the HER axis (e.g. erlotinib,
             gefitinib, cetuximab, trastuzumab).

          2. Received treatment with any other investigational agent, or participated in another
             clinical trial, with the following exceptions.

               -  Chemotherapy-only trials are permitted (if completed≧ 28 days prior to receiving
                  the first dose of study drug).

               -  Previous adjuvant or neo-adjuvant treatment for nonmetastatic disease is
                  permitted if completed ≥ 6 months before receiving the first dose of study drug;
                  c)Prior surgery is permitted if performed ≥ 4 weeks before receiving the first
                  dose of study drug and the patient is fully recovered.

               -  Prior localized radiotherapy is permitted if it was not administered to target
                  lesions selected for this study, unless progression of the selected target
                  lesions within the radiation portal is documented, and provided it has been
                  completed ≥ 4 weeks before receiving the first dose of study drug.

               -  Participation in a methodological or observational study in which no
                  investigational agent was given

          3. Patients who have brain metastasis or spinal cord compression that has not yet been
             definitively treated with surgery and/or radiation; previously diagnosed and treated
             CNS metastases or spinal cord compression without evidence of stable disease
             (clinically stable imaging) for at least 2 months

          4. History of another malignancy in the last 5 years with the exception of the following:

               -  Other malignancies cured by surgery alone and having a continuous disease-free
                  interval of 5 years are permitted.

               -  Cured basal cell carcinoma of the skin and cured in situ carcinoma of the uterine
                  cervix are permitted.

          5. Any significant ophthalmologic abnormality, especially severe dry eye syndrome,
             keratoconjunctivitis sicca, Sjögren syndrome, severe exposure keratitis or any other
             disorder likely to increase the risk of corneal epithelial lesions. The use of contact
             lenses is not recommended during the study. The decision to continue to wear contact
             lenses should be discussed with the patient's treating oncologist and the
             ophthalmologist.

          6. Any diseases, metabolic dysfunction, physical examination finding, or clinical
             laboratory finding giving reasonable suspicion of a disease or condition that
             contraindicates the use of any study medication or that might affect the
             interpretation of the results or render the subject at high risk from treatment
             complications.

          7. Female subject who is pregnant or breast-feeding

          8. Any unstable systemic disease

          9. Hypersensitivity to erlotinib
