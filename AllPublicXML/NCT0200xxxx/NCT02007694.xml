  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Recent advances in animal research have identified pharmacological agents that appear to both
      accelerate and consolidate extinction learning. One cognitive enhancers is Yohimbine
      hydrochloride (YOH). A finding in animal literature is that the administration of YOH during
      extinction trials accelerates fear reduction and may convert ineffective exposures in to
      successful ones. It is thought that the mechanism of enhanced emotional memory is through
      elevated norepinephrine. However, recent findings demonstrate mixed results. In a randomized
      controlled trial claustrophobic participants underwent exposure in combination with YOH or
      placebo. The YOH group showed significantly better results on anxiety improvement than the
      placebo group. In a more recent study with participants with fear of flying no additional
      benefits of YOH were demonstrated. Therefore, we intend to replicate and extend these studies
      by enhancing the dose of YOH in combination with VRET and by extending our experimental
      design with another group which receives propranolol in combination with VRET. Propranolol is
      β-adrenergic receptor antagonist, which has proven to disrupt reconsolidation in healthy
      humans. In this randomized controlled trial a between groups design is chosen to further
      characterize the differential within and between trial extinction and to enhance possible
      between groups effects. Sixty participants with fear of flying or fear of heights will be
      randomly assigned to one of the following three conditions 1) VRET plus YOH, 2) VRET plus
      Propranolol, or 3) VRET plus placebo. Participants in all conditions will be offered three
      sessions of VRET over a period of two weeks.

    <time_frame>Pre- (baseline) and post-assessment (after treatment termination, within 3 weeks after first treatment session) and 3 month follow up (3 month after post assessment)</time_frame>
    <description>The DASS is 42-item self-report measure that assesses level of depression, anxiety, and stress over the previous week. Each scale consists of 14 items, which are grouped into smaller subscales. The depression scale consists of the following subscales: dysphoria, hopelessness, devaluation of life, self-deprecation, lack of interest/involvement, anhedonia and inertia. The anxiety scale consists of: autonomic arousal, skeletal musculature effects, situational anxiety and subjective experience of anxious affect. The stress scale consists of: difficulty relaxing, nervous arousal, easily agitated, irritable/overreactive and impatient. The internal consistency of the DASs is good to excellent (Cronbach's alpha ranging from .88 to .96; Brown et al., 1997).</description>

    <description>The PIT is based on MacLeod and Byrne, (1996) and Stöber, (2000) and will be used to measure imagery for 10 positive and 10 negative prospective events. As in Holmes, Lang, et al. (2008), subjects will be asked to rate the vividness of prospective positive events (e.g., &quot;You will have lots of energy and enthusiasm&quot;) or negative events (e.g., &quot;Someone close to you will reject you&quot;) on a 5-point scale (1 = no image at all; 5 = very vivid).</description>

    <description>The ASI is a 16-items self-report questionnaire, measuring fear of anxiety-related symptoms. Each item is rated on a five-point likert scale ranging from 0 (very little) to 4 (very much). The ASI is scored by summing all items; possible scores range from 0 to 64, with higher scores reflecting higher levels of anxiety sensitivity.</description>

The four dimensions are rated using 100-point visual analogue scales, including the following: (a) overall improvement (not at all improved to much improved), (b) medication interference (not at all detrimental to extremely detrimental), (c) medication facilitation (not at all helpful to extremely helpful), and (d) exposure facilitation (not at all helpful to extremely helpful).</description>

    <description>The self-efficacy questionnaire is a self-report inventory designed to measure the degree of self-efficacy subjects experienced with respect to the phobic situation. The inventory consists of five items on self-efficacy in phobic situations. The items represent five different themes 1) the capability to reduce the experienced fear, 2) to think clearly, 3) to control for ones own actions, 4) to control anxious thoughts and feelings and 5) to stay in the situation while experiencing intense fear. The participant can give an indication by giving a percentage representing their evaluation of their own capability.</description>
