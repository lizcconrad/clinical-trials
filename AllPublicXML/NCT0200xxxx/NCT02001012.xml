  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Preliminary studies have supported the background efficacy of local standard anti-malarial
      medications in the treatment of uncomplicated knowlesi malaria, however there are no current
      WHO treatment guidelines for this infection. There are both health cost benefits to a more
      rapidly acting agent, and due to difficulties with microscopic identification there may be
      more effective treatment for all malaria species if an aligned treatment guideline could be
      supported. We are currently conducting a separate RCT using a similar protocol evaluating
      artesunate-mefloquine versus chloroquine for uncomplicated P. knowlesi malaria. However
      artemether-lumefantrine should also be compared against chloroquine due to the fact it is
      also a first line anti-malarial recommended in Malaysia, and there are potential differences
      in efficacy due to the different administration, absorption and half-life of
      artemether-lumefantrine.

      The investigators aim to test whether the fixed combination of artesunate-mefloquine is
      superior to chloroquine in order to define the optimal treatment for both uncomplicated P.
      knowlesi infection in both adults and children in this region.

      Naturally acquired infections with Plasmodium knowlesi, the fifth human malaria, are growing
      [1]. Since 2004 increasing numbers of cases have been reported from residents and returned
      travelers predominantly from Malaysia and other countries in South-East Asia including
      Thailand, Vietnam, Myanmar, Singapore, Indonesia and the Philippines [2-8]. Cases coincide
      with the geographic distribution of its natural simian hosts (long-tailed and pig-tailed
      macaques) and Anopheles leucosphyrus group mosquito vector [9, 10], with potential
      human-to-human transmission unknown. Eastern Malaysia appears to be the epicentre, with
      around 1400 PCR-confirmed P. knowlesi human mono-infections reported in 2009, comprising 41%
      of 2,189 total malaria cases in Sarawak [11] and 343 cases from selected samples sent to
      Sabah's State Reference Laboratory [12]. P. knowlesi is also now the most common cause of
      malaria in different contrasting regions, including 70% of malaria admissions in the heavily
      forested area of Kapit in Sarawak [1, 13], 63% of samples from the interior division of Sabah
      [14], and in 87% of malaria admissions in the deforested coastal area of Kudat in Sabah,
      where it is also the major cause of malaria in children [15].

      Despite the increase in reported incidence, difficulties with microscopic diagnosis and a
      lack of PCR based epidemiological surveillance studies throughout South-East Asia mean the
      true disease burden is underestimated. P. knowlesi is microscopically misidentified as P .
      falciparum and P. malariae due to morphological similarities in the early trophozoite, and
      late trophozoite and schizont life stages respectively, with studies showing up to 80% of P.
      malariae [16-19] and 7-12% of P. falciparum [1, 16] in this region are actually P. knowlesi
      when definitively evaluated with PCR. Misdiagnosis has concerning treatment implications, as
      unlike P. malariae, knowlesi malaria has a rapid 24-hour replication rate and can cause
      hyperparasitaemia, severe complications and fatal outcomes [13, 17, 18], while the
      inadvertent use of chloroquine for widely chloroquine-resistant P. falciparum may also have
      fatal consequences.

      malariae [16-19] and 7-12% of P. falciparum [1, 16] in this region are actually P. knowlesi
      when definitively evaluated with PCR. Current rapid diagnostic tests (RDT) for malaria can
      distinguish falciparum Current rapid diagnostic tests (RDT) for malaria can distinguish
      falciparum from other Plasmodium species with a sensitivity of up to 99% at parasite counts &gt;
      1,000/ μL [20], but a knowlesi specific antigen has not been developed and current antibody
      panels are unable to differentiate between P. knowlesi and other mixed Plasmodium spp.
      infections [21]. Misdiagnosis has concerning treatment implications, as unlike P. malariae,
      knowlesi malaria has a rapid 24-hour replication rate and can cause hyperparasitaemia, severe
      complications and fatal outcomes [13, 17, 18], while the inadvertent use of chloroquine for
      widely chloroquine-resistant P. falciparum may also have fatal consequences.

      Artemether-lumefantrine (A-L) is a common and widely available ACT, and along with
      artesunate-mefloquine (AS-MQ) is one of only 2 first line WHO recommended options for the
      treatment of uncomplicated P.falciparum infection which are registered in Malaysia and
      produced according to international good manufacturing practice (GMP) standards. ACTs are the
      current mainstay of malaria eradication efforts 28, with a mechanism of action resulting both
      in a rapid reduction in parasite mass and resolution of clinical features, while the long
      acting component eliminates residual parasites and delays the development of de novo
      resistance 29,30.

      Initial reported use of A-L for knowlesi malaria was from our retrospective study at a
      tertiary referral hospital in Sabah, where a small sample size of 8 out of 34 patients with
      PCR confirmed uncomplicated P.knowlesi infection were treated with oral
      artemether-lumefantrine. Median microscopic parasite clearance time was 1 day (range 0-3),
      which was significantly faster than those receiving chloroquine (median 2.5 days, range 1-3),
      while this also resulted in fewer days of hospitalization and health sector associated costs.
      The proportion remaining parasitaemic at day 1 was 33% 16. Our subsequent prospective study
      at the same site documented 109 knowlesi malaria patients successfully treated with A-L, with
      no recurrences identified. Unpublished data from this study showed that of the patients with
      uncomplicated P. knowlesi malaria enrolled, 51 received A-L monotherapy, with a median
      parasite clearance time of 2 days31.

      Evaluation of A-L is required in addition to AS-MQ, as there are a number of pharmacokinetic
      and pharmacodynamic differences that may affect clinical outcomes. In contrast to AS-MQ,
      adequate oral absorption of A-L requires co-adminstration with fatty foods, with twice daily
      dosing28. The longer acting partner drug in A-L is lumefantrine, which has a half life of 3
      days compared to mefloquine in AS-MQ which is 21 days. Therefore there may be differences in
      P. knowlesi recurrence at day 28 or 42 as the follow up time recommended by WHO for
      anti-malarial efficacy monitoring studies 32.

      Chloroquine with primaquine was initially suggested to have favourable treatment outcomes for
      uncomplicated P. knowlesi human infections after a retrospective review of patients from
      Kapit Hospital in Sarawak in 2004 15. Following this a single prospective observational study
      conducted at the same site between 2006-7 administered chloroquine as a total base dose of
      25mg/kg and primaquine as a gametocidal agent to 73 patients with uncomplicated PCR-confirmed
      P. knowlesi malaria, with results showing median fever clearance of 26 hours, mean times to
      50% and 90% microscopic parasite clearance of 3.1 and 10.3 hours respectively, and a median
      PCR adjusted clearance time of 3 days. The proportion remaining parasitaemic at day 1 was
      55%. None of the 60 patients who completed the 28-day follow up demonstrated any evidence of
      resistance, re-infection or recrudescence 25.
