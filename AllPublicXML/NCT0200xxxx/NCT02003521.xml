      We hypothesized that the ability of the Lung Flute to enhance mucus clearance from the lower
      airways could be used to improve asthma control, if the device is used on a chronic basis.
      The primary end point of the study is the comparison of Asthma Control Test (ACT) - a
      validated questionnaire for asthma control and exhaled NO before, during and after using the
      lung flute. Several secondary end points were assessed for efficacy and safety, including
      health status, spirometric lung function, &quot;stepping down&quot; controller therapy and daily
      albuterol use.

      This is a 3 month open label study. We plan to enroll 48 subjects with asthma at the Buffalo
      General Medical Center Allergy Clinic or the office of Dr. James Cumella. Inclusion criteria
      includes: at least 12 years of age, diagnosis of asthma and no current or previous history of
      smoking. Exclusion criteria includes: exacerbation of asthma or hospitalization for asthma
      within 8 weeks prior to enrollment, predominant chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)
      and bronchiectasis by clinical and/or radiological assessment, history of cough syncope,
      pregnant or nursing women, and inability to comply with study procedures.

    <description>A low frequency wave is generated at the mouth by exhaling through a mouthpiece over a laminar surface (Reed) inside the Lung FluteÂ®. The resulting low frequency acoustic wave that is produced travels retrograde into the lower airways and lung parenchyma and increases mucociliary clearance. Patients expel air with the force required to blow out a single candle. Patients concentrate on producing a low tone through the device while breathing in a proscribed pattern. Twenty repetitions of a single two-breath pattern are performed with the device to complete a diagnostic session.</description>

        We are seeking patients diagnosed with asthma. All subjects will have already been screened
        as a consequence of their being established asthma patients at the clinical sites. Patients
        will be identified and screened by their attending physician who will notify the
        investigators. The investigators are responsible for recruiting identified subjects.
