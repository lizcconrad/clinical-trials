  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Lymphangioleiomyomatosis (LAM) is a rare disease in which reduced exercise capacity is
      frequently present. The mechanisms applied are airflow obstruction, abnormal diffusion
      capacity and dynamic hyperinflation (DH).

      Pulmonary rehabilitation (PR) has proved benefit in improving exercise tolerance, dyspnea,
      and quality of life in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. There are no studies evaluating
      the impact of PR in patients with LAM.

      The hypothesis under study is that PR determine improvement in exercise capacity, dyspnea,
      quality of life, muscle force, functional limitation and DH in these patients.
