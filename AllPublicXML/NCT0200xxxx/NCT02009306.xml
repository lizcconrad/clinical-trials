  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      When patients are dying they become unable to take oral medication and if they develop
      symptoms (e.g. pain or agitation) they need to be given a subcutaneous injection of
      medication. If they are at home this requires that a District Nurse is called and it can take
      a long time (sometimes hours) for the Nurse to arrive. This can be a very stressful time for
      the patient and family.

      There are 2 drug preparations which could potentially be given by family members in the home:

      Nasal fentanyl (PecFent) Buccal midazolam (Epistatus) If these preparations helped symptoms
      this would give much quicker symptom control for patients and might mean the District Nurse
      visit was not needed.

      In advance of a community based randomised trial of these modes of administration, it is
      important to assess the feasibility of such an approach in terms of carer acceptability and
      patient tolerability as well as determine appropriate sample sizes and sampling methods.
      There are 2 work packages which would help assess feasibility of a community trial:

        1. An open label randomised controlled trial comparing the use of PecFent with or without
           Epistatus versus standard subcutaneous breakthrough medication for the management of
           breakthrough pain (with or without agitation) in dying hospice patients who either
           remain in the hospice or go home.

        2. A qualitative interview study to capture the thoughts of relatives of these patients
           about the use of these preparations.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This will be an open-label, randomized, controlled feasibility pilot study to evaluate
      whether using nasal fentanyl (PecFent: 100, 200, 400 or 800 mcg) alone or in combination with
      buccal midazolam (Epistatus: 2.5, 5 or 10 mg) has the possibility to give better breakthrough
      symptom control to dying patients when compared with standard subcutaneous medication (Figure
      1 A and B).

      Each subject and their carers/family members will receive verbal and written information
      followed by signing of the Informed Consent Forms (ICFs). The study is divided into two arms.
      In both arms patients will receive standard regular oral or subcutaneous medication for
      relieving non-breakthrough symptoms. In the standard care arm, patients will receive standard
      as needed medication (SANM) administered orally, sublingually or subcutaneously for
      breakthrough symptoms. The experimental arm will consist of two stages: in Stage 1 of the
      study, PecFent will be given to patients in order to treat breakthrough pain instead of
      subcutaneous opioids. PecFent will be titrated in order to establish an effective treatment
      dose to manage pain. SANM administered orally, sublingually or subcutaneously will be used to
      treat agitation and other symptoms.

      After the effective treatment dose of PecFent has been established patients will enter stage
      2. Patients will not move to stage 2 if the treatment dose of PecFent is not deemed
      effective. Stage 2 will test a range of doses of Epistatus in terms of efficacy in treating
      agitation alone instead of subcutaneous midazolam (or in combination with the effective
      treatment dose of PecFent for pain and agitation).

      SANM will be used to treat other symptoms. Assessment of effectiveness of any as needed
      medication will be conducted at 30 minutes from administration. If PecFent, Epistatus or a
      combination of both is ineffective, administration of SANM will be considered. Further opioid
      cannot be given within one hour but benzodiazepine can be given within 30 minutes as is
      standard practice in this setting. Thus, patients in the experimental arm will receive
      symptom relief regardless the efficacy of test drugs.

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

        Adult hospice in-patients fitting the following criteria will be approached to see if they
        are willing to participate in the study:

          1. diagnosis of terminal cancer and thought to have an estimated prognosis of between 1
             and 2 weeks

          2. have capacity to consent to participation

          3. patients who, in the last 24 hours, have experienced at least one episode of
             breakthrough pain FOR ARMS 1 OR 2 (RCT) For Arm 3 must have had 1 episode of agitation
             necessitating the use of a benzodiazepine in the last 24 hours

          4. taking 60mg or more of oral morphine (or its equivalent) per 24 hours FOR ARMS 1 OR 2
             (RCT) IF taking less than this dose of opioid could be enrolled in Arm 3 (Epistatus
             alone - change in protocol implemented 28/11/17

          5. have carers or family members who would be: willing to give the study medication to
             the patient likely to be at the hospice at least 50% of the time so that they are
             likely to be present to administer medication.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. patients / carers / family members who in the opinion of the clinical team would be
             too distressed by the idea of participation

          2. patients with disease of the nasal/buccal mucosa preventing effective absorption of
             medication

          3. families who are unable to administer breakthrough medication e.g. problems with
             dexterity

          4. history of substance abuse - patient or carer / family.

          5. people who who might not adequately understand verbal explanations or written
             information given in English. The pilot is only recruiting 20 patients and
             Gloucestershire has a only a very small percentage of people who are not English
             speaking. It has been decided that it is not cost effective to fund translation for
             this pilot although this information will have to be taken into account when planning
             a larger study. We will capture information on the numbers of patients that may have
             been excluded and the languages that might have been needed.

          6. Participated in a medicinal trial within the last four months following the guidance
             from the Association of the British Pharmaceutical Industry.
