    <measure>Change from baseline of the Quantification score of angina pectoris at Day 7</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 7</time_frame>
    <description>Quantification score of angina pectoris is a 4-item questionnaire that quantifies the frequency of angina, the duration of angina at every attack, the severity of angina and the use of nitroglycerin in a week. Scores range from 0 to 24; higher scores indicate worse health status.</description>
