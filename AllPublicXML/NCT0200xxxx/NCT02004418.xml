  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with localized prostate cancer are routinely treated with radiation therapy to the
      entire prostate gland. The investigators can identify where the cancer is concentrated in the
      prostate gland using a newer specialized imaging technique called 11C Choline PET (stands for
      choline positron emission tomography). This is different from the older type of PET scan that
      has been used in the past (called FDG PET) which has not been as accurate as the new PET scan
      for identifying where the cancer is in the prostate gland. It has also been shown that
      delivering higher doses of radiation to prostate cancer cells in the prostate have resulted
      in better cure rates in patients with prostate cancer. Therefore for goal number one the
      investigators want to give higher radiation dose to the prostate cancer cells. But the
      challenge has been that delivering higher doses of radiation to the prostate gland may also
      increase the chance of complications from the higher doses of radiation to the rectum,
      bladder and surrounding area. Therefore for goal number two the investigators want to
      minimize radiation dose to the rectum, bladder and surrounding area. 3-Tesla Magnetic
      Resonance Imaging (3T MRI) is a new kink of scan that will be used in this study to identify
      the urethra in the prostate so that the investigators can minimize the radiation dose to the
      urethra. The investigators believe the 3T MRI scan is able to point to the areas of cancer
      that may be able to predict how well the treatments may work, as well as which areas of the
      tumor appear to be responding to failing.

      In this study, the investigators will keep the dose of radiation to the rectum and bladder as
      low as possible while increasing radiation dose to parts of the prostate with more cancer
      cells. The investigators will compare the cure rates in this study with the cure rates of
      other patients receiving the standard treatment in which the same dose of radiation is
      delivered throughout the prostate gland. The investigators will also compare the rates of
      complications in this study with the rates of complications in patients receiving the
      standard treatment in which the same dose of radiation is delivered throughout the prostate
      gland.

      This is a prospective, open label, non-randomized, single site, phase I/II study of the
      safety and utility of 11C-Choline PET scans for delineation of intraprostatic lesions in
      subjects with localized intermediate risk prostate cancer and subsequent Enhanced EBRT
      (External Beam Radiation Therapy) to monitor toxicity, therapeutic response and recurrence.

      The estimated total number of subjects required for protocol enrollment and baseline
      11C-Choline PET scans is 63; however, the protocol will complete accrual only when 29
      subjects have commenced Enhanced EBRT or the outlined stopping rules require a halt to
      accrual. Twenty-nine (29) subjects treated with Enhanced EBRT are required to assess the
      toxicity of this treatment based on the statistical analysis outlined in the protocol.
      Subjects will receive a fixed dose (400 MBq, 10%) of 11C-Choline and PET/CT imaging with
      co-registration 3T MRI imaging prior to Enhanced EBRT and two further doses of 11C-Choline at
      two intervals (3 and 6 months) thereafter.

      Subjects with suitable intraprostatic lesion delineation with 11C-Choline will proceed to
      Enhanced EBRT, consisting of a dose prescription of 78 Gy in 25 fractions to the
      intraprostatic lesions and 68 Gy in 25 fractions (simultaneously) to the prostate gland.
      Subjects without suitable intraprostatic lesion delineation will be treated with Cross Cancer
      Institute standard of care EBRT and undergo follow-up for biochemical recurrence per protocol
      to determine the prognostic value of the baseline PET findings.

      Subjects will be monitored for 11C-Choline safety and efficacy and for EBRT safety / toxicity
      and efficacy.

      11C-Choline PET image intraprostatic lesion(s) will be analyzed by the relative uptake scores
      (RUS), tumor to background ratios (T/B) and SUVmax parameters. Adequate delineation will be
      determined by a lesion with tumor to background ration ≥2. This is defined in section 10.

      11C-Choline PET image parameters will be correlated with other measures of progression and
      survival including biochemical disease free survival as indicators of Enhanced EBRT response.

      Efficacy of 11C-Choline delineated Enhanced EBRT will be evaluated by progression and
      survival analysis compared to historical data from this population.

      Safety of 11C-Choline will be determined by: vital signs, blood hematology and clinical
      biochemistry profile (pre-injection, post-imaging) and adverse event collection.

      Safety/toxicity of 11C-Choline delineated Enhanced EBRT will be determined by adverse event
      collection, primarily for genitourinary and gastrointestinal toxicity and compared to
      historical data from this population.
