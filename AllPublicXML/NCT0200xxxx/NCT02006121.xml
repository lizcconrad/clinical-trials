      The main purpose of this study is to investigate the efficacy of apomorphine subcutaneous
      infusion compared to placebo in advanced Parkinson's Disease patients.

      The secondary purpose of this study is to investigate the safety and tolerability of
      apomorphine subcutaneous therapy.

      - Primary efficacy variable is the absolute change in time spent &quot;OFF&quot; from baseline to the
      end of 12 weeks treatment period based on patient diaries

      Secondary Endpoints:

        -  Percentage of patients with response to therapy, defined as an OFF time reduction of at
           least 2 hours, from baseline to end of 12 weeks treatment period

        -  Patient Global Impression of Change

        -  Absolute Change in time spent &quot;ON without troublesome dyskinesia&quot;

        -  Change in oral L-dopa and L-dopa equivalent dose

        -  Change in Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS Part III motor examination)
           during ON periods

        -  Change in Quality of Life (using PDQ-8)

        Inclusion Criteria:

        Male or female patients aged ≥30

          -  Diagnosis of idiopathic Parkinson's disease of &gt;3 years' duration, defined by the UK
             Brain Bank criteria (with the exception of &gt;1 affected relative being allowed),
             without any other known or suspected cause of Parkinsonism

          -  Hoehn &amp; Yahr stage up to 3 in the ON and 2 to 5 in the OFF state

          -  Motor fluctuations not adequately controlled on medical treatment including L-dopa
             which was judged to be optimal by the treating physician

          -  Average of OFF time&gt;= 3 h/day based on screening and baseline diary entries with no
             day with &lt; 2 hours of OFF time recorded

          -  Stable medication regimen, with a stable dose of L-dopa administered in at least 4
             intakes, for at least 28 days prior to baseline. All oral or transdermal
             antiparkinsonian drugs are permitted, with the exception of budipine. This regimen may
             include the use of L-dopa /DDCI rescue medication if this occurs up to 2 times a day,

             methylphenidate, or amphetamine; intrajejunal L-dopa

          -  Previous use of apomorphine pump treatment

          -  History of deep brain stimulation or lesional surgery for PD

             long QT syndrome; or &gt;450 ms absolute duration

          -  Clinically relevant hepatic dysfunction (total bilirubin &gt;2.0 mg/dL, ALT and AST &gt;2
             times the upper limit of normal)

          -  Clinically relevant renal dysfunction (serum creatinine &gt;2.0 mg/dL);

          -  Pregnant and breastfeeding women

          -  Clinically relevant cognitive decline, defined as MMSE ≤24 or according to DSM IV
             criteria for dementia
