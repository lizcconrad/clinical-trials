    <textblock>
      This randomized phase III trial studies combination chemotherapy with blinatumomab to see how
      well it works compared to induction chemotherapy alone in treating patients with newly
      diagnosed breakpoint cluster region (BCR)-c-abl oncogene 1, non-receptor tyrosine kinase
      (ABL)-negative B lineage acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Drugs used in chemotherapy work in
      different ways to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping
      them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Monoclonal antibodies, such as
      blinatumomab, may block cancer growth in different ways by targeting certain cells. It is not
      yet known whether combination chemotherapy is more effective with or without blinatumomab in
      treating newly diagnosed acute lymphoblastic leukemia.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To compare the overall survival (OS) of blinatumomab in conjunction with chemotherapy to
      chemotherapy alone in patients with BCR-ABL-negative B cell precursor acute lymphoblastic
      leukemia (ALL) who are minimal residual disease (MRD) positive after induction and
      intensification chemotherapy, based on multiparameter flow cytometric (MFC) assessment of
      residual blasts.

      II. If superiority of blinatumomab in the MRD positive group is shown, to compare the OS of
      blinatumomab in conjunction with chemotherapy to chemotherapy alone in patients with
      BCR-ABL-negative B cell precursor ALL who are MRD negative after induction and
      intensification chemotherapy, based on MFC assessment of residual blasts.

      III. If superiority of blinatumomab in the MRD positive group is not shown, to compare the OS
      of blinatumomab in conjunction with chemotherapy to chemotherapy alone in the overall
      population of patients with BCR-ABL-negative B cell precursor ALL.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To compare the relapse-free survival (RFS) of blinatumomab in conjunction with
      chemotherapy to chemotherapy alone in MRD positive patients, MRD negative patients and
      overall population after induction and intensification chemotherapy.

      II. To determine if blinatumomab can convert patients who are MRD positive by MFC assessment
      of residual blasts after induction and intensification chemotherapy to MRD negativity.

      III. To assess the toxicities of blinatumomab in this patient population. IV. To assess the
      toxicities of the modified E2993 chemotherapy regimen in this patient population.

      V. To describe the outcome of patients who proceed to allogeneic blood or marrow transplant
      after treatment with or without blinatumomab.

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine differences in MRD kinetics among patients with the BCR/ABL1-like B-lineage
      ALL, and assess the efficacy of blinatumomab in each molecular subgroup.

      II. To evaluate the incidence of anti-blinatumomab antibody formation.

      OUTLINE:

      INDUCTION CHEMOTHERAPY: Patients receive cytarabine intrathecally (IT) on day 1; daunorubicin
      hydrochloride intravenously (IV) over 10-15 minutes on days 1, 8, 15, and 22; vincristine
      sulfate IV on days 1, 8, 15, and 22; dexamethasone orally (PO) daily on days 1-7 (and 15-21
      for patients age &lt; 55 years only); methotrexate IT on day 14; pegaspargase intramuscularly
      (IM) or IV on day 18 (patients age =&lt; 55 years); and CD20 positive patients may optionally
      receive rituximab IV on day 8 and 15. Beginning on day 29, patients with absolute neutrophil
      count (ANC) &gt;= 0.75 x 10^9/L and platelets &gt; 75 x 10^9/L (patients with delayed hematologic
      recovery) (patients with residual disease that is delaying count begin treatment immediately)
      receive cyclophosphamide IV over 30 minutes on days 1 and 29, cytarabine IV over 30 minutes
      or subcutaneously (SC) on days 1-4, 8-11, 29-32, and 36-39, mercaptopurine PO on days 1-14,
      29-42, pegaspargase IM or IV on day 15 (patients age &lt; 55 years), patients receiving
      treatment for central nervous system (CNS) 2 or 3 leukemia in course 1 receive methotrexate
      IT on days 1, 8, 15, and 22, and CD20 positive patients may optionally receive rituximab IV
      on days 8 and 15.

      INTENSIFICATION THERAPY: Beginning 4 weeks after the completion of course 2 of induction
      therapy, patients receive intensification therapy comprising high-dose methotrexate IV over 2
      hours on days 1 and 8, and pegaspargase IM or IV on day 9.

      Patients are then randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

      Patients randomized to the blinatumomab group receive blinatumomab IV continuously on days
      1-28. Treatment repeats every 6 weeks for 2 courses in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity. Patients may then undergo allogeneic stem cell transplant (SCT) or
      proceed to consolidation therapy per investigator discretion.

      CONSOLIDATION THERAPY: Beginning after the second course of blinatumomab (patients randomized
      to the blinatumomab group) or after intensification therapy (patients not randomized to
      blinatumomab), patients receive cytarabine IV over 30 minutes or SC on days 1-5, etoposide IV
      over 1 hour on days 1-5, methotrexate IT on day 1, and pegaspargase IM or IV on day 5, and
      CD20 positive patients may optionally receive rituximab IV on day 5. Beginning 4 weeks from
      day 1 of course 1, patients receive cytarabine, etoposide, methotrexate, and CD20 positive
      patients may receive rituximab as in course 1. Beginning 4 weeks from day 1 of course 2,
      patients receive daunorubicin hydrochloride IV over 10-15 minutes on day 1, 8, 15, and 22;
      vincristine sulfate IV on days 1, 8, 15, and 22; dexamethasone PO daily on days 1-7 (and
      15-21 for patients age &lt; 55 years); methotrexate IT on day 2; cyclophosphamide PO or IV over
      30 minutes on day 29; cytarabine IV over 30 minutes or SC on days 30-33 and 37-40;
      mercaptopurine PO on days 29-42 and CD20 positive patients may receive rituximab on day 8.
      Beginning 8 weeks from day 1 of course 3, patients receive cytarabine, etoposide,
      methotrexate, and CD20 positive patients may optionally receive rituximab as in course 1.
      Patients randomized to blinatumomab repeat course 4 and then receive blinatumomab IV
      continuously on days 1-28.

      MAINTENANCE THERAPY: Within 12 weeks after beginning last course of consolidation therapy,
      patients receive mercaptopurine PO daily, methotrexate PO or IV over 6 hours once weekly for
      2.5 years, vincristine sulfate IV on day 1 every 3 months, prednisone PO on days 1-5 every 3
      months, and methotrexate IT on day 1 every 3 months. Treatment continues for up to 2.5 years
      in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 2 years,
      every 6 months for 3 years, and then every 12 months for 5 years.

    <description>Estimates of relapse-free survival, including medians and confidence intervals, will be calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method. Comparison of relapse-free survival between treatment arms will be conducted using the one-sided stratified log-rank test with minimal residual disease status, age, CD20 status, rituximab use, and whether patients intend to receive hematopoietic stem cell transplantation or not as stratification factors. Stratified on those factors, Cox proportional hazards models, will also be used to assess the treatment effect by adjusting other possible clinical and biological risk factors, including cytogenetic abnormalities and the receipt of transplant (included as a time-varying covariate).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Minimal residual disease status</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 32 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Minimal residual disease will be assessed after induction and intensification chemotherapy (but before randomization), after two courses of blinatumomab or consolidation, and prior to the start of the maintenance therapy. The study will have 91% power to detect this difference using two-sided Fisher's exact test at the significance level of 0.05.</description>

    <description>Classified as either possibly, probably, or definitely related to study treatment. The maximum grade for each type of toxicity will be recorded for each patient, and frequency tables will be reviewed to determine toxicity patterns. In addition, we will review all adverse event data that is graded as 3, 4, or 5 and classified as either &quot;unrelated or unlikely to be related&quot; to study treatment in the event of an actual relationship developing.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Identification and characterization of the BCR/ABL1-like phenotype</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 2 years</time_frame>
    <description>Cox regression analysis will be used to assess whether BCR-ABL-like phenotype is an independent predictor for overall survival (and relapse-free survival), adjusted by treatment effect, minimal residual disease status, age, cytogenetic abnormalities, CD20 status, rituximab use, and whether patients intend to receive hematopoietic stem cell transplantation or not. If a strong interaction effect is detected, Cox regression analysis will be used to look at the treatment difference separately within each of the BCR-ABL-like phenotype categories (negative/positive) to see if the magnitude and direction of the treatment effect differs by phenotype.</description>

                  therapy for control of leukocyte count and/or other symptoms or signs;
                  corticosteroids can be given after pre-registration to the protocol and
                  submission of baseline marrow and blood samples for control of leukocyte count
                  and/or other symptoms or signs prior to initiation of protocol therapy if needed;

             cytogenetics, fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and/or polymerase chain
             reaction (PCR); patients who are negative for the Philadelphia chromosome by
             conventional cytogenetics must have FISH or PCR performed for BCR/ABL to exclude
             occult translocations

          -  Cytogenetic analysis must be performed from diagnostic bone marrow (preferred) or if
             adequate number of circulating blasts from peripheral blood; FISH testing for common
             B-lineage ALL abnormalities including t(9;22) (BCR/ABL1), t(12;21) (ETS-variant gene 6

                  PUNCTURE SITE); ONLY SUBMIT ASPIRATES FROM THE FIRST PULL OF AN ASPIRATION SITE
                  FOR MRD TESTING; DO NOT SUBMIT SAMPLES FROM THE SECOND OR THIRD PULL OF THE SAME
                  ASPIRATION SITE

               -  In B-lineage ALL, MRD levels in peripheral blood or from a dilute marrow
                  aspiration can be 300% lower, on average, than those in bone marrow at a given
                  time point; submitting a first pull from a separate aspiration site will ensure
                  that MRD determinations used in randomization and trial interpretation are
                  accurate

                    -  NOTE: failure to submit bone marrow aspirates will result in a major
                       violation at the time of an audit

          -  CRITERIA FOR ALLOGENEIC TRANSPLANTATION

          -  A suitable donor must be identified; there are no restrictions on donor type and can
             include a matched sibling, a matched or mismatched unrelated donor, a family haplotype
             matched donor or a cord blood donor (single or double)

          -  Patients should meet the eligibility criteria for RANDOMIZATION TO BLINATUMOMAB OR NO
             BLINATUMOMAB-STEP 3

          -  Patients must be considered reliable enough to comply with the medication regimen and
             follow-up, and have social support necessary to allow this compliance

          -  CRITERIA FOR MAINTENANCE THERAPY-STEP 4: Patients must have an ECOG performance status
             of 0-3

          -  CRITERIA FOR MAINTENANCE THERAPY-STEP 4: Patients must have maintained peripheral
             blood evidence of a remission and must have a CR or CRi, confirmed on restaging BM
             aspirate and biopsy

          -  CRITERIA FOR MAINTENANCE THERAPY-STEP 4: Patients must have resolved any serious
             infectious complications related to therapy

          -  CRITERIA FOR MAINTENANCE THERAPY-STEP 4: Any significant medical complications related
             to therapy must have resolved
