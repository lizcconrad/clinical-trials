    <textblock>
      You are being asked to take part in this study because you have chronic lymphocytic leukemia
      (CLL) with a chromosomal abnormality (17p/TP53 deletion) or CLL that has come back after
      treatment.

      The goal of this clinical research study is to learn if the combination of ibrutinib and
      rituximab can help to control CLL better than ibrutinib alone. The safety of these treatments
      will be also studied.

      Study Groups and Drug Administration:

      If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, you will be randomly assigned (as
      in the flip of a coin) to 1 of 2 study groups. This is done because no one knows if one study
      group is better, the same, or worse than the other group. There is an equal chance of being
      in either group.

        -  Group 1 will receive ibrutinib alone.

        -  Group 2 will receive ibrutinib plus rituximab.

      Study Drug Administration:

      Each cycle is 28 days.

      If you are in Group 1, you will take 3 capsules of ibrutinib by mouth 1 time every day with 1
      cup (8 ounces) of water.

      If you are in Group 2, you will take 3 capsules of ibrutinib by mouth 1 time every day with 1
      cup of water. Your doctor will tell you if you will start taking the ibrutinib on Day 1 or
      Day 2 of Cycle 1. You will receive rituximab by vein over between 3 and 8 hours on Days 1, 8,
      15, and 22 of Cycle 1, then on Day 1 of Cycles 2-6.

      If you miss a dose of ibrutinib, it can be taken as soon as possible on the same day with a
      return to the normal schedule the following day. You should not take extra capsules to make
      up the missed dose.

      Study Visits:

      On Days 8, 15, and 22 of Cycle 1:

        -  You will have a physical exam.

        -  Blood (about 1-2 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests.

      After Cycles 1-6, then Cycles 9, 12, 15, 18, 21, and 24:

        -  You will have a physical exam.

        -  Blood (about 1-2 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests.

      After Cycle 3 or 6, you will have a CT scan, MRI, or PET scan of the chest, abdomen, and
      pelvis to check the status of the disease.

      After Cycles 12 and 24, then every 12 cycles if the doctor thinks it is needed:

        -  You will have a bone marrow aspiration to check the status of the disease.

        -  You will have a CT scan, MRI, or PET scan of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis to check the
           status of the disease.

      Once every 6 months after Cycle 24:

        -  You will have a physical exam.

        -  Blood (about 1-2 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests.

      Length of Study:

      You may continue taking ibrutinib for as long as the doctor thinks it is in your best
      interest. You will no longer be able to take the study drug if the disease gets worse, if
      intolerable side effects occur, or if you are unable to follow study directions.

      Your participation on the study will be over after the follow-up visits.

      Follow-Up:

      At 60 days after the last dose of study drug(s), then about every 4 months for 5 years (or
      until the disease gets worse or a new treatment is started), blood (about 1-2 teaspoons) will
      be drawn for routine tests.

      This is an investigational study. Ibrutinib is FDA approved and commercially available for
      the treatment of patients with mantle cell lymphoma and in patients with CLL who have
      received at least 1 prior treatment. Its use in this study is investigational. Rituximab is
      FDA approved and commercially available for the treatment of CLL. The combination of
      rituximab and ibrutinib is investigational.

      Up to 208 participants will be enrolled in this study. All will be enrolled at MD Anderson.

          1. Patients must have a diagnosis CLL/SLL or Prolymphocytic Leukemia (PLL) and be
             previously treated. Given the poor outcome of CLL/SLL/PLL patients with 17p del or
             TP53 mutation to standard frontline chemo-immunotherapy, such patients will be
             eligible if they are untreated.

          2. Patients must have an indication for treatment by 2008 IWCLL Criteria.

          3. Patients must be age &gt;/= 18 years at the time of signing informed consent, understand
             and voluntarily sign an informed consent, and be able to comply with study procedures
             and follow-up examinations.

          4. ECOG performance status of 0-2.

          5. Patients of childbearing potential must be willing to practice highly effective birth
             control (e.g., condoms, implants, injectables, combined oral contraceptives,
             intrauterine devices [IUDs], sexual abstinence, or sterilized partner) during the
             study and for 30 days after the last dose of study drug. Women of childbearing
             potential include any female who has experienced menarche and who has not undergone
             successful surgical sterilization (hysterectomy, bilateral tubal ligation, or
             bilateral oophorectomy) or is not postmenopausal.

          6. Adequate renal and hepatic function as indicated by all of the following: Total
             bilirubin &lt;/=1.5 x institutional Upper Limit of Normal (ULN) except for patients with
             bilirubin elevation due to Gilbert's disease who will be allowed to participate; an
             ALT &lt;/=2.5 x ULN; and an estimated creatinine clearance (CrCl) of &gt; 30 mL/min, as
             calculated by the Cockcroft- Gault equation unless disease related.

             breast, who are eligible even if they are currently treated or have been treated
             and/or diagnosed in the past 3 years prior to study enrolment. If patients have
             another malignancy that was treated within the last 3 years, such patients can be
             enrolled, after consultation with the Principal Investigator, if the likelihood of
             requiring systemic therapy for this other malignancy within 2 years is less than 10%,
             as determined by an expert in that particular malignancy at MD Anderson Cancer Center.

          8. A Urine Pregnancy Test (within 7 days of enrollment date) is required for women with
             childbearing potential.

             despite appropriate antibiotics or other treatment).

          6. Patients with uncontrolled Autoimmune Hemolytic Anemia (AIHA) or autoimmune
