  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the clinical efficacy, the safety and acceptability
      of three new oral sprays with a reference oral spray in the relief of drug-induced xerostomia
      associated with hyposialia, i.e. dryness of the mouth induced by a decrease of salivation
      (hyposialia) induced by chronic drug intake.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Male and female subjects,

          -  Adult subjects (≥18 years) taking drug(s) causing salivary hypofunction / xerostomia,
             for at least 1 week prior to study initiation and expected to continue without change
             during study

          -  Subjects with a complaint of dry mouth as assessed by a response of 40mm or greater on
             item &quot;Rate the dryness of your mouth&quot; of the Dry Mouth Visual Analogue Scale (VAS)
             questions. (The VAS limits will be 0 representing normal [i.e. no dry mouth symptoms]
             and 100 representing &quot;the worst imaginable&quot; dry mouth symptoms). This score should
             also be met before the 1st product application, on P1 D1.

          -  Documented hyposalivation with test of resting saliva weight absorbed ≤ 0.5g/5 min at
             baseline

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Presence of disorders (bucco-dental disease, history of major medical/psychiatric
             illness or surgery, ... ) which, in the judgement of the investigator, may interfere
             with study implementation and/or study parameter assessment(s).

          -  Sjögren syndrome and related autoimmune diseases,

          -  Other medical causes of xerostomia (oral candidiasis).

          -  History of head and neck irradiation and cancer chemotherapy

          -  History of hypersensitivity to any of the components of the investigational products,

          -  History or current excessive use of alcohol,

          -  History of drug addiction,

          -  Presence of treatments for their dry mouth within 7 days prior to inclusion into the
             study
