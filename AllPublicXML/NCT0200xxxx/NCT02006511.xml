  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Wound complications associated with surgical incisions range from minor to life threatening.
      Surgical site infections occurring usually occur within 30 days and are one of the most
      common surgical complications. Perigraft infections in groin wounds can be devastating. Even
      superficial wounds can progress to deep wounds resulting in graft infection, need for
      explantation, and sepsis or amputation requirement. Negative pressure wound therapy has had
      favorable results on closed wounds in trauma populations. Similarly, negative pressure wound
      therapy has had positive benefits in closed incisions such as sternal wounds following
      cardiac surgery. As a result, the PrevenaTM Incision Management System(IMS) was developed to
      allow easier application of negative pressure therapy to closed wounds. Application of the
      PrevenaTM IMS dressing would portend the aforementioned benefits of Vacuum Assisted Closure
      (VAC®) therapy with the added benefits of protecting the wound from contamination and
      bolstering the wound edges for better approximation and consequently better aesthetic
      outcome. However, no comparison between negative pressure therapy as a dressing and standard
      wound dressings exists.

      The purpose of this study is to assess the efficacy and safety of topical negative pressure
      therapy application with Prevena™ versus standard of care wound therapy on closed groin
      incisions in high risk patients undergoing vascular surgery.
