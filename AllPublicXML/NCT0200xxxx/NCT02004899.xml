  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Epidural analgesia is the most effective form of labor pain relief. Low doses of local
      anesthetic (freezing solutions) in combination with opioids (narcotics) are commonly used as
      epidural solutions to provide pain relief. Low dose local anesthetic solutions with opioids
      for labor have been shown to decrease motor block (leg weakness or temporary paralysis),
      without affecting labor pain relief. However, onset of pain relief can be delayed with these
      low dose solutions. The standard epidural solution used at Victoria Hospital is a low dose of
      local anesthetic called bupivacaine mixed with fentanyl, an opioid, for labor epidural pain
      relief.

      There is some evidence that the addition of more fentanyl to the epidural bolus dose of
      bupivacaine at the start of labor epidural analgesia can speed onset of pain relief. Both
      medications are safe for you and your baby.

      This study will investigate whether the addition of different doses of fentanyl (20 mcg, 50
      mcg and 100 mcg) to the epidural bolus dose speeds onset of pain relief.

      The study hypothesis is that the onset of epidural labor analgesia will be shortest with the
      larger fentanyl epidural bolus.
