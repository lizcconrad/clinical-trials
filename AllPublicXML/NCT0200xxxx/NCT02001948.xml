    <textblock>
      The aim of this study was to compare the effects of two different doses of intrathecal
      morphine (0.1 mg and 0.4 mg) combined with 7.5 mg of heavy bupivacaine on postoperative block
      regression times, postoperative analgesia and the severity of side effects, for inguinal
      hernia repairs.

      The purpose of this study was to compare spinal anesthesia with low dose heavy bupivacaine
      combined with 0.1 mg or 0.4 mg of morphine in inguinal hernia repair surgeries. Anesthesia
      onset time (sensory and motor blocks) as well as postoperative recovery (first mobilisation,
      first voiding) time were compared. Also the postoperative pain management and side effects
      (nausea, vomiting and pruritus) were assessed.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Sensory and motor block</measure>
    <time_frame>The change in motor block and sensory block levels will be assessed after performing spinal block, every 5 minutes for 30 minutes and then at the end of the procedure.</time_frame>
    <description>Sensory and motor block produced by the spinal anaesthesia will be assessed prior the procedure to define readiness for surgery and then once the procedure is over, sensory and motor block levels will be assessed one more time to follow up the block regression times. Motor block will be assessed with Bromage scale (0: no motor block, 1: hip blocked; 2: hip and knee blocked; 3: hip, knee and ankle blocked). Sensory block will be assessed using loss of pinprick sensation. The onset of surgical anesthesia is defined as loss of pinprick sensation at ≥ T10 with a Bromage score ≥ 2.</description>
