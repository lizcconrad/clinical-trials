    <textblock>
      The purpose of this open-label, multicenter, randomized, Phase III study is to evaluate the
      benefit of venetoclax in combination with rituximab compared with bendamustine in combination
      with rituximab in participants with relapsed or refractory CLL. Participants will be randomly
      assigned in 1:1 ratio to receive either venetoclax + rituximab (Arm A) or bendamustine +
      rituximab (Arm B).

Part 2: 6-items to assess Interference (symptom distress) (average of Questions 20 to 25; total 6 items: general activity, walking, work, mood, relations with other people, and enjoyment of life). Each item was rated from 0 to 10, with lower scores indicating better outcome. Total score for Core Symptom Severity, Module Symptom Severity, and Interference are reported which range from 0 to 10, with lower scores indicating better health-related quality of life (HRQoL).</description>

    <description>The EORTC QLQ-C30 is a validated self-report measure consisting of 30 questions incorporated into five functional scales (Physical, Role, Cognitive, Emotional, and Social scales), three symptom scales (fatigue, pain, nausea, and vomiting scales), a global health status/global QoL scale, and single items (dyspnea, appetite loss, sleep disturbance, constipation, and diarrhea). Most questions used 4-point scale (1='Not at all' to 4='Very much'), while 2 questions used 7-point scale (1='very poor' to 7='Excellent'). Functional scales score and global health status/global QoL scale score are reported. Scores were averaged, transformed to 0-100 scale; where higher score for functional scales = poor level of functioning and higher score for global health status/global QoL = better HRQoL.</description>

    <description>The EORTC QLQ-CLL16 module is designed for participants with Stage 0 to Stage 4 CLL. It is composed of 16 questions and there are four multi-item scales on Fatigue (2 items), Treatment-related side effects (TRSE, 4 items), Disease-related symptoms (DRS, 4 items), and Infection (4 items); and two single-item scales on social activities and future health worries. Multi-item scales score are reported and the total score for each multi-item scale was transformed to result in a total score range of 0 to 100, where higher score = poor HRQoL.</description>

    <description>Participants will receive bendamustine 70 milligrams per meter squared (mg/m^2) via intravenous (IV) infusion on Days 1 and 2 of each 28-day cycle for 6 cycles, in combination with rituximab 375 mg/m^2 via IV infusion on Day 1 of Cycle 1 followed by 500 mg/m^2 on Day 1 of Cycles 2-6.</description>

Then the dose will be incremented weekly up to a maximum dose of 400 mg. Participants will then continue receiving venetoclax 400 mg QD from Week 6 (Day 1 of Cycle 1 of combination therapy) onwards, as directed by the investigator, in combination with rituximab 375 mg/m^2 via IV infusion on Day 1 of Cycle 1 followed by 500 mg/m^2 on Day 1 of Cycles 2-6.</description>
