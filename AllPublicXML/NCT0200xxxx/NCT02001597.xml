  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Radical prostatectomy, or the surgical extirpation of the prostate, is a standard treatment
      for prostate cancer. The state of the art radical prostatectomy involves a robotic
      laparoscopic surgery system (the da Vinci) which provides the surgeon with excellent 3D
      visualization of the surgical site and improved dexterity over standard laparoscopic
      instruments. While the long term prognosis of prostate cancer patients who undergo radical
      prostatectomy has improved significantly over the past two decades, there remain significant
      rates of disease recurrence and complications.

      The investigators hypothesis is that advanced trans-rectal ultrasound (TRUS) imaging can be
      deployed and used easily during surgery, can be registered to the robot coordinate systems
      with high accuracy, and can be controlled from the surgeon's console, in order to improve the
      visualization of the prostate and peri-prostatic anatomy, and in order to produce a cancer
      probability map that can be used to make decisions on surgical margins.

      The investigators objectives are

        1. To demonstrate that TRUS imaging can be integrated with the da Vinci radical
           prostatectomy

        2. To determine the ability of TRUS imaging to intra-operatively visualize the prostate and
           peri-prostatic tissue from the surgical console

      This is an observational study; trans-rectal ultrasound will be used to visualize the
      prostate and periprostatic structures during surgery but the standard of care will not be
      affected by this ultrasound imaging.
