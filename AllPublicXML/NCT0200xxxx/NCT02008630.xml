  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall research aim of this study is to investigate changes in measures related to the
      risk of falls among elderly with dementia participating in animal-assisted interventions.
      Also relatives' experience of own and the elderly's situation during and after the
      intervention will be examined. The design will be a prospective and cluster randomized
      multicenter trial, but mixed-methods will be used to target different outcomes. The study
      population will be elderly (age above 65) at day care centers diagnosed with dementia, or
      having a cognitive deficit. The intervention will consist of 30 minutes sessions with
      animal-assisted activity or animal-assisted therapy two times a week for 12 weeks in groups
      of 4-6 participants. Control groups will receive treatment as usual. Research questions:

        1. Is there an effect in use of ordinary and optional medication among elderly persons with
           dementia at day care centers participating in animal-assisted interventions compared to
           a control group?

        2. Is there an effect on social interaction, quality of life, activeness and wellbeing
           among elderly persons with dementia at day care centers participating in animal-assisted
           interventions compared to a control group?

        3. Is there an effect on balance among elderly persons with dementia at day care centers
           participating in animal-assisted therapy compared to animal-assisted activity or a
           control group?

        4. Do relatives of elderly persons with dementia at day care centers experience a change in
           their own and the elderly's situation after the intervention compared with before the
           intervention started?
