      Primary Objective: To evaluate the safety, tolerability and maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of
      daily oral administration of metatinib tromethamine in subjects with solid tumors;
      Investigate the influence of food on pharmacokinetic parameters.

      Secondary Objective: To evaluate the plasma pharmacokinetics (PK) of daily oral
      administration of metatinib tromethamine in subjects with solid tumors; To observe
      preliminary anti-tumor efficacy; To evaluate potential pharmacodynamic and predictive
      biomarkers at MTD.
