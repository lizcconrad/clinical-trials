    <textblock>
      The main aim of this study is to examine the effectiveness of a web-based CBT protocol
      (entitled Meeky Mouse) in the treatment of children with Selective Mutism in Singapore. The
      researchers hypothesized that the Meeky Mouse program would be associated with higher
      frequency of speaking behaviors, lower levels of anxiety, greater improvements in
      clinician-rated severity of mental illness, and higher clinician-rated improvement scores at
      post-treatment.
