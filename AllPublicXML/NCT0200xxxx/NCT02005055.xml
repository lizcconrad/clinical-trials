      This prospective study evaluates the outcome of surgical excision with adjuvant
      high-dose-rate brachytherapy for the treatment of recalcitrant keloids. Main outcomes are
      recurrence rate, scar quality and physical complaints.

      This prospective evaluation describes the outcome of surgical excision with adjuvant
      high-dose-rate brachytherapy for the treatment of recalcitrant keloids in a large mixed
      Fitzpatrick skin type patient population. After intralesional excision, a unique low dose
      radiation scheme of 2x6Gray (Gy) was administered in 2 fractions: the first within 4 hours,
      the second within 24 hours. Keloids were evaluated pre- and postoperative (1 week, 3, 6, 12
      months, 5years). Scars were measured and recurrence was judged. An evaluation of the outcome
      of the scars was obtained using the Patient and Observer Scar Assessment Scale. Statistical
      analyses were conducted using SPSS version 20.0 (SPSS, Inc, Chicago, III)

    <description>The keloid was excised extralesionally and subsequently a metal tipped Varisource catheter was positioned between the dermal edges of the wound, 5 mm below the surface of the skin and extending out of the skin beyond the wound. Primary wound closure was performed and patients were transferred to the radiation department, where the catheter was connected to the Iridium-192 remote control afterloader. The planning target volume was defined as a cylinder along the axis of the scar, with a central diameter of 5mm. Patients received 2 fractions of HighDoseRate brachytherapy. Within 4 hours after the resection, the first brachytherapy fraction of 6 Gy at 5mm of the source axis was given. Within 24 hours after the first fraction a second fraction of 6Gy was administered to a total dose of 12Gy in 2 days. After the second fraction the catheter was gently removed.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Keloid defined as excessive scar tissue raised above skin level and proliferating
             beyond the confines of the original lesion. Keloids were distinguished from
             hypertrophic scars based on the clinical judgment of experienced plastic surgeons and
             on the age of the scar (&gt;1yr)

          -  the keloid had been proven insensitive to at least one other treatment

          -  patients had to be older than 10 years of age.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  keloids not suitable for excision with primary closure due to its size or anatomical
             location

          -  pregnancy or diabetes
