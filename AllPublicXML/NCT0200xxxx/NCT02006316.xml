  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate whether clinical varicoceles are associated with
      abnormal semen parameters and whether varicocelectomy could improve the semen parameter in
      patients unrelated with infertility.

    <textblock>
      While most studies are continued to validate the observations of significant improvements in
      sperm density and motility after varicocele ligation in infertile patients, there have been
      few studies to investigate the effects of varicocelectomy on semen parameters in adult men
      unrelated with infertility. The purpose of this study was to determine whether
      varicocelectomy could improve the semen parameter of these patients as well as whether
      clinical varicoceles are associated with abnormal semen parameters in patients unrelated with
      infertility.
