  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This one-year randomized crossover study is proposed to compare the changes of postprandial
      oxidative stress (POS) after consumption of meals from different cultures in healthy Chinese
      adults, using a 'real-life, cultural meal' approach. It is hypothesized that the changes of
      POS differ with meals from different cultures. Four cultural meals are chosen, namely
      Southern Chinese, Northern Chinese, American, and South Indian, based on the known prevalence
      of chronic diseases between Caucasians, Chinese and Indians, and within the Southern and
      Northern Chinese population.
