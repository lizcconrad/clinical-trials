    <textblock>
      The best strategy to prevent colorectal cancer (CRC) death lies in early detection and early
      treatment at the local disease status of tumor. After curative resection of tumor, there are
      about 5~10% of stage I, 20~30% of stage II and 40~50% of stage III patients suffering
      metastasis during subsequent follow-up periods. Although carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) is
      the most widely used biomarker for postoperative monitoring of recurrence on asymptomatic
      patients, it is difficult to use CEA as biological marker to identify the population with
      high recurrent risk in patients with early-stage cancer because lower than half of patients
      with early-stage cancer do not have CEA elevation. For improving the survival of patients
      with early-stage CRC, we need effort to search more useful biological markers to predict the
      risk of tumor recurrence and to select out patients with high recurrent risk to receive
      preventive adjuvant therapy.

      Circulating tumor cells (CTCs) in the blood play an essential role in cancer metastasis.
      Hence, the detection of CTCs and subsequent analysis can potentially revolutionize the cancer
      care ranging from screening, diagnosis, monitoring, to drug selection and so on. In the past
      decade, many methods using magnetic beads (CellSearch), filtration (RareCelletc), or flow
      cytometry have been developed but all of them have the shortcomings from low sensitivity, low
      purity, to unable to retrieve cells for downstream molecular analysis and cell culture.
      Recently, a biomimetic affinity based microfluidic platform has overcome abovementioned
      technical challenges. Importantly, by using only 2 ml of peripheral blood, Sinica's team has
      shown that the enumeration of CTCs increases with the CRC disease progression, where the mean
      CTC counts are 3, 15, 29 and 60 per ml for the stages I, II, III and IV, respectively. The
      results imply that monitoring CTC enumeration serially may serve as a prediction marker to
      identify the CRC patients with high probability of recurrence. The aims of this study are
      toestablishing CTC platform standard operation protocol (SOP) that leads to certification of
      ISO 13485 and to establish CTC criteria and evaluate its prediction power of early detection
      of colorectal cancer recurrence.
