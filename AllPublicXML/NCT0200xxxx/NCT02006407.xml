    <textblock>
      This is a pilot study to assess the changes in white matter, in the brain, in response to
      radiation therapy and correlate these changes with later declines in cognitive function.

    <time_frame>Baseline, 3 weeks, and 6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Determine the change in cognitive test scores from baseline to time-points early during radiation therapy (3 and 6 weeks) using CogState (a computerized software testing system that offers various cognitive assessments based on expansive neurocognitive tests). Correlate test scores from COGState with changes in Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI) at the same timepoints using scatter plots with Pearson and Spearman's correlation coefficients. As a pilot study multiple comparisons will be assessed; however, the working hypothesis is that DTI changes as measured by an increase in diffusivity of water perpendicular to the direction of axonal transport will be measurable even in this acute setting and will correlate with global response as measured on COGState with the sub-domains on executive function anticipated to be most highly correlated.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Pediatric patients (age 6-21) who will receive cranial radiotherapy for brian tumors.
             This could include but is not limited to: low grade glioma, high grade glioma (to
             include grade III but not grade IV glioma), germ cell tumors, primitive
             neuroectodermal tumors, craniopharyngioma, or medulloblastoma.

          -  Patients should, in the estimate of the treating physician, be anticipated to have a
             median survival of greater than 1 year.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with previous Central Nervous System (CNS) radiation or or CNS tumors that,
             in the judgement of the investigators, are likely to undergo progression during or
             shortly after radiotherapy are excluded.

          -  Patients with glioblastoma, multiforme, gliosarcoma, diffuse pontine glioma, or other
             tumors presumed to have expected median survival per the investigators of less than 1
             year.

          -  Patients who require sedation for Magnetic Resonance Imagining (MRI)are excluded.

          -  Patients at risk for nephrogenic systemic sclerosis will be excluded as a safety
             precaution due to the contrast used in the scans.

Correlate test scores from COGState with changes in Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI) at the same timepoints (Baseline and 6 months) using scatter plots with Pearson and Spearman's correlation coefficients. As a pilot study multiple comparisons will be assessed; however, the working hypothesis based upon results in adults treated with radiation therapy is that DTI changes as measured by an increase in diffusivity of water perpendicular to the direction of axonal transport will correlate with changes in global response as measured on COGState with the sub-domains on executive function most highly correlated. In addition, these regional changes in DTI will be directly related to the radiation doses received in these regions.</description>

          <description>Patients receiving standard cranial radiotherapy will undergo (1) Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) with Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI) and (2) Neuro-cognitive testing (CogState-a computerized software testing system that offers various cognitive assessments based on traditional expansive neurocognitive tests) at four timepoints (Baseline, 3 weeks, 6 weeks and 6 months).
Cranial Radiotherapy: Standard cranial radiotherapy administered dependent upon patient and brain tumor type.
MRI with Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI): Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) with Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI)
Neuro-cognitive Testing (CogState): CogState is a computerized software testing system that offers various cognitive assessments based traditional expansive neurocognitive tests.</description>
