      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the Threshold Suspend (TS) feature of the Medtronic
      MiniMed® 530G insulin pump in patients 16 and older with insulin requiring diabetes.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The evaluation of Threshold Suspend(TS) feature is conducted by two sub-studies: 1)
      Multi-Center Trial; 2) Commercial Data Evaluation. Multi-center trial is initiated to observe
      the Threshold Suspend (TS) feature with a sensor-augmented insulin pump (Medtronic MiniMed®
      530G insulin pump) in patients 16 and older with insulin requiring diabetes over a period of
      one year.

      In addition, additional data from commercial use will be analyzed/summarized to support the
      Multi-center trial as the enrolled population is lower (N=426) than the anticipated N=1000
      subjects

             screening.

          3. Subject is currently on pump therapy.

          4. Subject is transitioning to the 530G insulin pump system with the TS feature turned
             ON.

          5. Subject is willing to complete all study related activities

          6. Subject is willing to upload data every 21 days from the study pump

          7. Subject must have Internet access and access to a computer system that meets the

          8. Subject is able (by insurance or financial means) to cover the initial investment and
             ongoing cost of the 530G insulin pump and consumables, CGM, Bayer CONTOUR Next Link RF
             enabled meter and supplies for the length of the study- 1 year.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Subject is actively participating in an investigational study (drug or device) wherein
             he/she has received treatment from an investigational study drug or investigational
