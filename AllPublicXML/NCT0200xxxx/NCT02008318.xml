    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the effect of the study drug known as LY2157299
      on red blood cells in participants with myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS). Participants with
      different degrees of disease (very low, low, and intermediate risk) will be studied. The
      study treatment is expected to last about 6 months for each participant.
