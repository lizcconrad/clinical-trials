  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Sustained clinical remission from the treated osteoarticular infection</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year after study drug completion</time_frame>
    <description>Sustained clinical remission is defined by the absence of either clinical or microbiological evidence of failure at 1 year after study drug completion, in patients who complete the protocol's antibiotic regimen(s) and did not require subsequent antibiotics for their osteoarticular infection beyond the protocol prescribed regimen.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Initial clinical success from the treated osteoarticular infection</measure>
    <time_frame>30 days after conclusion of study antibiotic</time_frame>
    <description>Initial clinical success will be measured by the agreement of the Infectious disease consultant and Orthopedic surgeon that the patient has had a positive response to therapy. Success will be measured by decrease of CRP (C reactive protein) by 50% from baseline if initially elevated, no evidence of drainage, sinus tract formation or infection related bone instability. Follow up cultures, if available are negative for originally isolated organism. In patients with prothetic joints no new warmth, tenderness or inflammation.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Number of participants with defined symptoms, signs and lab values as markers of safety and tolerance.</measure>
    <time_frame>Day one through one year after completion of study drug.</time_frame>
    <description>Symptoms will be assessed daily by study team while patient is hospitalized and reviewed weekly by investigator while the patient is receiving study drug. Specific symptoms will include fever, chills, rash, nausea. diarrhea, abdominal pain, pain at the surgical/infection site, vertigo, shortness of breath, hives or other rash. A baseline physical will be performed on enrollment and repeated each week at follow up visits. Labs will checked at baseline, then daily through hospitalization and then weekly. If patient develops persistent diarrhea a stool test for C. Diff PCR (polymerase chain reaction) will be performed.</description>
