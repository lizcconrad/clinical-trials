    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to compare the efficacy and tolerability of low-dose
      statin therapy vs. the association between a low-dose statin and a nutraceutical-based
      protocol in high-dose statin-intolerant patients with coronary artery disease deemed to be at
      high-risk.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Several clinical trials have shown that in patients with atherosclerotic cardiovascular
      disease, reduction of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) level with a
      beta-hydroxy-beta-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitor (ie, statin) is associated
      with significant reductions in both mortality rate and major cardiac events.

      Accordingly, current guidelines recommend that high-intensity statin therapy—such as
      rosuvastatin 20 to 40 mg or atorvastatin 80 mg—should be used to achieve at least a 50%
      reduction in LDL cholesterol unless otherwise contraindicated.

      In real world clinical practice, however, high-intensity statin treatment is often
      discontinued by patients due to side effects. As alternatives, nonstatin drugs, such as
      ezetimibe, are often prescribed in association with moderate-to-low intensity statin.

      It remains unknown, however, whether the association between moderate-to-low intensity statin
      therapy and and nutraceuticals (i.e. compounds derived from foods with cholesterol lowering
      actions) can have a therapeutic role in high-intensity statin-intolerant patients.
