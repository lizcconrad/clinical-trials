    <textblock>
      The number of studies concerning health related quality of life (HRQL) in children with food
      allergy is very limited.

      Only one study to date has compared HRQL of a group of children with food allergy to data
      published on general population and other chronic diseases. This study concluded to lowest
      HRQL scores in food allergic children compared to type 1 diabetes mellitus with important
      impact on scores concerning social activities.

      Primary aim:

      To compare generic HRQL score in children with food allergy with other chronic diseases and
      with healthy chidren in an homogeneous socio-cultural context.

      Secondary aims :

        -  To compare generic and specific HRQL scores in children with food allergy

        -  Identifify in chidren with food allergy, clinical factrors assocated with lowest scores
           in order to improve our management.

      Methods

      Generic HRQL questionnaire (CHQ-87) will be distributed :

        -  after hospital consultation for patients

        -  in schools for healthy children A specific HRQL questionnaire (FAQLQ-CF or TF) and the &quot;
           Food Allergy Independent Measure &quot; will also distributed to chidren with food allergy.
