    <textblock>
      Measuring basal levels of plasma oxytocin in individuals with typical development across
      childhood and adolescence using both extracted and unextracted EIA methods. This study is
      necessary since there is great variability in reported plasma oxytocin in typically
      developing children from other studies as well as up to 1000 fold variability in such levels
      using different assay procedures. Further existing studies have not clearly described
      variation in levels with age. all samples will be taken in the afternoon.
