    <textblock>
      The study patients are patients suffering from primary or secondary immunodeficiencies
      investigated in the Hospital Necker for a suspected infectious disease.

      The study purpose is to assess the performance of a High Throughput Sequencing method, the
      PATHOQUEST method (from sample preparation to bio informatic analysis), versus the classic
      diagnostic approach.

      The study will evaluate the capacity of the PATHOQUEST method to detect pathogens responsible
      for an infectious disease episode and will also evaluate the delay of obtention of results
      compared to the classic diagnostic approach.
