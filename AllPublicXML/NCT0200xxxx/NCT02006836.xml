  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Food intake has a great influence on blood glucose of patients with diabetes. This study was
      designed to determine the glycemic index (GI) of a particular pomelo named Majia pomelo and
      its effects on postprandial glucose (PPG) excursions in both healthy subjects and patients
      with type 2 diabetes (T2DM).

      The purpose of this study was to evaluate the GI and effects on glucose excursion of Majia
      pomelo in both healthy and diabetic subjects. The results may help diabetic subjects and
      their health care providers in developing a diet that is both medically and culturally
      appropriate.

    <description>Glycemic index (GI) measurement was carried out after an overnight fast on 2 occasions in every subject, each test being separated from the next by a &quot;washout&quot; day.The first test day utilized 50 g of glucose dissolved in 200 ml water followed sequentially by 50g carbohydrate equivalents of the Majia pomelos. Venous blood samples were collected and monitored during 3 hrs for both the healthy and T2DM individuals at 0, 30, 60, 90, 120, 150, and 180 min. Areas under the curves (AUC) of blood glucose concentrations were obtained. The 50 g of glucose was used as the reference (GI = 100) according to the literature. The AUC under the incremental glycemic-response curves for Majia were expressed as a percentage of the areas under the glucose curves for the same subject. The resulting values for all subjects were averaged to calculate the GI.
GI measurement is only calculated in case-control period.</description>

    <description>Patients of Diabetic 2 group were on CSII treatment with insulin subcutaneous pump.The scheme and dose of CSII for each patients were adjusted on the first 3 test days to optimize glucose control, followed by 3-day CSII treatment without change of insulin dose. On the 7th test day, patients consumed 100g Majia pomelos after meals (breakfast, lunch and dinner) for 3 test days. Capillary blood samples were detected before and after meals, 10pm, and 3am. Mean of each time point(before breakfast, 2 hours after breakfast, before lunch, 2 hours after lunch, before dinner, 2 hours after dinner,10pm, and 3am ) of blood glucose concentrations on 4th to 6th day（without pomelo） were calculated and so as each time point of blood glucose concentrations on 7th to 9th day (with pomelo). Areas under the curves (AUC) of mean blood glucose concentrations of each time point were obtained with/without pomelo.</description>

        <title>Glycemic Index</title>
        <description>Glycemic index (GI) measurement was carried out after an overnight fast on 2 occasions in every subject, each test being separated from the next by a “washout” day.The first test day utilized 50 g of glucose dissolved in 200 ml water followed sequentially by 50g carbohydrate equivalents of the Majia pomelos. Venous blood samples were collected and monitored during 3 hrs for both the healthy and T2DM individuals at 0, 30, 60, 90, 120, 150, and 180 min. Areas under the curves (AUC) of blood glucose concentrations were obtained. The 50 g of glucose was used as the reference (GI = 100) according to the literature. The AUC under the incremental glycemic-response curves for Majia were expressed as a percentage of the areas under the glucose curves for the same subject. The resulting values for all subjects were averaged to calculate the GI.
GI measurement is only calculated in case-control period.</description>
