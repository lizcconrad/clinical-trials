    <textblock>
      This is an open-label trial investigating the effect of Spatz 3 intragastric balloon on
      weight loss on obesity and associated co- morbidities.

      The study aim is to evaluate the effect of the intra gastric balloon on weight reduction and
      on related co- morbidities during 1 year of balloon implantation and a year following
      explantation.
