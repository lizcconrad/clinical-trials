      The aim of the present study is to evaluate differential lactate removal kinetics in heart
      failure patients that are trained according to 2 different exercise protocols:

      (A) High intensity intervals training (HIT); (B) Continuous moderate aerobic training (MAT)

      Introduction: Congestive heart failure (CHF) patients suffer from early fatigue and
      functional aerobic impairment. Their reduced cardiac output and O2 delivery to the peripheral
      muscles shifts those patients consistent anaerobic metabolism, thus, CHF patients rely on
      anaerobic metabolism even in everyday life activity. This metabolism leads to a shift of
      muscles fiber types from mainly slow twitch, oxidative type I fibers to fast twitch,
      glycolytic type IIb fibers. Monocarboxylate proteins MCT1 and MCT4 transport lactate crosses
      the membrane. MCT1 is responsible for the lactate uptake and MCT4 is responsible for efflux
      of excess lactate. Exercise training is known to improve the quality of life in CHF. We
      hypothesized that exercise training might change MCT1 and 4 expression and distribution.
      Accordingly, these changes may also affect lactate clearance during recovery, which may
      contribute to the beneficial effect of exercise training in CHF patients. Methods: New-York
      Heart association (NYHA) class II-III CHF patients will be assigned to the experiment. At
      baseline and upon training conclusion they will undergo the same tests battery. The test
      battery includes heart rate, blood pressure measurements, echocardiographic evaluation. All
      participants will fill out &quot;Minnesota living with heart failure&quot; questionnaire. Subsequently,
      after their basal blood lactate will be assessed they will undergo measurement which will be
      followed by lactate clearance-rate evaluation.

      Randomly each patient will then be assigned to one of two experimental training groups: (A)
      High intensity intervals training (HIT); (B) Continuous moderate aerobic training (MAT). Each
      volunteer will be trained twice a week for 12 weeks, according to his/hers assigned training
      protocol and in accordance to exercise training guidelines.
