    <textblock>
      This is a single-arm, multicenter, open-label Phase II, proof-of-mechanism study to evaluate
      the efficacy, safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of losmapimod in approximately 21
      subjects with primary (idiopathic) focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) and substantive
      proteinuria as indicated by a Urinary protein/creatinine Up/c ratio &gt;=2 gram/gram (g/g) or 24
      hr urine protein &gt;=2 g/day. Losmapimod will be orally administered twice daily over a 24-week
      treatment phase followed by a 12-week follow-up for safety and relapse assessments.

    <time_frame>Week 2, Week 4, Week 8, Week 16 and Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>Proteinuria is defined as the presence of an excess of serum proteins in the urine. Participant was considered as a responder on achieving &gt;=50 percent reduction in proteinuria from Baseline (measured as 24 hour total protein) and also having a stable renal function of &gt;=70 percent of Baseline estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) at end of treatment (&gt;=16 Weeks).

    <description>Proteinuria is defined as the presence of an excess of serum proteins in the urine. Participant was considered as responder on achieving &gt;=50 percent reduction in proteinuria from Baseline (measured as 24 hour total protein) and also having a stable renal function of &gt;=70 percent of Baseline eGFR at any time during the treatment phase of the study.

      <recruitment_details>This single-arm, multicenter, fixed sequence open-label study consisted of 2 screening visits, run-in phase before the first dose of study treatment, followed by treatment phase in which participants received losmapimod 7.5 milligrams (mg) twice daily (BID) for 2 weeks and 15 mg BID for an additional 22 weeks, and a follow-up visit (12 weeks).</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>A total of 29 participants were screened and entered into the run-in phase, of which 17 participants received at least one dose of losmapimod.</pre_assignment_details>

        <title>Number of Participants Meeting the Definition of Responder for Reduction in Proteinuria at Any Time During the Treatment Phase (Week 2 to Week 24)</title>
        <description>Proteinuria is defined as the presence of an excess of serum proteins in the urine. Participant was considered as responder on achieving &gt;=50 percent reduction in proteinuria from Baseline (measured as 24 hour total protein) and also having a stable renal function of &gt;=70 percent of Baseline eGFR at any time during the treatment phase of the study. Reduction in proteinuria assessment at any time during the treatment phase of the study was done by utilizing a responder analysis.</description>

        <title>Percent Change From Baseline in Urinary Protein/Creatinine (Up/c) Ratio (Spot and 24 Hours [hr])</title>
        <description>Reduction in proteinuria was measured by the Up/c ratio (spot and 24 hr) at Baseline, Week 2, 4, 8, 16, 24, end of study and at Follow-up (FU) visits Week 30 and 36. Spot urine sample was provided by the participants on site. The 24 hour urine collection started with the second morning void and ended with the first morning void on the following day; generally, 24 hour urine collection was initiated the day prior to the study visit. Baseline was defined as the value obtained at Week 0. Percent change from Baseline was calculated as change from Baseline value divided by Baseline value multiplied by 100. Only those participants available at the specified time points (represented by n=X in the category titles) were analyzed.</description>

Any untoward event resulting in death, life threatening, requires hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, results in disability/incapacity, congenital anomaly/birth defect, any other situation according to medical or scientific judgment or all events of possible drug-induced liver injury with hyperbilirubinaemia were categorized as SAE. Participants having any AE or SAE were included in the analysis.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Systolic Blood Pressure (SBP) and Diastolic Blood Pressure (DBP)</title>
        <description>Blood pressure was measured in a sitting position after 5 minutes rest with comfortably seated, legs uncrossed and the back and arm supported, such that the middle of the cuff on the upper arm is at the level of the right atrium and asked to remove all clothing that covered the location of cuff placement. It was recorded at Screening, Baseline, Week 2, Week 4, Week 8, Week 16, Week 24, End of study, and until the follow-up visit (Week 30 and Week 36). Vital sign measurements were repeated if the values were &lt; 80 mmHg or &gt; 140 mmHg SBP and &lt;40 mmHg or &gt;90 mmHg for DBP. Baseline was defined as the value obtained on Week 0. Change from Baseline was calculated as visit value minus value at Baseline. Only those participants available at the specified time points were analyzed (represented by n=X in the category titles).</description>

        <description>Blood samples were collected at Screening (Week -4 and -2), Baseline (Week 0) and at Weeks 2, 4, 8, 16, 24 and Follow-up (Week 30 and 36) to evaluate ALT, AST, AP and GGT. Baseline was defined as the value obtained at Week 0. Change from Baseline was calculated as visit value minus value at Baseline.
