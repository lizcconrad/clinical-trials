    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to learn about the possible benefits of aerobic exercise in
      controlling or reducing the amount of amyloid present in the brain, reducing changes in brain
      structure that may lead to Alzheimer's Disease (AD), and increasing cognitive ability in
      individuals that have amyloid deposits and are at risk to develop AD.

    <description>amyloid burden measure will be mean change from baseline to 52 weeks in Florbetapir cortical-to-cerebellar ratio averaged across 6 regions of interest (frontal, temporal, parietal, anterior cingulate, posterior cingulate, and precuneus)</description>

    <measure>Change in cognitive function</measure>

    <description>cognitive ability to be measured using confirmatory factor analysis (CFA). CFA aggregates scores from across multiple subtests.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Dietary intake and diet pattern assessment</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Dietary intake will be measured using the Diet History Questionnaire II (DHQII). The DHQII is a survey that measures typical consumption of food and beverage items and converts that information to food group and individual nutrient output. The survey takes about 1 hour to complete. Nutrition output varies on an individual basis as it calculates intake data for numerous nutrition-related variables. This data can then be used to investigate inner-study relationships as well as calculate diet quality through different indices.</description>

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Clinically significant major psychiatric disorder (e.g., Major Depressive Disorder)
