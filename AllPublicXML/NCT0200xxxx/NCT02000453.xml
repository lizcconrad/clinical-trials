  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open label exploratory study to investigate the safety of 400 milligram (mg )
      twice a day (b.i.d.) GSK2586184 in patients with moderate to severe, active ulcerative
      colitis (UC). Study medication will be administered orally (as tablets), twice daily, for up
      to 8 weeks (56 days). Study medication will be taken with food. Each subject will have 6
      out-patient visits: Screening (Day -30 to -1); Baseline and Start of treatment (Day 1); Week
      2 (Day 14); Week 4 (Day 28); Week 8 (Day 56); and Follow-up (Week 12; Day 84). Visit windows
      for weeks 2, 4 and 8 will be + 2 days. The primary objective of this study is to assess the
      safety and tolerability of GSK2586184. The primary endpoints to measure safety are laboratory
      tests (including haematology, clinical chemistry and serum creatinine), vital signs, 12-lead
      electrocardiogram (ECG), physical examination, and adverse event reporting. These are
      standard measurements to evaluate safety.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Male or female, between 18 and 75 years of age inclusive, at the time of signing the
             informed consent.

          -  Moderate to severely active UC at least 6 months prior to Screening confirmed by
             colonoscopy or sigmoidoscopy with video recording, and biopsy.

          -  A Mayo score of 6 to 12 points and endoscopy sub score of 2 to 3 at screening, despite
             concurrent treatment with at least 1 of the following (oral corticosteroids or any
             oral 5-aminosalicylic acid (ASA) or both as defined below): Oral 5-ASA at a stable
             dose (&gt;=2.4grams (g)/day) for at least 4 weeks from first dose. Must remain on a
             stable dose until end of treatment, Stable oral corticosteroid dose (prednisone of
             &lt;=20 mg/day or equivalent) for at least 14 days prior to Baseline (must remain on a
             stable dose until end of treatment).

          -  Otherwise healthy as determined by a responsible and experienced physician, based on a
             medical evaluation including medical history, physical examination, laboratory tests
             and cardiac monitoring. A subject with a clinical abnormality or laboratory parameters
             outside the reference range for the population being studied may be included only if
             the investigator agrees that the finding is unlikely to introduce additional risk
             factors and will not interfere with the study procedures

          -  A female subject is eligible to participate if she is of: Non-childbearing potential
             defined as: pre-menopausal females with a documented tubal ligation or hysterectomy;
             or postmenopausal defined as 12 months of spontaneous amenorrhea.

        In questionable cases a blood sample with simultaneous follicle stimulating hormone (FSH)
        &gt;40 milliinternational units (MlU)/milliliter (mL) and estradiol &lt;40 picograms (pg)/mL
        (&lt;147 picomole [pmol]/liter [L]) is confirmatory). Females on hormone replacement therapy
        (HRT) must discontinue HRT to allow confirmation of post-menopausal status before study
        enrollment. For most forms of HRT, at least 2 to 4 weeks should elapse between the
        cessation of therapy and the blood draw; this interval depends on the type and dosage of
        HRT. Following confirmation of their post-menopausal status, they can resume use of HRT
        during the study without use of a contraceptive method.

          -  Male subjects with female partners of child-bearing potential must agree to use
             acceptable contraception methods. This criterion must be followed during the study and
             for at least 2 weeks after their last dose.

          -  A major organ transplant (e.g. heart, lung, kidney, liver) or haematopoietic stem
             cell/marrow transplant.

             hematologic, gastrointestinal, hepatic, renal, neurological, malignancy or infectious
             diseases) which, in the opinion of the investigator, could confound the results of the
