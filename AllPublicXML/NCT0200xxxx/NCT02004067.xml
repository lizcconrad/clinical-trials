    <textblock>
      In the present study the investigators aim to determine the efficacy of an immunomodulating
      topical medication, compared with a topical lubricant, on the treatment of dry eye disease
      (DED) due to primary or secondary Sjögren's syndrome (aqueous deficient DED) and evaporative
      DED.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Dry eye disease (DED) is a multifactorial disease of the tears and ocular surface that
      results in symptoms of discomfort, visual disturbance, and tear film instability with
      potential damage to the ocular surface. It is accompanied by increased osmolarity of the tear
      film and inflammation of the ocular surface. DED prevalence is estimated around 15 -35% of
      the population over 50 years old. There is a wide variety of topic medications for the
      treatment of DED, though few aim the re-establishment of tear osmolarity equilibrium and
      reduction of damages to the ocular surface. The treatment of DED can include a medical
      treatment, such as tear substitution, tear preservation, production stimulation,
      anti-inflammatory; it can also include surgical treatment, as tarsorrhaphy and salivary gland
      transplant. Considering tear substitutes and anti-inflammatory topical treatments, the
      purpose of our study is to determine efficacy of an immunomodulating topical medication
      containing 0.05% cyclosporine A (CsA), compared to a topical lubricant (vitamin A, Refresh
      Endura®), on the treatment of dry eye disease (DED) due to primary or secondary Sjögren's
      syndrome (aqueous deficient DED) and evaporative DED.
