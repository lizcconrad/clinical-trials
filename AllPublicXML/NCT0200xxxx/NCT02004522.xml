      A Phase 3 clinical trial to examine the efficacy of IPI-145 monotherapy versus ofatumumab
      monotherapy in subjects with relapsed or refractory Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL) or
      Small Lymphocytic Lymphoma (SLL).

    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, two- arm, randomized phase 3, superiority trial designed to evaluate
      the efficacy and safety of IPI-145 compared to ofatumumab administered to patients who have
      been diagnosed with CLL/SLL whose disease is relapsed or refractory.

      Approximately 150 subjects will receive a starting dose of 25 mg IPI-145 BID initially over
      the course of 21-day treatment cycle followed by 28-day treatment cycles for up to 18 cycles
      or until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity (whichever comes first). After 18
      complete cycles of treatment, subjects may receive additional cycles of duvelisib until
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity if they, in the judgment of the Investigator,
      may derive benefit from continued treatment, and if the subject meets the criteria for
      additional treatment at Cycle 19 Day 1.

      Approximately 150 subjects will receive a starting dose of 300 mg ofatumumab on Day 1
      followed by seven weekly doses of 2000 mg. Thereafter, subjects will receive 2000 mg
      ofatumumab once every month for four months. Administration of ofatumumab will not exceed the
      12 doses (within 7 cycles).
