  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Current medical therapies for depression take weeks to achieve full efficacy, and are
      ineffective in many patients or cause intolerable side effects, emphasizing the need for a
      deeper understanding of depression and its treatment. Identifying early brain biomarkers of
      treatments responses seems necessary to improve antidepressant treatment outcome. In this
      study we aim to detect early brain responses to a fast acting antidepressant-like treatment
      administered intravenously during a Real-Time Neurofeedback functional magnetic resonance
      imaging (MRI) Task to predict antidepressant treatment outcome in depression. At completion
      of the neuroimaging task, participants will enter a placebo-controlled clinical trial with a
      selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI).
