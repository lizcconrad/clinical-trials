    <textblock>
      This is a study to evaluate how the body handles and metabolizes (PK) the various doses of
      the drug Tolvaptan, and what the effect (PD) of the various doses of Tolvaptan are on the
      content of &quot;salt&quot; in blood and urine

    <time_frame>Baseline and Day 2</time_frame>
    <description>Fluid intake was monitored on Day 0 (times relative to Day 1 dosing), and Day 1 at intervals of 0 to 6, 6 to 12, and 12 to 24 hours postdose. Fluid intake included fluid used for dosing (study medication and any concomitant medication); food items that included any significant amounts of water (e.g., Jello [including Gelatin and Jelly dessert] and soup) was added to the total fluid intake. Samples were taken on Day 0 (baseline) at the corresponding Day 1 predose time and 12 hours postdose time; and on Day 1 at predose and at 2, 4, 6, 8, 12, and 24 hours postdose.</description>

    <time_frame>2 days</time_frame>
    <description>Fluid intake was monitored on Day 0 (times relative to Day 1 dosing), and Day 1 at intervals of 0 to 6, 6 to 12, and 12 to 24 hours postdose. Fluid intake included fluid used for dosing (study medication and any concomitant medication); food items that included any significant amounts of water (e.g., Jello [including Gelatin and Jelly dessert] and soup) was added to the total fluid intake. Urine was collected for baseline comparison on Day 0 for the 24 hour prior to Day 1 dosing at intervals of 0 to 2, 2 to 4, 4 to 6, 6 to 8, 8 to 12 hours, and 12 to 24 hours relative to the Day 1 dosing time. Fluid balance was determined as fluid intake minus urine output.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in Cumulative Urine Volume at 0-6 Hours, 0-12 Hours and 0-24 Hours.</measure>
    <time_frame>2 days</time_frame>
    <description>Urine was collected for baseline comparison on Day 0 for the 24 hour prior to Day 1 dosing at intervals of 0 to 2, 2 to 4, 4, to 6, 6, to 8, 8, to 12, and 12 to 24 hours relative to Day 1 dosing time. Urine was collected on Day 1 at intervals of 0 to 2,2 to 4, 4 to 6, 6 to 8, 8 to 12, and 12 to 24 hours postdose. For the start of the urine collection on Day 0, a window of 15 to 40 minutes prior to the assigned dosing time was acceptable, with the 0 to 24 hour collection period on Day 1 starting 24 hours after the start time on Day 0. Participants were asked to void immediately prior to the end of the collection interval. The volume of individual voids were measured and recorded prior to refrigerating. All voids in a collection interval were pooled at the end of the collection interval, at which time the volume was determined, recorded and an aliquot taken for osmolality, sodium, potassium, and creatinine assessments.</description>

      <recruitment_details>The study was conducted in 30 participants (29 received treatment) at 14 trial sites in 7 countries.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>Participants with syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH) and a serum sodium concentration between 120 and 133 mmol/L were randomized to single doses of 3.75, 7.5, or 15 mg tolvaptan. Baseline pharmacodynamics (PD) was assessed for 24 hours predose. Pharmacokinetic (PK) and PD assessments were obtained 24 hours postdose.</pre_assignment_details>

        <description>Fluid intake was monitored on Day 0 (times relative to Day 1 dosing), and Day 1 at intervals of 0 to 6, 6 to 12, and 12 to 24 hours postdose. Fluid intake included fluid used for dosing (study medication and any concomitant medication); food items that included any significant amounts of water (e.g., Jello [including Gelatin and Jelly dessert] and soup) was added to the total fluid intake. Urine was collected for baseline comparison on Day 0 for the 24 hour prior to Day 1 dosing at intervals of 0 to 2, 2 to 4, 4 to 6, 6 to 8, 8 to 12 hours, and 12 to 24 hours relative to the Day 1 dosing time. Fluid balance was determined as fluid intake minus urine output.</description>

        <description>Urine was collected for baseline comparison on Day 0 for the 24 hour prior to Day 1 dosing at intervals of 0 to 2, 2 to 4, 4, to 6, 6, to 8, 8, to 12, and 12 to 24 hours relative to Day 1 dosing time. Urine was collected on Day 1 at intervals of 0 to 2,2 to 4, 4 to 6, 6 to 8, 8 to 12, and 12 to 24 hours postdose. For the start of the urine collection on Day 0, a window of 15 to 40 minutes prior to the assigned dosing time was acceptable, with the 0 to 24 hour collection period on Day 1 starting 24 hours after the start time on Day 0. Participants were asked to void immediately prior to the end of the collection interval. The volume of individual voids were measured and recorded prior to refrigerating. All voids in a collection interval were pooled at the end of the collection interval, at which time the volume was determined, recorded and an aliquot taken for osmolality, sodium, potassium, and creatinine assessments.</description>
