  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the this international, multicenter, randomised, single-blind, parallel group,
      Phase III study is to demonstrate that a single transrectal ultrasound (TRUS)-guided
      intraprostatic injection of NX-1207 provides a long lasting therapeutic improvement of Lower
      Urinary Tract Symptoms (LUTS) associated with Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia (BPH) in patients
      not adequately controlled by medical therapy with α-blockers, as assessed by a change from
      baseline in the International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS) total score.

    <measure>Change from baseline in the total IPSS score.</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>The primary efficacy parameter is the change from baseline in the total score (Questions 1 to 7) of the IPSS at 12 months.
The IPSS questionnaire will be filled by the subjects in blind conditions and will be reviewed by the investigators for its completeness. Validated local translations of the IPSS questionnaire will be used in each country.</description>

    <measure>Patient's global assessment of treatment</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>A patient-rated global assessment of treatment benefit, satisfaction and willingness to continue will be performed at 12 months (or in case of early termination) by using the BSW questionnaire.
The BSW is a validated questionnaire that consists of three, single-item measures designed to capture the patient's perception of the effect of treatment in terms of the relative benefit, their satisfaction, and their intention or willingness to continue on therapy.</description>

    <description>To evaluate the effect on urinary flow, the change from baseline in maximum urinary flow (Qmax) at 3, 6, 9, 12 months will be considered. The same validated device and procedure will be used in all centres and a blinded centralized reading is foreseen.</description>
