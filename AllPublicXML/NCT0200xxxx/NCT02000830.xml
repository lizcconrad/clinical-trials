      The objectives of this follow up study are to evaluate the long-term effects of stannsoporfin
      (Stanate) on the health, growth, and development of patients who received a single dose of
      stannsoporfin with PT used to treat hyperbilirubinemia compared with patients in the control
      (placebo plus PT) group in clinical trial 64,185-204.

    <description>The Mullen Scales of Early Learning examination has been selected for its standardized measurement of developmental skills in multiple domains (gross motor, visual reception, fine motor, expressive language, and receptive language). Testing will be done at visits 1 and 2 by a healthcare individual trained to administer the test. The Mullen raw scores, T-scores, and age equivalents will be recorded.</description>
