          -  Successful completion (Day 182) of study EVP-6124-024 or EVP-6124-025

          -  No clinically significant change in the judgment of the investigator in the subject's

             drug, and considered by the investigator to be a contraindication to extension study
             participation

             unsuitable for the study
