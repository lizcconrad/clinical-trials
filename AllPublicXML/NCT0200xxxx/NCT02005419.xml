  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pancreatic cancer represents the most lethal of the common malignancies with a 5-year
      survival rate of less than 5%. For patients who are eligible for potentially curative
      resection, despite mortality and morbidity rates after surgery have improved, the recurrence
      rate is up to 85% within 2 years. Data from clinical trials indicate that adjuvant
      chemotherapy enhances 5-year survival to ~25% for patients who have undergone surgery to
      remove their tumor; and gemcitabine is the standard regimen of chemotherapy. Metformin is the
      first-line treatment for type 2 diabetes mellitus. Literatures reported that metformin might
      inhibit tumor growth by blocking some enzymes needed for cell growth. Some retrospective
      studies have revealed that diabetic patients taking metformin were less likely to develop
      pancreatic cancer. Additionally, pancreatic cancer patients treated with metformin showed a
      better survival than those without metformin. In this study, the researchers intend to
      investigate the activity and safety of the combination of gemcitabine and metformin in
      treating patients with pancreatic cancer that have removed by surgery.
