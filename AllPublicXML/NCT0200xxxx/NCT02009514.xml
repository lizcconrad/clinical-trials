      The purpose of this study is to investigate differences in glycemia

        -  during the whole hemodialysis day and the whole freeday

        -  during hemodialysis, during the evening and the night after hemodialysis and at the same
           time intervals during the freeday in an unselected type 2 diabetic patient group using
           both glucose-containing and glucose-free dialysate.

    <measure>Glucose below 4.0 mmol/l</measure>
    <time_frame>In the end of a two week period</time_frame>
    <description>In the end of a two-week glucose-containing and glucose-free period percentage of hypoglycemic values of continuous glucose monitoring during the whole hemodialysis day is compared to the whole freeday. Similar comparison is made between the whole glucose-containing and the whole glucose-free hemodialysis day as well as between the whole glucose-containing and the whole glucose-free freeday.</description>
