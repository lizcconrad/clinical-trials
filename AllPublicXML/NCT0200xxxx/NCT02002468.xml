  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Denmark has a higher incidence of cervical cancer than other Nordic countries, although all
      Danish women (aged 23-65) are screened regularly to identify possible cervical dysplasia or
      asymptomatic invasive cancer.

      Annually 40 000 women receives an abnormal or inadequate test result and a follow-up
      recommendation.

      However problems with delayed follow-up may threaten the effectiveness of the Danish Cervical
      Cancer Screening Program, as 20% of women are delayed and dysplasia potentially can progress
      into cancer.

      Delayed follow-up is found in situations where women either consciously or unconsciously
      postpone follow-up, or because of organizational aspects of the screening program, where
      communication regarding test results can fail either in content or with delay.This study will
      evaluate two interventions designed to increase follow-up:

        1. A letter with the test result and potential recommendation for follow up will be sent to
           the women (RCT). The intention is to ensure that all women will be notified about the
           test result, quickly, homogenously and in layman's written language, still with the
           opportunity to contact or be contacted by the general practitioner, if there is special
           needs. Furthermore, it is assumed that general practitioner consultations regarding
           delivery of normal test results will decrease, so that cost savings is a potential side
           benefit

        2. Electronic reminder to the general practitioner if women have not had the recommended
           follow up, giving the general practioner´s an opportunity to remind the women (retro
           perspective cohort study).

      The results will be of great importance to the future organisation of cervical and colorectal
      cancer screening programmes in Denmark, but will also have international interest because of
      their similar challenges.

    <description>The proportion of women followed up will be calculated as cumulated incidence proportions according to four timeframes (undesirable early, as recommended, late, very late), and be compared by relative risks. The results will be presented in totals and separately depending on the test result (normal/inadequate/Bethesda classification 2001/HPV).</description>
