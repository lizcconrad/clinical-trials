  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pelvic lymph node dissection (PLND) is the most accurate staging tool to determine lymph node
      involvement in prostate and bladder cancer. The main complication of PLND is development of a
      lymphocele, which can cause symptoms including lower abdominal pain, leg or penile/scrotal
      edema, bladder outlet obstruction, deep venous thrombosis or infection/sepsis. The incidence
      of radiographic (asymptomatic) and symptomatic lymphoceles following PLND varies between
      12,6-63% and 1,6-33% respectively. Medicated sponges such as Tachosil® are indicated in
      surgery for improvement of haemostasis and to promote tissue sealing. They could reduce
      lymphocele development by increased tissue sealing, due to a mechanical effect of the sponge
      itself and a lymphostatic effect of the included thrombin and fibrinogen. Our goal is to
      prospectively assess the lymphostatic effect of Tachosil(r) in patients undergoing
      transperitoneal PLND with or without radical prostatectomy or PLND with bladder cancer
      surgery.
