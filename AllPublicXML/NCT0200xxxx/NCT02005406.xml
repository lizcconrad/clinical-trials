      This is only initial thought and suggestions from the inventor Dr. Huafeng Wei. Principal
      investigator from each medical center interested in testing this new device should design
      their own clinical trials based on patient population and their own ideas for clinical
      trials. Just remind you that patient safety is number one and try all efforts to minimize
      patient risks during your clinical study.
