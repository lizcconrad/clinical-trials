      The purpose of this follow-up study is to evaluate the five-year immune persistence of one
      injection of inactivated and attenuated alive hepatitis A vaccine in healthy children.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In the previous double-blind, randomized, phase IV clinical trial in 2008, 300 healthy
      Chinese children aged 18 to 35 months old were administered with one dose of inactivated and
      attenuated alive hepatitis A vaccine. Series of serum samples were taken for immunogenicity
      and immune persistence evaluation. Safety observations were performed after vaccination. This
      trial was also approved by Tianjin CDC Biomedical Ethics Committee in 2008.

      This study is the fifth-year follow-up research for the previous clinical trial.
