    <description>Unified Protocol is designed to help patients learn how to confront and experience uncomfortable emotions and learn how to respond to their emotions in more adaptive ways. Individual treatment sessions will be conducted by experienced clinicians who will be trained in the administration of this protocol. A workbook will be provided to each patient as part of this manualized treatment. During this treatment period, the participants continue the Treatment As Usual.</description>
