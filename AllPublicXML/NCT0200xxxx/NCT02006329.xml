  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the most common cause of liver dysfunction
      worldwide. NAFLD may progress to nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and in turn to
      cirrhosis. To date, the detailed pathogenic mechanism of NAFLD including steatosis and NASH
      is not fully characterized, although it is regarded as a hepatic manifestation of the
      metabolic syndrome, sometimes it occurs in the absence of a metabolic syndrome. Based on
      conventional models of &quot;two-hit&quot; and &quot;multi- hit&quot; hypothesis of NAFLD, the dysregulated lipid
      metabolism and insulin resistance are considered as the &quot;first hit&quot; of the liver and the
      following &quot;second hit&quot; or &quot;multi-hit&quot; likely involves oxidative stress, lipid peroxidation,
      increased inflammatory responses, induced hepatic fibrosis and apoptosis. This emphasizes the
      multi-factorial pathogenesis of NAFLD and the necessity to treat NAFLD with diabetes-like and
      multimodal strategy. Several changes in dietary intake have occurred in the past few years,
      including increased energy intake (24%), and increases in added sugars, flour and cereal
      products, fruit, added fats and total fat intake. The increasing prevalence of NAFLD is
      probably directly affected by the contemporary epidemics of obesity, unhealthy dietary
      pattern, and sedentary lifestyle. Currently, there are two major categories of NAFLD therapy:
      lifestyle interventions and pharmaceutical therapies, lifestyle interventions in terms of
      diet and physical activity are regarded as safe and effective, while pharmaceutical
      interventions showed limited efficacy with unknown safety in the long term ,therefore, the
      first line of treatment is lifestyle modification. Although lifestyle intervention dose
      positively affects NAFLD, it has limitations. Patients adherence to dietary intervention is
      50%, while those who do adhere, find it difficult to maintain after 12 months. ).
      Mediterranean diet has been shown to be effective in reducing NAFLD, liver steatosis and
      improve insulin sensitivity. Acupuncture has been found as an effective treatment for
      improving quality of life in various medical conditions , including hepatitis . Acupuncture
      combined with life style intervention has been found effective in the treatment of obesity,
      metabolic syndrome in terms of weight, lipid regulation, glucose levels and various markers
      of inflammation. Acupuncture's effect on NAFLD has yet to be studied.

      We suggest that acupuncture combined with life style intervention can be an effective
      treatment for NAFLD.
