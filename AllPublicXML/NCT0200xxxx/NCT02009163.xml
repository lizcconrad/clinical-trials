      To evaluate maintenance of efficacy based on time to relapse between SPD489 (50 or 70mg) and
      placebo, as measured by the number of binge days (defined as days during which at least 1
      binge episode occurs) per week as assessed by clinical interview based on subject diary and
      Clinical Global Impression - Severity (CGI-S) scores for patients who responded to SPD489 by
      the end of the Open-label Treatment Phase.

    <measure>Time to Relapse From Date of Randomization to Endpoint of The Randomized-withdrawal Period</measure>
    <time_frame>Visit 21 (26 weeks after randomization [Week 38] or Early Termination)</time_frame>
    <description>Relapse status was assessed during the double-blind treatment phase and was defined as having 2 or more binge days per week for 2 consecutive weeks (14 consecutive days) prior to any visit and having an increase in Clinical Global Impressions-Severity (CGI-S) score of 2 or more points compared to the randomized-withdrawal baseline (date of relapse - date of randomization). Binge eating information was captured via a self-report paper diary. The binge diary captured the number of binges per day, total hours per day spent binging, type of binge (at mealtime or at another time other than mealtime), and a description of the binge (amounts and types of foods). Binge frequency was reviewed by the clinician with the subject to confirm reported binge episodes per day. The CGI-S was performed to rate the severity of a subject's condition using a 7-point scale ranging from 1 (normal, not at all ill) to 7 (among the most extremely ill).</description>

    <description>A binge day was defined as days during which at least 1 binge episode occurred. As assessed by clinical interview based on subject binge diary. Binge eating information was captured via a self-report paper diary. The binge diary captured the number of binges per day, total hours per day spent binging, type of binge (at mealtime or at another time other than mealtime), and a description of the binge (amounts and types of foods). Binge frequency was reviewed by the clinician with the subject to confirm reported binge episodes per day. A negative change from Baseline indicates that binge-related behavior decreased. The randomized -withdrawal-baseline was defined as the weekly average number of binge days for the 14 days prior to the Randomization Visit (Visit 8).</description>

    <description>The CGI-S permits a global evaluation of a subject's condition and severity of symptoms. The CGI-S was performed to rate the severity of a subject's condition based on a 7-point scale ranging from 1 (normal, not at all ill) to 7 (among the most extremely ill).</description>

    <measure>Change From Randomized-Withdrawal Baseline in The Total Score of The Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale Modified for Binge Eating (Y-BOCS-BE) During The Randomized-withdrawal Period</measure>
    <time_frame>Randomized-withdrawal baseline (Visit 8; 12 weeks after start of open-label treatment [Week 12]), Visit 21 (26 weeks after randomization [Week 38])</time_frame>
    <description>The Y-BOCS-BE measures the obsession of binge eating thoughts and compulsiveness of binge eating behaviors. The scale is a clinician rated, 10-item scale, each item rated from 0 (no symptoms) to 4 (extreme symptoms). The scale includes questions regarding the amount of time spent on obsessions, impairment or distress experienced, and resistance and control over these thoughts. The same types of questions were asked about compulsions (ie, time spent, interference, etc.).Total scores range from 0 to 40. A total score of 0-7 is sub-clinical, 8-15 is mild, 16-23 is moderate, 24-31 is severe, and 32-40 is extreme. A decrease from baseline in Y-BOCS-BE Total Score represents an improvement in obsession with binge-eating thoughts or compulsiveness of binge-eating behaviors.</description>

    <description>The C-SSRS is a semistructured interview that captures the occurrence, severity, and frequency of suicide-related thoughts and behaviors. The interview includes definitions and suggested questions to solicit the type of information needed to determine if a suicide-related thought or behaviour occurred. The interview was initiated with 5 (yes/no) questions, presented in ascending order of severity, about suicidal ideation. The most severe type of ideation was rated for frequency, duration, controllability, deterrents, and reason. If the answer to the first 2 ideation questions was &quot;yes,&quot; the clinician asked questions 3-5. Active suicidal ideation included any participant who answered &quot;yes&quot; to questions 2-5. If the answers to ideation questions 1 and 2 were &quot;No,&quot; then the clinician proceeded to 5 (yes/no) questions that addressed suicidal behavior, which was categorized as actual attempt, interrupted attempt, aborted attempt, preparatory acts or behaviors, and completed suicide.</description>

          <title>SPD489 (Open-label Period)</title>
          <description>SPD489 treatment was taken orally once daily at approximately 7:00 AM. All participants began treatment with SPD489 at the lowest dose level (30mg) during the 4-week open-label dose-optimization period. After 1 week of treatment at 30mg, all participants were titrated to the next dose level (50mg). After 1 week of treatment at 50mg, all participants were titrated to the highest dose level (70mg), as tolerated and as clinically indicated. After 1 week of treatment at the highest dose, the participant could have been down-titrated to 50mg; no further dose adjustments were permitted. The optimal daily dose of 50 or 70mg achieved during dose-optimization was maintained throughout the 8-week dose-maintenance period. The total time of the open-label period was 12 weeks.</description>

        <title>Time to Relapse From Date of Randomization to Endpoint of The Randomized-withdrawal Period</title>
        <description>Relapse status was assessed during the double-blind treatment phase and was defined as having 2 or more binge days per week for 2 consecutive weeks (14 consecutive days) prior to any visit and having an increase in Clinical Global Impressions-Severity (CGI-S) score of 2 or more points compared to the randomized-withdrawal baseline (date of relapse â date of randomization). Binge eating information was captured via a self-report paper diary. The binge diary captured the number of binges per day, total hours per day spent binging, type of binge (at mealtime or at another time other than mealtime), and a description of the binge (amounts and types of foods). Binge frequency was reviewed by the clinician with the subject to confirm reported binge episodes per day. The CGI-S was performed to rate the severity of a subjectâs condition using a 7-point scale ranging from 1 (normal, not at all ill) to 7 (among the most extremely ill).</description>

The binge diary captured the number of binges per day, total hours per day spent binging, type of binge (at mealtime or at another time other than mealtime), and a description of the binge (amounts and types of foods). Binge frequency was reviewed by the clinician with the subject to confirm reported binge episodes per day. A negative change from Baseline indicates that binge-related behavior decreased. The randomized Â­withdrawal-baseline was defined as the weekly average number of binge days for the 14 days prior to the Randomization Visit (Visit 8).</description>

        <title>Change From Randomized-Withdrawal Baseline in The Total Score of The Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale Modified for Binge Eating (Y-BOCS-BE) During The Randomized-withdrawal Period</title>
        <description>The Y-BOCS-BE measures the obsession of binge eating thoughts and compulsiveness of binge eating behaviors. The scale is a clinician rated, 10-item scale, each item rated from 0 (no symptoms) to 4 (extreme symptoms). The scale includes questions regarding the amount of time spent on obsessions, impairment or distress experienced, and resistance and control over these thoughts. The same types of questions were asked about compulsions (ie, time spent, interference, etc.).Total scores range from 0 to 40. A total score of 0-7 is sub-clinical, 8-15 is mild, 16-23 is moderate, 24-31 is severe, and 32-40 is extreme. A decrease from baseline in Y-BOCS-BE Total Score represents an improvement in obsession with binge-eating thoughts or compulsiveness of binge-eating behaviors.</description>

        <description>The C-SSRS is a semistructured interview that captures the occurrence, severity, and frequency of suicide-related thoughts and behaviors. The interview includes definitions and suggested questions to solicit the type of information needed to determine if a suicide-related thought or behaviour occurred. The interview was initiated with 5 (yes/no) questions, presented in ascending order of severity, about suicidal ideation. The most severe type of ideation was rated for frequency, duration, controllability, deterrents, and reason. If the answer to the first 2 ideation questions was &quot;yes,&quot; the clinician asked questions 3-5. Active suicidal ideation included any participant who answered &quot;yes&quot; to questions 2-5. If the answers to ideation questions 1 and 2 were &quot;No,&quot; then the clinician proceeded to 5 (yes/no) questions that addressed suicidal behavior, which was categorized as actual attempt, interrupted attempt, aborted attempt, preparatory acts or behaviors, and completed suicide.</description>

          <title>Number of Participants With a Positive Response on The Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS) at Endpoint of The Randomized-withdrawal Period</title>
          <description>The C-SSRS is a semistructured interview that captures the occurrence, severity, and frequency of suicide-related thoughts and behaviors. The interview includes definitions and suggested questions to solicit the type of information needed to determine if a suicide-related thought or behaviour occurred. The interview was initiated with 5 (yes/no) questions, presented in ascending order of severity, about suicidal ideation. The most severe type of ideation was rated for frequency, duration, controllability, deterrents, and reason. If the answer to the first 2 ideation questions was &quot;yes,&quot; the clinician asked questions 3-5. Active suicidal ideation included any participant who answered &quot;yes&quot; to questions 2-5. If the answers to ideation questions 1 and 2 were &quot;No,&quot; then the clinician proceeded to 5 (yes/no) questions that addressed suicidal behavior, which was categorized as actual attempt, interrupted attempt, aborted attempt, preparatory acts or behaviors, and completed suicide.</description>

          <description>SPD489 treatment was taken orally once daily at approximately 7:00 AM. All participants began treatment with SPD489 at the lowest dose level (30mg) during the 4-week open-label dose-optimization period. After 1 week of treatment at 30mg, all participants were titrated to the next dose level (50mg). After 1 week of treatment at 50mg, all participants were titrated to the highest dose level (70mg), as tolerated and as clinically indicated. After 1 week of treatment at the highest dose, the participant could have been down-titrated to 50mg; no further dose adjustments were permitted. The optimal daily dose of 50 or 70mg achieved during dose-optimization was maintained throughout the 8-week dose-maintenance period. The total time of the open-label period was 12 weeks.</description>
