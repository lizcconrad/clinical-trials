  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Minimally invasive surgery has become the standard treatment for many gynecologic disease
      processes. In the last decade, numerous studies have demonstrated that laparoscopic
      approaches to various gynecologic oncology conditions-particularly for early-stage
      endometrial and cervical cancers as well as select pelvic masses-is feasible and results in
      shorter hospital stays, improved quality of life and comparable surgical and oncologic
      outcomes to abdominal staging.For instance, the typical gynecologic robotic surgical
      procedure will require Two to three 5-mm ports and one 12-mm laparoscopic ports. Recently, an
      even less invasive alternative to conventional laparoscopy surgery has been developed:
      laparoendoscopic single-site surgery (LESS), also known as single-port surgery. Single port
      laparoscopy is an attempt to further enhance the cosmetic benefits of minimally invasive
      surgery while minimizing the potential morbidity associated with multiple incisions.
      Preliminary advances in LESS as applied to urologic and gastrointestinal surgery demonstrate
      that the techniques are feasible provided that both optimal surgical technical expertise with
      advanced skills and optimal instrumentation are available. Recently, several publication
      showed the single port laparoscopic surgery is feasibility in gynecologic surgery including
      oophorectomy, cystecomty, and myomecomty. To our knowledge, the sample size of recent
      publication about single port surgery including cystectomy and myomecomty is small.
      Furthermore, these studies lack the comparison of single port and convectional laparoscopic
      surgery. Base on our recent study demonstrated that either the single-port or the
      conventional approach can be used for LAVH, but the single-port LAVH technique yielded less
      postoperative pain (Chen et al., Obestet Gynecol, 2011). The purpose of this study was to
      assess the feasibility of single port laparoscopic surgery in the treatment of benign
      gynecologic disease.

      This study was designed as a retrospective case-control study, and port placement was one of
      the differences in operative procedures between the two groups. Patients with ovarian dermoid
      cysts were evaluated at Taipei Veterans General Hospital from June 13, 2011 through June 12,
      2013. Approval for the study was obtained from the hospital's ethics committee, and informed
      consent was obtained from all patients (VGHIRB 2011-06-004IA).

    <description>The three-channel single-port: a 1.5-cm horizontal intraumbilical skin incision, a 1.5-cm to 2-cm rectus fasciotomy to open the peritoneal cavity, and the insertion of an Alexis small wound retractor (Applied Medical, Rancho Santa Margarita, CA). The wrist portion of a size 6.5 surgical glove was fixed to the outer ring of the wound retractor. A 12-mm trocar was inserted through a small hole made in one of the fingertips of the glove and advanced into the abdominal cavity. Two additional holes for the accessory channels were made in another fingertip of the glove, and two conventional 5-mm trocars were inserted through the holes.</description>
