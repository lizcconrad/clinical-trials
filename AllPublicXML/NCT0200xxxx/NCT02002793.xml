      This study aims to standardized the process of mini-invasive abdominal draniage of SAP in
      early stage.To determine the indications and occasion.

      Pancreatitis associated ascetic fluids(PAAF) gather with the beginning of SAP and induced
      IAP(intra-abdominal pressure) increasement.With an excess of 12mmHg ,IAP presents as
      IAH(intra-abdominal hypertension) and when a ≥20mmHg IAP accompanied with at least one
      organ's dysfunction it is ACS(abdominal compartment syndrome).Previous recommended theraphy
      of ACS is laparotomy.However,with inherited advantages such as ease-to-operate and minimal
      invassiveness, early stage mini-invasive abdominal drainage therapies , for example,
      percutaneous catheter drainage(PCD) instructed by ultrasound or CT ,have shown a promised
      future in recent years. It is reported that patients acquired PCD decreased 81% in operation
      rate compared to those who did not and had lower mortality rate. Whereas, the operation flow
      of early stage mini-invasive abdominal drainage remains controversial, and whose validity
      calls for evidence from large-scale clinical trials.
