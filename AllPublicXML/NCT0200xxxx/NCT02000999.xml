  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this prospective study is to compare the diagnostic utility of two techniques
      (brush cytology + FISH and brush cytology + free DNA analysis) in the diagnosis of biliary
      strictures. Histologic diagnosis (biopsies) in conjunction with clinical and/or imaging
      follow-up will serve as the gold standard for diagnosis of malignancy. In order to do this
      the investigators will ask study participants to have a small volume of fluid obtained from
      the bile duct sent for additional testing at RedPATH. In some patients additional brushings
      will be obtained for FISH testing (this adds &lt;2 minutes to ERCP and only associated risk is
      increased procedure duration).

      The investigators hypothesize that the use of cytology +DNA analysis has a higher sensitivity
      and accuracy when compared to cytology +FISH in patients with biliary strictures.

      Primary aim:

      To compare the sensitivity and accuracy of the two techniques (brush cytology + FISH and
      brush cytology + free DNA analysis). Histologic diagnosis (histology from biopsy or cytology
      for fine needle aspiration) in conjunction with clinical and/or imaging follow-up will serve
      as the gold standard for diagnosis of malignancy.

      Secondary aims:

        1. To evaluate the diagnostic yield of malignancy when all three techniques (cytology, FISH
           and DNA analysis) are used.

        2. To evaluate the added value of biliary forceps biopsies, when used in conjunction with
           cytology, FISH and DNA analysis.
