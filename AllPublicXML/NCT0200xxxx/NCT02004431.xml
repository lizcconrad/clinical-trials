  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The experience of pain is common among hospital inpatients. Orthopaedic surgery often results
      in significant pain, which may last for some time. About one in eight people will experience
      long-term or chronic pain after surgery, which can impact on quality of life and mood. Some
      risk factors are known for chronic post surgical pain (CPSP) and these include patient
      factors, surgical factors and anaesthetic factors. We know that mood problems (anxiety and
      depression) increase the risk of CPSP. What is not known is how short term changes in mood
      are related to the experience of pain after surgery and how this impacts on CPSP. This study
      is designed to investigate the relationship between both short and long-term mood problems
      and short and long-term pain and quality of life after orthopaedic surgery. The study will
      provide valuable information to allow us to design a psychological intervention, which might
      reduce the risk of short-term post surgical pain and CPSP.

      This study also aims to measure a number of other variables, which may be related to CPSP
      including medication use, other medically unexplained symptoms and catastrophic thinking in
      response to pain.

      All patients having planned orthopaedic surgery will be asked to enter the trial. Those
      consenting to involvement will complete a questionnaire assessing the variables described
      above. They will be divided into two groups depending on whether they have significant pain
      on the day after their surgery. As the primary aim of the study, the rates of significant
      anxiety or depression will then be compared between these two groups.

      Secondary outcomes will be assessed by a questionnaire sent to the patients at 6 months after
      their surgery. Descriptive statistics will be produced for all the variables and use to model
      a future study, which would assess the effect of a psychological intervention on acute and
      chronic post surgical pain.

      Our hypothesis is that patients are more likely to experience acute anxiety and depression or
      display catastrophic thinking if they suffer significant post-surgical pain. The study is
      powered to reliably detect a three-fold difference in the prevalence of psychopathology
      between patients with and without acute pain on day 1 after elective orthopaedic surgery.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective case-control observational study. The primary aim is to determine
      whether patients with poor pain control on day 1 following surgery have higher levels of
      anxiety / depression or catastrophising than those without acute pain. The cases are patients
      with significant pain on day one after surgery and the controls are sex, age and operation
      matched individuals without pain.

      Several other variables are measured which may provide information for the design of future
      studies. The presence of pain or psychopathology prior to surgery will be recorded, as this
      is likely to impact on these variables in the post-operative period. Analgesic use pre and
      post surgery is also of interest as a surrogate measure of pain severity.

      In addition to day one data, pain severity will also be recorded on day 2 and 3
      post-operatively. This is of interest as although most patients will be expected to
      demonstrate reducing pain severity with time, a proportion will not improve and a small
      number will experience increasing pain with time. This adverse &quot;pain trajectory&quot; might be
      associated with an increased incidence of CPSP 28.

      Long-term outcomes such as pain and quality of life at 6 months post-discharge will also be
      assessed by postal questionnaire.

      The eventual aim of this series of studies is to assess the interaction between acute
      psychological problems and post-surgical pain and the impact that this has on longer-term
      outcomes such as CPSP, mood and quality of life. Short-term pre- and post-operative
      psychological interventions will then be developed to modify the impact of psychological
      factors on long-term surgical outcomes. Further studies will assess the efficacy of these
      interventions. Pre-study audit will be carried out to confirm the feasibility of matching.
