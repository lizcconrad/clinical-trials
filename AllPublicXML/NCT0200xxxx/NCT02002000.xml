  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Non-systematized chronic musculoskeletal pains are a frequent reason for consulting in
      general practice. The possible causes are numerous and sometimes nonspecific. In some cases,
      the etiologic investigation of patients with non-systematized and chronic musculoskeletal
      pain can not highlight any organic cause. Several studies have shown a link between these
      symptoms and vitamin D deficiency, characterized by a blood level of 25 (OH) vitamin D &lt;
      20.8ng/ml. This deficit is easy to identify and to correct through proper vitamin D
      supplementation with few side effects. Nevertheless, it remains unknown and vitamin D
      deficiency is rarely considered as a possible etiology in patients with chronic pain. We
      hypothesize that vitamin D supplementation in patients with non-systematized musculoskeletal
      pain and deficient in vitamin D could improve painful symptoms. We aim to perform a
      double-blind randomized controlled trial, vitamin D versus placebo, to assess the pain
      improvement after vitamin D supplementation.
