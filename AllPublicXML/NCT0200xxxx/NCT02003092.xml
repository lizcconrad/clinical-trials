    <textblock>
      In this dose-finding, open-label, single-agent study of RX-5902, subjects will be treated for
      up to 6 cycles of therapy. RX-5902 will be administered orally daily for 3 weeks followed by
      1 week of rest in each cycle. All subjects will be followed for at least 30 days after the
      last dose of study agent for safety.
