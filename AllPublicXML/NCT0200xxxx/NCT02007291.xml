  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Life expectancy in Brazil has increased markedly over the last 30 years. Hence, age-related
      disorders, such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), warrant special attention due to their high
      prevalence in the elderly. Pharmacologic treatment of AD is based on cholinesterase
      inhibitors (ChEI) and memantine, leading to modest clinical benefits both in the short and
      long-term.

      However, clinical response is heterogeneous and needs further investigation. Objective: To
      investigate the rate of response to ChEI in AD after three months of treatment. Methods:
      Patients with mild or moderate dementia due to probable AD or to AD associated with
      cerebrovascular disease were included in the study.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The subjects were assessed at baseline and again after three months of ChEI treatment.
      Subjects were submitted to the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), Mattis Dementia Rating
      Scale, Katz Basic Activities of Daily Living, Pfeffer Functional Activities Questionnaire,
      Neuropsychiatric Inventory and Cornell Scale for Depression in Dementia. Good response was
      defined by a gain of ≥2 points on the MMSE after three months of treatment in relation to
      baseline.

    <time_frame>three, six and twelve months</time_frame>
    <description>Patients presented mild or moderate dementia according to the Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR). None of the individuals had been treated with Cholinesterase inhibitors (ChEI) or memantine before study entry. Donepezil, galantamine or rivastigmine were prescribed to the patients according to the clinicians' preferences. All participants were evaluated by one board certified geriatrician (LFJRM) at baseline and after 3 months of treatment, as part of an ongoing 12-month responder analysis study of ChEI in AD. Clinical evaluations were performed at baseline and after three months. The domains examined and the evaluation tools were: cognition (Mini-Mental State Examination- MMSE+ Mattis Dementia Rating Scale- DRS), function (Katz - Basic Activities of Daily Living, and instrumental activities of daily living - Pfeffer Functional Activities Questionnaire - PFAQ), neuropsychiatric symptoms (Neuropsychiatric Inventory - NPI) and mood (Cornell Scale for Depression in Dementia - CSDD).</description>

    <measure>Good rate of cognitive response to cholinesterase inhibitors after 3 months of treatment</measure>
    <time_frame>three, six and twelve months</time_frame>
    <description>All participants were evaluated by one board certified geriatrician (LFJRM) at baseline and after three months of treatment, as part of an ongoing 12-month responder analysis study of ChEI in Alzheimer's disease. The rate of good clinical response was determined based on the proportion of patients who gained 2 or more points on the MMSE after three months of treatment in relation to baseline. Neutral response was defined by variations between -1 and +1 on the MMSE score as compared to baseline, while bad response corresponded to a decrease of 2 or more points on the MMSE after three months.</description>

      A blood sample was drawn from the patients on the first consultation for use in DNA
      extraction and Apolipoprotein E (APOE) genotyping. For the patients who were taking
      donepezil, after three, six and twelve months of treatment another blood sample were also
      drawn, separated in plasma and kept into the freezer at - 70 Celsius degree for further
      analysis of serum level of donepezil.
