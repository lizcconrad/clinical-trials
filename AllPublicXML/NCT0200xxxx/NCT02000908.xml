  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a 2-armed, randomized, sham-controlled, double-blinded clinical trial of
      photobiomodulation therapy using the Realief Therapy system. The patients will be randomized
      in a 3:4 ratio to treatment or sham arms.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The treatments will be administered by a Realief Neuropathy Center therapist. The target
      surface area and treatment durations will be dictated by the Realief Therapy protocol
      according to their proprietary algorithm, which includes assessment of geographic areas
      involved and the degree of neuropathy experienced. For the trial, each patient will be given
      18 treatments of 30-minute duration, scheduled every three times weekly. The treatments will
      include laser exposure of any or all of 27 differentiated areas of the legs, feet, cervical
      spine region and lumbar spine region, for durations of 3 to 30 minutes, based on the symptom
      presentation at the time. Power densities will vary from 5 to 12 watts, based on the symptom
      presentations through the course of therapy.

    <description>Each patient will be given 15-18 treatments depending on response of 30-minute duration of photobiomodulation with the Realief Therapy system, scheduled every three times weekly for 5-6 weeks. The treatments will include laser exposure of any or all of 27 differentiated areas of the legs, feet, cervical spine region and lumbar spine region, for durations of 3 to 30 minutes, based on the symptom presentation at the time. Power densities will vary from 5 to 12 watts, based on the symptom presentations through the course of therapy.</description>

    <description>The placebo group will receive sham treatment, during which a heat probe will be guided over both lower extremities over a period of 30 minutes, consistent with the treatment arm. The laser device will be activated during the treatment so that the visual and auditory environment prior to therapy will be the same for both treatment and sham control.
After 8 weeks of sham treatment the subjects in this arm will be offered the photobiomodulation combined with physiotherapy.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients will have stable or worsening neuropathy (â‰¥grade 2 CTCAE) after the
             completion of chemotherapy, with a presumptive remission. Patients who are interested
             in enrollment will have a baseline neuropathy assessment followed by a second
             evaluation 1 month later to confirm that the neuropathy is not spontaneously improving
             (greater than 10% improvement in their mTNS).

          -  Patients will be 18 years or older at the time of signing the consent.

          -  Patients must have GOG performance status of 0, 1, 2, or 3 (see appendix III), and be
             able to communicate both their symptoms and report the response to neurologic testing.

          -  Patients must have recovered from the acute and remediable effects of surgery,
             radiation therapy and/or chemoradiotherapy. At least 3 weeks must have elapsed from
             the last administration of chemotherapy, and at least three weeks must have elapsed
             from the last administration of a complete radiation therapy regimen alone or
             chemoradiation therapy.

          -  Patients with pre-existing neuropathy will be eligible, provided that they have not
             previously undergone laser therapy for the treatment of their condition.

          -  Patients must be sterile or on adequate birth control.

          -  Patients must have willingly signed an approved consent form, be willing to be
             randomized to intervention or sham therapy, and be willing to be blinded from directly
             observing therapy. Patients completing sham therapy will be offered Realief Therapy in
             conjunction with physiotherapy free of charge.

          -  Patients must be able to attend therapy at the Realief Neuropathy Center in St. Louis
             Park as dictated by the requirements of the protocol (3 times/week for up to 8 weeks
             as well as once 8 weeks following the completion of therapy) AND be evaluated at the
             University of Minnesota's Gynecologic Cancer Clinic for study assessments (4 planned
             assessments during and after therapy). Every effort will be made to co-ordinate these
             visits with routine health maintenance.

          -  Life expectancy &gt;6 months

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients who have previously received a laser-based therapy for the treatment of
             neuropathy will be considered ineligible.

          -  Patients with a &gt; 10% improvement from the initial mTNS assessment to the mTNS
             assessment at the time of study enrollment (four weeks from the original assessment).

          -  Patients with evidence of direct tumor involvement of the nervous system (central or
             peripheral) will be considered ineligible.

          -  Patients who are pregnant will be considered ineligible. Class 4 lasers have been
             inadequately studied in this setting to conclude that there is no risk to a developing
             fetus.

          -  Patients with the inability to tolerate therapy or blinding due to co-morbid medical
             or psychiatric illness.

          -  Patients in active treatment of cancer will not be considered eligible.
