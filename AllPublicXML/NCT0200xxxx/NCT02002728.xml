    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate a methodology for detecting early forming cavities
      in children that is more accurate and reliable than the gold standard used by dentists around
      the world. The new method uses an electrical current device to detect early enamel mineral
      loss before it can develop into a cavity. The manual gold standard is for a dentist to probe
      the surfaces of the teeth with a fine pick, searching for areas of defect.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        Children whose parents authorize participation by signing a consent form. Children who
        attend public school only. Children in good health. Children between 6 and 9 years of age.
        Children with all first permanent molars erupted. All permanent first molars must not have
        any signs of cavitation but only one molar can have some mineral loss(e.g. white spots).

        Children must show some caries in the primary molars as a sign of caries susceptibility.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Children of parents or a guardian who do not agree to participate in the study. Children
        registered in private schools. Children not in good health. Children undergoing
        antimicrobial or antibiotic treatment. Children outside the range of age selected for the
        study. Children with one or more first permanent molars unerupted. Children with any
        cavitation in the occlusal surface of any first permanent molar.

        Children who do not have a sign of dental caries in the primary molars as a sign of caries
        susceptibility.

        Children who do not allow themselves to be examined.
