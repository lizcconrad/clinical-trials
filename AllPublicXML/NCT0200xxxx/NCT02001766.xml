  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Type II diabetes (T2D) is characterized by endothelial dysfunction, resulting in a poor
      tissue perfusion and function as well as an increased risk of cardiovascular events. ATP,
      which is released from the red blood cells, contributes to the regulation of the blood flow
      and studies have shown that red blood cells taken from T2D patients have an impaired ability
      to release ATP. However, it is not known whether the changes in the ATP system is an
      underlying cause of the poor tissue perfusion observed in T2D. The purpose of project 1 is to
      test the hypothesis that the deterioration in blood flow in T2D is caused by a reduced
      release ATP from red blood cells, and to test if pharmacological manipulation of cAMP will
      normalize ATP release, plasma ATP levels and thereby blood flow.

      Furthermore, epidemiological studies show a clear link between regular exercise and a reduced
      risk of serious cardiovascular disease. The extent to which a physically active lifestyle may
      improve endothelial function in T2D is unknown. Regular physical activity improves
      vascularization and induces an anti-inflammatory environment. Both the angiogenic and
      anti-inflammatory effects of physical activity is in part mediated by substances released
      from the active muscle. These muscle-derived substances are classified as myokines and have
      paracrine, autocrine and endocrine effects and may thereby affect distant tissues. The
      purpose of the project 2 is to investigate whether high intensity interval training may
      reverse endothelial dysfunction in T2D through increased release of ATP and myokines. In
      individuals with T2D we will determined blood flow in the muscle tissue using advanced
      ultrasound. In addition, using intravascular and intramuscular microdialysis we will
      determine ATP levels in blood and in the muscle interstitium.
