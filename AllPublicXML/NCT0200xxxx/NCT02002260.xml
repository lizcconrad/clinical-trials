  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a randomized clinical trial comparing the levonorgestrel intrauterine system
      (LNG-IUS) to combined oral contraceptives (COCs) for treatment of heavy menstrual bleeding.
      This study is designed to be conducted within the context of a patient's
      standard/usual/typical care from their primary gynecologic care provider. We hypothesize
      that, compared to COCs, the LNG-IUS will be more effective at improving bleeding-related
      quality of life and will be associated with fewer treatment failures and greater
      cost-effectiveness at one year. To test these hypotheses, we plan to enroll 59 women from
      several sites who present for gynecologic care and self-report heavy menstrual bleeding into
      a RCT comparing LNG-IUS to COCs. The eligible study population includes women with heavy
      menstrual bleeding secondary to ovulatory disorders (AUB-O) or endometrial hemostatic
      disorders (AUB-E). Women meeting study eligibility will be randomized to receive LNG-IUS or
      COCs. Main study outcomes will be obtained at 6 weeks, 3 months, 6 months, and 1 year.

    <description>We will measure bleeding-specific quality of life using the Menstrual Bleeding Questionnaire (MBQ), a validated tool to assess bleeding-related quality of life, which is the most important outcome for patients and for clinicians treating this symptom. We will measure MBQ score at randomization, and at 6 weeks, 3 month, 6 months, and 12 months post-randomization for both groups</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Treatment Failure</measure>
    <time_frame>Information collected at four time points during a one year period post randomization</time_frame>
    <description>The goal of treating heavy menstrual bleeding is to utilize a treatment option that improves patient quality of life and avoids surgical intervention. We will look at treatment failure two different ways. We will determine the overall proportion of participants who discontinued their assigned treatment (opted for no treatment or chose a different treatment option, including surgery) and subset that opted for surgical intervention (endometrial ablation or hysterectomy) during the study period. This information will be recorded by the primary gynecologic provider (physical examination and physician form), by participants (interval health history form), and by the research team (medical record review).</description>
