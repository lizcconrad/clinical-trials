  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomised study to examine whether high dose Sillymarin will be able to help
      improve fat-induced liver damage in the liver. The study hypothesis is that high dose
      Sillymarin will be able to reduce steato-hepatitis (fat-related liver inflammation) better
      than placebo.

      OBJECTIVES OF STUDY Primary Objectives

        1. To assess the safety and adverse event profile of Silymarin compared to placebo.

        2. To assess the efficacy of Silymarin as defined by an improvement in non-alcoholic
           steatosis (NAS) activity score by at least 30% from baseline compared to placebo.

      Secondary Objectives

        1. To compare NAS activity before and after Silymarin therapy.

        2. To characterize changes in ALT and AST during Silymarin therapy.

        3. To compare insulin resistance measured by HOMAr during Silymarin therapy.

    <description>Sillymarin is derived from the milk thistle plant, Silybum marianum, a herbal remedy that has been used for centuries for diseases of the liver. It is a complex mixture of 6 major flavonolignans (silybins A and B, isosilybins A and B, silychristin, and silydianin), as well as other minor polyphenolic compounds.</description>
