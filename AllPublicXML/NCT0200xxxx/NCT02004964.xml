      Protocol to screen potential subjects for islet transplantation
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Subjects with Type 1 diabetes and history of severe hypoglycemia will undergo screening
      similar to the screening done for islet transplantation including: history; physical; chest X
      rays; upper GI series if history of ulcer; abdominal and pelvic ultrasound with careful
      attention to liver parenchyma and gallbladder; EKG; stress echocardiography if older than 35,
      psychological evaluation; autonomic and sensorimotor evaluation. They will also have a
      tuberculosis skin test (PPD), and pre-transplant laboratory tests, including: serology (for
      hepatitis B and C, HTLV I and II, Herpesvirus 1 and 2, CMV, EBV, Parvovirus B19, RPR and
      HIV); first morning urine (albumin, protein and creatinine), GFR; urinalysis and urine
      culture; CBC, chemistry, PT, PTT, INR, C-peptide (basal and stimulated), HbA1c, , lipid
      profile, LFTs, thyroid profile, blood typing, PRA, MHC determination, auto-antibodies (GAD65,
      IA2 and insulin), and if male, prostate specific antigen (PSA). Severity of glucose lability
      and hypoglycemia unawareness is assessed with Clarke score, Lability index, Mage and
      hypoglycemia score.

        glucose control by an Endocrinologist.; and/or 3. Progressive diabetic complications.
