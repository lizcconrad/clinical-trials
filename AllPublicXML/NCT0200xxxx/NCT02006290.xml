    <textblock>
      The B7441003 study will assess PF-06412562 for motor benefit in Parkinson's disease subjects.
      Safety, tolerability and PK of PF-06412562 in Parkinson's disease subjects will also be
      evaluated.

    <measure>Apparent Volume of Distribution (Vz/F)</measure>
    <time_frame>0, 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 8, 12, 24 hours</time_frame>
    <description>Clearance of a drug is a measure of the rate at which a drug is metabolized or eliminated by normal biological processes. Clearance obtained after oral dose (apparent oral clearance) is influenced by the fraction of the dose absorbed. Clearance was estimated from population pharmacokinetic (PK) modeling. Drug clearance is a quantitative measure of the rate at which a drug substance is removed from the blood.</description>

    <measure>Plasma Decay Half-Life (t1/2)</measure>
    <time_frame>0, 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 8, 12, 24 hours</time_frame>
    <description>Volume of distribution is defined as the theoretical volume in which the total amount of drug would need to be uniformly distributed to produce the desired plasma concentration of a drug. Apparent volume of distribution after oral dose (Vz/F) is influenced by the fraction absorbed.</description>

    <measure>Mean Residence Time (MRT)</measure>
    <time_frame>0, 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 8, 12, 24 hours</time_frame>
    <description>Plasma decay half-life is the time measured for the plasma concentration to decrease by one half.</description>
