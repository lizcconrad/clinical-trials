    <textblock>
      The use of the best evidence available for decision-making is nowadays an undisputed goal in
      health care. However, this is not always achieved in the context of clinical practice. Two of
      the potential solutions to bridge the gap between evidence and the clinical practice are the
      &quot;evidence summaries&quot; and the &quot;evidence based recommendations&quot;. However, it is not clear, and
      frequently controversial, to what extent clinicians consider helpful recommendations
      accompanying evidence summaries. The investigators will explore this question by conducting a
      study where clinicians will be randomized to receive a clinical scenario accompanied by an
      evidence summary plus a recommendation and a second clinical scenario accompanied by only for
      an evidence summary (group A) or vice versa (Group B). The outcome will be clinicians'
      preferences.
