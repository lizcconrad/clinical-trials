      This randomized, double-blind study is intended to test the safety and feasibility of using
      3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA)-assisted therapy, compared with placebo, to treat
      social anxiety in autistic adults. Subjects will be randomly (by chance) assigned to receive
      placebo or MDMA during two experimental sessions. The first six subjects in the study will be
      randomized to placebo (2) or 75 mg MDMA on the first session and 100 mg MDMA on the second
      session (4). The next six subjects will be randomized to placebo (2) or 100 mg MDMA on the
      first session and 125 mg MDMA on the second session (4). The study will explore whether two
      doses of MDMA, combined with selected therapeutic activities, can reduce social anxiety. The
      study takes place in Los Angeles, California and requires about 15 visits to the study
      location over several months. Study subjects will meet with the investigators three times to
      prepare for the MDMA sessions, and they will meet with them on three occasions and receive
      daily phone calls for safety monitoring for a week after each session. Blood samples will be
      collected at baseline, two hours after drug administration during the second experimental
      session, one month and six months after the second experimental session to measure amounts of
      the hormones oxytocin, arginine vasopressin and cortisol in plasma. Subjects will return six
      months after their second experimental session for measurements of and social anxiety and
      other symptoms and an interview. Subjects will learn what they received at this visit.
      Subjects who received placebo can go through treatment again to have two sessions with MDMA,
      the first with 75 mg and the second with 125mg MDMA. Social anxiety, anxiety, depression,
      stress, self-esteem, empathy, and quality of life will be measured before and after
      experimental sessions.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Studies suggest that autistic adults are at greater risk for social anxiety. Social anxiety
      is a condition characterized by fear of scrutiny and avoidance of social interactions. Social
      anxiety frequently compounds the considerable social challenges experienced by autistic
      adults. There are currently no FDA-approved pharmacologic treatments for autistic adults,
      although off-label prescription of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are on the
      rise in this population.

      Based on the known effects of MDMA, as well as individual reports from autistic adults, this
      exploratory study will focus on enhancing functional skills in this underserved population,
      who tend to experience greater anxiety, depression and victimization than typically
      developing adults. The main objective of this study is to collect safety data to examine
      whether MDMA-assisted therapy will be tolerated and to estimate effect size of symptom
      reduction in social anxiety and other psychiatric symptoms that are common in the adult
      autistic population as evaluated by standard clinical measures. The primary outcome measure
      will be change in social anxiety levels as measured by the Lieberman Social Anxiety Scale
      (LSAS). Secondary measures include those of social anxiety, anxiety, depression, stress,
      self-esteem, emotion labeling and recognition, empathy, and quality of life, and blood levels
      of the hormones oxytocin, arginine vasopressin and cortisol.

      Each of the 12 subjects will participate in two blinded experimental sessions, assisted by
      either MDMA or placebo lasting seven hours within a brief course of non-drug therapy. The
      non-drug therapy includes three hour-long preparatory sessions at the start of the study and
      three hour-long integrative sessions during the month after each experimental session at two
      week intervals.

      This study is designed as a dose escalation study to assist with the exploration of safety
      and finding the most effective dose in this population. Subjects assigned to the MDMA group
      will receive two of three different doses, either 75mg, 100mg, or 125 mg MDMA. Overall, eight
      subjects (66.7%) will be randomized to the MDMA group and four subjects (33.3%) will be
      randomized to the placebo group. During the study, there will be a maximum of 24 experimental
      sessions with MDMA, with eight sessions in each dose group, and eight experimental sessions
      with placebo. Observations before, during, and after experimental sessions will be compared
      between these groups of equal size to explore the effects of MDMA-assisted therapy in the
      first double

      The Principal Investigator will evaluate all subjects to confirm autistic status. In
      addition, autistic status will be confirmed with the gold-standard diagnostic measure of
      autism in adults. Upon enrollment, subjects will meet with the study therapists for three
      1-hour preparatory sessions scheduled within the month prior to the first experimental
      session to discuss what to expect during experimental sessions. In-person visits will occur
      in a private room at the research facility. All in-person sessions will be video recorded.
      Video recordings will be used for research and training purposes after the study.

      During experimental sessions, there will be periods of structured and unstructured
      interactions. The structured interactions will be selected based on elements of therapeutic
      interventions that are currently in use in this population for the treatment of social
      anxiety. An overnight stay at a hotel located close to the site will be offered to subjects,
      accompanied by their support partners, if they live further than 30 miles from the site on
      the night following the experimental session.

      Subjects will attend a 1-hour follow-up integrative therapy session on the day after the
      experimental session. Two additional integrative sessions will be conducted two weeks apart
      following each experimental session. During integrative sessions subjects will receive
      support in integrating their experiences and insights from the experimental session. The
      second experimental session will be scheduled approximately one month after the first
      experimental session, after outcome assessments have been completed.

      Biomarker levels will be analyzed to determine if MDMA-assisted therapy causes changes in
      these modulators of social behavior in this population as previously demonstrated in
      typically developing adults. Biomarker levels will be analyzed for persisting effects at one
      month and 6 months after treatment. Blood samples will be obtained from all subjects to
      measure plasma OT, AVP and CORT, which will be used to explore as potential surrogate
      endpoints at baseline, two hours after drug administration during the second experimental
      session, one month after the second experimental session, and at 6-month follow-up.

      Social anxiety will be measured by interview with a blinded Independent Rater. Questionnaires
      measuring anxiety, depression, self-esteem, emotion labeling, emotion recognition, stress,
      and self-esteem will be given at baseline and throughout treatment. Quality of life will be
      assessed by interview at baseline and 6-month follow.
