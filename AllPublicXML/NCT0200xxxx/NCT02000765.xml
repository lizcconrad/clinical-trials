  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, non-randomized, two-period, cross-over, mass balance study that will
      evaluate the recovery, excretion, and pharmacokinetics of a single intravenous (IV) dose of
      [14C]-GSK2140944 (Period 1) and a single oral dose of [14C]-GSK2140944 ( Period 2) in 6
      healthy male subjects. The results from this study will aid in the design of future clinical
      pharmacology studies such as the thorough corrected QT interval study, special population
      studies (renal, hepatic, critically ill patients), potential drug interaction studies, and
      will help to establish safe and efficacious intravenous and oral dosing regimens.
