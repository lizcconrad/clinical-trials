      Our hypothesis is that an on-site mentoring program for staff at primary health care centers
      in northern Karnataka, will improve the quality of maternal, neonatal and child health care,
      and improve clinical outcomes.

    <textblock>
      By providing on-site mentoring for improved clinical care and service delivery, we
      hypothesize that the quality of services and care will improve and patients will have better
      clinical outcomes. Specifically we believe that routine on-site clinical and service delivery
      mentoring will strengthen clinical knowledge, skills and practices among staff nurses and
      ANMs (in year 2), will strengthen appropriate referrals and follow up care, will improve
      other aspects of service quality, and provider and client satisfaction. The evaluation will
      assess change during the first year of the intervention that focuses on clinical mentoring of
      staff nurses and on quality improvement in the PHCs as a whole. The evaluation will focus on
      success indicators as shown in Appendix 1. Due to the short time frame for evaluation,
      success indicators will be principally at the levels of inputs, outputs, and outcomes
      focusing on adherence to the Sukshema Critical Care package, although we also hope to assess
      some key health outcomes, in terms of reduction of &quot;near-miss&quot; cases.

      A. Pre and post MM intervention evaluation strategy The &quot;pre-intervention&quot; evaluation will
      have two phases. The first phase will take place in all 122 sites before any intervention
      activities begin (Figure 1). This evaluation will focus on site readiness to provide quality
      services, provider knowledge, attitudes and reported or observed (or simulated) practices,
      supervision and mentoring, record keeping, and provider and client satisfaction. The NRHM SBA
      guidelines, PHC 24/7 guidelines, MHFW NSSK guidelines, and the Sukshema critical care package
      will all be used to determine expectations of clinical quality of care at this level.

      The focus of the first year of the MM intervention is enhanced clinical skills in the
      intra-partum and postpartum periods and thus assessments of actual clinical practices are
      important. However, data on actual practices in the intrapartum and postpartum periods will
      be difficult to collect by observation during this baseline (especially those with
      complications). Most of the PHCs conduct only a few deliveries each week, and it will be
      therefore almost impossible to obtain a representative sample of observations. Therefore we
      will assess intrapartum and postpartum clinical practices largely though the audit of case
      sheets and registers. However, these case sheets are currently either not available or not
      used. Thus our strategy necessitates delay of this part of the second phase of the baseline
      until after the update training where all staff will be given and instructed in the use of
      new and improved case sheets. All sites will be given the opportunity to practice using these
      patient case sheets for one month before they are collected by project staff and used as a
      basis for assessing both compliance with the new case sheets, adequacy of reporting, and
      actual case management. Actual case observations will be done during routine MM visits where
      possible. The post intervention phase of the assessment will take place in all sites once
      year after the first (planned 6) MM visits and will repeat the baseline survey.

      Pre and post MM intervention evaluation survey tools

      The survey will use four types of survey tools pre and post MM intervention and one
      additional tool after one year in the intervention sites only:

      A1. Questionnaires for all staff nurses on duty (including night duty) at the PHCs during the
      evaluation that will assess knowledge of intrapartum, postpartum, newborn care and infection
      prevention, and solicit provider perspectives on mentoring and supervision. In some cases,
      the questions will be in the form of case studies or asking for simulated demonstrations of
      practices.

      A2. Facility audits and observations in all PHCs to assess site readiness to provide quality
      services and provide checks of drugs used: equipment and drugs, staffing and training levels,
      availability and correct use of case sheets, registers and referral slips. This tool will
      also have a section for observing practices in the postnatal ward.

      A3. Postpartum client questionnaires with all women who have delivered up to one month before
      the survey traced to their homes that will assess client recall of information and services
      given and client satisfaction. Delivery registers will be checked and all women who delivered
      in the PHC n the previous month will be traced to their homes for interview.

      A4. Case sheet and register audits for all cases for the one month before survey dates to
      assess completeness of reporting and appropriate client management A5. Focus Group
      Discussions with SNs in a sample of intervention PHCs: During the post MM intervention survey
      we will conduct focus group discussions (FGDs) with staff at a selection of intervention
      sites to understand their experiences with the MM intervention and to gather their
      suggestions for improvement.

      Data collection: The field staff will consist of three supervisors per district, plus 13
      teams of 2 interviewers, one of whom will manage the facility audits and staff surveys, and
      one the postpartum client questionnaires for each of the 122 PHCs. It will be necessary for
      each team to spend 2 days in each PHC, thus each team will be able to complete the survey
      work in 3-4 weeks. Simultaneous data collection will be carried out in both districts.

      A week's training will be provided to the field teams that will include lectures on technical
      topics, demonstration interviews, mock interviews and field practice. The training will be
      provided to about 10% more persons than actually required for the survey, and the required
      number will be selected based on their performance during the training. KHPT and SJMC staff
      will conduct the training and will monitor the field work activities and quality of data.

      Data processing: Double data entry will be done at KHPT, who will prepare a report of the
      pre-intervention survey and end-line survey comparison.

      B. Routine continuous monitoring: First, project staff will routinely document staffing,
      training, financial and other project inputs, data that will be crucial for assessing the
      feasibility of scale up to other districts. During bi-monthly MM visits, staff will have a
      proscribed list of data to collect. As well as keeping details of staff at the sites their
      training background and any clinical mentoring given, the mentors will have a proscribed list
      of clinical skills to observe; wherever possible during their 3 day visits, they will observe
      women in labour, after delivery and in the postpartum ward, and where this is not possible,
      they will use models and case studies to assess staff skills. There will be continuous
      monitoring of the MM interventions through reports of MM visits that will include:
      documentation of visits through trip reports that detail facility meetings, talks given,
      happenings in the PHC or area and notes on any morbidity and mortality discussions; completed
      clinical competency checklists for mentored individuals. They will also photocopy the case
      sheets, which will have been used as a basis for discussion during the visit and facility
      action plans, for review by KHPT clinical staff. The case sheets will also be collected
      quarterly from the control sites by the KHPT district staff. These staff will encourage use
      of the case sheets at each of their quarterly visits without any additional training or
      mentoring.

      Informed consent Verbal, witnessed informed consent will be sought from the head of the PHC
      who will be asked to give permission to survey the PHC; from staff nurses who will be
      interviewed in the PHCs and from postnatal women traced to the community.

      Districts and sites Using a matched (for client volume) case control strategy, the MM
      intervention will be piloted and evaluated in PHCs in two districts, Gulbarga and Bellary
      that have a total of 122 24x7 PHCs (Gulbarga 70; Bellary 52). Sixty one PHCs (Gulbarga 35;
      Bellary 26) will be randomly assigned to an MM intervention or experimental group (stratified
      by taluka and 6-monthly patient delivery load), while the rest will serve as control sites.

      SBA + training The first part of the intervention involves all the 122 PHC 24/7 facilities in
      the two districts for two reasons: first we feel that this training is generally needed and
      will help to put the intervention and control site staff on the same level playing field in
      terms of basic MNCH knowledge; second, we know from the Sukshema baseline survey conducted in
      2011 that few staff use adequate reporting mechanisms such as case sheets. As these are
      needed both programmatically as job aids, and for programme evaluative purposes, we will use
      this training as an opportunity to introduce new case sheets. After the first phase of
      baseline survey (described below) and before the mentoring programme begins in the
      intervention sites, Sukshema project staff will conduct a 3 day training update (called SBA+)
      for all staff nurses and a one day SBA+ for all M.O.'s from all 122 PHCs in the two
      districts, irrespective of whether they have previously attended the NRHM Skilled Birth
      Attendant (SBA) training. The 3 day training will focus on the essential components on
      intra-partum and postpartum (mother and baby) care identified in the Sukshema critical care
      package that evidence shows can significantly reduce maternal and newborn morbidity and
      mortality. The one day training for doctors will focus on identification of danger signs,
      pre-referral management of complications, quality of care, case audits and improvement of
      management and documentation. At these trainings, staff will be given, and instructed in the
      use of enhanced case sheets for women and babies from labour through to discharge, including
      use of the partograph. After this training, there will be no further interventions in the
      control sites, except that Sukshema staff will visit every 3 months to collect copies of the
      case sheets.

      Sampling strategy The PHC intervention and control sites will be selected systematically in
      each taluka, after stratification and matching by client volume per month.

      MNCH mentoring In each district MNCH mentors (MMs), a new staff cadre, will be recruited and
      trained (Gulbarga 5; Bellary 4), each responsible for the intervention in 6-7
      experimental/intervention PHCs. We will also train 3 additional MMs to act as a back-up (2 in
      Gulbarga and one in Bellary), total 12 mentors. The MMs will attend some of the PHC staff
      training but will also be trained for 4 weeks by project staff at St John's Medical College
      in essential clinical competencies and in how to mentor staff in clinical skills, team
      building and problem solving, service delivery improvement, as well as in how to be effective
      mentors. The MNCH mentors will be senior nurses, selected based on specific criteria such as
      clinical experience, training and mentoring abilities, and experience/familiarity with
      government health systems. They will be guided by a Mentoring Coordinator in each district
      who will support the mentors' activities and liaise between them, the PHCs, district
      government staff and KHPT district staff. During the first year, the mentors will be trained
      by the Project to (a) provide clinical mentoring in safe delivery to staff nurses by hands-on
      coaching; (b) provide mentoring in how to improve the quality of services by building
      teamwork and introducing problem solving initiatives to address other aspects of service
      delivery (including especially referral processes); and in year 2 to mentor ANMs who will
      come to the PHC during the MNCH mentor visits, in providing antenatal, postpartum and newborn
      care, and referrals and follow up.
