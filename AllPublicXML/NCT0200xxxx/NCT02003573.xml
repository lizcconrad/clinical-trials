      Dose Escalation (MTD Finding) Phase: To investigate the maximum tolerated dose (MTD), safety
      and pharmacokinetics of different volasertib administration schedules in combination with
      decitabine in previously untreated AML patients &gt;= 65 years of age who are considered
      ineligible for standard intensive therapy, or patients with relapsed or refractory AML
      regardless of prior treatment status.

      MTD Extension Phase: To collect additional data on safety, efficacy and pharmacokinetics of
      volasertib in combination with decitabine in previously untreated patients with AML &gt;= 65
      years of age and considered ineligible for standard intensive therapy.

        Inclusion criteria:

          1. Dose Escalation Phase: patients with previously untreated AML, relapsed or refractory
             AML regardless of prior treatment status.

          2. MTD Extension Phase: previously untreated AML (prior treatment for MDS is allowed).

          3. Age &gt;= 65 years.

          4. Previously untreated patients must be ineligible for receiving standard intensive
             therapy at the time of enrolment, in the opinion of the investigator and based on
             documented medical reasons.

          5. Histologically or cytologically confirmed AML (except for APL, FAB subtype M3)
             according to the WHO classification.

          6. Eastern co-operative oncology group (ECOG) performance score =&lt; 1 at screening.

          7. Signed and dated written informed consent by start date of Screening Visit in
             accordance with GCP and local legislation.

        Exclusion criteria:

          1. MTD Extension Phase: Prior chemotherapy for AML (except for hydroxyurea). Patients can
             receive treatment with hydroxyurea in order to reduce high WBC count for no more than
             28 days (cumulative); discontinuation of hydroxyurea at least one day prior to the
             study treatment is required. Please note that any prior therapy for MDS is allowed.

          2. Acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL, FAB subtype M3), according to WHO classification.

          3. Hypersensitivity to the trial drugs.

          4. Other malignancy currently requiring active therapy (except for hormonal/anti-hormonal
             treatment, e.g. in prostate or breast cancer).

          5. Known clinical central nervous system (CNS) symptoms deemed by the investigator to be
             related to leukemic CNS involvement.

          6. QTcF &gt; 470 ms, calculated as the mean value of the triplicates taken at least 2
             minutes apart at baseline or QTcF prolongation deemed clinically relevant by the
             investigator.

          7. Baseline LVEF of &lt; 45% or below the lower limit of institutional normal range.

          8. Aspartate amino transferase (AST) or alanine amino transferase (ALT) &gt; 2.5 x the upper
             limit of normal (ULN). Patients with elevated liver enzyme(s) due to leukemic
             involvement are allowed up to = 5 x the ULN.

          9. Total bilirubin &gt; 1.5 x ULN. For patients with Gilbert's syndrome or elevation due to
             hepatic infiltrate, total bilirubin must be &lt;4 x ULN.

             with consent, study participation, or interpretation of study results.

         14. Patients with a systemic fungal, bacterial, viral, or other infection that is not
             controlled.

         15. Contraindications for decitabine treatment according to the manufacturer's prescribing
             information provided in the ISF.

         16. Female patients of childbearing potential who are sexually active and unwilling to use
             a medically acceptable method of contraception during the trial and for a minimum of 6
             months after completion of study treatment.

         18. Pregnant or breast feeding patients.

         19. Treatment with any investigational drug within 2 weeks of administration of first
             study medication dose or within less than five half -lives of the investigational drug
             before treatment with the present trial drug, whichever is shorter, and / or
             persistence of toxicities of prior anti-leukemic therapies which are deemed clinically

             trial using a Plk inhibitory compound.
