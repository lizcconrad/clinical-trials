    <description>Participants sleep at home while monitored with ambulatory polysomnography. For the full sleep condition, they are instructed to go to bed and to get up at the usual times that they would normally do that. For the sleep deprivation condition, they are instructed to go to bed 3 hours before the time when they would usually get up, and then to get up at that time.</description>
