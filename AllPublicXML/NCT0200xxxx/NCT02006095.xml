    <textblock>
      Carotid revascularization can significantly reduce the risk of stroke in patients with severe
      carotid stenosis; however, it has been associated with cognitive decline in 25% of the older
      adults who undergo the procedure. Characterizing risk factors for cognitive decline following
      carotid interventions and individualizing treatment strategy based on those risks can
      minimize procedure-associated cognitive dysfunction. Neuroimaging techniques that
      characterize white matter integrity and regional hypoperfusion have the potential to provide
      sensitive brain structure indicators that may be associated with memory decline following
      revascularization procedures. In this protocol, we hope to determine how cerebral blood flow
      and baseline white matter abnormality in the vulnerable region modify the frequency and
      cognitive effect of microembolization following carotid revascularization procedures.
