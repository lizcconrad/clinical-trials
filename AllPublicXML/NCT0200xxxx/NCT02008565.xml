  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is a multi-center, randomized, placebo controlled trial with participants
      randomized into one of four groups:

        1. placebo/usual care (educational pamphlet)

        2. loperamide/usual care (educational pamphlet)

        3. placebo/anal exercises with biofeedback

        4. loperamide/anal exercises with biofeedback

      The primary outcome, change from baseline in St. Marks (Vaizey) Score at 24 weeks, will be
      compared between treatment groups using linear regression.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The goals of this trial are to compare the use of loperamide to oral placebo and to compare
      the use of anal sphincter exercise training with biofeedback to usual care (educational
      pamphlet) in the treatment of women suffering from fecal incontinence (FI). We will test the
      following null hypotheses:

        1. there is no difference in outcomes between women randomized to loperamide and women
           randomized to oral placebo for treatment of FI;

        2. there is no difference in outcomes between women randomized to anal sphincter exercises
           with biofeedback and women randomized to usual care (educational pamphlet) for FI
           treatment;

        3. there is no difference between women randomized to both treatments together and women
           randomized to either FI treatment alone; and

        4. there is no correlation between anal manometry measurements and digital anal squeeze
           strength or measures of FI severity and bother.

      A supplemental study, Stool Metabolome and Microbiome in Women with Fecal Incontinence in
      CAPABLe, will evaluate the stool metabolome and microbiome in women with fecal incontinence
      and unaffected age matched controls.

    <description>Participants randomized to the loperamide group will begin with 2mg of loperamide/day. The participant will be administered the Patient Global Symptom Control rating scale (PGSC) to determine dose escalation. Participants who report inadequate control of stool leakage on the PGSC will be instructed to increase the daily dose of loperamide by 2 mg up to a maximum of 8 mg per day (1-4 capsules). Bothersome adverse events and resulting dose reduction will be based exclusively on the result of the Patient Global Tolerability Scale (PGTS). The daily dose will be decreased by 2mg to a minimum of 2mg every other day. If a PGSC score indicates inadequate control of stool leakage combined with a PGTS score indicating bothersome side effects, the participant will discontinue the study medication.</description>

    <description>Participants will receive a formal anal exercises training program that can be easily applied in an office setting with minimal participant burden. Participants will attend six anal exercises with biofeedback sessions with trained personnel over a 12-week period for the 24-week study. Sessions will include introduction, standard patient education, and exercises using anal manometry-assisted biofeedback introducing concepts such as shaping, generalization and termination. The protocol uses strength and sensory training including urge resistance training. During the final twelve weeks, participants will perform anal exercises on their own. The sessions with interventionists will occur every other week for 12 weeks (total 6 supervised sessions).</description>
