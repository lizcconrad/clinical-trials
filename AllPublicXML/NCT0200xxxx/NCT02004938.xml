      Project Aims: The purpose of this study is to determine the size of the right internal
      jugular vein (RIJV) in children with normal respiratory physiology during the respiratory
      cycle and evaluate the reliability of those measurements.

      Hypothesis: Ultrasound measurements of internal jugular vein collapse of children can be
      reliably measured in the respiratory cycle.

      Intervention: We will ensure that the patient is not having any respiratory symptoms or signs
      of dehydration. A clinical asthma score will be assigned using the Modified Woods pulmonary
      index scoring system. The Gorelick Dehydration Scale with also be calculated.

      Using bedside ultrasonography with the Sonosite Titan ultrasound machine, each measurement
      will be taken with the subject lying in bed with the head of the bed elevated at 45 degrees
      with the subject's head in the neutral position and then turned 45 degrees leftward.
      Measurements of the internal jugular vein at maximal inhalation and exhalation will be
      recorded. Reliability calculations will be assessed.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        Subjects ages 6-17 years old presenting to the emergency department (ED) will be enrolled
        into the normal respiratory function group.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Children will be excluded from participation if they have: a baseline chronic lung disorder
        (including asthma), current respiratory illness, fever, Emergency Services Index (ESI)
        triage category of less than or equal to 2 (emergent acuity), chronic cough, dyspnea with
        exercise, wheezing, or a history of smoking by self and/or parent report.

        Subjects will be excluded if they had prior cardiac/pulmonary disease or surgeries (other
        than asthma for the acute exacerbation group), significant musculoskeletal abnormalities
        (such as scoliosis) that might compromise baseline pulmonary function testing, a history of
        smoking tobacco or marijuana, and prematurity (birth at less than 37 weeks gestation. In
        addition, those with an allergy to ultrasound gel will be excluded from participation.
