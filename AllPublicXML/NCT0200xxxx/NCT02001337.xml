  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to create a prospective cohort of subjects with increased
      probability of being diagnosed with pancreatic cancer and then screen this cohort for
      pancreatic cancer
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Compared to the general population, subjects &gt;50 years of age with new-onset diabetes (DM)
      are 8-times more likely to have pancreatic cancer (PaC). The likelihood of PaC in new-onset
      DM is further increased in those who have weight loss or elevated CA19-9. In this study
      patients with newly diagnosed diabetes will be prospectively identified. Those with weight
      loss and/or elevated pancreatic cancer marker (CA 19-9) will undergo pancreatic imaging. All
      subjects will be followed up to 24 months. If successful in identifying surgically removable
      PaC, this study will fundamentally change our practice and will be a major breakthrough in
      PaC treatment and research.
