  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-centre, open-label, non-randomised, two-arm study in 12 healthy male
      volunteers. This study is designed to correlate the gastrointestinal transit behaviour of
      delayed-release diclofenac potassium tablets with their pharmacokinetic (PK) absorption
      profiles.

      We will be looking at:

        1. The behaviour of the tablets (when, where and how quickly they break up)

        2. The gastric emptying time of the tablets (when they leave the stomach)

        3. The gastrointestinal transit of the tablets (how long they take to travel through the
           gut)

        4. Blood levels of the drug (diclofenac)
    </textblock>

      The tablets being tested will contain the drug, diclofenac potassium. Diclofenac potassium is
      a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) taken to reduce inflammation and as an
      analgesic, reducing pain in certain conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis, gout and
      post-operative pain.

      The 2 treatments are as follows:

      Tablet T4: Radiolabelled delayed release diclofenac potassium tablet with time delay of 4 h

      Tablet T6: Radiolabelled delayed release diclofenac potassium tablet with time delay of 6 h

      In this study we will be using a type of radioactive material (known as technetium-99m) which
      is routinely used in investigations of this type. A small amount of technetium-99m will be
      put into each tablet.

      Primary Objective A)To assess the site and time of onset and complete release of radiolabel
      from two delayed-release diclofenac potassium formulations

      Secondary Objectives B)To determine gastrointestinal transit parameters of two
      delayed-release diclofenac potassium formulations C)To determine the plasma concentrations of
      diclofenac at each PK sampling point post-administration of two delayed-release diclofenac
      potassium formulations D)To assess and compare between the two delayed-release diclofenac
      potassium formulations, as a minimum, the following PK parameters: tlag, tmax, Cmax and
      AUC0-15h

        Inclusion Criteria:

        - Male 18 to 45 years inclusive. BMI 18.0 to 29.9 kg/m2. Body weight â‰¥50 kg. Understands

        Demonstrates understanding of the study and willingness to participate as evidenced by
        voluntary written informed consent.
