  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an extension study study to investigate long term safety of SyB L-1101 when
      administered intravenously every 4 weeks to the patients who have completed 8 cycles in the
      study 2011005 whose purpose is to investigate tolerability of SyB L-1101 when administered
      intravenously in patients with recurrent/relapsed or refractory myelodysplastic syndrome.
      Antitumor effects will also be investigated in this study.

    <description>Disease progression
According to the International Working Group 2006 response criteria for Myelodysplastic Syndrome, &quot;disease progression&quot; is defined as no evidence of complete remission (CR), partial remission, marrow CR, stable disease, or failure, and as meeting one of the following conditions.
when pretreatment percentage of bone marrow blasts &lt; 5%: ≥ 50% increase to &gt; 5%.
when pretreatment percentage of bone marrow blasts 5 to 10%: ≥ 50% increase to &gt; 10%.
when pretreatment percentage of bone marrow blasts 10 to 20%: ≥ 50% increase to &gt; 20%.
when pretreatment percentage of bone marrow blasts 20 to 30%: ≥ 50% increase to &gt; 30%.
other: at least one of the following: decrease to ≤ 50% of neutrophil or platelet count at maximum response, ≥ 2 g/dL decrease in Hgb or transfusion dependence (in the absence of other factors, such as infection, gastrointestinal bleeding, or hemolysis).</description>

    <description>SyB L-1101 (rigosertib sodium) will be administered intravenously 72 continuous hours (3 days), followed by 25-day observation period. The treatment period of 28 days (3 days of administration + 25 days of observation) constitutes 1 cycle. The dose at cycle 8 in the study 2011005 will be the dose (if needed, the dose can be reduced) at the first cycle in this study (cycle 9). From cycle 10 on, the dose of SyB L-1101 will be reduced, delayed, or discontinued according to adverse events and results of observation at the previous cycle.</description>

The dose of SyB L-1101 in the ninth cycle was to be the same as that of the eighth cycle of Study 2011005 (if a dose reduction in the next cycle applied to a patient, SyB L-1101 was administered to the patient at the reduced dose).</description>

According to the International Working Group 2006 response criteria for Myelodysplastic Syndrome, &quot;disease progression&quot; is defined as no evidence of complete remission (CR), partial remission, marrow CR, stable disease, or failure, and as meeting one of the following conditions.
when pretreatment percentage of bone marrow blasts &lt; 5%: ≥ 50% increase to &gt; 5%.
when pretreatment percentage of bone marrow blasts 5 to 10%: ≥ 50% increase to &gt; 10%.
when pretreatment percentage of bone marrow blasts 10 to 20%: ≥ 50% increase to &gt; 20%.
when pretreatment percentage of bone marrow blasts 20 to 30%: ≥ 50% increase to &gt; 30%.
other: at least one of the following: decrease to ≤ 50% of neutrophil or platelet count at maximum response, ≥ 2 g/dL decrease in Hgb or transfusion dependence (in the absence of other factors, such as infection, gastrointestinal bleeding, or hemolysis).</description>
