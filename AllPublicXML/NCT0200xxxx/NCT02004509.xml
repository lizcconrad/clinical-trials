      Introduction: Patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) have a substantial risk of stroke and
      systemic embolism. Subclinical AF is often suspected to be the cause of stroke in these
      patients. The detection of asymptomatic AF episodes is a challenge and the real rate of
      occurrence of these episodes remains unknown. The rate of stroke is high among patients who
      have received a pacemaker and this device can detect subclinical episodes of rapid atrial
      rate, which correlate with electrocardiographically documented AF. The net benefit of
      anticoagulant treatment is well established in patients with clinical AF but data about
      anticoagulation in subclinical AF setting is unknown. The aim of this study is to assess the
      impact of anticoagulant therapy on subclinical AF, directed by cardiac implantable electronic
      device (CIED) intensive monitoring, on the incidence of stroke and systemic embolism and
      correlate the AF episodes detected by CIED with thromboembolic events. Methods: This is a
      prospective, randomized, unicentric, parallel clinical study in patients with
      atrioventricular pacemaker, defibrillator or cardiac resynchronization therapy devices in
      sinus rhythm and CHADS2 score (an index of the risk of stroke in patients with atrial
      fibrillation, range from 0 to 6) â‰¥ 2 . Patients will be randomized to the intervention group
      - intensive monitoring arm (Group I) or control group - routine schedule arm (Group II) in a
      1:1 ratio. Time to inclusion will be 24 months and all patients will be followed up for a
      period of 36 months. Group I patients will be submitted to device data collection every 2
      months, while the Group II patients will be managed conventionally. Patients from Group I
      with episodes of subclinical AF will receive anticoagulant therapy, as well as patients with
      clinical AF of both arms. Device data from Group II patients will not be analyzed until they
      achieve the primary endpoint. Primary endpoint: stroke or systemic embolism. Secondary
      endpoints: subclinical AF rate, total mortality, cardiovascular mortality, myocardial
      infarction, cardiovascular hospitalization and bleeding rates. Expected outcome: It is
      expected that anticoagulation therapy of subclinical AF directed by CIED intensive monitoring
      will reduce the incidence of stroke and systemic embolism comparing to patients with
      non-diagnosed subclinical AF.
