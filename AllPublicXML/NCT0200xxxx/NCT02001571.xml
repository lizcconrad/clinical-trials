  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and pharmacokinetics (study of what the
      body does to a drug) of 1000 mg oral dose of abiraterone acetate and its major metabolite(s)
      with mild or moderate hepatic impairment and matched control Participants with normal hepatic
      function.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label (identity of assigned study drug will be known) pharmacokinetics and
      safety study of abiraterone acetate administered as four 250 mg tablets (1000 mg) to 3
      cohorts (groups) in Cohort 1 (Mild Hepatic Impairment), Cohort 2 (Moderate Hepatic
      Impairment) and Cohort 3 (Normal Hepatic Function). There will be approximately 8
      Participants per cohort (total of approximately 24 Participants for the study). The cohorts
      will be dosed sequentially and activities will consist of Screening, Study and Follow-up
      periods, a total of up to approximately 36 days. Possible Participants will be screened to
      assess their eligibility to enter the study within 14 days prior to study Day 1. Participants
      will be confined at the Clinical Research Center (CRC) from the time of Check-in on Day -1
      until discharge on Day 5. Participants will return to the CRC on Days 8 and 15 and there will
      be a follow-up call or visit on Day 22. A review of all clinical and laboratory data through
      Day 8 evaluations in each cohort will be done by the Medical Monitor and the Principal
      Investigator (PI) prior to proceeding with dosing any further cohort, if indicated. Safety
      will be monitored throughout the study.
