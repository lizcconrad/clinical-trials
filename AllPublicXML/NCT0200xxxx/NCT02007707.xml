      The goals of the study are to develop smoking cessation intervention using lay health worker
      (LHW) outreach and family involvement targeting Vietnamese Americans ages 18 and above in
      Santa Clara County, CA, to evaluate efficacy of the proposed intervention. The study is a
      two-arm randomized controlled trial targeting a total of 18 lay health workers (LHW) and 108
      dyads of a smoker and a family member from the same household. The hypotheses are:

      H. At 6-month post initiation of the intervention, Vietnamese male daily smokers who receive
      the proposed â€•Quit Smoking For a Healthy Family Intervention, a Family-based Intervention
      (FI), will be more likely to achieve biochemically verified 7-day point prevalence of smoking
      abstinence when compared to those receiving an attention control intervention (CI).

      H2. At 6-month, FI participants we be more likely to report making at least one 24-hour quit
      attempt than those in CI.

      H3. At 6-month, FI participants will be more likely to report using a recommended
      evidence-based smoking cessation resource (quitline, FDA-approved smoking cessation
      medications, advice from health professionals) than those in CI
