      This study aim is to observe the response to Bambuterol Hydrochloride tablets treatment in
      subjects with eosinophilic bronchitis .

      The investigators hypothesize:

      A few of subjects with EB have some responses to Bambuterol Hydrochloride tablets therapy.

      Most of subjects with CVA respond well to Bambuterol Hydrochloride tablets therapy

      Study groups:

      45 patients with chronic cough will be collected and two groups will formed based on
      diagnosis as follows:

      Group 1: EB group The patients with eosinophilic bronchitis received Bambuterol Hydrochloride
      tablets 10mg Q24 for three days .

      Group 2: CVA group The patients with cough variant asthma received Bambuterol Hydrochloride
      tablets 10mg Q24 for three days .

      Observe the response to Bambuterol Hydrochloride tablets treatment three days later and
      compare the effective rate of patients with EB and CVA. Then the study will be over.

             eosinophil percentage (Eos%) over 2.5%, and the negative result in bronchial
             provocation test by methacholine inhalation challenge.
