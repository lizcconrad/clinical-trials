  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Engagement in primary care for People Living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA) is a significant public
      health concern because reduced commitment to care puts PLWHA at risk for illness progression,
      death, and transmission of HIV to others. This project will develop a novel treatment, brief
      acceptance-based behavior therapy (ABBT), to promote self-acceptance of HIV status as a
      pathway to reducing engagement barriers. The clinical and public health impact of this
      project will be the development of a simple, low-cost, disseminable intervention that
      enhances longitudinal commitment to care so PLWHA can obtain effective medical treatments
      that will prolong survival and improve quality of life. We hypothesize that individuals
      randomized to brief ABBT will showed increased longitudinal attendance of primary care
      appointments.

    <description>ABBT will consist of 2 sessions. The first session will be used to introduce the concept of acceptance and its possible benefits in the context of life values and patient-identified barriers to care engagement. Following a discussion of life values will be a discussion of which, if any, of these values are currently misaligned with the participant's HIV self-care. At the second session, acceptance-based coping skills will be practiced and a behavioral plan will be developed to targets barriers identified in the first session. These discussions will help the participant clarify how best to align their values with decisions on how to manage his/her HIV (e.g. when and how to disclose, what to expect at appointments).</description>

    <description>TAU will consist of the standard sessions all individuals receive as they enter HIV care and attend their first follow-up visit to review lab results. TAU includes identification of environmental barriers to care, assessment of needs for additional care and corresponding referrals (i.e., for depression, substance abuse), and recommendations to attend HIV support groups.</description>
