      Lack of physical activity is associated with negative health outcomes, including obesity,
      diabetes, and cardiovascular disease. There are calls from NIH and medical organizations to
      integrate the use mobile devices, such as smartphones, to provide &quot;e-health&quot; interventions to
      patients in their daily life. Referred to as Ecological Momentary Interventions [EMI], these
      innovative mobile methods provide an opportunity for researchers and clinicians to offer
      tailored intervention material to people at specific times and in specific settings when they
      may be most in need of such support. To our knowledge no study has used objective ambulatory
      assessment data to deliver EMI. This preliminary work is to demonstrate the feasibility, and
      test preliminary efficacy, of using a Bluetooth accelerometer to provide real-time feedback
      on a smartphone to increase objectively measured steps (i.e., increase activity). A
      within-person design will be used, including assessment, intervention, and follow-up phases.
      During the assessment phase objective physical activity (using accelerometers) will be
      collected. In the intervention phase participants will also receive real-time feedback
      throughout the day regarding their total steps and personalized step goals. Objectively
      measured steps and disease status measures will be used to evaluate efficacy.

      Lack of physical activity is associated with negative health outcomes, including obesity,
      diabetes, and cardiovascular disease. A myriad of interventions aimed at increasing daily
      physical activity (PA) exist. Increasing PA levels has been shown to improve health among
      patients with cardiovascular and metabolic diseases. Accelerometers and pedometers can be
      useful tools in such interventions, particularly when used to provide participants with
      individualized feedback on progress toward PA goals. These programs typically require
      participants to set PA goals (e.g., number of steps/day), wear pedometers, and record daily
      activity levels from the pedometers. This process relies heavily on accurate self-reported
      information and is both time- and effort-intensive for participants, thus limiting
      acceptability and longer-term viability of this intervention option.

      There is an increasing trend in health behavior research to use mobile devices, such as
      smartphones to provide interventions. These methods - known as Ecological Momentary
      Interventions [EMI] - are innovative because they allow researchers and clinicians to offered
      information to people at specific times and in settings when they may be most in need of such
      support. One way EMI can be tailored is by having participants complete repeated self-report
      assessments on mobile devices such as smartphones (known as Ecological Momentary Assessment
      [EMA]), and then using this material to identify times when people are in need of
      intervention. Although some studies (including recent studies conducted by members of our
      research team) have developed interventions that use EMA to create real-time interventions
      that are delivered in daily life, to our knowledge no study has used objective ambulatory
      assessment data to do so. Using objective data is potentially advantageous because it
      utilizes passive data collection (requiring little or no input by participants), and thus
      reduces participant burden and potential concerns regarding accuracy of self-reported data.

      The first aim of this study is to establish the feasibility and acceptability of integrating
      Bluetooth-enabled activity monitor with smartphones to provide real-time feedback regarding
      physical activity in everyday life. We will evaluate feasibility and acceptability of this
      intervention method by tracking intervention delivery and participant compliance with EMA.
      This information will be automatically recorded by smartphone and activity monitor.

      The second aim of this work is to provide a preliminary evaluation of the efficacy of
      delivering real-time feedback based on objectively measured PA. Our primary outcome is number
      of objectively measured steps. It is expected that participants will increase from their
      baseline number of steps when receiving personalized feedback and reminders on the
      smartphones.
