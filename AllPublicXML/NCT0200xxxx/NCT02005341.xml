        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Is at least 21 years of age and skeletally mature.

          2. Must have cervical disc disease (defined as neck pain of discogenic origin with
             degeneration of the disc confirmed by history and radiographic studies) at one level
             in the cervical spine between C3 to T1.

          3. Must have completed a minimum of six weeks of unsuccessful conservative, non-operative
             care or has the presence of progressive symptoms or signs of nerve root/spinal cord
             compression in the face of conservative treatment.

          4. Has pre-operative objective evidence of primary diagnosis confirmed by appropriate
             imaging studies (Anteroposterior/Lateral/Flexion/Extension X-rays &amp; a recent MRI).

          5. Is willing and able to comply with all clinical investigation visits and procedures
             including screening treatment procedures, post-operative management, the follow-up
             schedule and completion of forms or questionnaires.

          6. Is able to understand and sign the patient information sheet/informed consent form.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Requires fusion at more than one level.

          2. Has had prior fusion at the level to be treated.

          3. Has a metabolic or systemic bone disorder.

          4. Has a disease that significantly inhibits bone healing (i.e., severe osteoporosis,
             osteomalacia, Paget's disease).

          5. Has a systemic or local infection (active or latent).

          6. Has acute or chronic infections in the surgical area (i.e., soft tissue infections;
             inflammatory, bacterial bone disorders, osteomyelitis).

          7. Chronic use of steroids, other than episodic use or inhaled corticosteroids.

          8. Has any significant general illness (i.e., HIV, active metastatic cancer of any type,
             uncontrolled diabetes Type I, dialysis dependent renal failure, symptomatic liver
             disease).

          9. Has a mental or physical condition that would limit the ability to comply with study
             requirements or would preclude accurate evaluation.

         10. Is immunocompromised or being treated with immunosuppressive agents (including
             chemotherapy or radiation treatment).

         11. Has documented allergies to hydroxyapatite or porcine collagen, PEEK, titanium,
             titanium alloy or tantalum.

         12. Is currently pregnant, or interested in becoming pregnant during the clinical
             investigation follow-up.

         13. Is a smoker.

         14. Is non-English speaking.

         15. Requires the use of a bone-growth stimulator.

         16. Is a prisoner.

         17. Is currently involved in another drug or device clinical investigation that may
             confound the clinical trial investigation
