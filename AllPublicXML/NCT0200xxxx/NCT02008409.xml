    <textblock>
      The primary goal of the study is to evaluate the safety of the EndoLift Liver Retractor as an
      internal laparoscopic liver retraction device. The secondary goals of the study are to
      evaluate the efficacy of the EndoLift Liver Retractor as an internal laparoscopic liver
      retraction device and to identify 'best practices' for device utilization.

      This study evaluates the use of a specific type of liver retractor (EndoLift). Liver
      retractors are often necessary during MIS procedures, but this retractor is the only device
      which is deployed internally (NOT requiring additional skin punctures/incisions for placement
      of the liver retractor device). All patients undergoing minimally invasive surgery (MIS) at
      Duke Regional Hospital will be approached.

      The new device is expected to have a minimal risk safety profile. The investigators believe
      that these risks are no more than would be encountered by using any other commercially
      available retraction device available on the market today. Data will be collected and
      analyzed by the identified investigators. Continuous variables will be analyzed via T-test
      and Chi-square analysis will be applied to discontinuous variables. Statistical analysis
      software such as SPSSÂ® will be utilized when necessary.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Since the introduction of minimally invasive surgery (MIS) techniques in the 1980's
      laparoscopic surgery has become the preferred approach for a number of intra-abdominal
      procedures such as cholecystectomy, gastric bypass, etc.[1] One of the key components of
      laparoscopic surgery, of any surgery for that matter, is the ability to achieve and maintain
      adequate visualization of the surgical target throughout the procedure. During certain MIS
      procedures the patient's internal organs, such as the liver, can block or obscure the
      surgical view. A number of surgical instruments (retractors) have been developed to help
      retract abdominal organs &quot;out of the way&quot; during MIS procedures, but all of these devices
      require an additional abdominal wall puncture/incision to adequately position the device.

      Virtual Ports, Ltd. has developed a new laparoscopic liver retractor device, the EndoLift
      Liver Retractor. This new device does not require additional skin incisions and is placed
      internally (inside the abdomen) during laparoscopic surgery. The device has 2 ends that
      &quot;grab&quot; tissue. The body of the device is a smooth, cylindrical steel bar that has minimal
      risk of traumatizing tissues/organs. The ends of the device are positioned on to peritoneal
      surfaces (e.g., anterior abdominal wall and/or the right crus of the diaphragm) and the body
      of the device (smooth cylindrical bar) &quot;pushes&quot; the liver away from the surgical field.

    <description>The primary study endpoint will be to establish the safety of using the EndoLift Liver Retractor as an internal laparoscopic liver retraction device.
Safety will be established by lack of serious events. Events are defined as adverse if they require change in the operative course, a device specific complication and/or association with prolongation of hospital stay.</description>

    <measure>Effective use of the EndoLift Liver Retractor</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 6 hours during the operative procedure</time_frame>
    <description>The effective use of the EndoLift Liver Retractor as a liver retraction device during surgery will be considered a &quot;success&quot;. If there is a need to use any additional equipment to retract the liver during the surgery, the subject will be scored a &quot;failure&quot;.
Study success will be declared if at least 80% of subjects are scored a &quot;success&quot;.</description>

    <description>During surgery, the surgeon will use the new internal liver retractor device. The device will retract the subject's liver out of the way and help the surgeon see better during the surgery. The device is placed inside the abdomen during the surgery. It is &quot;clipped&quot; onto 2 safe surfaces inside the abdomen. The device is removed before the surgery ends.</description>
