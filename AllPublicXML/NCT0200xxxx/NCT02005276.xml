  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Employers are increasingly looking for opportunities to motivate sedentary employees to
      become more physically active. Workplace walking programs have had mixed success and
      typically show most improvement among participants that are already fairly active at a
      baseline. The goal of this study is to determine whether a financial incentive program can
      motivate sedentary employees to increase the number of steps they walk per day to meet a
      minimum threshold.

      Our primary outcome measure is the proportion of days a minimum activity of 7000 steps or
      more is achieved. We will assess outcomes each week for 3 months using incentives followed by
      3 months of follow-up without incentives. Secondary outcomes will include the average steps
      walked per day.

    <description>Participants receive either an email or text message daily (based on the participant's preference) stating whether the participant achieved the 7000 step goal during the previous day. Each day a lottery will be held, and participants will be eligible to collect monetary rewards only if the participant met the step goal the day before. The names of the winners will be announced during each lottery. The daily lotteries are as follows:
About a 1 in 4 chance of winning $5. Expected value is about $1.40 per person per day.</description>
