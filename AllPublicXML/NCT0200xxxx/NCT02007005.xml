    <textblock>
      The aim of this phase Ib/IIa study is to investigate the maximum tolerable concentration of
      abnobaVISCUM速 Fraxini for intravesical instillation in patients with superficial bladder
      cancer. Secondary objectives are the local and systemic tolerability, the influence on tumor
      remission and the influence on the one-year recurrence rate.

    <textblock>
      A dose-escalation-study according ICH/GCP (International Conference on Harmonisation/Good
      Clinical Practice) with different concentrations of abnobaVISCUM速 Fraxini is conducted in two
      hospitals in Germany and Egypt. Patients with superficial bladder cancer TaG1/G2 or T1G1/G2
      are enclosed after TUR-B (transurethral resection bladder). The tolerability of the different
      concentrations is assessed after weekly instillations into the urinary bladder for 6 weeks. A
      direct antitumoral effect is assessed on a single marker tumor left in the bladder after a
      complete TUR of all other lesions according a study design established by the
      EORTC-GENITO-URINARY GROUP (European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer). A
      re-TUR is conducted after 12 weeks. Tumor response is measured by biopsy of the marker lesion
      and by cytology. Safety of the instillations is measured by analysis of adverse events, vital
      signs and clinical laboratory tests. After treatment of a cohort is finished a safety
      evaluation is conducted to decide about the increase to the next dosage.
