    <textblock>
      This randomized phase II trial studies how well brief behavioral therapy works in improving
      sleep disorders in patients with stage I-III breast cancer undergoing chemotherapy. Sleep
      disorder counseling may reduce fatigue and insomnia as well as improve the well-being and
      quality of life in patients with breast cancer who are undergoing chemotherapy.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine recruitment rates to the proposed randomized controlled trial (RCT).

      II. Determine the rate of intervention adherence. III. Determine the feasibility of training
      National Cancer Institute (NCI) Community Oncology Research Program (NCORP) clinical research
      staff to successfully deliver the Brief Behavioral Therapy (BBT) intervention.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Obtain preliminary estimates for the effect of the intervention (compared with control) on
      insomnia as measured by the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI).

      II. Obtain preliminary estimates for the effect of the intervention (compared with control)
      on sleep quality as measured by the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI).

      III. Obtain preliminary estimates for the effect of the intervention (compared with control)
      on circadian rhythm as measured by the two-oscillator cosinor parameter estimates based on
      actigraphy data.

      IV. Obtain preliminary estimates for the effect of the intervention (compared with control)
      on heart rate variability (HRV) as measured by the Firstbeat® ambulatory heart-rate monitor
      (i.e., 1. respiratory sinus arrhythmia-RSA, 2. standard deviation of all normal R-wave to
      R-wave intervals--SDNN, 3. root mean square of successive differences between adjacent normal
      R-wave to R-wave intervals--RMSSD, 4. The ratio of low frequency total spectrum power of all
      NN intervals between .04 to .15 Hertz to high frequency total spectrum power of all NN
      intervals between .15 to .40 Hertz--LF/HF ratio, and 5. natural log of low frequency total
      spectrum power of all NN intervals between 0.04 to 0.15Hz.).

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Obtain preliminary estimates for the effect of the intervention (compared with control) on
      quality of life as measured by the Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy (FACIT)
      total score and subscales.

      II. Obtain preliminary estimates for the effect of the intervention (compared with control)
      on general mood as measured by the Profile of Mood States (POMS) total score and subscales.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.

      ARM I: Patients undergo BBT intervention, comprising insomnia education, stimulus control,
      discouragement of napping and encouragement of exercise, and sleep compression over two 60
      minute face-to-face sessions in weeks 1 and 3 or 4, and four 15 minute telephone sessions in
      weeks 2, 3, 5, and 6 or 2, 4, 5, and 6.

      ARM II: Patients undergo Healthy Eating Education (HEAL) comprising nutritional education and
      suggestions for symptom management over two 60 minute face-to-face sessions in weeks 1 and 2
      or 3, and four 15 minute telephone sessions in weeks 2, 3, 5, and 6 or 2, 4, 5, and 6.

      After completion of study, patients are followed up at 1 month.

    <measure>Percentage of Key Components of BBT Delivered by NCI Community Oncology Research Program (NCORP) Staff, Assessed by Checklist and Auditing of Audio-recordings</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 1 month</time_frame>
    <description>Each NCORP staff person completed a study checklist in which they designated which concepts they discussed with the patient at each session. Concepts included how sleep problems develped, how to control stimulus, and sleeping environment. The overall mean percent delivery was measured using a random effects model (residual maximum likelihood [REML] estimation), where the intercept represents the mean delivery and three independent random effects are included. Because of the small sample size, testing will use the Kenward-Roger procedure.</description>

    <measure>Change in Insomnia as Measured by the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to up to 1 month</time_frame>
    <description>The ISI has seven questions. The seven answers are added up to get a total score.
Total score categories:
0-7 = No clinically significant insomnia 8-14 = Subthreshold insomnia 15-21 = Clinical insomnia (moderate severity) 22-28 = Clinical insomnia (severe) The difference between arms will be assessed using analysis of covariance (ANCOVA). The response will be the post-intervention outcome. Arm will be the factor, and baseline will be the covariate. Appropriate contrasts will be used to estimate the difference between arms in change from baseline. Initially, the arm*baseline interaction will be assessed with an F test. If this interaction is insignificant at the 0.05 level, it will be dropped from the final model. If the interaction is significant, then mean change from baseline at various levels of baseline will be reported.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Sleep Quality as Measured by the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to up to 1 month</time_frame>
    <description>Each item is weighted on a 0-3 interval scale. The global PSQI score is then calculated by totaling the seven component scores, providing an overall score ranging from 0 to 21, where lower scores denote a healthier sleep quality. The difference between arms will be assessed using ANCOVA. The response will be the post-intervention outcome. Arm will be the factor, and baseline will be the covariate. Appropriate contrasts will be used to estimate the difference between arms in change from baseline. Initially, the arm*baseline interaction will be assessed with an F test. If this interaction is insignificant at the 0.05 level, it will be dropped from the final model. If the interaction is significant, then mean change from baseline at various levels of baseline will be reported.</description>

        <title>Percentage of Key Components of BBT Delivered by NCI Community Oncology Research Program (NCORP) Staff, Assessed by Checklist and Auditing of Audio-recordings</title>
        <description>Each NCORP staff person completed a study checklist in which they designated which concepts they discussed with the patient at each session. Concepts included how sleep problems develped, how to control stimulus, and sleeping environment. The overall mean percent delivery was measured using a random effects model (residual maximum likelihood [REML] estimation), where the intercept represents the mean delivery and three independent random effects are included. Because of the small sample size, testing will use the Kenward-Roger procedure.</description>

        <description>The ISI has seven questions. The seven answers are added up to get a total score.
Total score categories:
0–7 = No clinically significant insomnia 8–14 = Subthreshold insomnia 15–21 = Clinical insomnia (moderate severity) 22–28 = Clinical insomnia (severe) The difference between arms will be assessed using analysis of covariance (ANCOVA). The response will be the post-intervention outcome. Arm will be the factor, and baseline will be the covariate. Appropriate contrasts will be used to estimate the difference between arms in change from baseline. Initially, the arm*baseline interaction will be assessed with an F test. If this interaction is insignificant at the 0.05 level, it will be dropped from the final model. If the interaction is significant, then mean change from baseline at various levels of baseline will be reported.</description>
