  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Craving differs from hunger because it occurs even when a person is in a satiated state and
      in the absence of an energy deficit. Craving is usually triggered by specific foods and may
      be attributable to certain sensory properties of foods. Foods that are craved are often
      regarded as less healthy choices, and are higher in energy content. Chocolate is one of the
      most commonly reported foods craved by people in this country. Together, craving for
      chocolate has been suggested to be a possible cause of weight gain and access to chocolate
      therefore needs to be restricted.

      However, it remains unknown if restriction may induce maladaptive eating behaviors of
      chocolate cravers. The anticipation of going on a diet has been shown to cause restrained and
      disinhibited eaters to react by consuming more chocolate. In this study, we will examine if
      this response is also found in chocolate cravers when they are asked to undergo three weeks
      of chocolate restriction. This study will also examine chocolate cravers' response after the
      chocolate restriction is lifted. We hypothesize that chocolate consumption of cravers will
      increase both before and after chocolate restriction is imposed. We also hypothesize that
      chocolate craving is specific to the food rather than its sweet taste, and that chocolate
      cravers are less willing to substitute chocolate for salty snacks, natural snacks, and sweet
      non-chocolate snacks during the restriction.

    <description>A secondary objective of this study is to examine if the observed responses before and after chocolate candy restriction can be predicted by participants' personality, ingestive behavior and food craving status. Providing different snacks to the participants during the restriction period will allow us to determine if craving is specific to specific foods, in the case of this study, chocolate. Cravings will be measured three times per week for six weeks.</description>

    <description>Individuals recieve a different snack for every week of the study. This is viewed as 4 phases. Phase 1 measures of habitual chocolate candy consumption (1 week), Phase 2 assesses participants' chocolate consumption while anticipating an oncoming chocolate candy restriction (1 week), Phase 3 is the total chocolate candy restriction period, but participants will be given 3 non-chocolate-candy snack substitutes in a random order (1 week per snack type, 3 weeks total), and Phase 4 examines participants' chocolate candy consumption when the 3-week restriction is lifted (1 week).</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

        Sixty adult participants (age 18-60 years) who are regular chocolate candy eaters (&gt; 4

          -  BMI between 18-35

          -  American born, or have lived in United States for majority of life, as different
             cultures have been shown to have lower chocolate preferences and consumption.

          -  Snack on a regular basis

          -  No allergies to test foods

          -  Not taking medications that affect appetite or metabolism

          -  Consume chocolate, or chocolate candies more than 4 times per week

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  If a participant does not fit the above requirements, they will be excluded from
