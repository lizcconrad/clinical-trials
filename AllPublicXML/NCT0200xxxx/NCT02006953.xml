  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the best way to feed children after they have a
      gastrostomy tube placed. The study compares bolus feeding to continuous feeding.

      This study will consist of a prospective, randomized comparison of bolus versus continuous
      enteral feeding protocols in pediatric patients with gastrostomy tubes

    <description>Bolus: Total volume of feedings is determined by the amount of formula required to meet calorie and protein needs, which is determined by a Registered Dietitian. Volume of each bolus is determined by dividing the total volume of feeding by the desired number of feedings per day:
If child is less than 6 months: 8 feeds/day If child is 6-12 months 6 feeds/day If child is 12 months or greater: 5 feedings/day Rate of feeds is determine by the rate needed to infuse each bolus over 1 hour. Patient to remain NPO. Once at goal, if able to take PO, may offer orally first with remainder of goal volume over the remainder of the hour.</description>

Rate of feeds is determined by dividing total volume of feedings by 24 hours. Patient is to remain NPO. Once at goal, if able to take PO, may offer hourly amount orally, but only 2x per day.</description>
