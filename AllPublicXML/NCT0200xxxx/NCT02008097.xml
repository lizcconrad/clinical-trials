  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goals of this study are to evaluate the efficacy of the B-flow capability on the LOGIQ E9
      system in three clinical focus areas.

        1. Liver transplant patients: Improved real-time visualization of liver vessels is needed
           to improve diagnosis and assessment following stenting or angioplasty.

        2. Renal artery disease: Improved real-time visualization of the renal arteries would
           enable a more rapid and accurate assessment of renal artery disease (stenosis,
           dissection, occlusion, aneurysm) and facilitate follow-up evaluations after renal artery
           interventions.

        3. Pregnancy: We are proposing to use B-flow ultrasound as a way to evaluate placenta
           perfusion and assay for potential ischemia.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Correlating blood flow findings using B-flow imaging with standard clinical ultrasound.</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1. Participants will have B-flow US performed the same day as their clinical US and measures will be assessed at the time of the B-flow US.</time_frame>
    <description>The new &quot;B-Flow&quot; method combines the color-flow image and the B-mode image to show the tissue and blood flow at the same time. This makes it easier to see the blood flow and smaller blood vessels in real time. Findings from the B-Flow method will be correlated with the standard clinical ultrasound to validate the efficacy of B-Flow for detection and classification of stenosis and other abnormalities in blood vessels.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Correlating blood flow findings on B-flow imaging in pregnant women with pathology findings in the placenta.</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 6 months. Pregnant women who have B-flow US will be followed until delivery (up to 6 months from B-flow US) and pathology data on the placenta will be collected if a histopathology assessment is done.</time_frame>
    <description>Findings from the B-Flow method will be correlated with the standard clinical ultrasound to validate the efficacy of B-Flow for detection and classification of stenosis and other abnormalities in blood vessels. B-Flow findings will also be correlated with histopathologic diagnosis in the placenta after delivery.</description>
