      Antiangiogenics are the mainstay of treatment in patients with metastatic renal cell
      carcinoma. Conventional clinical end-points, used to measure efficacy with chemotherapeutic
      agents, have not been helpful in monitoring the efficacy of antiangiogenic therapy.
      Increasing numbers of predictive and pharmacodynamic biomarkers are being investigated that
      are useful surrogates for clinical response and also to identify patients early on who will
      benefit from this class of agents. This is valuable in avoiding unnecessary toxicity in
      patients and also in reducing cost implications of this expensive group of drugs.

      The investigators wish to explore the variability of baseline metabolomic profile in the
      blood and urine of patients with mRCC and characterise the inter-subject and intra-subject
      variability. The study of the baseline levels has not been performed in this cohort
      previously. This is extremely important in interpreting the emerging data of changes in the
      levels of the various biomarkers from various trials. This will in turn help in the
      development of future targeted therapies, especially Phase I/II studies where an early
      demonstration of target modulation is vital. This study will also help to identify the number
      of patients required for appropriate statistical evaluation in pharmacodynamic studies to
      assess biological activity, optimisation of dosing, and investigation of potential mechanisms
      of resistance. Study of the urinary and blood metabolomic profile in conjunction will give us
      an insight into the potential use of urine as a diagnostic and prognostic tool.

      OBJECTIVES GOAL The main objective of the study is to determine the change from baseline in
      metabolomic profiling in patients with clear cell renal cell carcinoma 1 month after
      nephrectomy or antiangiogenic treatment during 2 months

      METHODOLOGY STUDY DESIGN. Observational, Prospective, Exploratory, Single centre.

      STUDY POPULATION Common Inclusion criteria Patients must be older than 18 years in age.
      Written Informed Consent obtained. Patients previously informed about the objectives.

      Patients with histologically confirmed renal clear cell carcinoma. Patients before surgery
      with confirmed renal cell carcinoma or suspected. RCC must be confirmed after surgery.

      Exclusion criteria Presence of a separate malignant diagnosis, in the last two years, except
      non-melanoma skin cancer or cervical carcinoma in situ.

      Prior anti-cancer treatment for RCC other than nephrectomy

      ENDPOINTS Primary endpoint Determination the changes from baseline in metabolomic profiling
      Secondary outcomes Time to progression Progression free survival (PFS) /Overall survival (OS)
      Determination of metabolomic levels during the monitoring period Radiologically measured
      tumour response (according to investigator assessment) Toxicities

      Outcome Measures Primary The primary outcome measures are the changes from baseline in
      metabolomic profiling 1 month after nephrectomy or after antiangiogenic treatment during 2
      months Cohort 1. The primary clinical outcome measure is progression-free survival (PFS), the
      interval from first line therapy to first evidence of progression disease or death from RCC.

      Cohort 2. The primary clinical outcome measure is to find differences in metabolomic profiles
      between samples before and after nephrectomy.

      Secondary The main objective of the study is to determine the metabolomic basal levels in
      patients with renal cell carcinoma clear cell and try to find out a prognostic profile
      Metabolomic profile changes during the follow up. Tumour progression and PFS, i.e. the time
      from surgery/first line treatment to progression RCC specific survival time, i.e. the time
      from first line treatment to death from RCC Overall survival, i.e. the time from first line
      treatment to death from any cause, including RCC Best response Toxicity and association with
      metabolomic profile evaluation. Metabolomic characteristics of resected primary RCC. Tumour
      samples will be examined for a relevant metabolomic profile, and their association with
      outcome will be studied.

      Definitions PFS is defined as the time between the first day of treatment with any drug
      (sunitinib, pazopanib, etc.) and the date of radiological progressive disease (PD), clear
      clinical evidence of PD, or death. Patients who had not progressed at database closure will
      be censored at final follow-up. If the date of PD is unknown, the investigators will censor
      PFS at the last tumour assessment.

      Overall survival is defined as the time between the first day of &quot;drug&quot; treatment and the
      date of death or last date of follow-up.

      Objective response will be assessed by treating doctors, according to Response Evaluation
      Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) criteria version 1.1, and classified as complete response,
      partial response, stable disease, or PD. Timing for assessments will be dictated by
      individual institution policy.

      All adverse effects will be graded by the attending doctors according to Common Terminology
      Criteria for Adverse Events version 4•0. The investigators have initially selected mucositis,
      hypothyroidism, hand-foot syndrome, hypertension, anaemia, and thrombocytopenia for analysis
      on the basis of clinical relevance and grading objectiveness, together with grade 3-4 adverse
      events. The investigators will also record adverse toxic events leading to dose reductions
      and the date on which they occurred.

      The investigators will test metabolomic profile against PFS and overall survival with
      Cox-regression analysis and against RECIST response with logistic regression analysis. The
      investigators shall perform a multivariable analysis by including clinical factors associated
      with PFS, overall survival, or response as covariates (clinical factors that will be
      associated with p&lt;0•1 with a specific variable will be used as covariates for that specific
      variable).

      The investigators will allocate patients to favourable, intermediate, and poor prognosis
      groups according to the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC) prognostic
      classification, and included this variable in the multivariable analysis. The investigators
      will further analyse metabolomic profile associated with PFS and overall survival in the
      multivariable analysis by the Kaplan-Meier method.

      The investigators will assess metabolomic levels/profile associated with an increased risk of
      drug dose reduction caused by toxicity with Cox-regression modelling of the number of days of
      drug treatment until the reduction of dose. Patients with no dose reductions will be censored
      at final follow-up. For multivariable analysis, the investigators will use clinical factors
      associated with p&lt;0•1 with dose reductions as covariates, and the investigators will analyse
      the metabolomic levels associated to drug dose reduction in the multivariable analysis with
      the Kaplan-Meier method. The investigators will study associations between specific drug
      toxicities and metabolomic profiles with logistic regression analysis, with toxicity
      development as a dichotomous endpoint. The multivariable logistic regression analyses will
      include clinical factors associated with the corresponding outcome as covariates (factors
      with p&lt;0•1). The investigators will test all genotypes with an additive genetic model. The
      investigators will retain missing data as missing apart from MSKCC prognostic factors. The
      most likely value, based on the data from the rest of the series, will be assigned to these
      patients.

      There will be a general descriptive variables included in the study. Distributions will be
      presented absolute and relative frequencies of qualitative variables, and measures of central
      tendency and dispersion (mean standard deviation, median, minimum and maximum) for
      quantitative variables. They will be presented with the confidence intervals at 95% for the
      major outcome. No missing data imputed and left as missing.

      The hypothesis test to be performed will be bilateral with a significance level of 0.05. For
      variables that do not conform to the normal distribution (or parametric) will be used for
      non-parametric tests in the analysis of contingency tables and for comparison of proportions
      and / or frequency distributions, will be used the chi -square (or Fisher's exact where
      appropriate).

      Statistical analysis of the data from the study will be conducted by Hutchison/MRC (Medical
      Research Council) Research Center. Specific aspects of the statistical analysis

      Analysis goal:

      Cohort 1: &quot;To determine the baseline metabolomic profiles in urine/blood in patients with
      renal cell carcinoma clear in order to find a prognostic/predictive model&quot; Appropriate
      regression models as well as univariate and multivariate statistical tests will be used.

      Cohort 2: &quot;To determine the changes of metabolomic profiles before and 1 month after
      nephrectomy&quot; Univariate and multivariate statistical tests for paired setting will be applied
      to reveal the changes.
