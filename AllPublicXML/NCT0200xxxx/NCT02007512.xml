    <time_frame>From randomization until PD, last tumor assessment without PD before new antitumor treatment initiation or death due to any cause, whichever occurred first (up to 3 years)</time_frame>
    <description>PFS was defined as the time in months from randomization to the first documentation of progression of disease (PD) or death on study due to any cause, whichever occurred first. PD according to response evaluation criteria in solid tumors version 1.1 (RECIST 1.1) was defined as greater than or equal to (&gt;=) 20 percent (%) increase in the sum of diameters of the target lesions taking as a reference the smallest sum recorded since the start of treatment or unequivocal progression in non-target lesions or the appearance of 1 or more new lesions. The analysis of PFS was based on investigator assessment of disease progression. Participants who were not known to have had a PFS event at the analysis date were censored at last tumor assessment date prior to data cutoff or date of new treatment initiation, whichever occurred first.</description>

          <title>Cohort 1: Enzalutamide 160 mg + Exemestane 50 mg</title>
          <description>Participants with no previous hormonal treatment for advanced breast cancer, received enzalutamide 160 mg along with exemestane 50 mg, orally, once daily until disease progression or permanent treatment discontinuation.

Eligible participants with disease progression in double blind period, on their discretion, received enzalutamide 160 mg along with exemestane 50 mg, orally, once daily up to disease progression in open label treatment period.

        <title>Progression Free Survival (PFS): Intent-to-Treat (ITT) Population</title>
        <description>PFS was defined as the time in months from randomization to the first documentation of progression of disease (PD) or death on study due to any cause, whichever occurred first. PD according to response evaluation criteria in solid tumors version 1.1 (RECIST 1.1) was defined as greater than or equal to (&gt;=) 20 percent (%) increase in the sum of diameters of the target lesions taking as a reference the smallest sum recorded since the start of treatment or unequivocal progression in non-target lesions or the appearance of 1 or more new lesions. The analysis of PFS was based on investigator assessment of disease progression. Participants who were not known to have had a PFS event at the analysis date were censored at last tumor assessment date prior to data cutoff or date of new treatment initiation, whichever occurred first.</description>
        <time_frame>From randomization until PD, last tumor assessment without PD before new antitumor treatment initiation or death due to any cause, whichever occurred first (up to 3 years)</time_frame>
