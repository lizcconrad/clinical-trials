    <textblock>
      Multi-center, prospective, randomized, controlled study to verify the clinical effectiveness
      of K / DOQI guidelines. The efficiency and safety of Vitamin D2 and low protein diet
      treatment for prevention and treatment of CKD-MBD and malnutrition in CKD3-5 (ND) patients.

    <textblock>
      This study will enroll chronic kidney disease patients, stage 3 to 5ND, who have chronic
      kidney disease mineral and bone disease (CKD-MBD) and malnutrition as defined by Kidney
      Disease Improvement Global Outcome (KDIGO) Guidelines. Patients in five centers will be
      randomized. A total of 600 patients will be enrolled, 150 patients receiving Vitamin D2
      treatment virus 150 patients receiving calcitriol treatment, and another 150 patients
      receiving low protein diet virus 150 patients receiving normal protein diet. Outcomes will be
      assessed as proportion of patients achieving target blood levels on calcium, phosphorus,
      parathyroid hormone, 25 hydroxyvitamin D, albumin and hemoglobin. Other outcomes will also be
      assessed, which include secondary hyperparathyroidism (sHPT), vascular calcification,
      cardiovascular diseases, nutritional status and quality of life.
