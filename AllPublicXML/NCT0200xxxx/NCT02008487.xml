    <textblock>
      This study will test a special powder for ulcers caused by a variety of conditions such as
      pressure that sometimes happen when a person is at the end of life. The powder will be
      applied to these ulcers to see if it helps with pain, odor and drainage (leakage). People who
      are being cared for by hospice or palliative care organizations will be invited to be in the
      study. The study will also find out if the powder is easy to use by caregivers as well as
      improving the comfort and quality of life of the person who has the ulcer.

      Aim 1. In a comparative 2-group design, we will evaluate and compare the feasibility of the
      intervention through assessment in both settings (home-based and inpatient) on:

        1. Adherence to RGN107 protocol by licensed care providers and/or family or other
           caregivers providing wound care; measures include implementation of procedures,
           frequency of dressing changes.

        2. Reach, enrollment, disenrollment, acceptability, satisfaction; measures include
           difficulties with recruitment and enrollment, side effects such as burning, peri-wound
           skin irritation.

        3. Usability issues such as powder ability to stick to wound and ease of use of applying
           powder.

      Aim 2. Estimate variability of outcome measurements and effect sizes and investigate the
      presence of a preliminary &quot;signal&quot; of clinical efficacy in two groups of hospice/home
      health/residential individuals receiving RGN107 in:

        1. Physical wound symptoms outcomes, specifically pain, odor and exudate.

        2. Quality of life of individuals receiving and caregivers using RGN107.

    <description>In both hospice settings, a registered nurse establishes the wound protocol per principles of wound care and agency guidelines. The cover dressing will be removed and the wound cleansed according to agency protocol (usual care) or as needed. The RGN107 powder, contained in a small squirt bottle, will be squeezed/sprinkled on the wound at each dressing change after cleansing or until a crust is formed. Once formed, the powder will be applied only minimally to reinforce crust integrity. The peri-wound skin will receive care and the cover dressing will be applied. Minimal manipulation of the crusted area will ensue once it has formed. Frequency of dressing changes depends on wound characteristics such as exudate.</description>
