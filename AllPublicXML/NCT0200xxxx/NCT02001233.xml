      The purpose of this follow-up study is to evaluate the two-year efficacy, immunogenicity and
      safety of EV71 Vaccines in preventing Hand, Foot and Mouth disease caused by EV71 in a total
      10,000 healthy infants volunteers aged from 6 to 35months old.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The phase III, efficacy trial of inactivated vaccine (vero cell) against EV71 has completed
      on March 2013 in China. The data from the phase III study suggested that the inactivated EV71
      vaccine had protection effects on healthy Chinese infants against Hand, Foot and Mouth
      disease caused by EV71 within one-year surveillance period, and had clinically acceptable
      safety and good one-year immune persistence.

      This study is the phase III, open-labelled, follow-up research, in order to evaluate the
      two-year efficacy, safety and immune persistence.

      Serum samples will be taken from 1200 subjects in the immunogenicity subgroup 26 months after
      the first vaccination.

      Throat and anal swab samples will be taken from the cases with Hand, Foot and mouth disease
      for the detection of PCR assays and the isolation of EV71.
