  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective is to evaluate the rate of complete remission/complete remission with
      partial hematological recovery (CRh*) in adults with relapsed/refractory Philadelphia
      chromosome positive (Ph+) B-precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) who receive
      blinatumomab.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-arm Simon II stage design, multicenter study consisting of a screening
      period, an induction treatment period (2 cycles of blinatumomab), a consolidation treatment
      period (up to 3 additional cycles of blinatumomab for applicable participants), and a safety
      follow-up visit 30 days after treatment. Following the safety follow-up visit, participants
      will be followed for response duration and survival every 3 months for 18 months or death,
      whichever occurs first.

    <measure>Percentage of Participants With Complete Remission/Complete Remission With Partial Hematological Recovery (CR/CRh*) During the First Two Treatment Cycles</measure>
    <time_frame>Approximately 12 weeks, as of the data cut-off date of 20 May 2015</time_frame>
    <description>Participants were evaluated for efficacy at the end of each treatment cycle via a central bone marrow aspiration and local peripheral blood counts.
Complete remission was defined as meeting all 3 of the following criteria:
less than or equal to 5% blasts in the bone marrow;
no evidence of disease
full recovery of peripheral blood counts: platelets &gt; 100,000/μl, and absolute neutrophil count (ANC) &gt; 1000/μl.
Complete remission with partial hematological recovery (CRh*) was defined as meeting all 3 of the following criteria:
less than or equal to 5% blasts in the bone marrow
no evidence of disease
partial recovery of peripheral blood counts: platelets &gt; 50,000/μl, and ANC &gt; 500/μl.
Participants without a post-baseline disease assessment were considered non-responders.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of Participants With Minimal Residual Disease (MRD) Remission During the First 2 Cycles of Treatment</measure>
    <time_frame>Approximately 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Bone marrow samples were evaluated for MRD remission by a central laboratory using bcr-abl fusion gene reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR).
An MRD response was defined as MRD &lt; 10^-4 measured by PCR. Participants with no post-baseline MRD assessment were considered non-responders.</description>

    <measure>Duration of CR or CRh* Response</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to the data cut-off date of 20 May 2015; median observation time was 7.0 months</time_frame>
    <description>Duration of response was measured for participants in remission (CR/CRh*), and was measured from the time the participant first achieved remission until first documented relapse or death from disease progression. Participants without a documented relapse (hematological or extramedullary) and who did not die were censored at the time of the last bone marrow assessment or the last survival follow-up visit to confirm remission. Participants who died without having reported hematological relapse or without showing any clinical sign of disease progression were censored on their date of death.</description>

    <time_frame>From the date of allogeneic HSCT until the data cut-off date of 20 May 2015; median observation time was 3.2 months.</time_frame>
    <description>The analysis of 100-day mortality after allogeneic HSCT was assessed for participants who received an allogeneic HSCT while in remission (CR/CRh*) after 2 cycles of blinatumomab treatment and did not receive any additional antileukemic treatment. 100-day mortality after allogeneic HSCT was calculated relative to the date of allogeneic HSCT.
The 100-day mortality rate after allogeneic HSCT was defined as the percentage of participants having died up to 100 days after allogeneic HSCT estimated using the estimated time to death in percent calculated by Kaplan-Meier methods. Participants alive were censored on the last documented visit date or the date of the last phone contact when the patient was last known to have been alive.</description>

    <measure>Number of Participants With Adverse Events</measure>
    <time_frame>From the first dose of blinatumomab until 30 days after the last dose, up to the cut-off date of 20 May 2015; the median duration of treatment was 53.8 days.</time_frame>
    <description>Adverse events (AEs) were graded for severity according to the CTCAE version 4.0, where Grade 1: Mild; asymptomatic or mild symptoms; clinical or diagnostic observations only; intervention not indicated.
Grade 2: Moderate; minimal, local or noninvasive intervention indicated; limiting age-appropriate instrumental activities of daily living.
Grade 3: Severe or medically significant but not immediately life-threatening; hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization indicated; disabling; limiting self care activities of daily living.
Grade 4: Life-threatening consequences; urgent intervention indicated. Grade 5: Death related to AE. Treatment-related adverse events (TRAEs) were those assessed by the investigator as possibly related to blinatumomab based on response to the question: Is there a reasonable possibility that the event may have been caused by blinatumomab or other protocol-specified therapies/procedures?</description>

          <description>Participants received blinatumomab by continuous intravenous (CIV) infusion over 4 weeks followed by a treatment-free interval of 2 weeks for 2 cycles. Participants who achieved a complete remission or complete remission with partial or incomplete hematologic recovery within 2 induction cycles of treatment could receive up to 3 additional consolidation cycles of blinatumomab.
The initial dose was 9 μg/day for the first 7 days of treatment, increased to 28 μg/day starting on day 8 and for all subsequent cycles of treatment.</description>

        <description>Participants were evaluated for efficacy at the end of each treatment cycle via a central bone marrow aspiration and local peripheral blood counts.
Complete remission was defined as meeting all 3 of the following criteria:
less than or equal to 5% blasts in the bone marrow;
no evidence of disease
full recovery of peripheral blood counts: platelets &gt; 100,000/μl, and absolute neutrophil count (ANC) &gt; 1000/μl.
Complete remission with partial hematological recovery (CRh*) was defined as meeting all 3 of the following criteria:
less than or equal to 5% blasts in the bone marrow
no evidence of disease
partial recovery of peripheral blood counts: platelets &gt; 50,000/μl, and ANC &gt; 500/μl.
Participants without a post-baseline disease assessment were considered non-responders.</description>

The 100-day mortality rate after allogeneic HSCT was defined as the percentage of participants having died up to 100 days after allogeneic HSCT estimated using the estimated time to death in percent calculated by Kaplan-Meier methods. Participants alive were censored on the last documented visit date or the date of the last phone contact when the patient was last known to have been alive.</description>

      <pi_employee>Principal Investigators are NOT employed by the organization sponsoring the study.</pi_employee>
      <restrictive_agreement>The Clinical Trial Agreement generally does not restrict an investigator's discussion of trial results after completion. The Agreement permits Amgen a limited period of time to review material discussing trial results (typically up to 45 days and possible extension). Amgen may remove confidential information, but authors have final control and approval of publication content. For multicenter studies, the investigator agrees not to publish any results before the first multi-center publication.</restrictive_agreement>
