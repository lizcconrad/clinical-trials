  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Colonoscopy has been shown to reduce both the colo-rectal cancer incidence and mortality, due
      to its capability to detect and remove precancerous lesions. However, polypectomy is
      associated with complications, such as bleeding and perforation, with an estimated overall
      incidence of about 10%, with polyp size and right-sided location considered as major risk
      factors. Aim of present study was to prospectively evaluate the early and delayed (30-days
      follow-up) complications of polypectomy in a multicenter regional Italian real practice
      setting
