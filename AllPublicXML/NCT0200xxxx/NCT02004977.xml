      The goals of this intervention study are to implement best practice strategies to expand and
      promote the school breakfast program and test the impact upon student participation rates
      among a) all 10th and 11th grade students and among a randomly selected cohort of 800
      students b) total diet and body mass index and percent body fat inin 16 rural Minnesota
      school districts.

      School-wide Primary Aim: Improve participation in the school breakfast program among high
      school students. Hypothesis: School-wide school breakfast program participation will be
      higher in the intervention versus comparison group.

      We will accomplish the following secondary aims using a random subsample of 800 incoming 10th
      and11th grade students.

      Student-level Secondary Aims Secondary Aim 1: High school students in the intervention
      condition will decrease their rate of weight gain relative to height gain as measured by
      change in body mass index and percent body fat compared to students in the control condition.
      Hypothesis: Body mass index and percent body fat will be maintained or reduced in the
      treatment versus control group.

      Secondary Aim 2: High school students in the intervention condition will maintain or decrease
      their energy intake while improving dietary intakes of low fat dairy, whole grains and fresh
      fruits compared to the control students.

      Hypothesis: Energy intake (measured by 3, 24-hour recalls) will be maintained or reduced and
      intakes of low fat dairy, whole grains and fresh fruits will increase more in the
      intervention groups.

      Secondary Aim 3: Compared to students in the control condition, high school students in the
      intervention condition will report receiving more support to eat school breakfast. Support
      will be social (increased peer and school support) or related to the school environment
      (satisfaction with serving locations and times, eating locations, foods and increased
      availability of low fat dairy, fruits and whole grains for breakfast).

      Hypothesis: The treatment group will report receiving more social and school environment
      support for eating school breakfast than the comparison group (measured by a student survey).

    <description>Change in the total Healthy Eating Index score from baseline to SY2. The Healthy Eating Index (HEI) score is a measure of diet quality. HEI scores can range from 0 to 100, with 0 representing the least overall healthy diet, and 100 representing the most overall healthy diet</description>

    <measure>Social Support</measure>
    <time_frame>Change in perceived support from baseline at the end of the school year (SY2)</time_frame>
    <description>Change in social support from baseline to SY2. Assessment of social support for breakfast was measured by asking the students to consider a typical month and record how often the following people encouraged them to eat or continue to eat breakfast at school: (1) parent/guardian, (2) friend, (3) other kids at my school, (4) teacher, and (5) other school staff. A 4-point Likert-type scale (disagree to agree, 0-4) for each of the categories was used. The total scale summed the five categories. The scale ranged from 0-20, a higher score indicates more social support.</description>

Assessment of social support for breakfast was measured by asking the students to consider a typical month and record how often the following people encouraged them to eat or continue to eat breakfast at school: (1) parent/guardian, (2) friend, (3) other kids at my school, (4) teacher, and (5) other school staff. A 4-point Likert-type scale (disagree to agree, 0-4) for each of the categories was used. The total scale summed the five categories. The scale ranged from 0-20, a higher score indicates more social support.</description>
