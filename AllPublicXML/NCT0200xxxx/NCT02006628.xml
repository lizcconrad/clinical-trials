    <textblock>
      A study to compare the change in symptom severity in patients with schizophrenia or related
      psychotic disorder when treated with GWP42003 or placebo, added to existing anti-psychotic
      therapy over a period of six weeks. Secondary objectives are to evaluate the effect of
      GWP42003 on quality of life and cognition and to assess the safety and tolerability of
      GWP42003.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This eight-week (six week treatment period and two week follow-up), multi-centre,
      double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled, parallel group study aims to determine the
      efficacy, safety and tolerability of GWP42003 in patients with schizophrenia or a related
      psychotic disorder.

      and begin treatment at Visit 1 as instructed.

      A second (Visit 2, Day 8) and third (Visit 3, Day 22) visit will take place mid-treatment,
      where the following assessments will be performed:

    <description>The PANSS is a medical scale completed by a trained rater at site and is used for measuring symptom severity of patients with schizophrenia or related psychotic disorder. It is a 30 item rating instrument that assesses the positive and negative symptoms of schizophrenia as well as symptoms of general psychopathology. A PANSS total score is derived from the sum of the 30 items and the PANSS items are also grouped into three subscales: Positive ('P'), Negative ('N'), and General ('G'). Individual items are rated on a seven point scale, where 1 = absent and 7 = extreme. A decrease in total score indicates an improvement in condition.</description>

    <time_frame>0-43 days</time_frame>
    <description>SANS assesses five symptom complexes to obtain clinical ratings of negative symptoms in patients with schizophrenia or related psychotic disorder. They are: affective blunting; alogia (impoverished thinking); avolition/apathy; anhedonia/asociality; and disturbance of attention. Assessments are conducted on a six-point scale (0 = not at all to 5 = severe). A decrease in score indicates an improvement in condition.</description>

    <measure>Change in the severity of mental illness at the end of treatment relative to baseline using the Clinical Global Impressions - Severity Scale (CGI-S).</measure>
    <time_frame>0-43 days</time_frame>
    <description>The CGI-S is a seven point scale that requires the clinician to rate the severity of the patient's illness at the time of assessment, relative to the clinician's past experience with patients who have the same diagnosis. Considering total clinical experience, a patient will be assessed on severity of mental illness at the time of rating. The markers are:
Not at all ill, Borderline mentally ill, Mildly ill, Moderately ill, Markedly ill, Severely ill, Extremely ill.
The number of patients for each of the markers at the final study visit is presented.</description>

    <measure>Improvement in mental illness at the end of treatment relative to baseline using the Clinical Global Impressions - Improvement Scale (CGI-I).</measure>
    <time_frame>0-43 days</time_frame>
    <description>The CGI-I is a seven point scale that requires the clinician to assess how much the patient's illness has improved or worsened relative to a baseline state at the beginning of the intervention. The markers are:
Very much improved, Much improved, Minimally improved, No change, Minimally worse, Much worse, Very much worse.
The number of patients for each of the markers at the final study visit is presented.</description>

    <measure>Change from baseline to the end of treatment in Global Assessment of Functioning (GAF) score.</measure>
    <time_frame>0-43 days</time_frame>
    <description>The GAF is a numeric scale (0 through 100) used by mental health clinicians and physicians alike to subjectively rate the social, occupational, and psychological functioning of adults. The patient will be assigned a code related to the group that best describes the patient's functioning. Patients assigned the code 91-100 are deemed to have:
&quot;Superior functioning in a wide range of activities, life's problems never seem to get out of hand, is sought out by others because of his or her many positive qualities. No symptoms.&quot;
Patients assigned the code 1-10 are deemed in:
&quot;Persistent danger of severely hurting self or others (e.g., recurrent violence) OR persistent inability to maintain minimal personal hygiene OR serious suicidal act with clear expectation of death.&quot;
A decrease in score indicates an improvement in condition.</description>

    <measure>Change from baseline to the end of treatment in Simpson-Angus Scale (SAS) total score.</measure>
    <time_frame>0-43 days</time_frame>
    <description>The SAS is a 10-item instrument used to evaluate the presence and severity of Parkinsonian symptomatology. The ten items focus on rigidity rather than bradykinesia, and do not assess subjective rigidity or slowness. Items are rated for severity on a 0-4 scale, where 0 is indicative of 'normal' and 4 being the most severe. Definitions are given for each anchor point within each item and a total score is obtained by summing over the 10 items. The 10 items that are scored are: Gait; Arm Dropping; Shoulder Shaking; Elbow Rigidity; Wrist Rigidity or Fixation of Position; Leg Pendulousness; Head Dropping; Glabella Tap; Tremor and Salivation. A decrease in score indicates an improvement in condition.</description>

    <measure>Change from baseline to the end of treatment in Brief Assessment of Cognition in Schizophrenia (BACS) average score.</measure>
    <time_frame>0-43 days</time_frame>
    <description>The BACS is an instrument used to assess the aspects of cognition found to be most impaired and most strongly correlated with outcome in patients with schizophrenia or related psychotic disorder. The BACS consists of six domains: verbal memory; working memory; motor speed; verbal fluency; attention and speed information processing and executive functions. A score is obtained for each domain and a composite summary score is also calculated as the average of the scores from the six domains. An increase in score indicates an improvement in cognition.</description>

&quot;How has the participant's general functional ability changed since Visit 1?&quot;
&quot;How has the participant's quantity of sleep changed since Visit 1?&quot;
&quot;How has the participant's quality of sleep changed since Visit 1?&quot;
