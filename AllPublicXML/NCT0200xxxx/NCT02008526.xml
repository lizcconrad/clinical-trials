  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Participants receive culturally relevant and specifically tailored text messages based on the
      behavioral change theoretical constructs of Social Support Theory, Health Belief Model, and
      Social Cognitive Theory. Participants are randomized into one of three conditions for an
      8-week intervention period: Group 1: culturally relevant theory-based text messages
      interactively transmitted by peer health educators (TXT-PHE); or, Group 2: the same
      culturally relevant theory-based text messages transmitted by automation (TXT-Auto); or,
      Group 3: assessment-only (AO) control with no theoretically based text messages.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The randomized three-group design uses repeated assessments at baseline, at the end of the
      8-week intervention period, and at 3-, 6-, and 9-month post randomization follow-up.
      Participants in all three conditions receive brief weekly text-message assessments on their
      methamphetamine use and HIV sexual behaviors in the previous seven days. This study will
      determine the differential immediate and sustained effects of transmitting theory-based text
      messages by PHE (TXT-PHE) versus by automation (TXT-Auto), compared to an assessment-only
      (AO) control condition among out-of-treatment, methamphetamine-using MSM for reductions of
      methamphetamine use and HIV sexual risk behaviors. It is hypothesized that there will be
      significantly greater reductions in methamphetamine use and HIV sexual risk behaviors from
      text messages transmitted by PHE than by text messages transmitted by automation, which in
      turn will produce significantly greater reductions than the AO condition (PHE &gt; TXT &gt; AO). In
      addition, this study will determine the cost-effectiveness of TXT-PHE vs. TXT-Auto compared
      to AO for reducing methamphetamine use and HIV sexual risk behaviors. The investigators
      hypothesize that the TXT-PHE intervention will prove more cost-effective than TXT-Auto in
      reducing methamphetamine use and HIV sexual risk behaviors, while the TXT-Auto condition will
      prove more cost effective than the AO condition in reducing these same outcomes (PHE &gt; TXT &gt;
      AO).

This condition is interactive and tailored to the needs of the individual participant. PHEs initiate (i.e., &quot;push&quot;) text messages to participants and also respond to participant-initiated queries and participant responses to the PHE messages (i.e., &quot;pull&quot;).
Participants receive five pre-written messages per day sent on a predetermined schedule. Participants who respond to the pre-written text messages or initiate queries or requests for support (&quot;pull&quot;) are sent additional real-time messages back from the PHE.
During the 8-week intervention, participants receive a brief weekly text-based assessment on their methamphetamine use and HIV sexual behaviors in the previous seven days.</description>

Interactive and tailored to the needs of the individual participant. PHEs initiate text messages to participants and also respond to participant-initiated queries and participant responses to the PHE messages.
Participants receive five pre-written messages per day. Participants who respond to the pre-written text messages or initiate queries or requests for support are sent additional messages back.
During the 8-week intervention, participants receive a brief weekly text-based assessment on their methamphetamine use and HIV sexual behaviors in the previous seven days.
Text Messages Transmitted by Peer Health Educators (TXT-PHE): Text messages are transmitted and responded to in real time, at the peak hours of high-risk activities. Participants receive a brief weekly text-based assessment on their methamphetamine use and HIV sexual behaviors in the previous seven days.</description>
