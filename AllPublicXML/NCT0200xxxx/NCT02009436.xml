    <textblock>
      This pilot phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of azacitidine in treating
      patients with lung cancer that is stage IV or has returned after previous treatments
      (recurrent). Azacitidine is a drug used in chemotherapy that may stop tumor cells from
      growing or spreading by activating genes that help prevent cancer growth, called tumor
      suppressor genes. As people age, these genes are silenced by a chemical reaction that occurs
      naturally in the body, or by exposure to environmental factors such as smoking. Azacitidine
      may help reverse this process and restore the function of the tumor suppressor genes.
      Delivering azacitidine directly into the lungs by inhalation may work better in treating lung
      cancer.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the tolerability and toxicity of inhaled Vidaza® (azacitidine) with special
      emphasis on pulmonary toxicity.

      II. To determine the minimum effective dose of inhaled Vidaza® required to induce the
      re-expression of relevant 5 candidate tumor suppressor genes (cyclin-dependent kinase
      inhibitor 2A [p16], h-cadherin [H-Cad], opioid binding protein/cell adhesion molecule-like
      [OPCML], secreted frizzled-related protein 1 [SFRP-1], and ras association domain family 1
      [RASSF1A]) that are silenced in 20-50% of bronchial tissue of heavy smokers with lung cancer.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the pharmacokinetics of inhaled Vidaza®. II. To determine the changes in
      global methylation patterns in the bronchial epithelium (bronchial tissue samples) pre and
      post treatment.

      III. To determine the changes in methylation patterns in the exhaled breath. IV. To evaluate
      the efficacy of inhaled Vidaza® on intra-thoracic tumors (response rate by Response
      Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors [RECIST] criteria for intrapulmonary lesions).

      V. To estimate the progression free, intra-thoracic tumor progression free and overall
      survival.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study.

      Patients receive azacitidine via nebulizer over 20 minutes once daily (QD) on days 1-5 and
      15-19. Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 24 weeks in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients may continue treatment on a case-by-case basis
      at the discretion of principal investigator and Institutional Review Board.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 4-6 weeks and then every 3
      months thereafter.
