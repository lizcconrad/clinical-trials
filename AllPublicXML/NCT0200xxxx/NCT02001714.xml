  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This three-site randomized controlled trial compares the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness
      of a group-administered behavioral treatment program to no treatment. Women with stress,
      urgency, or mixed urinary incontinence will be recruited and screened centrally, evaluated
      clinically at each of three study sites, and random assigned to one of two treatment arms: 1.
      Group behavioral treatment or 2. No treatment. Group treatment modalities have the potential
      to reach a larger population of older women with urinary incontinence, not only in the
      traditional medical settings, but also in community settings. The investigators hypothesize
      that group behavioral treatment will be more effective than no treatment. The investigators
      hypothesize that the group treatment will be cost-effective compared to no treatment.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Group Behavioral Treatment Effectiveness as Shown by Changes From Baseline to 3 Months in Urinary Incontinence Severity.</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>The primary outcome is the self-reported urinary incontinence severity as measured by the International Consultation on Incontinence questionnaire-short form (ICI-Q). This short and simple questionnaire is used to screen for incontinence (urine leakage) to obtain a brief yet comprehensive summary of the level, impact and perceived cause of symptoms of incontinence. The ICI-Q consists of four questions and numeric scales: 1. How much do you leak urine? (0-5); never - all the time, 2. How much urine do you usually leak? (0-6); none - large amount, 3. Overall, how much does leaking urine interfere with your everyday life? (0-10); not at all - a great deal, 4. When does urine leak? Multiple choices. The ICI-Q score is the sum of questions 1-3 and ranges from 0-21. The higher the score, the greater severity of incontinence. Baseline data is compared to the 3 month data for the primary outcome.</description>

Baseline data is compared to the 3 month data for the primary outcome.</description>
          <population>The Group Behavioral Treatment group population at baseline is 232. At the 3 month follow-up visit 16 had withdrawn and 7 missed the appointment, leaving 209 for the total number analyzed. For the No Treatment group, the number at baseline is 231 and by the 3 month visit 8 had withdrawn and another 11 missed the appointment, leaving 212.</population>
