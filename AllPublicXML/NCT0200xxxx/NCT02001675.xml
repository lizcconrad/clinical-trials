  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Neuromuscular electrical stimulation (NMES) has emerged as a suitable tool for restoring,
      maintaining and/or enhancing muscular performance. From a practical point of view, NMES can
      elicit contractions either by direct activation of motor axons (i.e. peripheral mechanism) or
      by the recruitment of motoneurons in the spinal cord through the depolarization of sensory
      axons (central mechanism). It is noteworthy that NMES parameters widely affect the balance
      between transmission along these two pathways. Conventional NMES is usually delivered using
      short pulse duration (0.05-0.4 ms), low stimulation frequency (15-40 Hz) and high stimulus
      intensities so that the large antidromic volley in motor axons ensures that the evoked
      contraction will be driven largely by the direct depolarization of motor axons beneath the
      stimulation site with no or little involvement of central nervous system. On the contrary,
      when NMES is delivered using wide pulse widths (1 ms) and high frequency (up to 100 Hz)
      (WP-HF NMES), a portion of the evoked contraction arises from a central mechanism and the
      corresponding force (recently referred to as &quot;extra force&quot;) is significantly (three times)
      larger than the conventional NMES-induced force. This extra force is supposed to represent
      the central contribution from the recruitment of spinal motoneurons by the evoked afferent
      volley given that no additional force was observed during a complete anesthetic block of the
      nerve proximal to the stimulation site. Despite the obvious differences in terms of
      activation of the neuromuscular system between conventional and WP-HF NMES, the functional,
      metabolic and cortical responses associated to both protocols remain to be determined

      The main goal of the project will be to characterize the evoked-force profile during
      conventional and WP-HF NMES.

      The secondary purpose will be to i) investigate the anatomic and metabolic responses of the
      human calf muscle following both NMES protocols by using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and
      31-phosphorous magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS-P31), ii) study the cortical responses
      for both conditions of stimulation by means of functional MRI (f-MRI).
