    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to obtain data regarding the safety of olipudase alfa
      in patients with acid sphingomyelinase deficiency (ASMD) who are exposed to long term
      treatment with olipudase alfa.

      The secondary objectives of this study are to obtain data regarding the efficacy of olipudase
      alfa and to characterize olipudase alfa pharmacodynamics (PD) and pharmacokinetics (PK)
      following long-term administration.

      5 years: This study is an extension study for patients who have completed a previous study
      with olipudase alfa (DFI13803 for pediatric patients, and DFI13412 for adult patients).

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion criteria :

          -  The patient completed the treatment period of a previous study of olipudase alfa with
             an acceptable safety profile in the opinion of the investigator and sponsor.

          -  The patient and/or the patient's parent(s)/legal guardian(s) is willing and able to
             provide signed written informed consent.

          -  The patient who is female and of childbearing potential must have a negative urine
             pregnancy test for beta human chorionic gonadotropin (Î² HCG).

          -  Female patients of childbearing potential and sexually mature male patients must be
             willing to practice true abstinence in line with their preferred and usual lifestyle
             or use 2 acceptable effective methods of contraception up to 15 days following their
             last dose of study drug

        Exclusion criteria:

          -  The patient has any new condition or worsening of an existing condition which in the
             opinion of the investigator would make the patient unsuitable for enrollment, or could
             interfere with the patient participating in or completing the study.

          -  The patient, in the opinion of the investigator, is unable to adhere to the
             requirements of the study.

          -  The patient is unwilling or unable to abstain from the use of alcohol for 1 day prior
             to and 3 days after each olipudase alfa infusion for the duration of the treatment
             period.

          -  The patient is unwilling or unable to avoid, for 10 days before and 3 days after liver
             biopsies, medications or herbal supplements that are potentially hepatotoxic (eg, 3
             hydroxy 3 methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors, erythromycin, valproic acid,
             antidepressants, kava, echinacea) or may cause or prolong bleeding (eg,
             anticoagulants, ibuprofen, aspirin, garlic supplements, ginkgo, ginseng).

          -  The patient requires medication(s) that may decrease olipudase alfa activity (eg,
             fluoxetine, chlorpromazine; tricyclic antidepressants [eg, imipramine, desipramine]).

          -  The patient has an alanine aminotransferase (ALT) or aspartate aminotransferase (AST)
             &gt;250 IU/L or total bilirubin &gt;1.5 mg/dL.

        The above information is not intended to contain all considerations relevant to a patient's
        potential participation in a clinical trial.
