  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Intraoperative optimization of cardiac output using goal directed fluid challenge is
      associated with better outcome. Dynamic preload dependence indicators are well validated
      during surgery in supine position. Positioning from supine to sitting position under
      anesthesia is responsible of several hemodynamic changes. Predictability and cut-off values
      of dynamic preload dependence indicators during surgery in sitting position are unknown. The
      objective of this prospective study is to evaluate ability of three dynamic preload
      dependence indicators, i.e. PPV (Pulse Pressure Variation), SVV (Stroke Volume Variation) and
      PVI (Plethysmographic Variability Index), during neurosurgery in sitting position.

      The primary objective is to determine PPV, SVV and PVI thresholds for which patients respond
      to fluid challenge in sitting position.

      The secondary objectives are to determine variations of PPV, SVV and PVI measures before and
      after positioning in sitting position, and to compare these values to each other.
