    <textblock>
      Pterygium is a common ocular pathology facing ophthalmologists that has varied surgical
      management techniques and high rate of post-operative recurrence. The investigators aim was
      to compare and evaluate the safety and efficacy outcomes of those two surgical procedures in
      management of primary pterygium.

      Design: Prospective randomized clinical trial comparative study. Setting: Department of
      ophthalmology, Al-Minia University Faculty of medicine, Egypt.

      Methods: The study included 150 eyes of 150 patients of primary pterygium. Twenty four to 74
      years of age (mean 49 Â± 12 years). Simple excision under local anesthesia was performed then
      closure of the bare sclera by sutureless and glue free conjunctival autograft in 50 eyes of
      50 patients (group 1), versus sutured free conjunctival autograft in 100 eyes of 100 patients
      (group 2).

    <description>Overall satisfaction with the procedure 3 weeks post-operatively was recorded as four grades 0= unsatisfied, 1= low satisfaction, 2= moderate satisfaction and 3= highly satisfied, the data were collected as mean scores and recorded. The two groups were compared for overall satisfaction.</description>
