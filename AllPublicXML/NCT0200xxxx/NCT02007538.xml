  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In the diagnosis of lung cancer, the cytological sample obtained during Bronchoscopy (FBS),
      has an increasingly important role in the characterization of malignancy. The cytological
      sample can be harvested during bronchoscopy by bronchial brushing, bronchial lavages or fine
      needle aspiration. Immunocytochemical staining allows not only to discriminate between small
      cell lung cancer versus non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), but also to identify the
      expression of specific markers such as TTF-1, CK7, CK20, 4A4, 34βE12 and p63. Thin Prep is a
      technique for cytological assay already validated and largely used in the immunocytochemical
      determination of gynaecologic specimens. Further Studies are required to asses the accuracy
      of this technique compared to conventional smear in cytological airway samples obtained by
      fine needle aspiration.

      Patients undergoing FBS for lung cancer diagnosis purpose will be enrolled in the study.
      During FBS Fine Need Aspiration (FNA) will be performed. Four samplings by FNA will be
      performed in each patient. Two samplings will be processed with thin prep technique and two
      samplings with the traditional procedure. To avoid sampling procedures-related bias, the
      first harvested sample will be randomly tested with Thin Prep or Traditional technique.
