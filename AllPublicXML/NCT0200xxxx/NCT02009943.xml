  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Critically ill surgical patients are observed to have a functional iron deficiency which
      contributes to anemia, iron-deficient erythropoiesis, and an increased red blood cell
      transfusion requirement. Previously, iron supplementation has been studied in this population
      with the administration of enteral ferrous sulfate and intravenous iron sucrose but without
      robust results in resolving serum and bone marrow iron debts.

      Ferric carboxymaltose (FCM) is novel iron-containing complex that allows for the
      administration of a large dose of iron over a short infusion period to allow for sustained
      delivery of iron to target tissues with minimal hypersensitivity reactions. While there has
      been reported increased efficacy and comparable safety of FCM when compared to iron sucrose
      in the outpatient setting, there is no data comparing these two medications in surgical
      critical illness.

      The aim of this pilot trial is to compare two novel dosing schemes of these medications for
      treatment of functional iron deficiency in surgical ICU patients. The investigators
      hypothesize that iron supplementation with FCM, as compared to both iron sucrose and placebo,
      is more effective and equally safe for replacing the serum iron debt.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The inflammatory response associated with surgical critical illness rapidly induces a
      functional iron deficiency, characterized by hypoferremia, decreased transferrin saturation
      (TSAT), hyperferritinemia, and iron-deficient erythropoiesis (IDE). This functional iron
      deficiency both contributes to intensive care unit (ICU) anemia and increases the packed red
      blood cell (pRBCs) transfusion requirement.

      The goals of iron supplementation of critically ill surgical patients are to reverse the
      serum iron debt, eliminate IDE, improve anemia, and decrease pRBCs transfusions. Issues
      surrounding iron supplementation of this patient population include formulation, dose, route
      of administration, and mitigation of the complications of iron overload, including infection.

      The investigators first randomized clinical trial (RCT) of iron supplementation of critically
      ill surgical patients compared enteral ferrous sulfate 325 mg thrice daily to placebo
      (NCT00450177). Although a significant reduction in pRBCs transfusion requirement for the iron
      group was observed, low injury severity, intolerance of enteral medications, and a
      predominance of traumatic brain injury limited generalizability. In a second multicenter RCT,
      the investigators compared intravenous iron sucrose 100 mg thrice weekly to placebo among
      critically ill trauma patients (NCT01180894). Iron supplementation at this dose increased the
      TSAT only marginally (and not above the normal range) and increased the serum ferritin
      concentration significantly; however, there was no effect on IDE, anemia, or pRBCs
      transfusion requirement. In no instance did iron supplementation increase the risk of
      infection, despite a relatively high incidence of marked hyperferritinemia (serum ferritin
      concentration &gt; 1,000 ng/mL) in the iron group.

      The severity of both the serum and bone marrow iron debts observed in these trials led us to
      investigate alternative dosing schemes that deliver larger quantities of bioavailable iron
      safely. Ferric carboxymaltose (FCM) is a novel iron-containing complex that allows for the
      administration of a large replenishment dose of iron (up to 750 mg) over a short infusion
      period. Several pharmacodynamic properties of FCM render it appealing for use in the
      treatment of functional iron deficiency associated with surgical critical illness, including
      a short infusion time, a controlled, sustained delivery of iron to target tissues over a
      relatively long period of time (up to one week), and minimal hypersensitivity reactions.
      Increased efficacy and comparable safety have been reported for FCM as compared to iron
      sucrose for treatment of outpatients with iron-deficiency anemia. There are currently no data
      regarding the efficacy of FCM for the indication of functional iron deficiency associated
      with surgical critical illness.

      The aim of the current pilot trial is to compare two novel dosing schemes for treatment of
      functional iron deficiency in surgical ICU patients, both of which involve delivery of a
      larger total dose of iron as compared to both NCT00450177 and NCT01180894. The investigators
      hypothesize that iron supplementation with FCM, as compared to both iron sucrose and placebo,
      is more effective and equally safe for replacing the serum iron debt.

    <description>Because only a small fraction of total body iron is dissolved in blood, the TSAT is currently regarded as the most accurate indicator of iron substrate available for deposition in the bone marrow and eventual incorporation into erythrocytes. Data from outpatients indicate that TSAT is a more reliable predictor of hemoglobin response as compared to either serum iron concentration or serum ferritin concentration, with a target TSAT of 25-50% considered ideal for bone marrow iron delivery. In NCT01180894, TSAT began and remained &lt;16% despite iron supplementation with iron sucrose 100 mg IV thrice weekly. The target TSAT for this trial will be 25%-50%.</description>

    <description>Bone marrow iron debt as measured by daily erythrocyte zinc protoporphyrin (eZPP) concentration. During normal erythropoiesis, iron is chelated to protoporphyrin IX to form heme. When inadequate iron is delivered to the bone marrow, zinc is substituted for iron, forming zinc protoporphyrin. An elevated eZPP is diagnostic of IDE and reflects the bone marrow iron supply regardless of total body iron.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Anemia (hemoglobin &lt; 12 g/dL).

          -  Functional iron deficiency:

               1. Serum iron concentration &lt; 40 ug/dL

               2. TSAT &lt; 25%

               3. Serum ferritin concentration &gt; 28 ng/mL

          -  &lt; 72 hours from ICU admission.

          -  Expected ICU length of stay â‰¥ 7 days.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Age &lt; 18 years.

          -  Active bleeding requiring pRBCs transfusion

          -  Iron overload (serum ferritin concentration â‰¥ 1,500 ng/mL). The serum ferritin
             concentration is an acute phase reactant that is increased during critical illness
             regardless of total body iron [3]. Substantial levels of hyperferritinemia (serum
             ferrinin concentration &gt; 1,000 ng/dL) were observed in both NCT00450177 and
             NCT01180894 without increased risk of infection and despite both low TSAT and IDE. For
             these reasons, we believe that relative hyperferritinemia (serum ferritin
             concentration 500 - 1,500 ng/dL) is neither harmful nor indicative of bone marrow iron
             availability.

             culture with â‰¥ 105 colony forming units per mL.

          -  Chronic inflammatory conditions (e.g., systemic lupus erythematosis, rheumatoid
             arthritis, ankylosing spondilitis).

          -  Pre-existing hematologic disorders (e.g., thalassemia, sickle cell disease,
             hemophilia, von Willibrand's disease, or myeloproliferative disease).

          -  Current or recent (within 30 days) use of immunosuppressive agents.

          -  Use of any recombinant human erythropoietin formulation within the previous 30 days.

          -  Pregnancy or lactation.

          -  Legal arrest or incarceration.

          -  Prohibition of pRBCs transfusion.

          -  Stay of â‰¥ 48 hours duration in the ICU of a transferring hospital.

          -  History of intolerance or hypersensitivity to iron.
