    <textblock>
      Urodynamic study may lead to significant anxiety. Our hypothesis is that Urodynamic study is
      that pre-procedural explanation note about the test may reduce the anxiety level of the
      patients.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Urodynamic study is one of the most common procedures in urological outpatient practice.
      Patients who wait for the tests may experience significant anxiety.

      in this study, patients who are designated to have multichannel Urodynamic study will be
      randomized to two groups: group 1 - patients who received an explanation note about the test;
      group 2 - patients who did not receive the note. The explanation notes will be sent to the
      patients in group 1 by mail one month before the test.

      Investigators will use the State Anxiety Inventory (SAI) in order to assess emotional
      distress immediately before the test. Comparison opf the anxiety level between the two groups
      will be performed.

    <description>Investigators will use the State Anxiety Inventory (SAI) in order to assess emotional distress. The SAI is a validated questionnaire composed of 20-items measures of anxiety (e.g. ''I am anxious''). Respondents will be requested to rate their endorsement of each item on a four-point scale.</description>
