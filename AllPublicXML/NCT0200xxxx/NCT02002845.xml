      Primary Effectiveness Endpoint:

      • Ability to complete procedure without a need for conversion to a non-robotic approach

      Safety Endpoint:

      Assessment of adverse events through post-operative follow-up including but not limited to:

      • Bleeding

      ▪ Mortality

      Additional endpoints evaluated may include:

        -  Procedure times

        -  Length of hospital stay

        -  Volume of tissue resected

        -  Use of tissue sealants
