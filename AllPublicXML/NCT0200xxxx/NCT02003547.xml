      Each subject will receive the following treatments:

        -  Period 1: Formulation A (n = 14) or placebo (n = 7) twice daily for 7 days

        -  Period 2: Formulation B (n = 14) or placebo (n = 7) twice daily for 7 days

        -  Period 3: Formulation C (n = 14) or placebo (n = 7) twice daily for 7 days

      There will be a minimum washout of 7 days between each treatment period (last dose of
      previous period to first dose of subsequent period

    <measure>Safety and Tolerability</measure>
    <time_frame>7 days</time_frame>
    <description>The secondary endpoints are:
Comparison of hyperaemia assessments in each eye using a photographic rating scale on Day -1 (0 and 8 h post-anticipated dose) and Day 7 (0, 2, 4 and 8 h post dose)
Assessment of ocular surface photographic images of each eye on Day -1 and Day 7 (0 h).
Safety laboratory assessments, vital signs, 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG), recording of Adverse Events and ophthalmic examination findings including visual acuity.</description>
