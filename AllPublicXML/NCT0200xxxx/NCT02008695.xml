      The investigators will test the effectiveness of a youth-led animal husbandry microfinance
      program, Rabbits for Resilience, combined with the adult microfinance, Pigs for Peace (PFP),
      program on youth, family and community resilience outcomes. The following aims will be
      completed over the five-year longitudinal, mixed-method, cluster randomized community trial:

      Specific Aim 1: Determine the relative effectiveness of a youth-led microfinance combined
      with the adult microfinance on youth and family resilience outcomes (reduced mental health
      distress, increased economic stability, improved family functioning) compared to a youth-led
      microfinance only and adult microfinance only approaches.

        -  We hypothesize that at six, twelve and 18-months post-baseline youth and adults in
           households in the youth-led and adult microfinance approach will report improved
           individual and family resilience outcomes compared to households in the youth-led
           microfinance only and adult microfinance only approaches.

      Specific Aim 2: Determine the relative effectiveness of a youth-led microfinance combined
      with PFP microfinance on community resilience (e.g. social capital and participation in
      community groups by youth and adults) compared to youth-led microfinance only and adult
      microfinance only approaches.

        -  We hypothesize that at 18-months post baseline in households in the youth-led and adult
           microfinance will report improved community resilience compared to households in the
           youth-led microfinance only and adult microfinance only approaches

      Specific Aim 3: Determine if changes in youth resilience (caregiving ability, empathy and
      outlook for the future) mediate the relationship between youth engagement in microfinance and
      outcomes, as measured by reduced mental health distress, improved family functioning and
      improved social capital.

      Specific Aim 4: Examine youth perspectives on resilience in the context of multiple
      adversities (war, poverty, loss of family, displacement, victimization). Youth participants
      (N=50, ages 10-15 years) will be invited (with parent/caregiver consent) to complete at
      baseline and 18 month post-baseline qualitative interview/group discussion to examine
      individual, family and community resilience and what that they perceive as key to buffering
      the negative health and social consequences of prolonged conflict and other adversities.

    <textblock>
      Congolese youth, families and communities have survived the 16 years of conflict and are now
      faced with significant challenges for rebuilding their futures. Developing, implementing and
      evaluating microfinance programs that combine youth and adults is an innovative strategy to
      assist households and community efforts by focusing on existing strengths. The study will
      advance knowledge for youth, families and communities impacted by armed conflicts in six
      critical areas:

        -  1) increase our knowledge of youth and adult resilience (mental and physical health,
           family functioning, social capital) in context of multiple adversities;

        -  2) measurement of resilience from a social ecological and longitudinal, mixed-method
           perspective;

        -  3) expand our understanding of resilience to develop prevention interventions for youth
           in early adolescence (ages 10-15 years), an important time to develop healthy
           transitions to young adulthood (ages 15-10 years);

        -  4) test a youth-led microfinance program combined with an existing and successful adult
           microfinance program, Pigs For Peace (PFP), that is sustainable and appropriate to the
           context of a war-affected population;

        -  5) detail resources and infrastructure needed for conducting research in challenging
           field settings with diverse cultures and languages as well as with limited resources,
           such as access to mental health professionals;

        -  6) provide guidelines for the ethical conduct of research in settings where participants
           of diverse ages and backgrounds may have limited knowledge of human rights and ethical
           research concepts, such as informed consent and assent.
