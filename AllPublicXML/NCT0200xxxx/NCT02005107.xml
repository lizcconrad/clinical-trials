    <textblock>
      This study is being conducted to evaluate how the body absorbs and processes the immediate
      release (IR) and sustained release (XR) medication venlafaxine (EffexorÂ®). Subject who are
      1-3 years post gastric bypass or sleeve gastrectomy surgery will be invited to participate.
      Non-surgical controls will also be enrolled based on a matching criteria to post gastric
      bypass subjects. Participants will be asked to complete two 12-hour study days approximately
      11 days apart. This study will enroll up to 30 participants.

    <description>The primary aim of this research is to provide a comparison of pharmacokinetic measures associated with a single dose of venlafaxine IR (immediate release) and venlafaxine XR (sustained release) in Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass, Sleeve Gastrectomy, and matched nonsurgical &quot;control&quot; subjects. Comparisons will be based upon venlafaxine plasma concentrations obtained during the 24 hour sample collection window.</description>

    <time_frame>24 hour collection</time_frame>
    <description>We will also evaluate other PK characteristics associated with venlafaxine, such as Cmax, Tmax, t1/2, and the ratio of venlafaxine to the active metabolite ODV, and others.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Male or Female

          3. No tobacco use in the past three months.

          4. Underwent Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass or Sleeve Gastrectomy weight loss surgery 12-36
             months prior to study OR has not had a weight loss surgery but matches the gastric
             bypass patients on age, gender, and BMI. Criteria for matching will be established at
             the beginning of the study in consultation with the statistical team and addressed as
             needed with the input of the biostatistician.

          5. Ability to read, write and understand English

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Taking a medication that has a clinically significant interaction with venlafaxine or
             an interaction that may alter the study data.

          2. Hypersensitivity to venlafaxine or any excipient contained within the dosage forms

          3. Inability to tolerate repeated blood draws.

          4. Any history of bipoloar disorder or a psychotic disorder.

          5. Current major depressive disorder or current suicidality.

          6. Alcohol or substance dependence in the past year.

          7. Currently pregnant or lactating or unwillingness to use medically accepted
             contraception during study

          8. Taking a medication which significantly alters gastrointesinal transit time or
             significantly reduces acid secretion (e.g. routine use of proton pump inhibitors, H2
             antagonists, sucralfate).

          9. Medical conditon which may increase participant risk with venlafaxine or uncontrolled
             hypertension at the discretion of the examining provider.

         10. Hepatic insufficiency as defined by any hepatic enzyme greater than 3x the upper limit
             of normal or other hepatic laboratory abnormalities at the discretion of the medical
             provider.

         11. Renal impairment as evidence by a calculated creatinine clearance of less than or
             equal to 70ml/min or other abnormality on a renal panel that the medical provider
             feels puts the participant at risk.

         12. Poor or ultra-rapid Cytochrome P450 2D6 metabolizer.

         13. Self reported history of viral hepatits or HIV.

         14. Positive urine drug screen unless documented prescription of a non-interacting
             medication.
