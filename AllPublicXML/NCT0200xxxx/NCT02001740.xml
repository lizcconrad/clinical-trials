  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Frozen shoulder or adhesive capsulitis is a common cause of shoulder pain, estimated to
      affect 25% of the general population. Many forms of treatment have been advocated for frozen
      shoulder including physiotherapy, injection with steroid, distension arthrogram with steroid,
      manipulation under anesthetic and arthroscopic releases. There is no general agreement in
      favour of one form of treatment, and the response to a particular treatment varies in
      different series. A few randomized controlled trials appear in the literature. Most of these
      showed improvements with steroid use, but the results were not always statistically
      significant. One randomized control trial reported superior results in favor of arthrographic
      joint distension with steroid compared to a saline placebo. To our knowledge there have been
      no other similar randomized trials to support these results. The objective of this study is
      to determine if arthrographic distension of the shoulder joint with steriods is an effective
      treatment modality for adhesive capsulitis as compared to injection with local anesthetic and
      contrast alone. The study design is a placebo-controlled, double blind clinical trial where
      participants will undergo distension arthrogram of the shoulder and be randomized to receive
      either Triamcinalone (steroid), lidocaine and contrast or injection with lidocaine and
      contrast alone.
