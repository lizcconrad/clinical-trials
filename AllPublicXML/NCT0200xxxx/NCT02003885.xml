  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine desflurane's dose-dependent effect on left
      ventricular (LV) function in cardiac surgery. The change of tissue Doppler imaging (TDI) of
      lateral mitral valve annular velocity at three different desflurane concentrations would be
      analyzed by using intraoperative transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) in cardiac surgery
      patients

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Tissue Doppler imaging (TDI ) of mitral annular velocity during the cardiac cycle has been
      introduced as a reliable method for analysis of systolic and diastolic LV ling-axix function
      , efficacy of diastolic TDI profile, including early early relaxation (E') and atrial
      contraction (A') and has been suggested to be useful in predicting the postoperative clinical
      outcomes and the impact of isoflurane on LV diastolic function.

      Desflurane is widely used in cardiac surgery patients due to its beneficial effects , but
      many studies have shown that desflurane reduces myocardial contractility in a dose-dependent
      manner, and compromises left ventricular( LV) function We hypothesized that desflurane , even
      at a clinical dosage, would affects intraoperative LV systolic function in a dose-dependent
      manner and thus produce significant changes int the TDI profiles of mitral annular velocity.

      So we planned to study the changes in TDI profiles of lateral mitral annular velocity at the
      clinical desflurane dosage during remifentanil based anesthesia for cardiac surgery
