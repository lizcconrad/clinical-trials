  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the effect of chloroquine in individuals infected with HIV.
      Researchers will aim to determine if chloroquine treatment in participants whose viral loads
      are suppressed on combination antiretroviral therapy (ART), results in improved immune
      activation and CD4 cell recovery.

      The study will recruit 20 individuals and will last approximately 44 weeks. Eligible
      participants will receive an oral dose of chloroquine (250 mg) once daily from week 8 through
      week 32. All participants will be asked to have rectal biopsy samples (week 0 and week 32) to
      study T cell immune activation in the mucosa rectal site.

      Clinical data has identified chloroquine as a potential modulator of immune activation. The
      study's dose of chloroquine is the same as the dose recommended for patients having
      autoimmune diseases. In these autoimmune cases, a daily dose of chloroquine at 250 mg for 12
      weeks has shown improvement in symptoms and decreases in inflammatory cytokines synthesis and
      a reduction in TLR -mediated immune activation. Study findings could help provide information
      about where and under what circumstances chloroquine treatment may reduce T cell activation
      and help restore circulating CD4 T cells.

    <description>This will be a single arm, pilot study with each subject as his/her own control. The study will last 44 weeks, with 8 weeks observation period on ART alone to assess stability of activated CD8CD38 T cells, followed by 24 weeks chloroquine treatment with ART and a 12-week follow-up period on ART alone. Twenty ART treated patients will be recruited. To maximize chances of demonstrating a treatment effect, the chloroquine will be administrated for 24 weeks.</description>
