    <textblock>
      Aim of this study was to assess and compare the efficacy of a commercially available novel
      herbal mouthwash containing potassium nitrate on Dentinal Hypersensitivity (DH) compared to a
      placebo and non herbal potassium nitrate over a period of 12 weeks.

      A total of 120 subjects were divided into 3 groups randomly. Group 1 was given the placebo
      mouthwash, Group 2 was given the herbal mouthwash ( Hiora K, which contains potassium nitrate
      derived from Suryakshara plant) and Group 3 was given the non herbal mouthwash (Containing
      non herbal potassium nitrate). Sensitivity scores (VAS score) were recorded at baseline, 3
      weeks, 6 weeks and 12 weeks.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects with a history of DH caused by gingival recession or cervical erosion were
             selected at baseline. Subjects with a minimum 20 natural permanent teeth and at least
             two teeth with a VAS score of â‰¥4 were included in the study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  of teeth with caries, defective restorations, chipped teeth and deep periodontal
             pockets (probing depth &gt;4 mm). Also, the subjects who had undergone periodontal
             surgery within the previous six months, and those with orthodontic appliances or
             bridge work that would interfere with evaluation were excluded. Subjects with the
             presence of occlusal overload or occlusal adjustment recently made in the tooth to be
             studied were also excluded. Subjects who had undertaken treatment with any product
             that could influence the DH of the patient in the 30 days prior to baseline were
             excluded. Also, the subjects with allergy to the ingredients used in the study or
             exhibiting any gross oral pathology, eating disorders, chronic disease, pregnancy and
