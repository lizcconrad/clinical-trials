    <textblock>
      The main focus of this study is to determine the use of nicotine-containing products across
      the three experimental conditions. Subjects will be monitored to determine their continued
      use of assigned cigarettes, switching to other combusted and/or non-combusted tobacco, or
      cessation of all tobacco containing products.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a single site, single-blind, randomized trial with three experimental conditions
      tested for a period of 8 weeks: 1) Very low nicotine content (VLNC) cigarettes (0.07 nicotine
      yield) with access to combusted (except cigarettes) and non-combusted tobacco and medicinal
      nicotine products; 2) VLNC cigarettes with access to only non-combusted tobacco and medicinal
      nicotine products; and 3) conventional nicotine (CN) content experimental cigarettes (0.8 mg
      nicotine) with access to combusted and non-combusted products. This study will examine the
      use of nicotine-containing products across the three experimental conditions. Subjects will
      be monitored to determine their continued use of assigned cigarettes, switching to other
      combusted (e.g., little cigars, large cigars, pipes) and/or non-combusted tobacco products
      (e.g., conventional smokeless tobacco, snus for smokers, dissolvables, e-cigarettes,
      medicinal nicotine), or cessation of all tobacco containing products. Toxicant exposure
      across the three conditions will also be examined.

      Eligible subjects will be provided very low nicotine content cigarettes and are told to use
      the product ad lib for 8 weeks. Subjects will complete questionnaires on demographics,
      smoking and health history, drug and alcohol use history, mood and perceptions of the study
      tobacco product. Biomarker samples will be analyzed for exposure levels of nicotine and
      tobacco-related toxicants.
