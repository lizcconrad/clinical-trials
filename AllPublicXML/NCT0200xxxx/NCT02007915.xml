      To determine the safety and effectiveness of pamidronate in patients with radiographically
      proven avascular necrosis which are the result of unstable (acute) slipped capital femoral
      epiphysis, traumatic proximal femur fractures, traumatic hip dislocations, or idiopathic in
      nature.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Avascular necrosis of the femoral head and collapse is a devastating condition in the
      pediatric patient population leading to degenerative arthritis and significant disability.
      Bisphosphonate therapy has been shown to be effective in the treatment of adults with
      avascular necrosis of the femoral head. For children and adolescents however, there is
      currently no effective treatment that prevents collapse of the femoral head. Some patients
      with proven avascular necrosis of the femoral epiphysis are treated with bisphosphonates
      (intravenous pamidronate) at the The Hospital for Sick Children. The main aim of this study
      is to prospectively collect data on HSC patients receiving bisphosphonate treatment and
      thereby report the effectiveness of this treatment in the prevention of femoral head
      collapse.

    <description>Pamidronate will be given intravenously over one hour, one day per month for three out of every four months. The initial dose is 0.5mg/kg and subsequent doses are 1mg/kg. Infusions will continue for at least one year with a second year possibly recommended by the surgeon from data on the x-ray and bone scan.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

        Patients between the ages of 10 and 18 with:

          -  unstable slipped capital femoral epiphysis (defined as inability to bear weight) or
             acute slipped capital femoral epiphysis (defined as a separation of the epiphysis from
             the metaphysis of the proximal femur) who have been pinned either in situ or following
             reduction,

          -  traumatic hip dislocations or traumatic proximal femur fractures, or

          -  &quot;idiopathic&quot; avascular necrosis of the femoral head which includes unknown causes as
             well as Sickle Cell Disease, post radiation use, post chemotherapy treatment, and post
             steroid treatment.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Decline to participate in study. (Patients will be still offered this therapy whether
             or not they wish to be included in the official study protocol. Clinical evaluations,
             laboratory and imaging tests would be unchanged if they choose to be treated with
             intravenous pamidronate)

          -  Significant femoral head collapse - judged radiographically by treating surgeon

          -  Idiopathic causes under the age of 10.
