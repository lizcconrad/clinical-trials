  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Although poor antiretroviral (ART) adherence in HIV does not mean a complete lack of
      therapeutic results, the benefit of ART increases as adherence improves. Consequences of
      suboptimal ART adherence are viral rebound, development of drug-resistant HIV strains, and
      more rapid progression to AIDS. Moreover, HIV-infected persons tend to have numerous
      co-occurring conditions and therefore take many medications making adherence to multiple drug
      regimens more difficult. A mobile application capable of improving medication adherence among
      HIV-infected persons would be highly useful.

      The investigators propose an intervention study designed to address these potential
      mechanisms of nonadherence by utilizing the Care4Today v2.0 smartphone application (app). The
      current study is a small pilot Randomized Controlled Trial (RCT) comparing the smart phone
      application titled &quot;Care4Today v2.0&quot; versus standard of care to improve medication adherence
      to ART over a 4-week period with 60 HIV+ participants.

      The pilot RCT consists of 60 HIV+ persons who are at risk for ART medication nonadherence.
      Using random assignment, 30 HIV+ participants will be assigned to medication adherence
      improvement via &quot;Care4Today&quot; app as compared to 30 HIV+ participants assigned standard of
      care.

      The investigators will assess the effectiveness and acceptability of the app in improving
      objectively measured ART adherence (i.e., via medication event monitoring system caps) over a
      4-week period via a pilot RCT with 30 HIV+ persons assigned to the Care4Today intervention
      and 30 HIV+ persons assigned to standard of care.

    <description>Care4Today mobile application will send automated medication alert messages to HIV+ persons. The alert messages are customizable and automated, and real-time results are viewable within the application. The Care4Today intervention is designed to improve adherence to ART medications among HIV+ persons who experience adherence difficulties over standard of care.</description>
