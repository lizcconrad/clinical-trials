    <textblock>
      The MET oncogene encodes the receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) for hepatocyte growth factor
      (HGF) and controls genetic programs leading to cell growth, invasion and protecÂ¬tion from
      apoptosis. Although the definitive role of MET oncogene is yet to be determined in
      carcinogenesis of gastric cancer, overexpression and amplification of c-Met has been
      demonstrated in gastric cancer cell lines. In addition, approximately 10-20% of gastric
      cancer tissues and up to 40% of the scirrhous histological subtype were shown to harbor
      increased MET gene copy numbers. Importantly, PHA-665,752, a selective c-Met kinase inhibitor
      showed significant reduction of established tumor mass in mouse xenografts with GTL16, a
      gastric cancer cell line with &gt;10-fold MET amplification. Another pivotal study showed that
      gastric cancer cells with MET amplification were extremely sensitive to PHA-665,752 and
      implicated a potential role of c-Met protein in developing theranostics in gastric cancer.
      More and more data indicated that c-Met was an important prognostic factor in gastric cancer.

      Gastric cancer is a heterogeneous disease. Does the expression and amplification of c-Met in
      the primary lesion differ from the metastatic disease? Does the expression and amplification
      of c-Met in the early disease differ from advanced disease? Till now there is no related
      report.

      Purposes:

        -  Compare the expression and amplification of c-Met between primary lesion and metastatic
           lesion together with clinical characteristic, to explore the relationship of c-Met
           expression and metastatic pattern

        -  Compare the expression and amplification of c-Met between early stage and metastatic
           stage, and to explore the role of c-MET in the development of carcinoma

      We retrospectively collect the metastatic gastric cancer patients who received a surgical
      resection of both primary diseases and metastatic lesions during January 2006 and December
      2012. Patients are collected based on the following criteria: (1) pathology proven advanced
      gastric adenocarcinoma; (2) the paraffin-embedded tissues of the primary and metastatic
      lesions were available (3) full information of follow-up. There are 100 patients suitable for
      the analysis. c-MET protein expression and amplification are assessed in paraffin-embedded
      tissues of the primary and metastatic diseases obtained from 100 patients by
      immunohistochemistry (IHC) and Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). The clinical
      pathologic data of the patients are also collected for analysis, including: gender, age,
      Karnofsky performance score (KPS), chemotherapy regimens, tumor locations, Lauren
      classification, histology subtypes, metastatic sites.

      In order compare c-Met expression and amplification between early and advanced stage, we will
      match 100 early stage (stage I and stage II) patients based on the following criteria (1)
      pathology proven gastric adenocarcinoma with radical resection; (2) the paraffin-embedded
      tissues of the primary lesions is available (3) full information of follow-up MET IHC will
      employ the Dako MET IHC assay and supplied assay protocol and pathology scoring guideline.

      MET FISH will also employ the Dako MET FISH assay supplied assay protocol and pathology
      scoring guideline.
