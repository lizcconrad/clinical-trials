  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase II study trying to identify whether short term treatment with PD0332991
      yields anti-proliferative response -defined by a low level of Ki67 expression (IHC) at
      surgery- or induces senescence as determined by SABG expression (IHC) in tumors from patients
      with early breast cancer non-candidates for neoadjuvant hormonotherapy or chemotherapy, as
      compared to no treatment.
