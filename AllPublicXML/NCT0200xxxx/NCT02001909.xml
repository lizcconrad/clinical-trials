        Inclusion:

          -  Healthy male subjects

             to, during the course of the study, and 3 months after the last administration of
             regorafenib. An adequate contraception includes the use of condoms or a vasectomy. In
             addition, adequate birth control measures for the subject's partner is required, such
             as a hormonal contraception with implants or combined oral contraceptives, certain
             intrauterine devices, bilateral tubal ligation, or hysterectomy.

        Exclusion:

          -  Known or suspected hypersensitivity to regorafenib and/or neomycin

          -  Any illness or medical condition that is unstable or could jeopardize the safety of
             the subject and his compliance in the study

          -  Clinically significant illness within 30 days prior to Day 1, Period 1.

          -  Regular use of medicines at the time of screening, including herbal supplements and
             high dose vitamins

          -  Smoking; however, former smokers who have stopped smoking at least 3 months before the
             first study drug administration may be included

          -  Clinically relevant findings in the electrocardiogram (ECG)

          -  Clinically relevant findings in the complete physical examination

          -  Positive results for hepatitis B virus surface antigen (HBsAg), hepatitis C virus
             antibodies (anti-HCV), human immune deficiency virus antibodies (anti-HIV 1+2) at
             screening.

          -  Positive urine drug screening
