  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the efficacy and safety of Herceptin in patients with metastatic or
      advanced gastric cancer with disease progression during platinum-based or
      5-fluoropyrimidine-based chemotherapy. The anticipated time on study treatment is until
      disease progression.

    <description>Tumor response assessed according to RECIST. Complete response (CR): complete disappearance of all target and non-target lesions, with exception of nodal disease. All nodes, both target and non-target, must decrease to normal (short axis less than [&lt;]10 millimeters [mm]); no new lesions. Partial response (PR): greater than or equal to (≥)30 percent (%) decrease under baseline of sum of diameters of all target lesions. Short axis was used in the sum for target nodes, while the longest diameter was used in the sum for all other target lesions; no unequivocal progression of non-target disease; no new lesions. Stable disease (SD): not qualifying for CR, PR, or progressive disease (PD). Participants who could not be classified per RECIST were allocated as follows: early death from malignant disease (death due to cancer), early death because of other cause (death not related to toxicity or cancer disease), and unknown (for not fitting into the above categories).</description>

    <description>Participants were classified as having a clinical benefit if they had a best overall tumor response of CR, PR, or SD. Tumor response assessed according to RECIST.

        <description>Participants were classified as having a clinical benefit if they had a best overall tumor response of CR, PR, or SD. Tumor response assessed according to RECIST. CR: complete disappearance of all target and non-target lesions, with exception of nodal disease. All nodes, both target and non-target, must decrease to normal (short axis &lt;10 mm); no new lesions. PR: ≥30% decrease under baseline of sum of diameters of all target lesions. Short axis was used in the sum for target nodes, while the longest diameter was used in the sum for all other target lesions; no unequivocal progression of non-target disease; no new lesions. Stable SD: not qualifying for CR, PR, or PD.</description>
