    <textblock>
      It is hypothesized that a progressive simulated learning strategy will result in better
      global clinical performance (e.g., technical, communication) and transfer of endoscopic
      skill, as compared with a high-fidelity simulation strategy.

    <time_frame>4-6 weeks post-intervention</time_frame>
    <description>The Joint Advisory Group (JAG) Direct Observation of Procedural Skills (DOPS) tool is a tool to assess colonoscopic competency and includes ratings of the following domains: (i) assessment, consent and communication; (ii) safety and sedation; (iii) endoscopic skills during insertion and withdrawal; and, (iv) diagnostic and therapeutic ability. Scores range from 0-100, with higher scores representing higher colonoscopic competency. The tool will be used to assess participants before and after the intervention at a time of one week. A change in these ratings before and after intervention is the primary outcome.</description>

    <description>The Joint Advisory Group (JAG) Direct Observation of Procedural Skills (DOPS) tool is a tool to assess colonoscopic competency and includes ratings of the following domains: (i) assessment, consent and communication; (ii) safety and sedation; (iii) endoscopic skills during insertion and withdrawal; and, (iv) diagnostic and therapeutic ability. Scores range from 0-100, with higher scores representing higher colonoscopic competency. The tool will be used to assess participants on virtual reality colonoscopy cases. A change in these ratings before and after intervention is a secondary outcome.</description>

    <measure>Colonoscopy Specific Performance, Communication Skills, and Global Performance on an Integrated Scenario</measure>
    <time_frame>Immediate post-training and 4-6 weeks after training (delayed post-training)</time_frame>
    <description>Technical skills, communication skills, and global performance assessed during an integrated scenario through the JAG DOPS tool, integrated scenario communication rating form (ISCRF), and integrated scenario global rating form (ISGRF) respectively.
The JAG DOPS tool, as previously described, will be used to assess participants on integrated scenario colonoscopy cases. A change in these ratings before and after intervention is a secondary outcome.
The ISCRF and ISGRF are tools which measure communication skills and global performance with a standardized nurse and standardized patient during a simulated colonoscopy. These tools can have scores from 0-100, with higher scores representing better performance.</description>

    <description>The progressive learning group will undertake 6 hours of interactive small-group didactic sessions, interlaced with up to 6 hours of self-directed instruction initially on the low-fidelity box simulator, with feedback provided one-on-one by an expert academic endoscopist. Participants in the progressive learning group can switch to the high-fidelity simulator at their discretion, but cannot return to the low-fidelity simulator. On the high fidelity VR simulator they can progress through six modules each in colonoscopy and endoscopic polypectomy in a self-directed fashion, with one-on-one feedback by an expert academic endoscopist. The endoscopy instructor will demonstrate techniques, answer questions and provide feedback. The entirety of this will be delivered over two days.</description>

    <description>The high-fidelity group will undertake 6 hours of interactive small-group didactic and hands-on sessions on the theory of colonoscopy, led by an expert academic gastroenterologist. The sessions will be interlaced with up to six hours of self-directed instruction on the high-fidelity VR simulator. Six task-specific modules of increasing difficulty in colonoscopy and colonoscopic polypectomy will be taught solely on the VR simulator with one-on-one feedback from an expert academic endoscopist. The endoscopy instructor will demonstrate techniques, answer questions and provide feedback as necessary. The entirety of this will be delivered over two days.</description>

        <description>The Joint Advisory Group (JAG) Direct Observation of Procedural Skills (DOPS) tool is a tool to assess colonoscopic competency and includes ratings of the following domains: (i) assessment, consent and communication; (ii) safety and sedation; (iii) endoscopic skills during insertion and withdrawal; and, (iv) diagnostic and therapeutic ability. Scores range from 0-100, with higher scores representing higher colonoscopic competency. The tool will be used to assess participants before and after the intervention at a time of one week. A change in these ratings before and after intervention is the primary outcome.</description>

Participants in the progressive learning group can switch to the high-fidelity simulator at their discretion, but cannot return to the low-fidelity simulator.

          <title>Progressive Group</title>
          <description>The progressive learning group will undertake 6 hours of interactive small-group didactic sessions, interlaced with up to 6 hours of self-directed instruction initially on the low-fidelity box simulator, with feedback provided one-on-one by an expert academic endoscopist. Participants in the progressive learning group can switch to the high-fidelity simulator at their discretion, but cannot return to the low-fidelity simulator. On the high fidelity VR simulator they can progress through six modules each in colonoscopy and endoscopic polypectomy in a self-directed fashion, with one-on-one feedback by an expert academic endoscopist. The endoscopy instructor will demonstrate techniques, answer questions and provide feedback. The entirety of this will be delivered over two days.

          <title>High-Fidelity Group</title>
          <description>The high-fidelity group will undertake 6 hours of interactive small-group didactic and hands-on sessions on the theory of colonoscopy, led by an expert academic gastroenterologist. The sessions will be interlaced with up to six hours of self-directed instruction on the high-fidelity VR simulator. Six task-specific modules of increasing difficulty in colonoscopy and colonoscopic polypectomy will be taught solely on the VR simulator with one-on-one feedback from an expert academic endoscopist. The endoscopy instructor will demonstrate techniques, answer questions and provide feedback as necessary. The entirety of this will be delivered over two days.</description>
