      -  This is a phase II, prospective, single-center, non-randomized, non-controlled study.

        -  Sentinel lymph node biopsy (SNB) is a standard staging procedure in early breast cancer.
           The potentially increasing false negative rate of SNB was concerned if the sonographic
           abnormal node was not excised. The aim of this study was to evaluate the accuracy of SNB
           in breast cancer with sonographic abnormal axillary lymph nodes.

    <description>Axillary ultrasound examination was undergone for all breast cancer patients before sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB). If abnormal axillary lymph node was found, ultrasound-guided FNA cytology of these nodes were performed. The abnormal nodes were defined as completely hypoechoic node, asymmetric focal hypoechoic node, cortical lobulation and cortical thickness &gt;3mm. Patients with negative results of FNA would undergo SLNB. Technetium-99m-labeled Rituximab was used for lymphatic mapping. Before the SLNB operation, a hookwire was placed at the suspicious axillary lymph node by ultrasound guidance. In the SLNB operation, radioactive nodes and wire-localized nodes were removed and labeled separately for pathological examination.</description>
