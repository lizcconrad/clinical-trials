  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Gastroparesis (slow stomach emptying) is a common feature of Parkinson's Disease. Levodopa
      (Sinemet), a common medication for Parkinson's Disease, can make gastroparesis worse.
      Gastroparesis effects how the levodopa is absorbed and used by the body. This study will
      explore the possibility of using Erythromycin, a drug commonly used (off label) for
      gastroparesis, along with levodopa to determine if there is improved levodopa absorption and
      motor function.

      Participants will be required to make four visits for evaluation. Visit 1 is a screening
      visit, participants will receive the study drug or a placebo during visits 2 and 3, and visit
      4 is a follow up visit. Participants will provide blood and urine samples during the visits.
      Participants will also be required to complete questionnaires and a series of motor tests.

    <description>Mean total AIMS (Abnormal Involuntary Movements Scale) score after receiving erythromycin minus mean total AIMS score after receiving placebo. The AIMS test has a total of twelve items rating involuntary movements of various areas of the patient's body. Ten of the items are rated on a five-point scale of severity from 0-4. The scale is rated from 0 (none), 1 (minimal), 2 (mild), 3 (moderate), 4 (severe). Two of the items are not scored. Total score range is from 0 to 40. Higher scores represent more severe dyskinesia (a worse outcome).</description>

        <description>Mean Cmax of plasma levodopa after erythromycin versus placebo. Plasma samples were collected at the following times post-levodopa dose: 15, 30, 45, 60, 75, 90, 105, 120, 150, 180, 210, and 240 minutes.</description>
