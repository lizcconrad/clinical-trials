      The logical next step is to integrate molecular profiling into the care of all patients with
      NSCLC.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      NSCLC is an area of oncology in which clinicians are beginning to use specific
      tumor-associated molecular aberrations to assign and/or prioritize targeted therapies for
      patients. At this early stage, multiple hurdles remain before molecular profiling becomes a
      routine part of thoracic oncology practice. In particular, to develop specific targeted
      therapies for patients whose tumors harbor rare mutations, it will be important to identify
      appropriate candidates, design the appropriate trials, and execute the trials with adequate
      numbers to achieve the necessary endpoints. Implementation will facilitate realization of the
      promise of molecularly tailored therapy, which could lead to more effective treatments with
      fewer side effects.

        We plan to collect 300 EGFR mutation positive samples (approximately 200 de novo, 100 after
        treatment), 200 EGFR wild type adenocarcinoma patients and 100 other NSCLC patients in 3
        years.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients who have participated or will be participating a lung cancer clinical trial
             that use EGFR-TKI or chemotherapy as first line or second line treatment.

          2. Pathologic or cytological confirmation of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with
             available tissue

          3. Patients must understand and provide written informed consent prior to initiation of
             any study-specific procedures

          4. Have a life expectancy 3 months.

          5. Have stage IV NSCLC (AJCC, 7th Edition)

          6. No or one prior systemic therapy for advanced or metastatic NSCLC 6.1.Adjuvant
             chemotherapy: The adjuvant chemotherapy (e.g. vinorelbine / cisplatin) should be
             counted as one prior systemic therapy if the interval between the completion of
             adjuvant chemotherapy and the documentation of recurrence within 12 months.

             6.2.Maintenance therapy: The maintenance therapy (e.g. pemetrexed) following the
             first-line systemic chemotherapy which achieved complete response, partial response,
             or stable disease should not be counted as one prior systemic therapy if the
             maintenance drug was used in first-line combination therapy

          7. â‰¥20 years

          8. ECOG performance status 0 - 2

          9. If there is no available archived tissue, the subject must consent to undergo a biopsy
             or surgical procedure to obtain tissue within 1 month prior to study entry, which may
             or may not be part of the patient's routine care for their malignancy.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Prior history of another malignancy (other than cured basal cell carcinoma of the skin
             or cured in-situ carcinoma of the cervix) within 5 years of study entry.

          2. Known HIV infection.

          3. If subject has no archival tissue and refuse to do any biopsy or surgery for molecular
             testing
