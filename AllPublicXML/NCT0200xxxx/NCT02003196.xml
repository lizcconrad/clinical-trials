  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Morbidity and mortality of ICU patients is increased by the development of a
      &quot;immunosuppression&quot; systemic (IS). This IS develops in the early hours of hospitalization and
      is responsible for severe infections, including viral reactivations (Cytomegalovirus or
      Herpes Simplex Virus). Viral reactivation was associated with increased morbidity and
      mortality in intensive care units. In clinical practice, they are searched at the onset of
      organ failure or unexplained fever. The investigators wish to conduct this research in the
      stroke patients to assess the predictive power of these viral reactivations on the duration
      of mechanical ventilation.
