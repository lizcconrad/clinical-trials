      Background

      The prevalence and incidence of type 2 diabetes is increasing globally. A common complication
      of diabetes is the disease of the blood vessels, vascular diseases, which can cause disorders
      like myocardial infarction, stroke and kidney failure. Methods to detect early subclinical
      stages of macro-vascular disease are not yet available in a clinical setting.

      Hypothesis

      Arterial stiffness, an easy accessible vascular parameter, may provide additional prognostic
      information when evaluating risk profile for patients with diabetes type 2.

      Aim

      The aim of the project is to investigate the association between arterial stiffness and the
      occurrence and development of vascular complications in patients with type 2 diabetes.
      Specifically we want to investigate:

        1. in a cross-sectional study, the association between arterial stiffness and subclinical
           atherosclerotic changes in the coronary arteries assessed by computed tomography (CT)
           and

        2. in a longitudinal study, the predictive value of arterial stiffness on the development
           of subclinical cerebrovascular changes assessed by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and
           nephropathy assessed by urine analysis.

      Methods

      The study population consists of 100 patients with newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes and 100
      age- and sex matched controls. The study participants were enrolled between 2008-2011 and
      extensively characterized i.a. with arterial stiffness (pulse wave velocity), MRI (white
      matter lesions and cerebral infarctions) and urine analysis (albuminuria). In this study we
      will enrol the same patients in a 5 year follow-up study in order to repeat above mentioned
      measurements. Furthermore, CT is used to investigate the coronary plaque burden of the
      participants (Agatston Score and Segment Involvement Score).

      Results and Perspective

      This project adds new insight into arterial stiffness as a predictor of the progression of
      micro- and macrovascular complications in patients with type 2 diabetes, and can potentially
      improve risk stratification and early strategies of intervention in this patient group.
