      Surgical sponges can be accidentally left inside patient's bodies. We are working on special
      tags (called microfabricated tags) that surgeons can put on their sponges. Then, if the
      surgeons forget to remove a sponge from a patient, they'll be able to detect these special
      tags in an x-ray.

      Surgical sponges can be accidentally left inside patient's bodies. We are working on special
      tags (called microfabricated tags) that surgeons can put on their sponges. Then, if the
      surgeons forget to remove a sponge from a patient, they'll be able to detect these special
      tags in an x-ray. We wish to take x-rays of healthy people's abdomens with microfabricated
      tags lying on them. The x-rays will help us improve our system for detecting sponges left
      inside people's bodies.

    <description>X-rays of the microfabricated tag will be taken. These x-rays will be reviewed and the individual tags identified manually and a control file created. The images will then be processed by the CAD (computer aided detection)system and the output will be compared to the control file.</description>
