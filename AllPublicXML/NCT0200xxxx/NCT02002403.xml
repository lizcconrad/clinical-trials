  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The drug being tested in this study is low doses of Optina (formerly known as Danazol)
      (DMI-5207) that may be an effective treatment for diabetic retinopathy and diabetic macular
      edema (DME). Laboratory studies have demonstrated that low doses of this drug may treat
      diabetic retinopathy and diabetic macular edema by two important ways, decreasing blood
      vessel permeability (related to leaking and edema) and by decreasing the formation of new
      leaky blood vessels. Optina is not approved by Health Canada for the treatment of diabetic
      macular edema but higher doses of Optina are approved by Health Canada for treatment of
      endometriosis (growth of cells similar to those that form inside of the womb that grows
      outside of the womb) and fibrocystic breast disease (a condition of the breast tissue).
      Higher doses of Optina have also been approved in the United States and many other countries
      since the mid-1970s in the treatment of men and women with hereditary angioedema (a disease
      which causes swelling in parts of the body) in addition to endometriosis and fibrocystic
      breast disease in women.

      All of the Optina doses that will be used in the current study are less than half of the
      typical starting doses for the approved indications. This can be compared to &quot;high-dose&quot;
      aspirin that is used to treat, for example, headache, while low-dose &quot;baby aspirin&quot; is used
      to reduce blood clotting. Similarly, Optina has two different effects at high and low dose.
      The low doses for this study have been selected based on the laboratory studies mentioned
      above.

      The purpose of this study is to investigate the safety and effectiveness of low doses of
      Optina in the treatment of macular edema due to diabetes, and also to test if it helps to
      slow the development of macular edema.

             planning to use progesterone contraceptive methods (including a progesterone IUD)
             during the study drug treatment period are not eligible for enrollment.] Should a
             woman become pregnant or suspect that she is pregnant while participating in this
             study, she should inform her treating physician immediately.

          4. Enrollment in this study is contraindicated for pregnant or lactating women. Thus,

        Study Eye Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Best corrected Early Treatment Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) visual acuity letter score of

             type of insulin (for example, changing to or adding a short acting insulin from a
             longer-acting insulin), or increased the daily dose ≥50%, initiated intensive insulin
             treatment such as an insulin pump or additional daily injections or plan to do so in
             the next 3 months should not be enrolled

             undergoing dialysis at screening)

         16. Changes in anti-hypertensive medication within 3 months before randomization (except
             for dosage adjustments that are considered minor in the opinion of the Investigator)

         17. Major surgery (e.g. head and neck, chest, abdomen, gastrointestinal, genitourinary or
             central nervous system) within past 28 days or anticipated in the next 6 months

             entry

         20. Patient is expecting to move out of the area of the clinical center during the next 6
             months

        Study eye exclusions:

          1. Macular edema considered to be due to a cause other than diabetic macular edema, e.g.,
             cataract extraction, vitreous-retinal interface disease (a taut posterior hyaloid or

             acuity would not improve from resolution of macular edema (e.g., foveal atrophy,
             closure of juxtafoveal capillaries, dense subfoveal hard exudates)

          3. An ocular condition (other than diabetic retinopathy) that, in the opinion of the
             investigator, might affect macular edema or alter visual acuity during the course of
             the study, e.g., vein occlusion, uveitis or other ocular inflammatory disease,
             Irvine-Gass Syndrome, etc.

          4. Substantial cataract that, in the opinion of the investigator, is likely to interfere
             with ocular measurements or evaluations during this study

          5. History of treatment for DME at any time in the past 3 months (such as focal/grid
             macular photocoagulation, intravitreal or peribulbar corticosteroids, anti-vascular

             intraocular surgery, etc.) within prior 6 months or anticipated within the next 6
             months following randomization
