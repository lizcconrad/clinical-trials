  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The best way to measure whether treatment of children with central precocious puberty is
      working is to do a hormone stimulation test (leuprolide stimulation test) that requires
      injection of a medication and multiple blood draws to see if the hormonal response is
      suppressed (blocked). The hypothesis of this study is that random measurement of the free
      alpha subunit of pituitary glycoprotein, a protein related to the pituitary hormones that
      stimulate puberty, will provide an adequate alternative to the leuprolide stimulation testfor
      monitoring efficacy of pubertal suppression with Supprelin LA®.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      During clinical trials of Supprelin LA®, leuprolide stimulation tests were performed to
      determine adequacy of suppression. However, the use of this stimulation test to monitor
      suppression requires an expensive medication and collection of multiple blood samples.
      Alternative methods of monitoring pubertal suppression during gonadotropin releasing hormone
      receptor agonist (GnRHa) therapy have included both random and trough levels of Luteinizing
      Hormone (LH), estradiol or inhibin B. Recently, the free alpha subunit of pituitary
      glycoprotein (FASPG) has also been shown to be a potentially useful marker of hormonal
      suppression (Hirsch HJ, et al, JCEM 95:2841, 2010) as it undergoes a paradoxical rise
      following initiation of therapy, and reverts to baseline upon completion.

      In this investigator-initiated pilot study we will evaluate novel markers of pubertal
      suppression in children receiving standard of care gonadotropin releasing hormone receptor
      agonist therapy for the treatment of central precocious puberty. Children with central
      precocious puberty who have selected treatment with Supprelin LA will undergo hormonal
      testing of markers of pubertal activity before and after placement of the Supprelin LA
      insert.

        Females diagnosed with central precocious puberty or rapidly progressive puberty based upon
        age at start of puberty, physical examination, serum hormone levels and bone age X-Ray will
        be recruited. This will be a convenience sample of children scheduled to receive Supprelin
        LA insert placement. The subjects will be recruited from two pediatric endocrinology clinic
        systems.
