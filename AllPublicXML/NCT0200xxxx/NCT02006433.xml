      The Investigators propose an investigation of the safety of deep brain stimulation (DBS) for
      the alleviation of chronic neuropathic pain in patients with spinal cord injury (SCI).

      Aim 1 is to determine whether DBS in the periaqueductal/periventricular gray region (PAG/PVG)
      of the brain at analgesic intensities produces any systemic or neurological adverse effects
      in patients with longstanding SCI (&gt;1 year), either immediately or as a result of prolonged
      application for up 40 weeks.

      Aim 2 is to determine whether acute application of DBS in the PAG/PVG influences the severity
      of spontaneous ongoing pain caused by longstanding SCI.

      Aim 3 is to determine whether DBS in the PAG/PVG affects stimulus-evoked or persistent
      hypertension (a major sign of autonomic dysreflexia) in chronic SCI patients.

      Aim 4 is to determine whether prolonged PAG/PVG stimulation (for 40 weeks) leads to
      cumulative changes in chronic pain severity or in the motor or autonomic symptoms of chronic
      SCI patients.

      The current study attempts to utilize deep brain stimulation of the periaqueductal grey (PAG)
      for diminution of both neuropathic and nociceptive pain in spinal cord injury patients.
      Likewise, the study will look at the effects on autonomic function as well. Deep brain
      stimulation, as a treatment, has gained widespread use for the treatment of various movement
      disorders. It is currently approved for use by the FDA for treatment of Parkinsons Disease,
      Essential Tremor, and Dystonia. Over 100,000 implants have been performed worldwide for these
      indications. The safety profile is well defined.

      Pain is a tremendous burden for those who suffer with SCI. Persistent pain below or at the
      injury level is experienced in 2/3rd of chronic SCI patients. As a result of this pain at
      least 1/3rd of this sub-population faces a severely reduced quality of life; some authorities
      consider this rate to be much higher, based on surveyed pain ratings. It was reported that
      23% of a sample patients with cervical or high thoracic SCI and 37% with low thoracic or
      lumbosacral SCI would sacrifice sexual, bowel and bladder function for good pain relief.

      SCI pain is typically a mixture of nociceptive pain, which is caused by activation of primary
      afferents' receptors, and neuropathic pain, which is caused by damage to the nervous system.
      Neuropathic pain of SCI is most frequently treated by anticonvulsant agents. There is good
      evidence from randomized control trials for some degree of effectiveness of gabapentin and
      pregabalin, with weaker evidence for valproic acid. Tricyclic antidepressants are also used
      to control SCI pain, but the supporting evidence is not as strong. Thus amitriptyline has
      proved somewhat effective when the patient is depressed, but trazodone was reported not to
      reduce post-SCI neuropathic pain more than placebo. Traditional analgesics are also useful.
      Morphine can provide effective relief of neuropathic pain due to SCI, and can be combined
      with the alpha-2 agonist clonidine for this purpose. Subarachnoid or epidural lidocaine has
      been used to obtain short-term relief. For the musculoskeletal pain in SCI, which
      nociceptive, antispasticity agents are frequently used; intrathecal baclofen, for example,
      can be fairly effective. Despite this considerable range of choices, pharmacological
      treatment for the pain of SCI remains inadequate. Low effectiveness, tolerance, side effects
      or difficulties with prolonged local administration (e.g., subdural) are among problems
      encountered.

      Due to the combination of severity of chronic pain SCI patients are faced with and the
      inadequate medical treatments available that this study is pertinent. Although, prior
      attempts at clinical studies to show efficacy of DBS for pain have essentially failed, the
      Investigators believe this current protocol offers some unique aspects. Likewise, as
      mentioned earlier, both neuropathic and nociceptive pain related to SCI is devastating for
      those afflicted. The Investigators have performed a detailed literature search and reviewed
      all papers related to DBS and pain. To date there has been very few studies looking at DBS
      for pain. Of those papers, the etiology of pain was very variable with only a small subset
      related to spinal cord injury. Of the papers, including spinal cord injury none were well
      controlled and even fewer reported detailed outcomes, other than to say there was no pain
      control. Also of importance was that none of those studies truly looked at the effects of
      chronic stimulation on pain control. This is to say, that each paper had as a criteria, that
      the patient felt immediate relief of pain at the time of surgery or else the leads were
      removed and no further stimulation was given. Most papers to date do not detail the outcome
      measures used to determine pain relief. There are various pain scales that can be used to
      determine level of pain control, some more accurate than others. Our study will also look at
      the effects of alternating stimulation parameters on a monthly basis from therapeutic
      stimulation parameters to sub-therapeutic parameters in a double blinded fashion (patient and
      examiner). This method of evaluation will give us a unique way to evaluate pain control yet
      to be performed in any of these prior studies. Likewise, the Investigators will also evaluate
      the subject's ability to decrease both antiepileptic drugs as well as narcotics as DBS
      progresses.

      For the reasons above, the Investigators feel our study is different from those of the past.
      The Investigators believe that due to the severity of the problem and lack of effective
      therapeutic options combined with the less than stringent studies to date that our study
      should be done. The Investigators realize that prior attempts at pain control with DBS have
      been lackluster. However, our study is not only based on prior clinical attempts but also on
      basic science research from the Miami Project to Cure Paralysis. These studies performed by
      Dr. Ian Hentall (co-investigator) suggest strongly that stimulation of the periaqueductal
      grey on a chronic basis is effective for pain control. Likewise, they suggest a beneficial
      effect on autonomic dysreflexia, a potentially life threatening complication of SCI, as well.
      As a result, our study will also focus on evaluating the effects of DBS on autonomic
      dysreflexia with very stringent outcome measures, another unique aspect of this study. There
      is also data in humans to suggest that the PAG is a central control center for autonomic
      function.

      Key Points:

      Primary Rationale

        1. Need. Many patients with chronic neuropathic pain due to spinal cord injury (SCI)
           experience long-term suffering and have no recourse to adequate alternative therapy.
           Analgesic drugs are at best of weak or inconsistent efficacy for a given patient and can
           produce serious side effects at typical doses. This clinical trial is therefore
           qualitatively different from trials comparing some improved drug (etc.) with a currently
           used one.

        2. Prospects. Pain of many types is responsive acutely to stimulation in the
           periaqueductal/periventricular gray region (PAG/PVG; our anatomical target). There is a
           large confirmatory literature on this in both animals and man, going back 3-4 decades. A
           review analyzing PAG/PVG stimulation in prior clinical studies for all types of
           drug-refractory pain uncovered 148 cases with a 79.1% success rate after lead
           internalization.

        3. Clinical evidence. With regard to acute relief of chronic SCI pain by DBS in PAG/PVG,
           the Investigators believe that useful evidence is non-existent at present, but that the
           benefits of PAG/PVG stimulation for other kinds of pain strongly justify a targeted
           evaluation. In the above-cited 2005 meta-analysis, pain originating from spinal cord
           injury was identified in 10 cases and leads were internalized in 7 of these cases, of
           which 5 showed good long-term pain relief. Unfortunately, it is impossible to tell from
           the cases described in the original articles, many from the 1970s, whether the sensory
           thalamus (a different brain region, probably less appropriate) or the PAG/PVG or both
           were stimulated. Moreover, the clinical literature on DBS for SCI pain rarely describes
           the type of injury (segmental level, completeness, age or onset, etc.) and often
           includes non-typical SCI in its summary categories (e.g., root avulsion, myelopathy).
           Because of the conflation of stimulation sites and the poor characterizations of the
           injuries, these factors need to be revisited in a more thorough analysis.

        4. Preclinical evidence. Prolonged DBS improves other symptoms of SCI as well as pain. The
           Investigators have found that various types of sensory and motor performance and
           anatomical damage are restored. Recovery of autonomic dysreflexia, and improvements in
           gastric emptying, insulin level and glucose control have been measured more recently.
           These improvements remain when the stimulation ceases. Separately from pain, it is
           important to find out in man whether the Investigators can safely replicate these
           findings, with possible great benefit to patients. Thus there is a potential for (a)
           immediate pain relief, (b) long-term changes in pain status (such that the stimulation
           can be reduced or stopped), (c) general improvement in different visceral or motor
           symptoms of the SCI syndrome.

        5. Surgical issues. In the past, typically, at some point during the surgery, tests were
           done on whether the patient's pain is reduced immediately upon stimulation. If not, then
           leads were never internalized. The Investigators believe that this protocol may have
           reduced success rates needlessly. Acute effects of electrode insertion may have been
           present that prevented immediate benefits of the stimulation. Also, the most benefits
           the Investigators postulate are due to long-term effects of the stimulation. So the
           efficacy of DBS for pain, including SCI pain, may have been greatly underestimated. The
           present study will include patients that do not show an acute benefit immediately after
           surgical electrode implantation.

        6. Safety. DBS has a very low rate of complications, which are mostly correctable.

      Other Authorities

        1. The Granting Agency (DOD), Regulatory Agency (FDA) and Device Manufacturer (waiver from
           Medtronic Corp) have all supported the validity of this study.

        2. The procedure (DBS in PAG/PVG for pain) is currently being used in the United Kingdom,
           Germany, Australia and other countries.
