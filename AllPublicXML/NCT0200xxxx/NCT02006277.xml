  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is intended to evaluate the sensory attributes and estimate the relative
      bioavailability of three prototype oral formulations. Subjects will either taste 75-mg doses
      by &quot;swirl and spit&quot; (Cohort 1) or will receive five oral single 250-mg doses with a washout
      period of at least 14 days (Cohort 2).

    <measure>Area Under the Curve From Time Zero to Extrapolated Infinite Time [AUC (0 - 8)]</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>AUC (0 - 8)= Area under the plasma concentration versus time curve (AUC) from time zero (pre-dose) to extrapolated infinite time (0 - 8). It is obtained from AUC (0 - t) plus AUC (t - 8).</description>

    <measure>Apparent Oral Clearance (CL/F)</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>Clearance of a drug is a measure of the rate at which a drug is metabolized or eliminated by normal biological processes. Clearance obtained after oral dose (apparent oral clearance) is influenced by the fraction of the dose absorbed. Clearance was estimated from population pharmacokinetic (PK) modeling. Drug clearance is a quantitative measure of the rate at which a drug substance is removed from the blood.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Apparent Volume of Distribution (Vz/F)</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>Volume of distribution is defined as the theoretical volume in which the total amount of drug would need to be uniformly distributed to produce the desired plasma concentration of a drug. Apparent volume of distribution after oral dose (Vz/F) is influenced by the fraction absorbed</description>

    <description>This cohort will be an open label, randomized, 5 period, 5 treatment, 4 sequence, cross over single dose bioavailability study employing administration of four crizotinib formulations Treatments E, F, G and H (Crizotinib 250 mg dose Formulated Capsule and 250 mg dose crizotinib as prototypes 0.529 mg/mg, 0.470 mg/mg and 0.420 mg/mg Microspheres, respectively) in the fasted state to healthy adult subjects (Periods 1-4). In addition, Treatment I (250 mg dose of crizotinib OS) will be administered at Period 5, for a taste evaluation only (no pharmacokinetic (PK) sample collection after the dose), in the period immediately following the completion of Period 4 of Cohort 2. A Crizotinib Taste Assessment - Questionnaire for Cohort 2 will be filled by all subjects.</description>
