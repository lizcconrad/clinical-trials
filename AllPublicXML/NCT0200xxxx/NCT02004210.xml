      The aim of this study is to compare the efficacy of conventional transarterial
      chemoembolization(TACE) and transarterial radioembolization in patients with unilobar
      advanced hepatocellular carcinoma.

      Potentially curative treatments for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) include surgical
      resection, liver transplantation, and local ablative therapy.

      However, HCC patients are diagnosed at advanced stages in Korea. Unresectable advanced HCCs
      are not suitable for other curative therapies. For these patients, the optimal treatment
      remains largely controversial. As a palliative treatment, the benefit of transarterial
      chemoembolization (TACE) had been shown in patients with unresectable HCC by several trials.
      Recently,transarterial radioembolization (TARE) has been introduced for the treatment of
      advanced HCC. However, the efficacy of TARE compared to TACE is uncertain.

      The aim of this study is to compare the efficacy of conventional transarterial
      chemoembolization(TACE) and transarterial radioembolization in patients with unilobar
      advanced hepatocellular carcinoma.
