  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether simple, evidence-based clinical screening
      be quickly and feasibly implemented (&gt;85% of patients in an average of &lt;6 minutes) in
      large-volume urgent transient ischemic attack (TIA)/stroke clinics to identify individuals at
      high risk for the three most common and devastating post-stroke co-morbidities (depression,
      obstructive sleep apnea and cognitive disorders).

      We have created a simple screening tool (the &quot;DOC&quot; Screen) that will be routinely applied to
      all patients at a high-volume Regional Stroke Prevention Clinic. Consenting patients will
      also undergo &quot;gold standard&quot; research assessments in order to determine the diagnostic
      characteristics of the screen compared to gold standard research assessments.The proportion
      of eligible patients who complete DOC screening and the time for completion (mean, range,
      standard deviations) will be calculated from aggregated data for all new consults in the
      stroke prevention clinic. For patients who consented to undergo gold standard testing,
      sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value and likelihood
      ratios of the DOC screen will be calculated. Screening cut-points will be optimized using
      Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) and area under the curve analysis, and logistic
      regression will be applied to this ROC Curve analysis to control for variables such as age,
      sex, BMI and education. We hope to develop a pragmatic approach to screening the large,
      high-risk stroke prevention clinic population, allowing broad screening for these important
      health conditions. This could change routine standard of care across stroke prevention
      clinics and facilitate early identification and appropriate assessment of patients.
