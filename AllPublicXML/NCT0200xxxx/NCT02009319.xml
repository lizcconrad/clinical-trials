  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this pilot study is to evaluate EBUS elastography strain ratio in assessment of
      mediastinal lymph nodes in patients with suspicion for lung cancer for the first time. Strain
      ratios of mediastinal lymph nodes will be compared with EBUS B-mode features and with tissue
      diagnosis as a gold standard.

      Evaluation will be performed on consenting consecutive patients at least 18 years old,
      referred to bronchoscopy with suspicion for lung cancer according to chest CT-scan. Eligible
      patients should have either enlarged discrete N2/N3 lymph nodes, or central tumor or enlarged
      N1 lymph nodes with normal mediastinal lymph nodes. Exclusion criteria will be metastatic
      disease, severe co-morbidity that disqualified surgical treatment, mediastinal infiltration
      by tumor and small peripheral lung tumor with normal-sized mediastinal lymph nodes.

      Outcomes: Sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, positive predictive value (PPV) and negative
      predictive value (NPV) for probability of malignant lymph node diagnosis, determined by
      elastography strain ratio. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis will be made to
      display specificity / sensitivity for different strain ratio cut-off values. Area under the
      ROC curve will be calculated.
