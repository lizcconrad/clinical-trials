      This clinical trial studies dietary and exercise interventions in preventing cardiovascular
      disease in younger survivors of childhood cancer. Eating a healthy diet and exercising
      regularly may reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease in younger survivors of childhood
      cancer.

      Participants receive personalized exercise plan and prescription tailored to individual needs
      and current level of activity and fitness, and they also receive 2 one-hour individual
      exercise training sessions consisting of 20-30 minutes cardiovascular activity and strength
      training. Participants receive nutritional education consisting of energy balance,
      appropriate portion sizes, calorie count, and basic nutrition skills such as label reading
      every 2 weeks for 12 weeks.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed for up to 6 months.
