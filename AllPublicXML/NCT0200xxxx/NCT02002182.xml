  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Some cancers may be related to an infection with a virus, such as the Human Papilloma Virus
      (HPV). HPV related Oropharyngeal cancer (HPVOPC) accounts for 80% of oropharynx cancer cases
      in the United States. HPVOPC has better prognosis than patients with HPV negative oropharynx
      cancer. In many hospitals, the standard of care treatment for oropharyngeal cancer is surgery
      and/or radiotherapy with or without chemotherapy. While chances of survival for most patients
      with HPVOPC is very good, current treatments are associated with short- and long-term side
      effects which can be severe. In pre-clinical research using animal models of cancer,
      vaccination targeting the HPV virus has been found to cause tumor regression. Thus,
      approaches which target the unique characteristics of HPV-infected cancer cells, such as
      therapeutic vaccination, are attractive strategies for potentially reducing radiotherapy and
      chemo radiotherapy regimens (and thus decreasing toxicity) and enhancing long-term disease
      control.

      The purpose of this study is to see if an experimental vaccine, ADXS11-001, is effective in
      stimulating the body's defense system against HPV-positive oropharyngeal squamous cell
      carcinoma before transoral (through the mouth) surgery. The experimental product ADXS11-001
      uses a live strain of the Listeria monocytogenes (Lm) bacteria that has been genetically
      modified such that the risk of getting an infection is significantly reduced. Several
      research studies have already been conducted with ADXS11-001 in men and women with cancer. So
      far, approximately 722 doses of ADXS11-001 have been given to 290 patients with HPV
      associated cancers.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an investigator-initiated prospective clinical study of patients with stage I-IV
      squamous cell carcinoma of the oropharynx (OPSCC) who are to undergo ablative transoral
      robotic surgery (TORS).

      There is a vaccination group and a control group in this study.

      Subjects in the control group will not receive the vaccination and will only be followed
      after TORS surgery for additional research blood tests to measure how their immune system is
      working.

      Subjects in the vaccination group will receive two vaccinations prior to surgery. The first
      dose will be about 33 days before surgery, and the second will be about 14 days before
      surgery.

      Participation in this study will also include allowing the research team to take several
      blood samples from the subject at various times before, during, and after treatment for
      his/her cancer.

      Vaccination subjects will be monitored closely after treatment and includes 6 months of oral
      antibiotics.

             contraception (i.e., barrier contraception and one other method of contraception) at
             least 4 weeks prior to study entry, for the duration of study participation, Should a
             woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while participating in this study,
