    <textblock>
      Asthma is a chronic lung condition in children, and often requires hospitalization for acute
      exacerbations. Azithromycin has been used successfully in other chronic lung diseases,
      including cystic fibrosis. Despite limited clinical evidence, some pediatricians use
      azithromycin in children hospitalized with asthma, citing either treatment of atypical
      pathogens or its proposed anti-inflammatory properties. We propose a clinical trial to
      determine if azithromycin will shorten length of stay in children hospitalized with acute
      asthma exacerabations.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Asthma is a chronic lung condition that accounts for over 130,000 pediatric hospitalizations
      nationally at a cost of almost 1.4 billion dollars. The Children's Hospital at Montefiore is
      located in an area with one of the highest asthma rates in the United States: Bronx, New
      York. Atypical pathogens have been implicated both in initiating asthma and triggering acute
      asthma exacerbations. Azithromycin, a macrolide antibiotic, is known to have antibacterial
      activity against atypical pathogens and gram positive bacteria. More recently, macrolides
      have been increasingly used and effective against gram negative bacteria and inflammation in
      the lungs of patients with chronic respiratory illnesses. This effect may be secondary to the
      immunomodulary effects macrolides possess, in addition to their anti-bacterial effects. In
      long-term therapy with macrolides, patients with asthma have shown improved bronchiolar
      hyperreactivity, spirometry, symptoms, and quality of life. However, studies of short-term
      treatment in the acute setting and in children are limited. Some practitioners use
      azithromycin in the treatment of acute asthma, despite limited data.

      The investigators propose a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial of
      azithromycin in children aged 4-12 years with persistent asthma hospitalized with acute
      asthma exacerbations. Children will be enrolled within 12 hours of admission and will be
      randomized to receive three days of either azithromycin or placebo suspension (10mg/kg/dose,
      max of 500mg). The primary outcome measure will be length of stay (LOS). Secondary outcome
      measures will include: days of school/work missed, readmission rates, return to medical care
      rates, recurrence of symptoms, and steroid courses. In the future, patients may also be
      approached to enroll in the &quot;Mechanism Subset Study&quot; a separate pilot and feasibility study
      which will require two blood samples and two nasal aspirate samples and will test for
      atypical pathogens, intraleukin-8 levels, and neutrophil/eosinophil counts. The average
      length of stay for patients in this age range with asthma in 2011 at our institution was 3.0
      days. The investigators will enroll to achieve a power of 80%, with an alpha of 0.05, which
      will require 107 patients in each group to detect a 16 hour (0.67 day) difference in the
      primary outcome, LOS. We hypothesize that azithromycin treatment in children hospitalized
      with acute asthma will decrease LOS.
