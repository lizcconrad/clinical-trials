  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the effect of thin fluid with starch versus thin
      fluid without starch on coagulation in elective surgery when the patient is normovolæmic
      during operation.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary goal is to register coagulation on basis of blood samples inclusive
      thromboelastography results.

      The secondary goal is to register blood loss and use of blood products during operation.

      The trial concerns 40 patients.
