  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Intervention studying the effect of a low-carbohydrate/high-fat (LCHF) diet as well as on
      bout of exercise in combination with either a normal diet or a LCHF diet, in relation to
      glucose metabolism, insulin sensitivity, lipid profile and body composition.

    <description>LCHF diet for 3 weeks, where E% 70 fat, E% 20-25 proteins and 20g or less carbohydrates. Oral glucose tolerance test on the morning of day 21 followed by a bout of exercise in the afternoon (indoor bicycle, 60min at 75% HFpeak). The following morning (day 22) a new oral glucose tolerance test. Oral glucose tolerance test results from pre-tests used to determine the effect of LCHF and a bout of exercise on insulin sensitivity.</description>

    <description>Low-carbohydrate/high-fat diet; effect on insulin sensitivity, lipid profile, weight and body composition. Participants ingested LCHF diet for three weeks before undergoing an oral glucose tolerance test. The same afternoon the participated in an one hour indoor bicycle training at 75% at HFpeak. The following morning they underwent a new oral glucose tolerance test. Body composition and weight were measured before and after the intervention. Oral glucose tolerance test was also performed before the intervention for baseline. Blood samples were collected before and after the intervention for lipid profile analyses.</description>
