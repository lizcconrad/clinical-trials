  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To develop a real-time diagnostic technique with Virosensor for Enterovirus 71 and Influenza
      Virus detection, the investigators conduct a prospective clinical study. In comparison with
      results from direct sequencing of Enterovirus 71 and Influenza Virus, the investigators
      evaluate the performance of virosensor , including reproducibility, sensitivity, specificity,
      and cross-reaction. The potential factors which may interfere with the results would be
      investigated. With such technique, the investigators hope to make early diagnosis and give
      Enterovirus 71 and Influenza Virus patients early treatment to reduce the complications and
      case-fatality rate.

      1. Sample acquirement： At National Taiwan University Hospital in Taiwan, we will enroll
           patients who have influenza-like illness or enterovirus infection . We will take three
           throat swabs for each patient: one for viral isolation, one for RT-PCR and the last for
           the Virosensor - based real-time diagnosis.

        2. Virosensor diagnosis： Virosensor (structural chip-based optosensing virus probing
           system), which is for the rapid and sensitive detection of viral antigen in medical
           samples, will be used for analyzing the interaction kinetics between
           anti-influenza-virus (or anti-Enterovirus 71-virus) and its influenza virus antigen (or
           Enterovirus 71 antigen) present in patients'and normal samples.

        3. Gold standard： viral isolation and RT-PCR

    <description>virosensor, which was developed for the rapid and sensitive detection of viral antigen in medical samples, will be used for analyzing the interaction kinetics between anti-influenza-virus (or anti-EV71-virus) and its influenza virus antigen (or EV71 antigen) present in patients and normal samples.
The system incorporates the use of chip formats. In antibody probing, antibodies are bound as a suitable probe, which specifically and selectively binds targeted molecules (virus antigen) in the test specimens.</description>
