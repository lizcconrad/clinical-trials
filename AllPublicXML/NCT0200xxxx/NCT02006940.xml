  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is devoted to the comparative analysis of the data received in patients with lung
      pathology using new method of probe-based confocal laser endoscopy of distal airways and two
      reference methods: high resolution computed tomography and morphology.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A relatively new technology in pulmonary medicine, probe-based confocal laser endomicroscopy
      of distal airways, which is also called alveoscopy, allows for real-time minimally invasive
      intraacinar imaging. This method has been developed that special miniprobe can be passed into
      the distal airway via the working channel of the bronchoscope and provide so called &quot;optical
      biopsy&quot;. The method is based on the natural autofluorescence of pulmonary structures,
      detecting the elastin scaffold of central and peripheral airways, the structure of alveoli,
      blood vessels and alveolar macrophages. Taking into account the fact that in vivo
      endomicroscopy of distal airways is a novel diagnostic technique it needs correlating the
      obtained data at certain disease with the reference methods for the challenges of our current
      understanding of interpreting endomicroscopic images. We choose high resolution computed
      tomography and morphology as such reference methods.

    <description>pCLE images will be assessed morphometrically. Such criteria as quantity of alveolar macrophages, quantity of floating intraalveolar substances etc. will be measured using 6-point score, where zero means the absence of the symptom and 5 - the maximal expressiveness. Thickness of interalveolar septum, diameter of microvessels and thickness of elastic fibers will be measured using special tool with the included software for endomicroscopic system. Radiologic signs e.g. low-density areas and consolidation areas will be assessed in Hounsfield Units. Other radiologic signs e.g. ground-glass opacity, crazy paving patterns etc. will be measured by 6-point scale, the same as for pCLE images. Morphological analysis of the lung tissue specimens (received as a result of transbronchial biopsy) will be made according to the structures in pCLE images for 20 fields of view.</description>
