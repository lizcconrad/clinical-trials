    <textblock>
      This is a study to determine the safety and effectiveness of BKM120 plus capecitabine in
      breast cancer patients with brain metastases.

      Both capecitabine and BMK120 have previously shown activity in patients with breast cancer.
      Like capecitabine, BMK120 is also effective in crossing the blood brain barrier making it a
      preferred candidate for its evaluation in patients with metastatic breast cancer (MBC).

      This is a Phase 2, multicenter, single-arm study to determine the safety and efficacy of
      BKM120 plus capecitabine in breast cancer patients with brain metastases. 40 patients will be
      included, who have either ER+/HER2-, HER2+ or triple negative breast cancer..

      The Graded Prognostic Assessment (GPA) is a recently developed, validated prognostic score
      for patients with brain metastases. The Graded Prognostic Assessment will be utilized to
      evaluate efficacy in this clinical study.

      Capecitabine is a prodrug which is enzymatically converted to 5-fluorouracil in its tumor
      target where it inhibits DNA synthesis and slows tumor growth. It is currently FDA approved
      for both colorectal and breast cancer. BMK120 is a pan phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase
      inhibitor being developed under IND# 102,823 by Novartis Corporation. As of September 2012
      over 600 patients had been enrolled in fourteen separate Novartis sponsored monotherapy or
      combination therapy clinical studies of BMK120.

      Phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K) signaling regulates diverse cellular functions including
      cell proliferation, survival, translational regulation of protein synthesis, glucose
      metabolism, cell migration, and angiogenesis. PI3K signaling also serves a central role in
      the pathogenesis of numerous cancers.

      Constitutive activation of PI3K signaling is known to be a critical step in mediating the
      transforming potential of oncogenes and tumor suppressors in many tumor types. Resistance to
      a variety of therapeutic interventions, including hormonal therapy, anti-HER2 therapies and
      chemotherapy can also be linked to constitutive activation of the PI3K pathway.

      Preliminary data suggest that activation of the PI3K pathway is a predictor of a poor
      prognostic outcome in many cancer types. Thus, as a pan-PI3K inhibitor, BMK120 may provide a
      therapeutic benefit to patients with MBC. Both capecitabine and BMK120 have previously shown
      activity in patients with MBC. Like capecitabine, BMK120 is also effective in crossing the
      blood brain barrier making it a preferred candidate for its evaluation in patients with MBC.

      Trastuzumab is a monoclonal antibody that targets the HER2 receptor which is overexpressed or
      amplified in approximately 20-25% of breast cancers. The clinical benefit of trastuzumab in
      women with metastatic breast cancer has been demonstrated in two pivotal studies.

      Current clinical experience with BMK120 has shown that its most frequent adverse events (AEs)
      include fatigue, decreased appetite, diarrhea, hyperglycemia, nausea, rash and mood
      alteration disorders. Therefore patients will be closely monitored for fasting plasma glucose
      (FPG) HbA1c, and insulin C-peptide. Patients will also be frequently and routinely evaluated
      for mood disorders and disturbances. The remaining most frequent AEs will be detected by
      regular, frequent monitoring with symptomatic treatment to be provided as required.

                  least 12 consecutive months (i.e., who has had menses any time in the preceding

                  prior to initiating treatment.

               -  Note: Women are considered post-menopausal and not of child bearing potential if
                  they have had 12 months of natural (spontaneous) amenorrhea with an appropriate
                  clinical profile (e.g. age appropriate, history of vasomotor symptoms) or six
                  months of spontaneous amenorrhea with serum FSH levels &gt; 40 mIU/mL [for US only:
                  and estradiol &lt; 20 pg/mL] or have had surgical bilateral oophorectomy (with or
                  without hysterectomy) at least six weeks ago. In the case of oophorectomy alone,
                  only when the reproductive status of the woman has been confirmed by follow up
                  hormone level assessment is she considered not of child bearing potential.

               -  Note: Women of child-bearing potential, defined as all women physiologically
                  capable of becoming pregnant, must use highly effective contraception during
                  treatment for 4 weeks (5 T1/2) after stopping treatment. The highly effective
                  contraception is defined as either:

                  i. True abstinence: When this is in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle
                  of the subject. Periodic abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulation, symptothermal,
                  post-ovulation methods) and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of
                  contraception.

             ii. Sterilization: have had surgical bilateral oophorectomy (with or without
             hysterectomy) or tubal ligation at least six weeks ago. In case of oophorectomy alone,
             only when the reproductive status of the woman has been confirmed by follow up hormone
             level assessment.

             iii. Male partner sterilization (with the appropriate post-vasectomy documentation of
             the absence of sperm in the ejaculate). For female subjects on the study, the
             vasectomised male partner should be the sole partner for that patient.

             iv. Use of a combination of any two of the following (a+b):

               1. Placement of an intrauterine device (IUD) or intrauterine system (IUS)

               2. Barrier methods of contraception: Condom or Occlusive cap (diaphragm or
                  cervical/vault caps) with spermicidal foam/gel/film/cream/vaginal suppository

                    -  Oral contraception, injected or implanted hormonal methods are not allowed
                       as BKM120 potentially decreases the effectiveness of hormonal
                       contraceptives.

         25. Patient has known diagnosis of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection

         26. Patient has history of another malignancy within 5 years, except cured basal cell
             carcinoma of the skin or excised carcinoma in situ of the cervix

         27. Patient is unable or unwilling to abide by the study protocol or cooperate fully with
             the investigator

         28. Patient is concurrently using other approved or investigational antineoplastic agent.

         29. Patient taking or needing enzyme-inducing anti-epileptic medication.

         30. Patient has an acute viral hepatitis or a history of chronic or active HBV or HCV
             infection
