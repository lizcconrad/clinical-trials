    <intervention_name>Continuous thoracic epidural infusions</intervention_name>
    <description>Continuous thoracic epidural infusions (TE) involves continuous infusion of drugs through a catheter placed into the epidural space, resulting in a loss of sensation—including the sensation of pain—by blocking the transmission of signals through nerve fibers in or near the spinal cord.</description>

    <description>Continuous paravertebral blockade (PVB) is the technique of injecting local anesthetic adjacent to the thoracic vertebra that anesthetizes the spinal nerve roots after they exit the spinal canal.</description>
