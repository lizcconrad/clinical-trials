  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The focus of this work is to explore the use of modern mobile technology to enable people
      with Alzheimer's disease to improve their abilities to perform activities of daily living and
      hence to promote independence and participation in social activities. This work also aims at
      reducing the burden on caregivers by increasing the AD patients' sense of competence and
      ability to handle behavior problems.

      The investigators developed ADcope, an integrated application that includes several modules
      that target individuals with Alzheimer's disease , using mobile devices. The investigators
      developed two different user interfaces: a text-based and a graphic-based. To evaluate the
      usability of the application, participants with early stages of AD were asked to run the two
      user interfaces of the spaced retrieval memory exercise using a tablet mobile device.
