  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      More than 5 million persons in France exposed, in last years, to the taking of the
      Benfluorex.

      Arisen, at certain patients, of a valvulopathy characterized by mitrals and/or aortic leaks
      Withdrawal of the French market: nov. 2009 Only a percentage limited by exposed patients
      developed a severe valvulopathy (1/1000), whereas on the contrary, many patients were exposed
      during years without developing the slightest anomaly.

      The hypothesis is the existence of a particular genetic susceptibility at the patients having
      developed a valvulopathy continuation in the exposure in this medicine.

      Existence of one varying genetics with strong effect. The purpose is to identify involved
      genetic factors.

        Inclusion Criteria of the cases :

          -  Individual presenting a typical medicinal valvulopathy defined by:

          -  A previous exposure of at least 6 months in the benfluorex or occasional exposure
             accepted about is the posology. The preliminary exposure in the dexfenfluramine or in
             the fenfluramine is authorized.

          -  A picture board of insufficiency mitral restrictive and/or aortic restrictive (in
             echocardiography) typical of a medicinal achievement, a gravity (rank I - IV), without
             cause associated of valvulopathy with compatible macroscopic and histological aspect
             (for the operated patients).

          -  Individual followed in one of the sites of study or recruited via associations AVIM
             and CADUS.

          -  Individual of Caucasian origin

          -  Individual having signed the form of specific consent for the study individual .

        Inclusion criteria of witnesses :

          -  Individual presenting an exposure previous to the benfluorex superior or equal to the
             equivalent of 2 years of treatment in 3 tablets a day and pursued to 2 years preceding
             the realization of a cardiac echography of screening. The preliminary exposure in the
             dexfenfluramine or in the fenfluramine is authorized.

          -  Individual presenting a strictly normal cardiac echography in particular: absence of
             valvulopathy significant, of morphological valvular anomaly (event without echography)
             and of valvular, including &quot;trivial&quot; leak at the aortic level. The mitrals micro leaks
             &quot;physiological&quot; are accepted.

          -  Individual having been seen for screening in one of the sites of study or in in French
             firms cardilogie which cardiologists are members of the French Society of Cardiologyor
             or having been included in the forward-looking study coordinated by Pr. TRIBOUILLOY
             (which the objective is to compare the echography data of a group of patients having
             been treated at least 3 months in the benfluorex and with a group of patients
             diabetics having never received this medicine).

          -  Individual of Caucasian origin.

          -  Individual having signed the form of specific consent for the study

        Exclusion criteria of the cases:

          -  Individual presenting another associated heart disorder.

          -  Individual having been exposed to another agonists of the receivers 5-HT2B such as the
             pergolide, the cabergoline, the lisuride, the quibbled by-products or the ecstasy.

          -  Individual having explicitly refused to participate in the study.

        Exclusion criteria of witnesses :

        - Individual having explicitly refused to participate in the study.
