  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A cooperation agreement between the Ministry of Health (MOH) of Kyrgyz Republic and WHO-EURO
      was established, for the implementation of a WHO Project to improve the quality of pediatric
      care in the referral hospitals. The pilot regions selected for this intervention are the
      three northern regions of Thalas, Chiu and Issik-Kul Region in Kyrgyz Republic. The MOH
      project will be implemented at a first stage in a group of 10 pilot hospitals, randomly
      selected among the existing hospitals in the above cited regions. Pilot Hospitals will be
      compared to &quot;control hospitals&quot;, which are the hospitals in the region not receiving the
      intervention, using a pre-defined set of indicators of quality of care. The results of the
      present evaluation on the pilot hospitals will provide data that will inform the MOH on how
      better to scale up this project at a national scale.

    <description>Quality of Care will be measured using 10 pre-defined indicators
Inappropriate hospitalisation (i.e. versus WHO standards)
Increased risk of iatrogenic adverse effects (i.e unnecessary poly-therapy, compared to WHO standards)
Unnecessary pain (i.e. unnecessary injections or other invasive procedures, as compared to WHO standards)
Incorrect Diagnosis (i.e. versus WHO standards)
Incorrect Treatment (i.e. versus WHO standards)
Inconsistency between diagnosis and treatment (i.e. versus WHO standards)
Inadequate Monitoring: (i.e. versus WHO standards)
Lack of nutritional evaluation (i.e. versus WHO standards)
Incorrect use of IV fluids (i.e. versus WHO standards)</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  The study will evaluate Quality of Care delivered to children at hospital level. This
             will be assessed by a direct review of patients' charts, in comparison with
             pre-defined standard. At the hospital level children's charts will be randomly chosen
             among children 2 months to 59 months, hospitalized with common diseases, such as acute
             respiratory diseases, diarrhoea, and fever.
