  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Peritoneal infection is still a frequent complication in peritoneal dialysis patients . In
      France, It contributes to the technique failure, responsible for about 20% of cases of
      transfer in hemodialysis. The risk of direct mortality is estimated at 1 to 6% according to
      studies. Peritoneal infection is involved in the dysfunction of the peritoneal membrane.

      Based on the recommendations of the International Society for Peritoneal Dialysis, the
      intraperitoneal route is preferentially recommended. For many antibiotics, pharmacokinetics
      (intravenous and intraperitoneal) was studied and protocols for IP administration were
      validated.

      Daptomycin, is a cyclic lipopeptide natural, active only on Gram-positive bacteria. It is
      presented as an alternative to vancomycin in infections resistant pathogens. The stability of
      daptomycin in peritoneal dialysis fluids (PDF) has been tested, and antimicrobial activity as
      well.

      Seven patients were treated with daptomycin intraperitoneally successfully. But no study has
      reported pharmacokinetics of daptomycin via the IP route. We propose a pharmacokinetic study
      of daptomycin administered intraperitoneally in 12 patients on CAPD and with Gram-positive
      peritoneal infection.

      Methodology:

      Prospective, open-label, non-randomized pharmacokinetic study. Daptomycin will be given IP in
      the CAPD fluid (200mg in 2L Nutrineal) once daily, in a 6 hours-dwell time. The process of
      dialysis is done four times per day : three during the day (6,6,and 4 h) and one time at
      night (8h). Duration of treatment depends on bacteria identified (14 or 21 days).

      Analyses will be performed on data from all patients meeting the criteria for inclusion and
      exclusion.

      For each patient, plasma, dialysate and urine kinetics will be studied.

      For each parameter, mean and standard deviation are calculated.

      Number of centers &amp; patients:

      One center, twelve patients.

      Sample size justification:

      This is an observational pharmacokinetic study of consecutive PD patients presenting to Caen
      University Hospital with peritoneal infection and who meet inclusion criterias over one year.

      Population: CAPD patients with a Gram positive peritoneal infection
