      The objective is to test the effectiveness of a village-led microfinance program, Pigs for
      Peace, on health, household economic stability, and reintegration of trauma survivors to
      family and community.

      The five-year experimental trial will use mixed-methods to address the following aims:

        1. Determine the effectiveness of a village-led microfinance program on participants health
           and reintegration in intervention households compared to participants in delayed control
           households. Health and reintegration will be measured at baseline and six, twelve, and
           18-months post-baseline using self-report in both intervention and delayed control
           groups. We hypothesize that at six, twelve and 18 months post-baseline participants in
           intervention households will have improved health and increased reintegration to
           families in comparison to participants in control households.

        2. Determine the effectiveness of a village-led microfinance program on household economic
           stability in intervention households compared to delayed control villages. Household
           economic stability will be measured at baseline and six, twelve and 18 months post-
           baseline using self-report in both intervention and control households. We hypothesize
           that at six, twelve and 18-months post-baseline the intervention households will have
           improved household economic stability in comparison to control households.

        3. Examine the role of a village-led microfinance program on village-level health,
           economics, stigma and reintegration of survivors and their families in intervention and
           delayed control villages. Village members (n=5 in each village, n=50 total) will
           complete a baseline and 18 month post-baseline qualitative interview to examine the role
           of microfinance on village-level health, economics, stigma and reintegration in both
           intervention and control households.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Mobutu Sese Seko's government of &quot;Kleptocracy&quot; collapsed in 1997 after 30 years of
      oppression. The new nation that emerged, the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), remains an
      all-to-potent reminder of how human rights violations, and their related health and economic
      impacts, can devastate individuals, families and communities. The genocide in neighboring
      Rwanda, coupled with the collapse of the Mobutu government, has spawned two wars and over a
      decade of warfare throughout the region, resulting in millions of deaths in what is the
      deadliest conflict since World War II 1. The last decade has seen the use of rape as a weapon
      of war in the DRC, where rebels and soldiers subject women, men and children to brutalizing
      attacks, rape, torture, and mutilation. Survivors of the assault are often further
      traumatized by infections, disease, poverty, stigma and social isolation.

      The US plays a significant role in global health. It is both the largest funder of innovation
      in global health and the largest donor to care and support programs in sub-Saharan
      Africaâ€”notably through The US President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) and
      responses to humanitarian crisis, such as USAID funded programs in DRC. The effectiveness and
      sustainability of these efforts are limited by gaps in knowledge of the role of social
      determinants, such as poverty, social isolation, chronic stress and trauma, and limited
      access to health care services has on the health of women and families. To begin to address
      these gaps, our overall goal is to build the science base for large-scale implementation of
      economic programs to improve the health of survivors of trauma living in man-made and natural
      disaster settings.

    <description>10 villages in rural South Kivu province of DRC will be selected for participation. Sixty-100 households in each village will then be randomized to intervention (receive 1st loan pig) and delayed control (receive offspring from loan pig) groups.
Outcome will be measured in both intervention and control villages.
Measurement of outcome will use self-report by participating household member.
An eligible participant is an adult head of household at least 16 years or older.</description>
