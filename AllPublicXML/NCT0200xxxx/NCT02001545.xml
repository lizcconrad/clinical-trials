      RE-ACT is a national, multi-centre, observational, prospective, longitudinal cohort study
      which will include patients hospitalized for ACS within 24 hours of symptom onset and who
      have a final diagnosis of ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) or
      non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI). This study aims to describe the
      short-term (at the end of the first month after index event) antithrombotic management
      patterns in a &quot;real-life&quot; setting for patients hospitalized with an acute coronary syndrome.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Provision of subject informed consent

          -  Patients hospitalized and diagnosed with STEMI or NSTEMI

          -  Hospitalized within 24 hours of onset of symptoms or transferred from another hospital
             within 24 hours of the onset of symptoms

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  STEMI and NSTEMI precipitated by or as a complication of surgery, trauma, or GI
             bleeding or post-PCI.

          -  STEMI and NSTEMI occurring in patients already hospitalized for other reasons.

          -  Presence of any condition/circumstance which in the opinion of the investigator could
             significantly limit the complete follow up of the patient (e.g. tourist, non-native
             speaker or does not understand the local language, psychiatric disturbances).
