  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective is to assess whether prostatic artery embolization has a similar
      efficacy and safety profile as GreenLight PVP in treating patients with urinary retention
      secondary to benign prostate hyperplasia (BPH). Subjects who consent will be randomized to
      either the Prostate embolization (PAE) arm or to the GreenLight PVP arm.

      The primary endpoint of efficacy of the procedure is measured by the ability of the patient
      to void. The secondary endpoints recorded will include patients' satisfaction measured by
      International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS), peak flow rate (Qmax) and post-void residual
      urine volume (PVR) and prostate specific antigen (PSA) will be measured at 3, 6, and 12
      months post treatment. Also, reduction in prostate volume is considered by MRI
      preoperatively, 3 months and 12 months.

      The primary objective is to assess whether prostatic artery embolization has a similar
      efficacy and safety profile compared to GreenLight PVP in treating patients with urinary
      retention secondary to benign prostate hyperplasia (BPH) that have failed medical management.

      The target population is composed of subjects referred to the urology department for
      treatment of BPH who have failed medical treatment, who present with permanent bladder
      catheterization and who meet the eligibility criteria.

      Subjects who consent will be randomized to either the Prostate embolization (PAE) arm or to
      the GreenLight PVP arm.

      The primary endpoint of efficacy of the procedure is measured by the successful removal of
      bladder catheter and ability of the patient to void. As well, the secondary endpoints
      recorded will be: International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS), peak flow rate (Qmax) and
      post-void residual urine volume (PVP) and prostate specific antigen (PSA) will be measured at
      3, 6, and 12 months post treatment. Trans-rectal ultrasound (TRUS) will be performed for
      measurement of prostate volume for the stratified randomization process. All adverse events
      will be captured and analyzed. MRI will be performed preoperatively, 3 months and 12 months.
      Hospital stays after the procedures will not be considered serious adverse events, unless a
      hospital admission occurs because of a complication of the treatment performed.

    <description>The KTP:YAG laser is based on the principle of passing Nd:YAG laser light through a KTP crystal. This halves the wavelength of the emitted laser to 532 nm and doubles its frequency. The emitted light is a visible green light, which is strongly absorbed by red tissues and hemoglobin; this renders a blood rich organ such as the prostate gland to be an excellent target. Prostate tissue is vaporized leaving an appropriate cavity for voiding.</description>

    <description>Prostatic artery embolization consists of gaining access into the patients arterial system via a common femoral artery puncture using a small needle and sheath. Once the access is established, a micro-catheter is navigated through the arterial system using X-ray guidance into the arteries feeding the prostate. There, small polyvynil alcohol plastic beads are injected to block the blood flow to the prostate. By doing so, the prostate undergoes an ischemic injury and there is reduction in gland size and relief of obstructive symtpoms.</description>

    <description>The green light laser has a wavelength of 532 nm which is strongly absorbed by red tissues and hemoglobin; this renders a blood rich organ such as the prostate gland to be an excellent target. The procedure uses the technology of high-powered laser light combined with fiber optics to vaporize the overgrowth of prostate cells quickly and accurately. As the surgeon directs the laser at the prostate, the intense pulses of light emitted from the fiber are absorbed by the blood. Within moments, the temperature of the blood becomes so great it causes the nearby cells to vaporize. Once the procedure is completed, patients have immediate post-operative symptom relief and dramatic improvements in symptoms, urinary flow rates, and bladder emptying.</description>
