      NETs formation in vaso-occlusive events in sickle cell disease and the role of hydroxyurea
      treatment.The study hypothesis is that NETs formation by neutrophils has a role in the
      induction of vaso occlusive disease in blood vessels. It is possible that high leukocyte
      count in children with sickle cell anemia is a bad prognostic sign due to NETs formation
      supporting occlusion of peripheral and central blood vessels.Hydroxyurea treatment might
      prevent vaso occlusive syndrome not only by increasing HbF but also by decreasing neutrophil
      count and inhibiting NETs formation.
