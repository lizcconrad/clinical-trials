    <textblock>
      This clinical trial is a double-blind, randomized, within-subject controlled, 2-armed,
      single-center study sponsored by SciVision Biotech Inc. and approved by National Taiwan
      University Hospital Research Ethics Committee. The aim of this post-marketing study is to
      evaluate the safety and efficacy of Hya-Dermis mixed with lidocaine, as well as the
      effectiveness of corrections of Hya-Dermis mixed with lidocaine. Accounting for potential
      loss to follow-up, the minimum enrollment was statistically determined to be 40 patients.

      The study was estimated to be held one and half year including a 0-2 weeks screening period,
      a day of treatment, and follow-up at month 1, 3, 6, 9, 12. Patient informed consent forms
      will be obtained before the treatment. A pre-treatment photograph, nasolabial folds (NLF)
      severity scale scores, and individual aesthetic satisfaction will be the baseline. Two sets
      of randomized numbers are used, patient numbers and treatment numbers. Participants with odd
      patient numbers will be assigned to nasolabial group and those with even patient numbers will
      be assigned to nasolabial&amp;cheekbone group. Participants receive experiment treatment
      (Hya-Dermis mixed with lidocaine) in one side and control treatment (Hya-Dermis mixed with
      normal saline) in the other side of the face randomly depending on the treatment numbers.
      Both physicians and participants are only blind to the treatment assignment. 30 minutes after
      the injection, a post-photograph will be used to evaluate NLF severity scale scores and
      global aesthetic improvement scale (GAIS) by physicians. A questionnaire including the Visual
      Analog Scale (VAS) of pain during the treatment and individual aesthetic satisfaction will be
      collected from patients. The effectiveness analyses compare NLF severity scale scores and
      GAIS based on photograph records from physicians, as well as participant questionnaires for
      each group on every visit. The safety assessment evaluates any recorded adverse events
      following the device treatment.

    <description>A quantification of the severity of pain experienced by individuals during the treatments. A scale of 100 mm horizontal line will be labeled by participants to assess pain on both sides of the injected areas 30 minutes after the treatment. The one on the extreme left (0) represents painless while the one on the extreme right (100) is set as the most pain could be imagined by participants.</description>

    <description>Any adverse events and abnormal physical parameters or reports occurred and disappeared should be monitored throughout the trial. The records should be assessed and keep on track of the severity of individual adverse events and correlation with the treatment.
Severity assessment:
To assess the level of severity by rating 0 (none), 1 (mild), 2 (median), and 3 (sever).
Correlation assessment:
Physicians evaluate the impact of adverse events for each individual and determine their causality of the treatment. Based on the correlation with the treatment, giving score 0 (no correlated), 1 (low correlated), 2 (suspected correlated), 3 (most likely correlated).
Adverse events tracking:
Any adverse events should be reported to the physicians by participants. Physicians keep following up adverse events experienced participants until the event disappeared or the symptoms stabilized.</description>

A validated 8-point photographic scale scored the severity grade from 0 (absent) to 7 (extreme) will be used to assess the severity of NLF at baseline, 30 minutes post-treatment, and every follow-up at 1, 3, 6, 9, 12 months.</description>
