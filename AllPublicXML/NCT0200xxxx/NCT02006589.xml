  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This will be an open-label, randomized, single dose, two-way crossover study. Each subject
      will participate in both treatment periods and will receive single oral doses of candesartan
      cilexetil (GW615775) and reference candesartan cilexetil (ATACANDâ„¢); the treatment periods
      will be separated by a washout period of at least 7 days and no greater than 14 days. This
      study aims to determine the relative bioavailability of an 8mg test formulation tablet of
      candesartan cilexetil (GW615775) compared to an 8mg reference tablet of candesartan cilexetil
      in healthy adult subjects. ATACAND is a registered trademark of the AstraZeneca group of
      companies.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Male and females aged between 18 and 65 years of age inclusive, at the time of signing
             the informed consent.

          -  Healthy as determined by a responsible and experienced physician, based on a medical
             evaluation including medical history, physical examination, laboratory tests and
             cardiac monitoring. A subject with a clinical abnormality or laboratory parameter(s)
             which is/are not specifically listed in the inclusion or exclusion criteria, outside
             the reference range for the population being studied may be included only if the
             Investigator in consultation with the GSK Medical Monitor if required agree and
             document that the finding is unlikely to introduce additional risk factors and will
             not interfere with the study procedures.

          -  Body weight &gt;= 50kg and body mass index within the range 19 - 24.9 kilogram per square
             meter (kg/m^2) (inclusive).

             defined as pre-menopausal females with a documented tubal ligation or hysterectomy for
             this definition, &quot;documented&quot; refers to the outcome of the investigator's/designee's
             review of the subject's medical history for study eligibility, as obtained via a
             verbal interview with the subject or from the subject's medical records; or
             postmenopausal defined as 12 months of spontaneous amenorrhea in questionable cases a
             blood sample with simultaneous follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) &gt; 40
             milli-international units (MIU) per milliliter (mL) and estradiol &lt;40 pigogram per mL
             (pg/mL) (&lt;147 picomole per liter) is confirmatory. Females on hormone replacement
             therapy (HRT) and whose menopausal status is in doubt will be required to use one of
             the contraception methods in protocol if they wish to continue their HRT during the
             study. Otherwise, they must discontinue HRT to allow confirmation of post-menopausal
             status prior to study enrollment. For most forms of HRT, at least 2-4 weeks will
             elapse between the cessation of therapy and the blood draw; this interval depends on
             the type and dosage of HRT. Following confirmation of their post-menopausal status,
             they can resume use of HRT during the study without use of a contraceptive method;

             human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) test at screening or prior to dosing and Agrees to
             use one of the contraception methods listed in Protocol for an appropriate period of
             time (as determined by the product label or investigator) prior to the start of dosing
             to sufficiently minimize the risk of pregnancy at that point. Female subjects must
             agree to use contraception until the follow-up contact visit.or has only same-sex
             partners, when this is her preferred and usual lifestyle.

          -  Male subjects with female partners of child-bearing potential must agree to use one of
             the contraception methods listed in Protocol. This criterion must be followed from the
             time of the first dose of study medication until the follow-up contact visit.

             in excess of 500 mL within a 90 day period.

          -  Lactating females.

          -  The subject has participated in a clinical trial and has received an investigational
             product within the following time period prior to the first dosing day in the current
             study: 90 days, 5 half-lives or twice the duration of the biological effect of the
             investigational product (whichever is longer).
