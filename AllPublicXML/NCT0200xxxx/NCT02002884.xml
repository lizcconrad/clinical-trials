  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether injections of Botulinum toxin type A into
      muscles of one or both arms alone or in combination with injections into one or both legs are
      effective and safe in treating children/adolescents (age 2-17 years) with increased muscle
      tension/uncontrollable muscle stiffness (spasticity) due to cerebral palsy.

    <time_frame>Baseline to week 4</time_frame>
    <description>Primary clinical target pattern is defined by the investigator. The AS is a well known and commonly used scale in clinical trials with spasticity. In spastic muscles the resistance to passive movement is assessed. It is a 5-point scale that ranges from 0 (=no increase in tone) to 4 (=limb rigid in flexion or extension).</description>

    <measure>Investigator's Global Impression of Change Scale (GICS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 4</time_frame>
    <description>This is a co-primary outcome measure. The GICS is used to measure the investigator's impression of change due to treatment. The response option is a common 7-point Likert scale that ranges from -3 = very much worse to +3 = very much improved.</description>
