  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To develop a real-time diagnostic technique with Ad sensor for Adenovirus detection, the
      investigators conduct a prospective clinical study. In comparison with results from direct
      sequencing of Adenovirus, the investigators evaluate the performance of Ad sensor , including
      reproducibility, sensitivity, specificity, and cross-reaction. The potential factors which
      may interfere with the results would be investigated. With such technique, the investigators
      hope to make early diagnosis and give Adenovirus patients early treatment to reduce the
      complications and case-fatality rate.

      1. Sample acquirement： At National Taiwan University Hospital in Taiwan, we will enroll
           patients who have Adenovirus infection . We will take three throat swabs for each
           patient: one for viral isolation, one for RT-PCR and the last for the Ad sensor - based
           real-time diagnosis.

        2. Ad sensor diagnosis： Ad sensor (structural chip-based optosensing virus probing system),
           which is for the rapid and sensitive detection of viral antigen in medical samples, will
           be used for analyzing the interaction kinetics between anti-Adenovirus and its
           Adenovirus antigen present in patients'and normal samples.

        3. Gold standard： viral isolation and RT-PCR

    <description>Ad sensor, which was developed for the rapid and sensitive detection of viral antigen in medical samples, will be used for analyzing the interaction kinetics between anti-Adenovirus and its Adenovirus antigen present in patients and normal samples.
The system incorporates the use of chip formats. In antibody probing, antibodies are bound as a suitable probe, which specifically and selectively binds targeted molecules (virus antigen) in the test specimens.</description>
