  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In patient who are predicted to be difficult to intubate with a standard direct laryngoscope
      well use flexible optical intubation via a supraglottic airway devise (the Ambu Aura-i).
      Patients are randomly assigner to a single- or a multiple- use flexible optical scope.

      We hypothesize that intubation is obtained equally effective with both types of flexible
      scopes

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  ASA physical status 1-3 and evaluated pre-operatively and found suitable for tracheal
             intubation with a flexible optical scope via the SAD and scheduled for elective
             surgery/anesthesia and are conscious about their rights and consequences of
             participating in the study.

          -  The patient must have one or two of the following predictors of difficult tracheal
             intubation:

               1. Modified Mallampati score &gt; 2 (= &quot;no parts of the Uvula is visible&quot;)

               2. a thyromental distance of less then or equal to 6.5 cms

               3. Combined movement in head and neck &lt; 90 degrees

               4. Mouth-opening less the 4 cm (but must be larger then 2.5 cm)

               5. Inability to protrude the teeth n the lower jaw beyond the upper incisors

               6. BMI &gt; 40 combined with a neck-circumference &gt; 43 cms

               7. Upper-lip-bite-test &gt; 2

               8. Previous difficult intubation or laryngoscopy (If more then two criteria are
                  fulfilled the patient should be considered intubated awake instead. . But the
                  upper-lip-bite-test and the prognation-beyond the incisors test represents a
                  similar thing, namely the inability to sub-luxate the lower jaw, the if both
                  these findings are positive it is only considered as counting for one.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  ASA physical status 4 or 5

          -  contraindications for use of the SAD

          -  Patients in whom intubation via a SAD has previously failed

          -  Patients at risk of aspiration from the gastrointestinal channel

          -  diseases in mouth, pharynx or larynx that precludes the use of a SAD

          -  Patients in whom the cricothyroid membrane cannot be localized preanaesthetically

          -  Patients in whom the doctor making the pre-anaesthetic evaluation finds in need of an
             awake intubation

          -  Patients with possible Creutzfeldt-Jacobs disease or contraindication against the use
             of non-autoclavable equipment r risk of cross contamination with prions
