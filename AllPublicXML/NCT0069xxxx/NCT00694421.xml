      This study will test the hypothesis that constitutionally poorer Eustachian tube function
      predisposes to middle-ear pathology during a viral upper respiratory infection.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The most well supported immediate cause of Otitis media (OM) is a pre-existing or concurrent
      viral upper respiratory tract infection (vURI). However, not all vURI episodes cause OM and a
      variety of predisposing factors has been suggested to explain this selectivity. Based on our
      preliminary work using a model of experimental viral infections in adults, we hypothesize
      that the constitutional efficiency of the Eustachian tube (ET) to supply the middle ear (ME)
      with gas and thereby stabilize ME pressure at near ambient is a primary risk factor for OM
      during vURI. Here, we test the hypothesis that constitutionally poorer ET function (F)
      predisposes to ME pathology during a vURI. Specifically, we will use ETF testing protocols
      relevant to the pressure-chamber to evaluate constitutional ETF in â‰ˆ 160 susceptible, adult
      volunteers who will be exposed to rhinovirus as part of our funded study entitled &quot;Social and
      Psychological Risks for Infectious Disease&quot; (PI: S. Cohen, PI: CHP subcontract: WJ Doyle) and
      document the ETF and ME responses to infection over a 5-day post-exposure, cloister period.

      Also, using protocols relevant to the pressure-chamber, we will evaluate constitutional ETF
      in 80 children who will be enrolled into our funded study entitled &quot;Role of Virus and Genetic
      Susceptibility in Otitis Media&quot; (PI: CM Alper) and followed for vURI and OM from October
      through April. From both data sets, we will extract measures of ETF efficiency and determine
      using logistic regression with appropriate control variables (e.g. demographic data etc) if a
      single or combination of ETF variables predicts an abnormal ME response in rhinovirus
      infected adults or OM during a rhinovirus cold in children.
