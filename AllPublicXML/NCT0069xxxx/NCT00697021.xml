  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      TEG is an established technique to assess the quality of clot formation' used mainly in
      surgery and obstetrics to determine possible bleeding diathesis. Recently it became to be
      used in cardiology, where it can be a valuable tool to assess a response to antiplatelet
      therapy and its association with the outcome. However, there is a few data about use of TEG
      in STEMI patients undergoing PCI. Our study is designed to assess by TEG the platelet's
      response to clopidogrel treatment during acute STEMI in patients undergoing primary PCI and
      the correlation of this response with the long term outcome, and ability to dose adjustment
      according to a specific measurement by TEG in order to prevent future MACE.

      TEG system may provide the capabilities needed to deliver personalized therapy, first,
      because it can identify patients at risk of ischemic event based on hemostatic influences,
      particularly platelet aggregation and platelet reactivity. Secondly, because treating those
      patients who exhibit high platelet reactivity -- an indication that they are not reaching a
      therapeutic level -- with appropriate drugs and doses is expected to improve outcomes.

      In this study that would be increased clopidogrel maintenance dosing (150 mg) or aspirin
      maintenance dosing to 200mg in an attempt to lower platelet reactivity below the 50th%ile,
      which we expect to also reduce their ischemic risk during the follow up period.
