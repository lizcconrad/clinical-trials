    <textblock>
      Delayed emesis following administration of carboplatin-based chemotherapy despite prophylaxis
      with standard antiemetic prophylaxis (5-HT3 and corticosteroid) remains a clinically
      significant and distressing problem for patients with cancer. The incidence of delayed emesis
      appears to be higher in women compared to men.

      All patients will be given the Functional Living Index- Emesis (FLIE), a standardized
      questionnaire. This is a self-administered questionnaire to assess the impact of nausea and
      vomiting on the patient's functional living, including physical activities, social and
      emotional function, and ability to enjoy food and drink. Patients will complete the
      questionnaire during the 5 days following carboplatin administration (at 24 hours, 48 hours,
      72 hours and 96 hours) during their first and third cycles of chemotherapy. The questionnaire
      should take approximately 10 minutes or less to complete.

      Patients will also be interviewed by a trained CRA or research nurse over the telephone 24-48
      hours following carboplatin administration in order to assess the severity of the delayed
      nausea and vomiting.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients must have newly diagnosed, histologically or cytologically proven cancer, and
             be scheduled to receive chemotherapy with carboplatin at AUC 5 or above.

          -  Patients should receive standard antiemetic prophylaxis prior to carboplatin
             administration, defined as 5-HT3 antagonist and dexamethasone. We will include only
             patients whose standard care includes treatment with a carboplatin-containing regimen
             and who are not being treated with aprepitant (EmendÂ®).

          -  Age &gt;= 18.

          -  After being informed of the treatment involved, patients must give written consent.

          -  Entry to this study is open to both men and women and to all racial and ethnic
             subgroups.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  No prior cytotoxic chemotherapy within the last 5 years.

          -  Should not be pregnant.
