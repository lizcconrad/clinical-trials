  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Experience with tacrolimus in pancreas transplantation has become a standard for
      immunosuppression in almost all pancreas centers over the world. Several centers have shown
      very good results in simultaneous pancreas-kidney (SPK) transplant recipients receiving
      antithymocyte globulin induction and maintenance immunosuppression consisting of calcineurin
      inhibitor and mycophenolate mofetil with or without corticosteroids.

      The use of sirolimus in SPK transplant patients has for the moment only been studied, with
      good results, in association with tacrolimus or cyclospsorine (CsA). In renal
      transplantation, there is also evidence that sirolimus (Rapamune) is a potent
      immunosuppressant that significantly reduces the incidence of acute rejection when given with
      CsA, effective as base therapy in the post-induction period. Because of Rapamune's
      effectiveness and different safety profile, it might be advantageous in terms of reduced
      nephrotoxicity to avoid completely calcineurin inhibitors without increased incidence of
      acute rejection.

      To explore this further, the following study is designed to assess the use of SRL versus TAC,
      both treatment groups including rATG plus MMF and a 3-month course of steroids in de novo
      simultaneous pancreas-kidney transplant recipients.

      The main objective is to compare renal and pancreas graft survivals at 12 months after
      simultaneous pancreas-kidney transplantation in patients receiving either a regimen combining
      sirolimus (SRL) plus mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) following an antibody induction (rATG) or a
      regimen combining tacrolimus (TAC) plus mycophenolate mofetil following an antibody induction
      (rATG). In both regimens corticosteroids (CS) will be withdrawn three months after
      transplantation.

      In addition, the two treatment groups will be compared for acute rejection, renal and
      pancreas functions and patient survival after transplantation at 12 months and for a total
      period of 5 years of follow-up.
