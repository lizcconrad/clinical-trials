      In wrists with carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) the sonographically measured largest
      cross-sectional area (CSA) of the median nerve is increased. We compared the changes in
      largest CSA in wrists undergoing surgical decompression and wrists undergoing conservative
      treatment of CTS.

      Objective:

      In wrists with carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) the sonographically measured largest
      cross-sectional area (CSA) of the median nerve is increased. We compared the changes in
      largest CSA in wrists undergoing surgical decompression and wrists undergoing conservative
      treatment of CTS.

      Methods:

      Prospective cohort study in 55 consecutive patients with 78 wrists with established CTS,
      including 60 wrists with surgical decompression and 18 wrists with conservative treatment. A
      sonographic examination was scheduled before and at 4 months after initiation of treatment.
      Changes in CSA between wrists with surgical and wrists with conservative treatment were
      compared using linear regression models.
