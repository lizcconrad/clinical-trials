    <measure>Change From Baseline in Brief Pain Inventory-Modified Short Form (BPI-SF) Interference Score Between Responder and Non-Responder Participants at 4 Weeks</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>BPI-SF interference score asks about the degree to which pain interferes with mood, walking and other physical activity, work, social activity, relations with others, and sleep. BPI-SF interference score ranges from 0 (no interference) to 10 (interferes completely). Response is defined as a &gt;=50% reduction in the Maier subscale score from baseline. The Maier subscale (Items 1,2,7,8,9,10) represents &quot;core&quot; symptoms of depression. Total subscale scores range from 0 (normal) to 24 (severe). Factors used for adjustment for least squares means are listed in 'Other relevant information' section.</description>

Items are rated from 1 (never, low enjoyment or pleasure) to 5 (every day/great enjoyment or pleasure). CSFQ measures 5 dimensions of sexual behavior: pleasure; desire/frequency; desire/interest; arousal; orgasm. CSFQ total score is obtained across all 5 dimensions. Lower scores are associated with sexual dysfunction/diminished sexual functioning. Total scores &lt;=47 (men) and &lt;=41 (women) indicate global sexual dysfunction, with all phases of the sexual response cycle being affected.</description>

        <description>BPI-SF interference score asks about the degree to which pain interferes with mood, walking and other physical activity, work, social activity, relations with others, and sleep. BPI-SF interference score ranges from 0 (no interference) to 10 (interferes completely). Response is defined as a &gt;=50% reduction in the Maier subscale score from baseline. The Maier subscale (Items 1,2,7,8,9,10) represents &quot;core&quot; symptoms of depression. Total subscale scores range from 0 (normal) to 24 (severe). Factors used for adjustment for least squares means are listed in 'Other relevant information' section.</description>

        <description>A 14-item patient-rated scale assesses medication-related changes in sexual activity/functioning. Items rated from 1 (never, low enjoyment/pleasure) to 5 (every day, great enjoyment/pleasure). CSFQ measures 5 dimensions of sexual behavior: pleasure; desire/frequency; desire/interest; arousal; orgasm. Lower total scores are associated with diminished sexual functioning. Total scores &lt;=47 (men) and &lt;=41 (women) indicate global sexual dysfunction, with all phases of sexual response cycle affected.
