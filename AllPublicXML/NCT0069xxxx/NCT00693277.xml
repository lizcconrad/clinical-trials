      1. Research question Can a web-based nutritional educational intervention improve
           phosphorus knowledge and control of phosphorus intake?

        2. Experimental design

           Following enrollment and informed consent, subjects will be randomized to one of two
           arms (group1: usual care; group 2: usual care plus Internet-based nutrition module). All
           subjects will undergo baseline data collection, consisting of:

             1. Short form of the test of functional health literacy in adults: categorizes
                individuals as having adequate, marginal or inadequate health literacy.

             2. Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) Knowledge Assessment Tool: addresses nutritional
                knowledge of CKD.

             3. SF-12 Health Survey version 2: a 12-item measure of health related quality of life.

             4. Kidney Disease Self-Management Survey: a 58-item Likert scale based on theories
                important for self-management in chronic disease.

             5. 3-Day Dietary Diaries

             6. Lab work:

           i. Serum phosphorus, calcium and parathyroid hormone levels. ii. Circulating endothelial
           cells, a novel marker for vascular damage.

           Following baseline data collection, group 1 will continue with their scheduled clinic
           visit, while group 2 will spend approximately 30 minutes completing a web-based
           nutrition module. After completion of the module, patients will proceed with their
           scheduled clinic visit.

           All subjects will then be asked to return in 30-60 days to repeat some of the survey
           information and blood work

        3. Major risks to subjects There is the potential for some mild discomfort from the
           necessary blood draws, which occur twice per subjects.

        4. Potential benefits to subjects Subjects randomized to the web-based module may receive
           an educational benefit from it.

        5. Consent procedures Only individuals who can provide their own consent can participate.
           Upon agreeing to enroll, a study coordinator or investigator will provide the subject
           with a copy of the consent form, and will remain available to answer any questions.

      Specific Aim 1: To examine the effect of a novel, web-based method of educating CKD patients
      on patient knowledge and dietary intake of phosphorus. We will compare 2 methods for
      educating CKD patients about dietary phosphorus intake:

        1. Usual care, consisting of individualized care/counseling by a nephrologist.

        2. Usual care, plus review of the Kidney School (KS) Nutrition Module (see below). To
           compare gains in phosphorus knowledge after 1 month. To compare compliance with dietary
           phosphorus intake, as measured by mineral metabolism laboratory values (serum
           phosphorus, calcium, PTH, calcium-phosphorus product) and 3-day dietary diaries.

      Specific Aim 2: To determine if the S-TOFHLA predicts CKD patients' knowledge and compliance
      with recommended dietary phosphorus intake:

        1. To measure health literacy in patients undergoing maintenance hemodialysis, using the
           S-TOFHLA.

        2. To assess correlations between health literacy and knowledge of phosphorus.

        3. To assess correlations between health literacy and compliance with CKD dietary
           phosphorus guidelines, as measured by mineral metabolism laboratory values (serum
           phosphorus, calcium, PTH, calcium-phosphorus product), and dietary phosphate intake, as
           measured by 3-day dietary diaries.

        4. To assess correlations between health literacy and compliance with CKD dietary
           phosphorus guidelines, following usual care versus an eHealth nutrition intervention.

      Specific Aim 3: To determine if higher dietary phosphorus intake correlates with higher
      levels of CECs.

        1. To measure CEC levels in patients with CKD.

        2. To assess correlations between dietary phosphorus intake, serum phosphorus levels, and
           CECs in patients with CKD.
