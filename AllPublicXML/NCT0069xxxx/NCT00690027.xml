      In unselected cirrhotic patients with bleeding esophageal varices to compare the influence on
      mortality rate, duration of life, quality of life, and economic costs of treatment of:

        -  Emergency portacaval shunt, and

        -  Emergency and long-term endoscopic sclerotherapy.

    <description>Objective: See Brief Summary, page 2. Eligibility: Patients who require &gt; 2 units blood transfusion for bleeding esophageal varices due to cirrhosis.
Randomization: By the blind card method to emergency portacaval shunt (EPCS) or emergency endoscopic sclerotherapy (EST) followed by long-term repetitive EST.
Diagnostic Workup: Completed within 6hr. Rapidity of Therapy: Within 8hr. Failure of Therapy: Bleeding requiring &gt;6u PRBC in first 7 days, or 8 units PRBC during 12 months, or rebleeding after varices were obliterated.
Rescue Crossover Therapy: When primary therapy has failed. Followup: Lifelong. Data Collection on line, analysis by biostatistician Florin Vaida, PhD External Advisory, Data Monitoring and Safety Committee by 3 senior academicians.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  All patients with UGI bleeding (blood in the esophagus, stomach, or duodenum) who
             enter the emergency room or develop bleeding while in the hospital or are transferred
             from nearby hospitals and are suspected of having cirrhosis and BEV will be eligible
             for consideration (all comers).

          -  Those who are shown to have the findings of cirrhosis and esophageal varices that:

               -  Are seen to be actively bleeding;

               -  Have an adherent clot;

               -  Have no other associated lesion that could reasonably account for bleeding of
                  that magnitude (such as large gastric or duodenal varices, GU, DU, etc)

          -  Require 2 or more units of blood transfusion, will be included in the study.
