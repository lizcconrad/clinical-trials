             21 days after last dose of study medication, or

          -  agrees to use a condom and occlusive cap (diaphragm or cervical/vault cap) with
             spermicidal foam/gel/film/cream/suppository from the first dose of study drug and
             until 21 days after last dose of study medication, or

          -  is surgically sterile. NOTE: Male patients must use contraception to prevent pregnancy
             in a female partner and prevent exposure of any partner to semen by any means (refer
             to protocol).

          -  A female is eligible to enroll in the study if she is of:

          -  spermicide; OR male condom and diaphragm. NOTE: Oral contraceptives are not reliable
             due to potential for drug-drug interaction.

          -  Adequate organ system function as defined in the protocol.

          -  QTc interval ≥ 480 msecs.
