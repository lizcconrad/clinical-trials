  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multi-center prospective pilot clinical study to assess the utility of the Triage
      NGAL Test - alone and in conjunction with the Triage BNP test - as an aid in the early risk
      assessment for heart-failure-related adverse clinical outcomes (deaths, readmissions, and
      additional emergent outpatient visits) through Day 30 and Day 90 in patients presenting with
      acutely decompensated heart failure (HF). Its utility as an aid in the early risk assessment
      for renal dysfunction in patients with acutely decompensated heart failure undergoing
      treatment with IV diuretics will also be assessed.

      Approximately 200 adults presenting to the Emergency Department (ED) / hospital with acutely
      decompensated HF will be enrolled. EDTA anti-coagulated blood samples will be collected for
      measurement of blood NGAL levels (using the Triage NGAL Test) at the point of care in all
      subjects at up to 8 different time points from presentation until discharge.

      The results of these NGAL assessments will be blinded to the medical team during the study
      and will not impact the medical management of the subject.

      Blood samples for unblinded assessment of both serum creatinine (analyzed at the hospital's
      laboratory) and whole blood BNP (analyzed with the Triage BNP Test at the point-of-care or
      laboratory) will also be obtained at some of the same time points.

      Dialysis, emergent outpatient visits for HF, hospitalizations and mortality will be recorded
      through Day 30 and Day 90. If an additional serum creatinine has been obtained as standard
      care near Day 30, it will also be recorded.

          -  Patients presenting to the emergency department / hospital with symptoms of new or
             decompensated heart failure and who will be treated with at least one dose of IV
             diuretic;

          -  Ability to draw blood samples for baseline NGAL, BNP and creatinine levels either
             prior to the administration of the first dose of IV diuretic or within 1 hour after
             the first dose of an IV diuretic

          -  Ability to provide written informed consent from subject or their authorized

             assessments;

          -  Cardiogenic shock or any other clinical condition that would contraindicate the
             administration of an IV agent with potent vasodilating properties;

          -  Known history of marked renal insufficiency (e.g., usual serum creatinine â‰¥ 3.0
             mg/dL), on dialysis (either acute of chronic) or in imminent need of dialysis at
             enrollment;
