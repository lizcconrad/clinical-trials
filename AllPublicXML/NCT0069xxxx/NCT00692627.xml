  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      acidosis, acute renal failure and acute pulmonary oedema are common, and frequently fatal,
      manifestations of severe P. falciparum malaria. The course of all three might be ameliorated
      by optimising a patient's intravenous fluid therapy. The fluid treatment of severe malaria is
      presently empirical, by defining cardiovascular responses to volume replacement we would
      provide a physiological basis for resuscitation strategies.

      We will use pulse contour cardiac output monitoring (PiCCOTM) to guide the fluid
      resuscitation of patients admitted to intensive care with severe malaria. With data collected
      during the patients' admission we hope to:

        1. Assess the degree of hypovolaemia in adults with severe malaria and its contribution to
           microcirculatory dysfunction and acidosis.

        2. To assess the relationships between volume status, haemodynamic parameters and the renal
           and pulmonary manifestations of severe malaria.

        3. To assess the utility of central venous pressure measurement as a guide for fluid
           administration in patients with severe malaria

        4. To investigate the prognostic and clinical utility of central venous oxygen saturation
           in severe malaria

      In this way we hope to develop a greater understanding of the pathophysiology of haemodynamic
      derangement in severe malaria. By comparing the PiCCO derived data with simpler clinical
      parameters, we hope to determine potential fluid resuscitation strategies - relevant for a
      resource poor setting - whose efficacy could be confirmed in future trials.
