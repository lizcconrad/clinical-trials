    <textblock>
      This study is a pilot, randomized trial that will examine whether the Nintendo Wii virtual
      gaming system is safe and feasible for use in patients who have had a recent stroke.

      A pilot, randomized (1:1) controlled trial to compare the safety and feasibility of Nintendo
      Wii gaming versus other recreational therapy activities (playing cards) in post-stroke
      patients. All patients will continue to receive all other standard medical and physiotherapy
      treatments while in the study.

    <description>The Nintendo Wii gaming system, released in 2005, introduced a new style of virtual reality by using a wireless controller that interacts with the player through a motion detection system. Nintendo Wii involves the incorporation of 3-dimensional accelerometer technology that can respond to changes in direction, speed, and acceleration, down to the most delicate movements. Specifically, the controllers use embedded acceleration sensors to enable players' wrist, arm, and hand movements to interact with the games. Tilt measurements allow users to move characters, while the accurate three-axis acceleration sensing easily transforms the controller into a virtual sword, gearshift, or musical instrument</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patient has provided written informed consent prior to entry into the study

          -  In-patient at one of the two study institutions at the time of randomization

          -  Males or females, aged over 18 and younger than 85

          -  Evidence of stroke confirmed by CT head (ischemic or hemorrhagic)

          -  Time: Onset of symptoms within 6 months prior to randomization

          -  Measurable Chedoke-McMaster scale stage of =&gt;4 on the &quot;arm&quot; item (10)

          -  Functional independence prior to present stroke (baseline mRS = 0-1)

          -  Patient is alert, medically stable according to the treating physician and able to
             follow simple verbal commands

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Acute stroke onset more than 6 months ago

          -  Patient is unable to follow verbal commands or has global aphasia

          -  Severe illness with life expectancy less than 3 months (cancer, endocarditis,
             metastasis with an occult primary malignancy, coagulopathy).

          -  Uncontrolled hypertension according to the treating physician

          -  Unstable angina or recent myocardial infarction (within the last 3 months), current NY
             Heart Association Class III (marked limitation of physical activity; although patients
             are comfortable at rest, less-than-ordinary activity leads to fatigue, dyspnea,
             palpitations, or angina3) or IV (symptomatic at rest; symptoms of CHF are present at
             rest; discomfort increases with any physical activity) or symptomatic ventricular
             tachyarrhythmias, as per medical history (a baseline ECG will not be required.)

          -  Any history of seizure, except for febrile seizures of childhood

          -  Participation in another clinical trial involving rehabilitation (recreational
             therapy, occupational therapy, physiotherapy) or involving an investigational drug.

          -  Patient is unwilling or unable to comply with the protocol or can not/will not
             cooperate fully with the investigator or study personnel.

          -  Any condition(s) that, in the Investigator's opinion, would a) warrant exclusion from
             the study (i.e., participation in the study is not in the best interest of the
             patient) or b) prevent the patient from completing the study.

          -  Any medical condition that might confound the interpretation of results or put the
             patient at risk (amputation of one extremity).
