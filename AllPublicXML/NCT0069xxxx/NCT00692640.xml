  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of XL147 in combination
      with erlotinib (Tarceva®) in subjects with solid tumors. XL147 is a new chemical entity that
      inhibits PI3 Kinase. Inactivation of PI3K has been shown to inhibit growth and induce
      apoptosis (programmed cell death) in tumor cells. Erlotinib is an orally administered
      inhibitor of EGFR (also known as HER1) tyrosine kinase. It was approved by the FDA as a
      single agent for the treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic non-small-cell
      lung cancer (NSCLC) after failure of at least one prior chemotherapy regimen and in
      combination with gemcitabine for first line treatment of patients with locally advanced,
      unresectable or metastatic pancreatic cancer.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects accrue to one of two phases:

               -  in the Dose Escalation Phase, the subject has a histologically confirmed solid
                  tumor that is metastatic or unresectable and is no longer responding to therapies
                  known to prolong survival or to other standard therapies, or has disease for
                  which no standard therapy exists or for which monotherapy with erlotinib is
                  considered standard therapy.

               -  in the Cohort Expansion Phase, the subject has advanced or metastatic NSCLC that
                  is no longer responding to therapies known to prolong survival or to other
                  standard therapies and which:

                    1. has been previously or currently treated with erlotinib or gefitinib or

                    2. with the agreement of the sponsor, has been previously or is currently
                       treated with other EGFR/VEGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors

          -  The subject has measurable or non-measurable lesions by the Response Evaluation
             Criteria in Solid Tumor (RECIST) criteria.

          -  At least 10 unstained slides of tumor tissue, archival or fresh, or paraffin block or
             a fresh tumor biopsy are identified and designated for central laboratory analysis.

          -  The subject has an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status ≤ 2.

          -  The subject has adequate organ and marrow function.

          -  The subject has a fasting plasma glucose ≤ 120 mg/dL at screening.

          -  The subject is ≥ 18 years old.

          -  The subject is capable of understanding and complying with the protocol requirements
             and has signed the informed consent document.

          -  Sexually active subjects (male and female) must use accepted methods of contraception
