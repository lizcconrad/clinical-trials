      The purpose of this study is to determine the feasibility of partial breast irradiation in
      participants with early invasive or non-invasive breast cancer.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      -  In this study, radiotherapy is given only to a portion of the breast around the tumor
           bed using external radiation treatments. This approach is called &quot;partial breast
           irradiation&quot;.

        -  Participants will undergo a planning session for the radiation treatments. This planning
           will be done by CT scan days or weeks before the start of treatment. This planning
           process is the same as that used to plan conventional radiation therapy treatments.

        -  Radiation therapy will begin 4-12 weeks after the last surgery of the breast in
           individuals not receiving chemotherapy first. For individuals receiving chemotherapy
           before radiation therapy, radiation therapy will start 2-6 weeks after ending
           chemotherapy.

        -  We will be studying three levels of radiation doses to see which is best. The dose the
           participant receives will depend upon when they are enrolled on the trial.

        -  Participants will receive radiation treatment twice each day for 4 or 5 treatment days,
           with an overall treatment time of one week.
