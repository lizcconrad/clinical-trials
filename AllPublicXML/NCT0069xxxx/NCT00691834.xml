  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test bone marrow mononuclear cells for patients with recent
      heart attack who are at high risk of experiencing heart failure. This study drug is made of
      you own cells. Studies similar to this one have suggested that the use of cell-based transfer
      after heart attack can improve the recuperation of the heart. The purpose of this study is to
      assess whether cell transfer can improve the healing of the heart after a heart attack.
