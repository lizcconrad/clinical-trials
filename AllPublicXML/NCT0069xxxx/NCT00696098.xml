  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Short chain fatty acids (mainly butyrate, acetate, and propionate) are produced in the large
      intestine by bacterial fermentation of undigested carbohydrates, such as dietary fibres.
      Butyrate is an important energy source of the intestinal epithelium and has a pivotal role in
      the regulation of epithelial cell proliferation and differentiation, immune function and
      mucosal protection.

      Non-digestible carbohydrates (prebiotics) increase the concentrations of colonic butyrate,
      which has been proposed to be responsible for its beneficial effects. Furthermore, butyrate
      enemas have been proven to be effective in the treatment of active ulcerative colitis.

      In the present study, the direct effects of butyrate on inflammation and parameters of
      colonic defence and mucosal integrity of the distal colon will be studied in 40 patients with
      diarrhoea predominant IBS (D-IBS) and 40 patients with ulcerative colitis in remission
      (UCrem) using rectal enemas. These patients groups were chosen because they have a low-grade
      inflammation in the large intestine, and can therefore be used as a model to study the
      mechanistic effects of butyrate. The design used to study the effects of butyrate in both
      patient groups will be a double blind randomized placebo-controlled parallel design.
