  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The high percentage of failure using available non-surgical options to treat menorrhagia in
      women with bleeding disorders shows a continuing need for innovative treatments. This has led
      to development of this protocol in order to make available tranexamic acid as a potentially
      effective menorrhagia therapy option in women with an underlying bleeding disorder. We
      anticipate that Tranexamic Acid may be a beneficial choice for controlling menorrhagia in
      bleeding disorder patients.

      Women with heavy periods and with a diagnosed bleeding disorders are prescribed cyclokapron
      pills to be taken during their periods. Their periods are assessed at 3 and 6 months by
      filling out a pictorial blood assessment chart. If the drug appears to be working with no
      adverse effects the patients can continue to take the medication as long as it is available
      with follow up with the investigator every 6 months.
