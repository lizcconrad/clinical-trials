  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This clinical study evaluates the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and immunogenicity
      of dalotuzumab (MK-0646) in participants with relapsed or refractory locally advanced or
      metastatic solid tumors using once weekly and once every other week dose infusion regimens.

      The primary study hypothesis is that administration of dalotuzumab as a once weekly and an
      every other week infusion will be generally safe and well tolerated

    <measure>Number of Participants Who Experienced a Dose-limiting Toxicity (DLT)</measure>
    <time_frame>Cycle 1 (Up to 4 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>Toxicity was graded and recorded according to National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 3.0. DLTs were defined as the occurrence of any of the following events when judged to be related to the study medication: Grade 4 neutropenia; Grade 3 neutropenia with fever &gt;38.5°C; Grade 4 thrombocytopenia; Grade 3 or Grade 4 non-hematologic toxicity, except alopecia and inadequately treated diarrhea, nausea and vomiting. The number of participants who experienced a DLT is presented.</description>

    <measure>Number of Participants Who Experienced an Adverse Event (AE)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 30 days after last dose of study treatment (Up to 101 days)</time_frame>
    <description>An AE was defined as any unfavorable and unintended change in the structure, function, or chemistry of the body temporally associated with the use of the study treatment, whether or not considered related to the use of study treatment. Any worsening (i.e. any clinically significant adverse change in frequency and/or intensity) of a pre-existing condition which was temporally associated with the use of study treatment, was also an AE. The number of participants who experienced at least one AE is presented.</description>
