  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Today metastatic breast cancer is regarded as cureless. The treatment is palliative in intent
      and the goals of treatment include improvement of quality of life and if possible
      prolongation of life. Treatment in metastatic cancer will usually involve hormone therapy
      and/or chemotherapy. Weekly application of chemotherapeutical drugs may lead to less drug
      concentrations in healthy tissue and therefore toxicities maý be reduced.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Breast cancer is the most common malignancy of females. In Germany about 46,000 women come
      down with breast cancer yearly.

      Present therapies cannot cure the metastatic disease, the main focus is improvement of
      quality of life and prolongation of life. It is therefore necessary to test new substances
      and/or new combinations and therapy concepts. Among the most active cytotoxic agents used in
      advanced breast cancer are the anthracyclines. Since conventional anthracyclines are often
      used as adjuvant or neoadjuvant therapy their cardiotoxicity restricts their use in the
      therapy of the advanced disease.

      Liposomal encapsulated doxorubicin shows better activity than conventional doxorubicin
      combined with reduced cardiotoxicity.

      Weekly applied cytotoxic agents show a better toxicity profile and hence the cumulative dosis
      can be increased. It is expected that the combination of liposomal encapsulated doxorubicin
      with paclitaxel given weekly shows improved results in the therapy of metastatic breast
      cancer.
