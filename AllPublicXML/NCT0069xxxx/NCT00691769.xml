  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to see if a specific protein that we are interested in
      is involved in scarring hair loss. If these proteins are involved, further genetic work may
      also better define the disease as well as future treatment options.

      This is a single-center study, designed to evaluate the expression of Fas protein in skin
      biopsies of patients with scarring alopecia including fourteen patients with central
      centrifugal scarring alopecia (CCSA), three patients with lichen planopilaris (LP) and three
      patients with discoid lupus erythematosus (DLE). Skin biopsies of five healthy participants
      will be used as controls.
