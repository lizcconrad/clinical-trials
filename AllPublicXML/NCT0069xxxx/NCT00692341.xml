        <description>Clearance of an unbound drug is a measure of the rate at which an unbound drug is metabolized or eliminated by normal biological processes. Clearance obtained after oral dose (apparent oral clearance) is influenced by the oral bioavailability. Unbound drug clearance is a quantitative measure of the rate at which an unbound drug substance is removed from the blood.</description>
