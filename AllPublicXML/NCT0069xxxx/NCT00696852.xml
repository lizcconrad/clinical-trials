  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study, we will conduct a preliminary, yet comprehensive evaluation of Mindfulness and
      Yoga, as compared to an exercise and education-based stress-reduction program. and
      simultaneous evaluation of the effect of an 8 week program of Mindfulness, 12 weeks of Yoga
      practice, and 12 weeks of an exercise and education-based program.

      105 otherwise healthy individuals, who have cardiovascular risk factors and mild to moderate
      stress or anxiety will be randomly assigned to one of the three intervention groups: an 8
      week program of Mindfulness, 12 week program of Yoga practice, and 12 week exercise and
      education-based group program. All subjects will perform daily practice that will continue
      after the weekly sessions end, allowing a follow up assessment at 24 weeks. Self-reported
      mood and psychological distress and physiological indicators of function of the ANS and
      stress hormones will be assessed at baseline, 8 weeks, 12 weeks and 24 weeks. Blood and urine
      samples will be collected at baseline and 8 weeks to determine levels inflammatory and
      atherosclerosis markers.

      We anticipate that the study will provide information on the efficacy of the Mindfulness and
      Yoga interventions as stress-reduction practices, variability in potential markers for
      activation of the brain/cardiovascular system connections, and preliminary estimates of
      effect size for each of these markers. Thus, the study will provide the data needed for
      designing a future study that will rigorously address these questions in a larger, randomized
      trial of Mindfulness and Yoga in patients with cardiovascular risk.
