    <textblock>
      PH-10 is a formulation of rose bengal disodium (RB) for topical administration to the skin.
      PH-10 is capable of undergoing photochemical reactions when activated by ambient light. This
      phase 2 study will assess whether topical PH-10 applied once daily to mild, moderate or
      severe areas of atopic dermatitis (including atopic eczema) may ameliorate inflammation of
      the skin when activated by ambient light.
