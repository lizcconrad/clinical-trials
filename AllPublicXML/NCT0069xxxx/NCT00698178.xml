  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) is a common and important disorder. Previous studies
      have demonstrated the association of obesity with GERD, and now obesity is regarded as a risk
      factor for GERD. Moreover, body mass index (BMI), an indicator of general obesity, correlates
      with severity of symptoms and degree of erosive esophagitis. Waist circumference, an
      indicator of abdominal obesity, has stronger correlation with intra-abdominal pressure and
      low-grade inflammatory state when compared with BMI. Nevertheless the association of waist
      circumference with severity of GERD has not been studied.

      The primary aim of this study is to compare BMI with waist circumference for their
      independent association with severity of GERD. The secondary aim is to evaluate independent
      risk factors of severity of GERD.

      This is a cross-section observational study. Outpatients presenting with acid reflux or heart
      burn are interviewed with standardized questionnaire to quantify severity of symptoms. The
      eligible patients undergo upper endoscopy to diagnose erosive esophagitis and further
      classify the degree of erosions according to Los-Angels classification. Enrolled patients
      receive anthropometric measurements to record body weight, body height and waist
      circumference on the day of enrollment.

      Two outcomes are studied: the severity of GERD symptoms and the Los-Angels Classification of
      erosive esophagitis.
