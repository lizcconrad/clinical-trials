  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      We want in this study to investigate the cost-effectiveness and waiting time of direct
      electronic referral and booking of outpatient surgery compared to the traditional patient
      pathway where the patient is seen at the outpatient clinic prior to surgery.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Waiting time from referral to day case outpatient surgery is unacceptable long. In Norway it
      is as much as 48 weeks for common conditions like gallstones, inguinal hernia and sinus
      pilonidalis. Electronic standardised referrals sent by the Norwegian Healthcare Network, and
      booking of surgery by the general practitioner might be a way to reduce the waiting time and
      increase the cost effectiveness of outpatient surgery.

      The trial is designated as a randomized controlled trial were selected patients (inguinal
      hernia, gall stone disease and sinus pilonoidalis) referred to the university hospital, were
      either randomized to direct electronic referral and booking for outpatient surgery (one
      stop), or using the traditional patient pathway where all patients are seen at the outpatient
      clinic several weeks before surgery.

    <description>Patients in the control group are randomised to use the regular patient pathway prior to day case outpatient surgery. All these patients are referred to the surgical outpatient clinic. At the outpatient clinic patients are examined by a surgeon and indications for surgery is decided by the surgeon. If indicated, patients are then referred to outpatient surgery and the surgical procedure is performed several weeks after the examination.</description>
