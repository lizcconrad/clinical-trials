  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to obtain information about the effect of a combination of
      genistein, PUFAs, vitamin K and D (BONISTEIN(R) bone blend) on bone health, determined as
      bone mass density/content and bone biomarkers after 6-months treatment in 70 healthy
      postmenopausal women. In addition, safety and tolerability will be investigated.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Osteoporosis is the most frequent disease of the skeletal system with approximately one third
      of all postmenopausal women being currently affected in the USA and in Europe. The role of
      nutrition in bone health has been increasingly recognized in the last couple of years. In
      particular nutrients such as isoflavones, vitamins D and K as well as polyunsaturated fatty
      acids (PUFA) have been implicate in bone health recently.

      The DSM Nutritional Products Ltd product BONISTEIN(R) is a synthetic genistein. Its genistin
      aglycone purity is above 99 % and the appearance is a beige crystal.

      In addition to the primary and secondary outcomes, body composition, genistein plasma levels,
      diet and physical activity are assessed.
