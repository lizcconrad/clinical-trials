  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      To determine if IGIV3I Grifols 10% is a consistently effective treatment in patients
      diagnosed with immune thrombocytopenic purpura with respect to:

        1. Increase of platelet count ≥ 50x10^9/L (primary objective).

        2. Time taken for the platelet count to reach ≥ 50x10^9/L.

        3. The length of time the platelet count remains ≥ 50x10^9/L.

        4. The maximum platelet level.

        5. Regression of bleeding episodes during the first 10 or 14 days.

      To determine if IGIV3I Grifols 10% is safe with respect to:

      Nature, severity and frequency of adverse reactions during and after infusions by percentage
      of subjects and percentage of infusions.
