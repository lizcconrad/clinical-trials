  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether or not participation in an experimental
      program called the &quot;P4 program&quot; is useful to men who are faced with choices about treatment
      for their early stage prostate cancer. The P4 program consists of a series of questions and
      information for the participant.

      Before seeing the cancer specialist, participants will answer several questionnaires on a
      computer. This will take about 20-30 minutes. Participants may choose to do this on a
      computer at home or on a touch-screen computer in the clinic. Half the participants will then
      be shown several highly rated informational websites about prostate cancer treatments. The
      other half, based on the individual participant's answers, will receive the P4 program's
      customized written and on-screen information. Reading the information and watching videos
      will take about 20 minutes.

      About one month later, and again 6 months, participants will complete follow-up
      questionnaires electronically or by mail. These questionnaires will help us understand how
      each participant's decision for treatment of their prostate cancer went. Answering these
      questionnaires should take about 20 minutes each time.
