      The purpose of this study is to evaluate a diabetes data management program in the hands of
      potential users, both health care professionals and lay users.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Diabetes data management programs analyze blood glucose results downloaded from glucose
      meters to assist health care professionals or lay users manage their diabetes. During the
      study, subjects download meters, generate and print reports, evaluate the program's ease of
      use, and verify that they understand the program output.

            <non_inferiority_desc>The null and alternative hypotheses for these tests will have the form:
Ho: Pr{Success} &lt; Po vs. Ha: Pr{Success} ≥ Po. Critical values for numbers of successes were computed to give approximately a 90% chance of rejecting Ho in favor of the alternative (non-inferiority) if the true probability of success is at least Po. For Po = 90%, with n=51, critical number is 43. With this critical value and sample size, the power to reject Ho is approximately 93.57%.</non_inferiority_desc>
