      Objectives:

      To study the changes in brain structure and function using MRI scans in patients treated for
      Alzheimer's disease.

      Methods:

      A pilot study of treating Alzheimer's disease with antibiotics showed some promise that this
      treatment could delay the deterioration of the mind with this disease. This study is being
      replicated on a larger scale, providing a more definitive answer to this question. In
      addition to looking at changes of the mind (through cognitive tests), we would like to use
      MRI scans in these patients before and after treatment to study the structural changes and
      the chemical changes in the brain. This would provide a non-invasive look at the bran
      processes that protect the brain from the effect of Alzheimer's as well as confirming that
      the disease has been modified with treatment.

      Impact:

      The novel treatment of Alzheimer's with antibiotics has provided a potential breakthrough in
      the field. In addition to verifying changes in the brain, MRI scans can observe HOW this
      process could occur, thus opening doors to other new treatments for Alzheimer's and perhaps
      even cures.

             consent for his or her own participation.

          5. Sufficient visual, hearing and communication skills to complete standardized testing
             in English.

          6. Patients or their legally acceptable representatives for personal care who sign
             informed consent.

          7. Otherwise healthy on physical examination and screening physical and laboratory
             testing.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        (DARAD Trial)

          1. Patients with neurodegenerative diseases such as Lewy Body dementia, Parkinson's
             disease, Fronto-temporal Dementia, Huntington's Chorea, Down's Syndrome or Creutzfeld
             Jacob Disease.

          2. Cognitive impairment which may be due to any of the following conditions:

               1. acute cerebral trauma, subdural hematoma, injuries from chronic trauma like
                  boxing.

               2. Hypoxic cerebral damage e.g. post cardiac arrest, postanesthesia etc.

               3. Vitamin deficiency like B12 deficiency will be treated and stabilized for one
                  month before patients will be randomized to the study. Patients taking B12 for
                  more than one month can be included in the study.
