    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, multicenter, phase 1 study of MLN8237 in participants with advanced
      hematological malignancies for whom there are limited standard treatment options.

    <textblock>
      The drug being tested in this study is called alisertib. Alisertib is being tested to treat
      people who have advanced hematological malignancies. This study determined the dose-limiting
      toxicity, maximum tolerated dose, safety and pharmacokinetics (how the drug moves through the
      body) for alisertib when given once or twice a day for 7 to 21 days.

      This open label study enrolled 58 patients. Participants were enrolled in one of 3 treatment
      groups:

        -  Part 1: Powder-in-Capsule (PIC) Dose Escalation (alisertib 25 mg PIC, orally twice daily
           [BID] on Day 1 [loading dose] and then alisertib 25 or 35 mg PIC once daily [QD] for 21
           days (D), or alisertib 35, 45, 65 or 90 mg PIC, orally, QD for 14D)

        -  Part 1: Enteric-coated Tablet (ECT) Dose Escalation (alisertib 40 mg, ECT, orally, QD
           for 14D or alisertib 30, 40 or 50 mg, orally, BID for 7D)

        -  Part 2: Participants with Peripheral T-cell Lymphoma (PTCL) (alisertib 50 mg ECT,
           orally, BID for 7D)

      All participants received treatment for 12 months or until their disease progressed or they
      experienced unacceptable alisertib-related toxicity. This multi-center trial was conducted in
      the United States. The overall time to participate in this study was 422 days. Participants
      made multiple visits to the clinic, including a final visit 30 days after receiving their
      last dose of alisertib for a follow-up assessment.

    <description>DLT was evaluated according to the National Cancer Institute's Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE) version 3.0 and was defined as any of the following events related to therapy with alisertib:1. Grade 4 neutropenia lasting ≥7 consecutive days, 2. Grade 4 neutropenia with fever and/or infection 3. Platelet count &lt;25,000/mm^3 4. Grade 3 or greater nausea and/or emesis despite use of optimal antiemetic prophylaxis 5. Grade 3 or greater diarrhea despite maximal supportive therapy with loperamide 6. Any other Grade 3 or greater nonhematologic toxicity, with the following exceptions: Grade 3 arthralgia/myalgias, Any grade of alopecia, Brief (&lt;1 week) Grade 3 fatigue 7. Treatment delay of &gt;21 days due to failure of adequate hematologic or non-hematologic recovery from previous cycle of treatment 8. Other alisertib related non-hematologic toxicities ≥Grade 2 that, in the opinion of the investigator required a dose reduction or discontinuation of therapy with alisertib.</description>
