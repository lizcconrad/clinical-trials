    <textblock>
      Asthma is most effectively treated by delivering inhaled drugs from an inhaler (puffer)
      directly into the lungs. Inhaled steroids are used in asthmatic patients to dampen down lung
      inflammation, which unchecked, can often lead to patient symptoms. Inhalers deliver a mist
      containing particles of lots of different sizes (like hairsprays). Medical puffers used by
      patients produce a 'coarse' mist of drug particles, which have the potential for side
      effects, as different sized particles will reach different parts of the airways and include;
      the mouth, the throat, the windpipe, and the bloodstream (all places we do not want the
      inhaled drug to go − and can give rise to important side effects)and, the lungs (where we do
      want the drug to 'deposit').

      Our aim in this study is to test an inhaled steroid by giving it to subjects as a 'fine' mist
      containing drug particles of nearly all one size using a research nebuliser (a Spinning Top
      Aerosol Generator). We shall use small, intermediate and large drug particle mists. We aim to
      find out how much of the drug goes to the blood stream for each particle mist and compare it
      with the standard puffers used in routine clinical practice.

      We hope this study will provide information to the rationale that by improving the efficiency
      of drug delivery (by changing drug particle size) one may improve inhaled drug delivery and
      ultimately, clinical patient benefit.

      Healthy volunteers and asthmatic patients will be recruited at the Royal Brompton Hospital
      London. The study is funded by GlaxoSmithKline, Research &amp; Development, U.K.

      The clinical trial is to investigate the pharmacokinetic effects (that is how much drug is in
      the blood) of Fluticasone Propionate (Flixotide), a commonly used steroid drug that is
      inhaled in patients with asthma. We will use standard clinical Flixotide Nebules that are
      used with clinical nebulisers (machines used in hospital and at home − to deliver drug to
      patients with asthma). Current clinical nebulisers deliver a 'coarse' mist of drug, which has
      the potential for side effects and this is an important consideration with steroids. These
      Flixotide nebules will be used to deliver the drug (fluticasone propionate) as monodisperse
      aerosol clouds (that is the drug will be delivered as a 'fine' mist cloud to patients). In
      order to deliver the drug as a monodisperse aerosol, the Flixotide Nebules will be used with
      a spinning top aerosol (a large research nebuliser machine)which is able to selectively
      generate aerosol clouds that have a fine mist. A fine mist cloud leads to less deposition in
      the throat of the patients and a greater control of the inhaled drug reaching the lungs, and
      fine mist drug clouds have the potential to reduce side effects. We will also compare this to
      the use of a standard routine clinical dose of a Flixotide metered−dose inhaler ( a 'press
      and breathe' inhaler) with a spacer (plastic bubble on the end of an inhaler) delivered to
      patients.
