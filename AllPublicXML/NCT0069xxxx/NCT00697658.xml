      The purpose of this study is to explore efficacy, tolerability and safety of paliperidone
      Extended Release (ER) in 250 schizophrenia patients who started treatment with paliperidone
      ER in a naturalistic setting.

    <textblock>
      This is an observational, prospective, multicenter 6-month study to explore efficacy,
      tolerability and safety of paliperidone Extended Release (ER) in 250 schizophrenia patients
      who started treatment with paliperidone ER in a naturalistic setting. The primary objective
      is to explore changes in Clinical Global Impression of Severity (CGI-S) score from baseline
      up to 26 weeks, in subgroups of schizophrenia patients who started treatment with
      paliperidone ER. Secondary objectives are: 1) To explore changes in mental health and social
      functioning based on routine outcome assessments in the Netherlands, the Health of the Nation
      Outcome Scales (HoNOS) and Global Assessment of Functioning (GAF), in schizophrenia patients
      who started treatment with paliperidone ER ; 2) To explore changes in patient's satisfaction
      with treatment, changes in number of ambulant contacts, changes in body weight, changes in
      concomitant therapy and to explore adverse events in schizophrenia patients who started
      treatment with paliperidone ER; and to explore possible association between CGI-S, GAF and
      HoNOS.

      The patients will receive paliperidone ER (6 mg, 9 mg or other dosages as directed on the
      label) once daily for the period of 6 month. Which dosage of paliperidone ER the patients
      receive will be at the discretion of the investigator and according the Summary of Product
      Characteristics (SmPC). Because the study is observational, dosage, administration and
      duration of treatment is at discretion of treating physician.

        Schizophrenia patients meeting DSM-IV criteria receiving paliperidone ER, as part of the
        common practice of participating physicians. Patients may enter the study as soon as their
        paliperidone ER treatment starts or when it has been less than 14 days after their
        treatment start.
