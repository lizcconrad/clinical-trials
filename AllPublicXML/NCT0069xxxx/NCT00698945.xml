    <textblock>
      To assess the additional benefit of common adjunctive classes on the diurnal IOP curve in
      patients assessed as needing additional treatment to reach target intraocular pressure (IOP).
      To demonstrate superiority of IOP control with Istalol 0.5% QD compared to Brimonidine
      Tartrate 0.2% BID as adjunctive therapy in adults with uncontrolled IOP's (determined by P.I.
      based on target pressures) currently treated with Latanoprost 0.05% in the study eye(s).

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients, male or female of any race or ethnicity, 18 years of age or older, diagnosed
             with ocular hypertension or open-angle glaucoma (with or without pseudoexfoliative or
             pigmentary dispersion component).

          2. Stable use of Latanoprost 0.005% for a minimum of 30 days prior to screening visit.

          3. VA of 20/200 or better in either eye

          4. Pachymetry of 600 microns or less

          5. Visual Field within 6 months of screening visit

          6. Patients who use contact lenses are allowed to participate provided that they will
             remove lenses 15 minutes before dosing

          7. Patients who satisfy all informed consent requirements may be included in the study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Females of childbearing potential (those who are not surgically sterile,
             postmenopausal or using a reliable birth control method) will be excluded from the
             study.

          2. Any allergic component or contraindication to the study medications

          3. Pachymetry of 600 microns or greater

          4. Systemic corticosteroids not on a stable regimen within 30 days of screening visit.

          5. Any concurrent topical agents that can not be discontinued during the course of the
             trial (natural tears are acceptable)

          6. Significant ocular surface abnormalities

          7. Patients with any form of glaucoma other than ocular hypertension or open-angle
             glaucoma

          8. Patients who have been on an investigational therapy within 30 days prior to screening
             visit

          9. History of ocular trauma within the past 3 months

         10. Intraocular surgery within the past 3 months

         11. Ocular laser surgery within the past 3 months

         12. Any abnormality preventing reliable applanation tonometry of either eye

         13. VA of 20/200 or greater in either eye

         14. History or evidence of clinically significant illness or conditions which would make
             the patient, in the opinion of the investigator, not suitable for the study
