  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      We hope to learn more about the biology of psychiatric illness with the hope of improving the
      diagnosis and treatment of such psychiatric conditions as major depression.

      From the blood sample you donate, the researchers will obtain DNA. This DNA will be used to
      search for DNA markers related to the underlying biology of psychiatric illness and how this
      might explain the symptoms of these disorders. Research using DNA is an important way to try
      to understand human disease and/or the role genes play in disease. In effect, part of your
      blood sample will be used to attempt to understand how genetic factors contribute to the
      symptoms of such psychiatric conditions as major depression.
