  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Surgical revascularization has proven its efficacy in term of morbidity and mortality in
      patients with multivessel coronary disease and poor left ventricular function. Nevertheless,
      if left ventricle is severely dilated, the improvement of global contractility and reduction
      of volumes is frequently absent after CABG even if substantial amount of myocardial viability
      is present. A value of &gt; 140 ml for end systolic volume has been proposed as the cut off for
      the absence of recovery after revascularization.

      Recently, a reduction of cardiac volumes and improvement of regional and global contractility
      has been demonstrated in patients with advanced ischemic heart disease, severe dilation of
      left ventricle and poor candidates for revascularization after injection of stem cells in
      territories with residual viability.

      The screening of patients will be performed after contrast coronar ventriculography realized
      for diagnostic or prognostic purpose.

      Subsequently all patients will be evaluated by cardiac ce-MR and PET imaging for verification
      of inclusion criteria.

      Patients will be allocated in a single blind manner to one of two therapeutic arms: surgical
      revascularization alone or surgical revascularization associated with autologous bone marrow
      derived stem cells injection in viable territories.

      During the follow up evolution of left ventricular volumes and contractility will be analyzed
      by ce-MR and PET imaging at 1 year. Additionally patients' functional status will be assessed
      by metabolic stress tests and quality of life questionnaire at 6 months, 1 year and 2 years.
