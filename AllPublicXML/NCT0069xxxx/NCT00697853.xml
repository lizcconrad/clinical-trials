    <textblock>
      This study is undertaken to assess the immune response and safety profile of 4 lots of the
      novel adjuvanted hepatitis B vaccine that were formulated following different processes, with
      Engerix™-B as the control vaccine

      This is an open, randomized study with five groups, but the four groups receiving HBV-MPL
      candidate vaccine are double-blinded.

      At the time of conduct of this study, the sponsor GlaxoSmithKline was known by its former
