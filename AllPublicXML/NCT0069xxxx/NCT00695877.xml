  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Successful control of the HIV epidemic will require a safe and effective vaccine to be
      developed. A successful vaccine will need to stimulate a widespread immune response. The
      purpose of this study is to determine the safety of and immune response to an adenovirus
      serotype HIV vaccine in HIV uninfected adults.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Control of the HIV pandemic can only be achieved with the development of a safe and effective
      preventive HIV vaccine. A vaccine that will prevent HIV infection will elicit a strong immune
      response from both CD4 and CD8 cells. Recombinant adenovirus serotype vectors have been shown
      to elicit just such a response. The purpose of this study is to determine the safety and
      immunogenicity of the recombinant adenovirus serotype 5 preventive HIV-1 vaccine.

      This study will last 18 to 24 months. Participants will be randomly assigned to one of four
      arms that will receive vaccine or placebo administered via intramuscular injection.
      Participants in Arms 1, 2, and 3 will all receive 3 injections. Participants in Arm 4 will
      receive one injection. For most participants, there will be 10 study visits in this study;
      for participants in Arm 4, there will be only 7 visits. For Arms 1, 2, and 3, study visits
      will occur at baseline and on Days 0, 14, 28, 42, 56, 168, 182,196, and 365. Participants in
      Arms 1, 2, and 3 will receive injections on Days 0, 28, and 168. For participants in Arm 4,
      study visits will occur at baseline and on Days 0, 14, 28, 56, 168 and 365. Participants in
      Arm 4 will receive one injection only, on Day 0. Participants will be asked to record their
      temperature and other side effects in a symptom log for 3 days after each injection. Risk
      reduction/pregnancy prevention counseling and physical exams will occur at all visits. At
      most visits, blood, urine, and oral swab collection will occur. Samples collected will be
      stored for future testing. HIV testing and pregnancy testing will occur at select visits. At
      Years 2, 3, 4, and 5, participants will be followed-up by telephone, e-mail, or study visit
      to collect vital status, and information about any development of significant disability or
      incapacity, hospitalizations, or congenital anomalies. At these follow-up visits, blood
      collection will be optional.
