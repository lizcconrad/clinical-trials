    <description>LBH589 will be administered orally at a dose of 30mg (1 - 20mg capsule and 2 - 5g capsules) on Monday, Wednesday and Friday of each week (three times a week). Patients may continue treatment with oral LBH589 until they experience unacceptable toxicity that precludes further treatment, disease progression, and/or at the discretion of the investigator.
The LBH589 capsules should be swallowed by mouth with a glass of water in the morning. The recommended way to take LBH589 is after not eating for at least 2 hours. You should also not eat for another 2 hours after taking your LBH589 capsules. The daily dose of LBH589 should be taken at approximately the same time each day. You should avoid eating grapefruit, seville oranges, or drinking grapefruit or seville orange juice during the study.</description>
