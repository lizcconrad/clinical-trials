    <textblock>
      The first phase was a double-blind crossover design of methylphenidate in the treatment of
      adult ADHD. The second phase consisted of an open-label extension trial of methylphenidate in
      adult ADHD. It was hypothesized that methylphenidate would prove more effective than placebo
      in treating ADHD symptoms during the first phase. It was also hypothesized that
      methylphenidate responders from the double-blind trial would continue to benefit from
      treatment in the second phase. Improvement would include both ADHD symptoms and social
      adjustment.

    <textblock>
      All patients received a single-blind week on placebo, followed by a double-blind random
      assignment crossover trial of methylphenidate and placebo, with each double-blind phase
      lasting two weeks. Subjects who experienced moderate or marked improvement on methylphenidate
      would be allowed to enter a long-term, open-label trial. ADHD symptom severity was measured
      monthly by a structured interview, the Wender-Reimherr Adult Attention Deficit Disorder Scale
      (WRAADDS), Clinical Global Impression - Improvement (CGI-I) and Global Assessment of
      Functioning (GAF). Social functioning was assessed by the clinician administered version of
      the Weissman Social Adjustment Scale (WSAS). Dosing was determined by clinical judgement,
      symptom improvement and AEs.

    <description>This is the active treatment arm of the double-blind placebo controlled phase. Patients were begun at 10 mg t.i.d. and the dose increased as necessary until a maximum dose of 60 mg/day was administered. Frequency could be increased and some patients had dosage schedules of 4 to 6 times per day</description>
