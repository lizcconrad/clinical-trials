    <textblock>
      This NON INTERVENTIONAL OBSERVATIONAL STUDY is conducted in Europe. The primary aim is to
      observe the haemostatic efficacy of NovoSeven® treatment during routine practice in German
      clinics. The observational study observes patients with congenital haemophilia with
      inhibitors to coagulation factors VIII or IX, acquired haemophilia, congenital FVII
      deficiency, or Glanzmann's thrombasthenia who have received at least one dose of NovoSeven®
      for treatment of a bleeding episode or for the prevention of a bleeding when undergoing
      surgery or an invasive procedure.
