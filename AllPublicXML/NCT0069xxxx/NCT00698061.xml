    <textblock>
      Subjects who had not responded to previous hepatitis B vaccination were vaccinated with
      either the adjuvanted HBV-MPL vaccine or Engerix™-B vaccine according to a three-dose
      vaccination schedule (0, 1, 2 months) and boosted at Month 12 as per their group allocation.
      The immunogenicity and safety of the HBV-MPL vaccine were compared with the control vaccine,
      Engerix™-B.
