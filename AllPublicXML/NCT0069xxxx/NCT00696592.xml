  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II study was designed to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of
      bevacizumab treatment in conjunction with PDT at the low fluence rate compared with
      bevacizumab alone or combined with PDT at the standard fluence rate, in patients with all
      types of choroidal neovascularization secondary to AMD.

      Hypothesis: bevacizumab in combination with PDT (low and standard fluence rate) will i) delay
      time to retreatment, ii) reduce the average number of treatments required compared to
      bevacizumab alone and iii) at low PDT fluence rate will improve long-term safety profile.

          -  Any intraocular surgery within 2 months in the study eye.

          -  Prior retinal or vitreous surgery including posterior segment vitrectomy or scleral
             buckling in the study eye.

          -  Any significant ocular disease that has compromised or could compromise vision in the
             study eye.

          -  Prior stroke, myocardial infarction, or end-stage malignancy.

          -  Active hepatitis or clinically significant liver disease, renal failure.

          -  Patients who are in an experimental therapy study or who have received experimental
             therapy within the last 12 weeks.

          -  Patients who are a poor medical risk because of other systemic diseases or active
             uncontrolled infections.
