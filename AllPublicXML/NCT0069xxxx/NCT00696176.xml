  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary goal of this study is to evaluate the safety of a transcription factor decoy
      targeting Signal Transducer and Activator of Transcription 3(STAT3) in patients with head and
      neck cancer. The rationale for targeting STAT3 using this approach is to decrease
      STAT3-mediated gene regulation. The study has the following scientific objectives:

        1. To assess the safety of a single dose of intratumoral STAT3 decoy.

        2. To estimate the effect of STAT3 decoy therapy on STAT3 activation levels, STAT3-mediated
           gene expression, and apoptosis in treated tumors.

      The decision to proceed with an exploratory IND study to be conducted in a phase 0 setting
      was based upon the expectation that the trial will involve very limited human exposure to the
      STAT3 decoy, and as administered, will have no therapeutic or diagnostic intent. Rather, the
      trial is designed to determine if intratumoral administration of the STAT3 decoy in human
      head and neck tumors inhibits STAT3 target gene expression. Given the cumulative evidence
      supporting STAT3 as a therapeutic target in cancer, and the absence of any clinical trial to
      date using a STAT3 inhibitor, it was felt that there would be utility in a proof of principal
      study to determine if the STAT3 decoy inhibits the expression of STAT3 target genes in human
      head and neck cancers. To support the proposed study design, the Grandis lab carried out a
      kinetic study in a xenograft model of SCCHN. Preliminary results demonstrated that
      administration of the STAT3 decoy, but not the mutant control decoy, decreased expression of
      STAT3 target genes (Bcl-xL and/or Cyclin D1) at time points ranging from 1 to 6 hours.
