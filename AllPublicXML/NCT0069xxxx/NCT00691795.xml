  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Epidural analgesia is widely regarding as the most effective analgesic strategy for labor
      pain. Modern practice is to utilize dilute local anesthetics as a continuous infusion along
      with an opioid, e.g., our common &quot;recipe&quot; of 12 ml/hr of 0.0625% bupivacaine with 2
      micrograms/ml fentanyl, after the initial dose to maintain patient comfort until delivery.
      This dose of the infusion often provides adequate comfort without interfering with the
      mobility of the patient and her ability to effectively push during delivery. However, this
      low dose epidural infusion strategy often results in recurrence of pain after an initial pain
      free period.

      This breakthrough pain is treated by administering small boluses of analgesics via the
      epidural catheter. The pain occurring in labor is initially of visceral origin and is
      mediated by pain fibers originating from the low thoracic and upper lumbar segments of the
      spinal cord. As labor progresses to the late first phase (also known as transitional stage),
      pain sensations originating from the distension of the pelvic floor, vagina and perineum adds
      a somatic component to labor pain. This type of breakthrough pain is often difficult to
      treat.

      Although requests from patients to alleviate late stage breakthrough pain are common, no one
      knows the most effective strategy for pain management in this stage of labor. This study is
      designed to compare the efficacy of two treatments for controlling late first stage
      breakthrough pain during labor with an epidural infusion in place: clonidine-bupivacaine
      versus fentanyl-bupivacaine.

      Women who have labor epidural analgesia in place will be enrolled to be randomized if and
      when they present with breakthrough pain in the late first stage or second stage of labor (â‰¥
      8 cm dilated). They will receive 8 ml of a solution containing 10 mg bupivacaine and 75
      micrograms of either fentanyl (an opioid or &quot;narcotic&quot;) or clonidine (an &quot;alpha-2 agonist
      known to be effective as an epidural analgesic).

      Pain relief, labor progress and outcome will be assessed to compare fentanyl versus
      clonidine.

      It is the hypothesis of this study that clonidine added to bupivacaine is a better analgesic
      than fentanyl added to bupivacaine for breakthrough pain in advanced labor.
