    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the immunogenicity and safety of different formulations of the
      candidate HBV-MPL vaccine administered according to a 2-dose schedule and compare it to that
      of Engerix™-B administered according to a 3-dose schedule in order to determine the optimal
      dose of each component of the candidate HBV-MPL vaccine when administered at 0 and 6 months
