  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and to
      establish the recommended phase 2 dose of oral OSI-027 when administered via 3 schedules,
      namely, intermittent, weekly, and continuous in patients with advanced solid tumors or
      lymphoma, namely, intermittent, weekly, and continuous.

      The study will open with Schedule 1 (S1, intermittent) with initiation of Schedule 2 (S2,
      weekly) and Schedule 3 (S3, continuous), which may occur in parallel after observation of
      clinically significant related dose limiting toxicity (DLT) in the S1 schedule. Dosing will
      be initiated on Day 1 with intermittent weekly dosing continuing for 21 days (1 Treatment
      Period). Expansion of Dose Escalation Cohorts may occur for S1 and S2 at the recommended
      phase 2 dose level(s) and a Biomarker Expansion Cohort may be opened in S1 and/or S2.
