    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the potential to decrease the use of IV anesthesia drugs in patients
      undergoing pleuroscopy administering lidocane standardly applied to the skin in combination
      with atomized lidocaine applied into the pleural cavity.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Most patient discomfort results from direct manipulation or contact with the parietal pleura
      during chest tube placement, talc instillation or pleural biopsy. This study intends to use
      combined IV, intradermal and intrapleural anesthesia during pleuroscopy procedures.
      Intrapleural atomized lidocaine will be applied directly to the parital pleura. This study
      will evaluate intravenous anesthesia reduction in subjects treated with intrapleural
      lidocaine, reduction in total procedure timeby minimizing interruptions due to poor pain
      control, reduce perioperative pain scores and improve patient comfort nad to determine safety
      of fixed dosage of 3 mg/kg intrapleural lidocaine given during pleuroscopy.

    <description>Patients randomized to arm two will receive a reduced topical dose of lidocaine of 2mg/kg and additional lidocaine 3mg/kg infused into the pleura cavity. Duration of procedure will be monitored from the time initial dose of intradermal lidocaine until the start of surgical wound closing, pain scale will be administered prior to the procedure and at the end of the procedure. Lidocaine serum levels will be monitored at 30, 60, and 120 minutes after initial intradermal administration of lidocaine.</description>

    <description>Study group will have up to 2 mg/kg of Lidocaine administered to the skin and additional Lidocaine(3mg/kg)infused through an atomizer using a specialized tip attached to the sterile leur lock syringe into the pleural cavity. The Intrapleural lidocaine dose will be given in a fixed dose of 3 mg/kg. Serum levels will be obtained at 30, 60, and 120 minutes after initial intradermal administration</description>
