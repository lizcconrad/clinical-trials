  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Individuals with Autism Spectrum Disorder will have abnormal DESAÂ® results. Our objective is
      to use neuroelectrical measures to determine the degree of processing abnormalities in
      individuals with Autism. The study will survey processing patterns and will locate and
      evaluate the degree(s) of abnormalities for further study. The abnormal results of
      comprehensive neuroelectrical evaluations of individuals with Autism when compared to the
      normative database will provide objective, verifiable, neurophysiological information with
      which to form novel approaches to the disorder.

      The research method will be: gathering, analyzing and utilizing data.

      We will observe research subjects through neuroelectrical instrumentation, then, compare
      results to retrospective information collected from research subjects and a normative
      database.

      A qualified neurologist thoroughly familiar with electrophysiology will interpret the data,
      and analyze it to explore the abnormalities.

      The hypothesis will be evaluated.

      We will, then, utilize the results to find data-based forms of treatment for those with the
      disorder.

        The study population includes individuals with Autism without exclusion on the basis of
        sex, gender, race or ethnicity. There will be 100 research subjects, with a ratio of four
        males to one female, and those being approximately sixty-five children and thirty-five
        adults.
