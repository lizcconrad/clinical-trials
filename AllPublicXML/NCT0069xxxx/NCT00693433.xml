    <textblock>
      This phase I trial is studying the side effects and best dose of temsirolimus when given
      together with dexamethasone in treating patients with recurrent or refractory multiple
      myeloma. Temsirolimus may stop the growth of cancer cells by blocking some of the enzymes
      needed for cell growth. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as dexamethasone, work in different
      ways to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from
      dividing. Giving temsirolimus together with dexamethasone may kill more cancer cells.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the toxicity and safety of temsirolimus in combination with dexamethasone in
      patients with recurrent or refractory multiple myeloma.

      II. To assess a dose of temsirolimus that is capable of inhibiting the mammalian target of
      rapamycin (mTOR) in myeloma tumor cells.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the efficacy of temsirolimus in combination with dexamethasone in these
      patients.

      II. To correlate the efficacy of this regimen with molecular characteristics of the
      individual tumor clones.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter, dose-escalation study of temsirolimus.

      Patients receive temsirolimus intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes once weekly on days 1, 8,
      15, and 22 and oral dexamethasone once on days 1, 2, 8, 9, 15, 16, 22, and 23. Courses repeat
      every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients undergo bone marrow aspiration and blood sample collection periodically for
      correlative studies. Correlative studies include analysis of p70S6 kinase activity in
      peripheral blood mononuclear cells and in multiple myeloma cells; analysis of the degree of
      AKT phosphorylation and degree of PTEN expression in multiple myeloma cells by
      immunohistochemistry; Ras mutational analysis; and Myc 5'UTR mutational analysis.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed for 4 weeks.

    <description>We will examine a scatter plot of the absolute and Percent change in PBMNC versus the absolute and percent change in BM. Spearman (non-parametric) and Pearson (parametric) correlation coefficients and linear and/or spline smoothing regression on either the original or a transformed scale will be used to assess the relationship. We will compare mean and median levels in those who respond versus those who do not using the Wilcoxon rank sum test and we will report the percent of overlap in P70 between the two groups. Assessed using analysis of variance methods or their non-parametric analog.</description>

    <description>Assessed by immunohistochemistry (IHC). We will first carry out a bivariate assessment of AKT percent positivity versus the binary outcome of response versus no response to treatment.
