      This is a single-arm, phase IV, open-label, prospective, non interventional study in
      approximately 600 patients that will be followed for 6 months in order to evaluate the safety
      and efficacy of quetiapine. Patients will be switched over a 4 to 7 day cross-titration
      period from their previous antipsychotic medication to quetiapine according to the approved
      SPC.
