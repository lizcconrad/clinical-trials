        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Informed Consent obtained &amp; signed:

             Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document.

          2. Disease characteristics:

             Patients with BCG refractory superficial transitional cell carcinoma, refractory
             carcinoma in situ, multiple unresected T1 and Ta high grade.

             BCG-refractory STCC is defined as when there is failure to achieve disease-free state
             at six months after initiation of BCG therapy either as primary or repeat therapy or
             recurrence of tumor within three months of completion of adequate induction or
             maintenance therapy or adequate retreatment. .

          3. Patient Characteristics:

        Age: 18 completed years and above Performance status: ECOG 0-2 Life expectancy: At least 24
        weeks Hematopoietic:Hemoglobin â‰¥ 9.0 g/dL

        Co-morbidity

          -  No patient who has eczema will be allowed to participate in this study.

          -  Patients who are immuno-compromised will not be enrolled.

          -  Patients with severe hepatic dysfunctions or with evidence of Cirrhosis will not be
             enrolled.

          -  Patients with uncontrolled diabetes mellitus will not be enrolled in the study.

        Note: The effects of Investigational product on the developing human fetus at the
        recommended therapeutic dose are unknown. For this reason and because other therapeutic
        agents used in this trial are known to be teratogenic, women of child bearing potential and
        men must agree to use adequate contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control;
        abstinence) prior to study entry and for the duration of study participation. Should a
        woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while participating in this study, she
        should inform her treating physician immediately.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients who have had cytotoxic chemotherapy or radiotherapy prior to entering the
             study.

          -  Intractable urinary tract infection.

          -  No patient who has eczema should be allowed to participate in this study.

          -  Patients who are immuno-compromised should not be enrolled.

          -  Patients with severe hepatic dysfunctions or evidence of Cirrhosis should not be
             enrolled.

          -  History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic
             composition to agents used in the study.

          -  Pregnant women or nursing women are excluded from this study because agents used in
             the study have potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects. Because there is
             known potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of
             the mother with investigational agent, breastfeeding should be discontinued if the
             mother is treated with investigational product.

          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac
             arrhythmias, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with
             study requirements.

          -  Previous splenectomy

          -  Clinically significant active infection

          -  Patients with uncontrolled diabetes mellitus.
