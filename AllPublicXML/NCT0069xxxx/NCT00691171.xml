      The purpose of the study is to examine the impact of augmented, high-quality
      physician-coordinated care executed via an electronic health record (EHR)-based intervention
      on quality of care for gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) and for gastroprotection for
      patients on chronic non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) at increased risk for
      upper GI tract ulcers and ulcer related complications.
