    <textblock>
      The purpose of this observational study is to examine the clinical outcomes of the use of
      sirolimus as base therapy in kidney allograft recipients from Expanded Criteria Donors (ECD)
      under conditions of routine clinical practice. The primary objective is to identify the
      current criteria/reasons to use sirolimus as base therapy in this selected population and
      define and understand the emerging patterns of immunosuppressive treatment with sirolimus.

    <description>The study employ a questionnaire which included different clinical criteria to determine the main medical reason for the introduction of sirolimus (Rapamune) therapy after renal transplant. The physician responsible selected the one that was considered the main reason for introduction of sirolimus (Rapamune) as base immunosuppressive therapy.</description>

    <description>Diagnosis of acute rejection was made via kidney biopsy. Categorization of biopsies with suspected acute rejection was based on histological findings using updated 1997 Banff criteria: Grade 1A: significant interstitial infiltration (greater than [&gt;] 25 percent [%] of parenchyma affected) and foci of moderate tubulitis (5-10 cells/tubular cross section), Grade 1B: significant interstitial infiltration (&gt;25% of parenchyma affected) and severe tubulitis (&gt;10 mononuclear cells/tubular cross section), Grade 2A: mild-moderate intimal arteritis, Grade 2B: severe intimal arteritis comprising &gt;25% of the luminal area and Grade 3: transmural arteritis and/or arterial fibrinoid change and necrosis of medial smooth muscle cells. Probability of no acute rejection throughout the sirolimus (Rapamune) therapy was estimated using Kaplan-Meier method.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 1 or 2, 4 or 5, 12 or 13, 24 or 25, 52 or 53</time_frame>
    <description>Creatinine clearance (CCr) is a measure of glomerular filtration rate (GMFR), an index of kidney function. CCr is the volume of blood plasma that is cleared of creatinine by the kidneys per unit time. Normal values for healthy, young males are in the range of 100-135 milliliter per minute (mL/min) and for females, 90-125 mL/min. Creatinine clearance decreases with age. A low creatinine clearance rate indicates poor kidney function.</description>

        <title>Average Creatinine Clearance</title>
        <description>Creatinine clearance (CCr) is a measure of glomerular filtration rate (GMFR), an index of kidney function. CCr is the volume of blood plasma that is cleared of creatinine by the kidneys per unit time. Normal values for healthy, young males are in the range of 100-135 milliliter per minute (mL/min) and for females, 90-125 mL/min. Creatinine clearance decreases with age. A low creatinine clearance rate indicates poor kidney function.</description>

An SAE was an AE resulting in any of the following outcomes or deemed significant for any other reason: death; initial or prolonged inpatient hospitalization; life-threatening experience (immediate risk of dying); persistent or significant disability/incapacity; congenital anomaly.</description>
