    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to perform a five-year, prospective evaluation of the Copeland™
      Humeral Resurfacing Head Prosthesis for outcome and durability. Relief of pain and
      restoration of function will determine long-term clinical outcome while durability will be
      measured by the absence of revisions.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Non-inflammatory degenerative joint disease including osteoarthritis and avascular
             necrosis.

          -  Rheumatoid arthritis

          -  Correction of functional deformity

          -  Reconstructable Rotator Cuff

          -  Treatment of acute fracture of the humeral head

          -  Traumatic arthritis

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients less than 18 years.

          -  Patients with rapid joint destruction, osteomalacia, osteoporosis, or marked bone
             loss, which would preclude proper fixation of the prosthesis.

          -  Patients with marked bone loss apparent on roentgenogram.

          -  Metabolic disorders, which may impair bone formation.

          -  Patients who are pregnant.

          -  Patients with an active or suspected infection in or around the shoulder or distant
             foci of infections, which may spread to the implant site.

          -  Patients with severe instability or deformity of the ligaments and/or surrounding soft
             tissue, which would prelude stability of the prosthesis.

          -  Patients who have had revision procedures where other devices or treatments have
             failed.

          -  Patients with a highly communicable disease or diseases that may limit follow-up (e.g.
             immuno-compromised conditions, hepatitis, active tuberculosis, neoplastic disease,
             etc).

          -  Patients unwilling or unable to comply with a rehabilitation program for a cemented or
             cementless partial or total shoulder replacement or who indicate difficulty or
             inability to return for follow-up visits prescribed by the study protocol.

          -  Patients with previous shoulder surgery or conditions that may interfere with the
             partial or total shoulder replacement's survival or outcome.

          -  Patients who qualify for inclusion in the study, but refuse consent to participate in
             the study.

          -  Patients who have had a partial or total shoulder arthroplasty on the contralateral
             shoulder within the last year.
