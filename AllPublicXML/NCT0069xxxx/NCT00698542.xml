      The Patient Safety Screening Tool (PSST) for Sepsis solution is a tool to assist with the
      early detection of Sepsis and management of the administration of bundle packages as defined
      by the Institute for Healthcare Improvement (IHI). This web based application relies on
      integration with bedside medical equipment (BME) data as well as Lab and Registration data so
      that clinical workflow items can be automated in the fight against Sepsis.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The workflow that is automated by the PSST for Sepsis solution is tightly integrated with
      Registration, Bedside Monitoring Equipment (BME), and Lab data. As patients arrive in the
      unit, workflow activities are started with patient context. Typical implementations of the
      IHI guidelines for Sepsis screening dictate that patients are rescreened on regular intervals
      to detect Sepsis. The PSST for Sepsis solution will monitor Lab and BME data stores and
      continually update the screening forms for a particular patient. It will also alert
      clinicians when a manual screen is required in the Microsoft InfoPath form. The constant
      screening loop is managed by the PSST for Sepsis solution and will continue to run until the
      patient screens positive for Severe Sepsis, or moves to the next workflow of auditing a
      patient with Sever Sepsis.

      When patients reach a state of &quot;positive screen&quot; (either manually, or through the automated
      data monitors) the PSST for Sepsis solution will move this patient from a screening workflow
      to an auditing workflow automatically. The PSST for Sepsis solution will then monitor the
      treatment process through Microsoft InfoPath form posts and alert clinicians when treatment
      goals have not been met. After a successful auditing process and completion of the 6 and 24
      hour bundles, the patient will be placed back into a screening workflow. The end result is
      that patients will remain in a screening/auditing workflow loop until the patient is
      discharged from the unit.

        This study will be located in the 22 bed Vanderbilt University Medical Center Neuro Care
        Unit (NCU). Every patient will be screened for sepsis according to the following workflow
        upon admission to the NCU. The patient population of the NCU is generally bimodal; the
        first group consists of post-operative patients with an average length of stay of three to
        five days. The second group consists of subarachnoid hemorrhage patients with an average
        length of stay of 45 days.
