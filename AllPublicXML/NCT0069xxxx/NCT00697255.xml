  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this trial is to evaluate whether a corifollitropin alfa (Org 36286)
      regimen applying a single or repeated dose of corifollitropin alfa followed by a low daily
      dose of Human Chorion Gonadotropin (hCG) or recombinant Follicular Stimulating Hormone
      (recFSH) can induce monofollicular growth (one follicle ≥18 mm and no other follicle ≥15 mm
      at day of bolus injection of hCG) in women with WHO group II anovulatory infertility.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This trial will include two separate stages (Ia+Ib and II).

      Stage Ia will be open-label and uncontrolled in a small cohort of women (n=5) to explore
      whether the intended dosing regimen of corifollitropin alfa followed by daily low dose recFSH
      provide an appropriate response in eligible participants meeting all inclusion and none of
      the exclusion criteria.

      Stage Ib will be open-label and uncontrolled in a small cohort of women (n=5) to explore
      whether the intended dosing regimen of corifollitropin alfa followed by daily low dose hCG
      provide an appropriate response in eligible participants meeting all inclusion and none of
      the exclusion criteria.

      Stage II is open-label and randomized (n=40) to evaluate whether the intended dosing regimen
      of corifollitropin alfa followed by low dose FSH (n=20) or hCG (n=20) provide an appropriate
      response in eligible participants meeting all inclusion and none of the exclusion criteria.

    <measure>Percentage of Participants With Monofollicular Response (Monofollicular Rate)</measure>
    <time_frame>At day of bolus injection of hCG (up to 20 days)</time_frame>
    <description>The monofollicular rate was defined as the number of participants with monofollicular response (one follicle ≥18 mm and no other follicle ≥15 mm on the day of the bolus injection of hCG) divided by the number of the treated participants.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of Participants With Ovulation (Ovulation Rate)</measure>
    <time_frame>8 days after bolus injection of hCG (up to 28 days)</time_frame>
    <description>Ovulation rate was defined as the number of participants with confirmed ovulation (≥15 nmol/l serum progesterone eight days after the bolus injection of hCG) divided by the number of treated participants. Ovulation was also considered confirmed for participants who became pregnant, had an ectopic pregnancy or had a miscarriage.</description>

    <measure>Percentage of Participants With Monofollicular Ovulation (Monofollicular Ovulation Rate)</measure>
    <time_frame>8 days after bolus injection of hCG (up to 28 days)</time_frame>
    <description>Monofollicular ovulation rate was defined as the number of participants with monofollicular response (one follicle ≥18 mm and no other follicle ≥15 mm on the day of the bolus injection of hCG) and confirmed ovulation (≥15 nmol/l serum progesterone eight days after the bolus injection of hCG) divided by the number of treated participants.

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of Participants Who Cancelled Treatment (Cancellation Rate)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 3 weeks after bolus injection of hCG (up to 41 days)</time_frame>
    <description>Treatment was considered cancelled if no bolus injection of hCG was administrated. Reasons of treatment failure included Adverse Event (AE)/ Serious Adverse Event (SAE), insufficient ovarian response on stimulation day 13 (no follicle ≥12 mm), insufficient ovarian response after 7 days of hCG/recFSH treatment (no follicle ≥18 mm), and multifollicular growth (≥3 follicles ≥15 mm).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Participants With Pregnancy</measure>
    <time_frame>At least 10 weeks after bolus injection of hCG (up to 13 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>A pregnancy test (serum or urinary hCG) was performed two to three weeks after bolus injection of hCG. In case of a positive pregnancy test vaginal and/or abdominal ultrasound scan was performed to confirm the pregnancy at 5 to 6 weeks after bolus injection of hCG and ≥10 weeks after bolus injection of hCG to confirm ongoing pregnancy.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Participants With AEs of Ovarian Hyperstimulation Syndrome (OHSS)</measure>
    <time_frame>During In-Treatment Period (up to 14 weeks after first corifollitropin injection)</time_frame>
    <description>OHSS was classified on study based on a slightly modified WHO Scientific Group (1973) classification: Grade I (mild) = characterized by excessive steroid secretion and ovarian enlargement (5-7 cm). Abdominal discomfort, including abdominal pain, is present. Grade II (moderate) = characterized by distinct ovarian cysts (ovary size 8-10 cm), accompanied by abdominal pain and tension, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea. Grade III (severe) = characterized by enlarged cystic ovaries (ovary size &gt;10 cm), accompanied by ascites and occasionally hydrothorax. Abdominal tension and pain may be severe. Pronounced hydrothorax together with an abdominal cavity filled with cysts and fluid elevating the diaphragm may cause severe breathing difficulties. Large quantities of fluid inside the cysts and in the peritoneal and pleural cavities cause haemoconcentration and increased blood viscosity. In rare cases, the syndrome may further be complicated by the occurrence of thromboembolic phenomena.</description>

As soon as the largest follicle reaches a size of ≥12 mm, the participant will start daily SC injections with FSH (Stage 1A: 50 IU, Stage II: 75 IU) the same day. A bolus injection of hCG (5000 IU) will be administered if at least one follicle is ≥18 mm and in total no more than two follicles ≥15 mm are observed.</description>

        <description>A pregnancy test (serum or urinary hCG) was performed two to three weeks after bolus injection of hCG. In case of a positive pregnancy test vaginal and/or abdominal ultrasound scan was performed to confirm the pregnancy at 5 to 6 weeks after bolus injection of hCG and ≥10 weeks after bolus injection of hCG to confirm ongoing pregnancy.</description>

        <title>Number of Participants With AEs of Ovarian Hyperstimulation Syndrome (OHSS)</title>
        <description>OHSS was classified on study based on a slightly modified WHO Scientific Group (1973) classification: Grade I (mild) = characterized by excessive steroid secretion and ovarian enlargement (5-7 cm). Abdominal discomfort, including abdominal pain, is present. Grade II (moderate) = characterized by distinct ovarian cysts (ovary size 8-10 cm), accompanied by abdominal pain and tension, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea. Grade III (severe) = characterized by enlarged cystic ovaries (ovary size &gt;10 cm), accompanied by ascites and occasionally hydrothorax. Abdominal tension and pain may be severe. Pronounced hydrothorax together with an abdominal cavity filled with cysts and fluid elevating the diaphragm may cause severe breathing difficulties. Large quantities of fluid inside the cysts and in the peritoneal and pleural cavities cause haemoconcentration and increased blood viscosity. In rare cases, the syndrome may further be complicated by the occurrence of thromboembolic phenomena.</description>
