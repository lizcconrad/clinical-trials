      This protocol (GENEFU) provides a mechanism for the 15-year followup period that the FDA
      requires for all participants in gene transfer protocols and assures that adequate followup
      can be maintained for a wide variety of participants on different individual gene therapy
      protocols at St. Jude Children's Research Hospital.

      GENEFU serves as an umbrella protocol for long-term follow-up (LTFU) for recipients of gene
      therapy/gene marked (GT/GM) products at St. Jude Children's Research Hospital. The FDA has
      recommended methods to assess the risk of delayed adverse events after GT/GM and has provided
      specific requirements regarding the duration and design of LTFU observations. This protocol
      is intended to provide LTFU in accordance with the FDA guidelines for those who received a
      GT/GM product as part of a St. Jude-sponsored clinical trial or compassionate use treatment
      plan. The protocol calls for a physical examination or general health evaluation and
      collection of required blood samples annually for up to 15 years after the last receipt of a
      GT/GM product.

      Goals will be to obtain clinical histories in order to detect late clinical outcomes
      suggestive of retroviral or lentiviral disease, including but not limited to cancer/second
      malignancies, neurologic disorders, autoimmune disorders, and hematologic disorders. Blood
      samples will be archived and tested when clinically or scientifically indicated, as in the
      event of development of a second malignancy. This prospective cohort study will utilize
      descriptive statistics in the analysis of long-term late effects outcomes. It offers a
      uniform approach to long-term safety monitoring in research participants who have received a
      gene-transduced product as part of St. Jude-sponsored GT or GM protocols and compassionate
      use treatment plans.

      Secondary objectives include the following: to obtain and archive blood samples to 1) detect
      frequency of vector marking in peripheral blood mononuclear cells when clinically or
      scientifically indicated, such as in the event of participant development of second
      malignancy, autoimmune disease, hematologic abnormality, or neurologic event, and; 2) To
      obtain and archive blood samples to detect and characterize clonal proliferation events
      occurring in gene transfer trials when clinically or scientifically indicated.
