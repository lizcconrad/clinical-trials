    <textblock>
      The overall aim of this study is to explore the effects of flaxseed supplementation and
      determine whether it is a feasible and potentially effective dietary intervention among women
      with polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS). Women, ages 18-45, with clinically confirmed PCOS
      (N=20) will be scheduled for baseline measures and then instructed and given supplies
      necessary to follow a flaxseed supplemented (30 g/day) diet for a period of three months,
      whereupon follow-up measures will be taken. Subjects will be asked to resume their typical
      (unsupplemented) diet for another three months and a second set of follow-up measures will be
      taken. Baseline levels of bioavailable and total testosterone, fasting insulin, glucose, and
      triglycerides (TG), total/LDL/HDL cholesterol, body weight, degree of hirsutism and acne, and
      menstrual cyclicity will be compared to levels at 3 and 6 month follow-up. The overall
      hypothesis (based upon our work in men at risk for prostate cancer and data from one
      case-study conducted in a woman with confirmed PCOS) is that during the time women receive
      flaxseed supplementation they will experience reduced serum levels of testosterone, and total
      and LDL cholesterol, as well as clinical evidence of hirsutism. Given the pilot nature of
      this study, statistical analyses will be limited to simple descriptive statistics. We have
      observed no negative side effects, other than minor gastro-intestinal occurrences (i.e.,
      temporary increased flatulence, borborygmi, increased number of stools, etc.) associated with
      flaxseed supplementation in our previous studies either with short or long-term use. Flaxseed
      supplementation will be discontinued if indicated and the events reported to the
      institutional review board.
