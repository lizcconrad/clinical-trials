  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This observational study will evaluate the incidence of new vertebral and non vertebral
      fragility fractures in patients with severe osteoporosis treated with anabolic drugs. This
      study will also evaluate BMD, compliance to treatment, back pain and the health-related
      quality of life.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The participants should be treated with anabolic therapy for osteoporosis (Teriparatide or
      PTH 1-84) for 18 months and should be followed up for subsequent 6 months. The treatment is
      expected to improve bone mineral density, back pain and reduce the risk of new fractures due
      to osteoporosis. The outcomes will be evaluated by bone densitometry at the lumbar spine and
      femoral neck, by standard radiographs, by measurements of bone formation marker (P1NP) and by
      questionnaires on back pain and quality of life. Postmenopausal women and men over 21 years
      old may be included if they have:

        1. at least 3 severe vertebral fractures

        2. 2 severe vertebral fractures and 1 hip fracture

        3. an incidental vertebral fracture or an hip fracture during treatment with
           antiresorptives prescribed for at least 12 months.
