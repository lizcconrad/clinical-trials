  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      As there are no clinical data in cardiology about the relationship between metabolism
      collagen changes and their clinical significance, the investigators will check the hypothesis
      that collagen metabolism changes, detected by biochemical markers for collagen metabolism,
      could predict the left ventricle remodelling and prognosis in patient with clinically
      significant pressure overloaded left ventricle.

      Clinical assessment and endpoints:

      1ST day (the day of entering the hospital or the day of the first contact): Informed consent
      (see below), clinical examination, ECG, complete echocardiography evaluating the function of
      the left ventricle (EF) and the presence and the significance of valvular disease, basic
      laboratory tests incl. CKMB, troponin I, taking of blood samples (5 ml) for the detection of
      collagen metabolism markers serum level, X-ray of chest, 2nd-3rd day: clinical examination,
      ECG, basic laboratory tests incl.CKMB, troponin I (only group I) 4th day: clinical check up,
      ECG, echocardiography, taking of blood samples (5ml) for the detection of collagen metabolism
      markers serum level (only group I) 30th day: clinical examination l, ECG, echocardiography,
      taking of blood samples (5ml) for the detection of collagen metabolism markers serum level,
      24 hrs ECG monitoring (holter) 6 months: clinical examination, ECG, echocardiography, taking
      of blood samples (5ml) for the detection of collagen metabolism markers serum level, holter
      monitoring

      1 year: history, clinical examination

      Primary endpoint: combined clinical endpoint: death/repeated hospitalisation due to heart
      failure/myocardial infarction within 30 days and during 1 year follow up.

      Secondary endpoints: rehospitalisation for cardiovascular reason, clinically significant
      arrhythmias, correlations between left ventricle parameters evaluated by echocardiography and
      collagen metabolism changes evaluated by serum markers
