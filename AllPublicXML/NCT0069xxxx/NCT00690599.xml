      The aim of the study was to evaluate the socioeconomic patient's profile and their level of
      satisfaction in the general dental practice clinic. A cross-sectional quantitative study was
      accomplished with 80 patients assisted at the referred service. A solely-applied
      questionnaire was used regarding the following aspects: structure and environment, fear and
      anxiety, reliability, empathy and commitment, resolutivity and quality of the accomplished
      services. It was observed that the assisted patients' profile consisted predominantly of a
      female sample (71,2%), that completed the medium learning (31,2%) and/or that didn't finish
      the fundamental level (26,2%). Moreover 50% of them presented a family income of 1 to 2
      minimum salaries and 41,2% were unemployed. As the quality of the rendered technical service,
      nearly 70% of the users considered it great, as well as the clinic's structure and
      environment. Regarding the satisfaction with to the received treatment, 76,2% of the
      interviewees gave the maximum score of 10 and 95% would recommend the attendance to others.
      It is concluded that the patients are satisfied with the clinical attendance accomplished by
      the students in the general practice dental clinic at UNIFOR, in what refers to its technical
      and functional quality.
