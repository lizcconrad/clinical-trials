      Rationale: Investigation of the circadian rhythm of erythropoietin and melatonin in patients
      with various degrees of renal insufficiency

      Objectives:

      Primary objective: Is there a circadian rhythm of epo and melatonin in patients with various
      degrees of renal insufficiency?

      Primary Objective: Is there a circadian rhythm of epo and melatonin in patients with various
      degrees of renal insufficiency compared to patients with a normal renal function?

      Secondary Objective: Is there a circadian rhythm of cortisol and IGF in patients with various
      degrees of renal insufficiency?

      Secondary Objective: Is there a circadian rhythm of cortisol and IGF in patients with various
      degrees of renal insufficiency compared to patients with a normal renal function?

      Study design: Comparative study in 4 groups with various degrees of renal insufficiency,
      duration for each patient 24 hrs. Total duration of study 12 months, patients admitted to the
      hospital (on nursing ward)

      Study population: Patients with various degrees of renal insufficiency

      Main study parameters/endpoints: Analysis of the existence of a circadian rhythm in patients
      with a normal renal function and in patients with variable degrees of renal insufficiency

      Nature and extent of the burden and risks associated with participation, benefit and group
      relatedness: Better knowledge of the circadian rhythm in renal insufficiency. This could lead
      to a more efficient administration of erythropoietin and melatonin in the future.

      Extent of burden is 1 venapunction for placement of infusion needle, the withdrawal of 11
      times 5 ml blood in 24 hrs, continuous measurement of body temperature via capsule, 24-hour
      continuous ambulant blood pressure monitoring.
