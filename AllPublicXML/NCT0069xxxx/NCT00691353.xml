      Cross - Sectional study requiring one visit at the investigators office for the data
      collection.

        -  Target Group: Patients that suffer from Bipolar Disorder Type 1.

        -  YMRS - HAMILTON and GAF scales are going to be used to assess the clinical outcome. The
           findings are going to be based on the different scores reported by Specialists (before
           the patients started to use as a therapy atypical antipsychotics / at the time that the
           visit actually takes place for the cause of the study.) We predefine the time period
           that the patient should be using atypical antipsychotics at minimum (2 months).

        -  The first 9 consecutive patients that visit the Specialist and meet the entry criteria
           and signs the ICF will be recruited in the study.
