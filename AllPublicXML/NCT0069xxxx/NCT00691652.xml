      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as clofarabine, work in different ways to stop
      the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing.
      Monoclonal antibodies, such as rituximab, can block cancer growth in different ways. Some
      block the ability of cancer cells to grow and spread. Others find cancer cells and help kill
      them or carry cancer-killing substances to them. Giving clofarabine together with rituximab
      may kill more cancer cells.

      PURPOSE: This phase I/II trial is studying the side effects and best dose of clofarabine when
      given together with rituximab and to see how well they work in treating patients with
      relapsed B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  To determine the maximum tolerated dose of clofarabine in adult patients with relapsed
           CD20-positive B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL).

        -  To estimate objective response rates of clofarabine in combination with rituximab in
           these patients.

      Secondary

        -  To determine the 1-year progression-free survival of this regimen using the mean
           tolerated dose in these patients.

        -  To determine the safety and efficacy of this regimen in these patients.

        -  To determine if clofarabine acts as an inhibitor of DNA methylation similar to
           cladribine by performing scientific correlates.

        -  To determine whether response to clofarabine alone or in combination with rituximab
           correlates with changes in global serum DNA methylation index.

        -  To identify the gene activated by clofarabine therapy by using genomic DNA and RNA array
           technology.

      OUTLINE: This is a phase I, dose-escalation study of clofarabine followed by a phase II
      study.

      Patients receive oral clofarabine once daily on days 1-14 of all courses and rituximab IV on
      days 1, 8, 15, and 22 of course one and then on day 1 of courses 2-8. Courses repeat every 4
      weeks. After 2 courses of therapy, patients who are eligible for stem cell transplantation
      may either undergo transplantation or continue receiving study drugs until disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity for up to a total of 8 courses of treatment.

      Patients undergo blood sample collection periodically for correlative studies. Samples are
      analyzed to identify global DNA methylation differences and correlate changes in methylation
      index (MI) with patient outcome after treatment with clofarabine with or without rituximab
      via high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC); to determine differences in gene
      expression via microarray analysis and micro-RNA (miRNA) expression via quantitative
      polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in patients with high compared to low global DNA methylation
      index and miRNA expression for CD5+ B-lymphocytes obtained from pediatric tonsils and from
      B-lymphocytes of 5 healthy controls; and to determine gene expression and miRNA profiles in
      patients before and after treatment with clofarabine with or without rituximab via genomic
      DNA arrays.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed once a year for 2 years.

    <description>Administered weekly times 4 weeks and then monthly during the study for up to 8 cycles and will be given on day 1 of clofarabine. A peripheral or central intravenous (IV) line will be established. The initial dose rate at the time of the first infusion should be 50/mg/hr for the first hour. If no toxicity is seen, the dose rate may be gradually escalated (50 mg/hr increments at 30 minute intervals) to a maximum of 300 mg/hr. If the first dose of rituximab is well tolerated, the starting flow rate for the administration of subsequent doses will be 100 mg/hr then gradually increased (100 mg/hr increments at 30 minute intervals) not to exceed 400 mg/hr.</description>

    <description>we will scan the microarray slides with an Axon scanner, and quantify data using the GeneSight software. Local background is subtracted and data points with no signal, high background, or spot asymmetry are eliminated. We will adjust genes with low expression and low signal intensity to a minimal raw value of 5: This avoids unwarranted mathematical distortions due to division by decimals &lt;&lt; 1. After calculating the ratio of the Cy5 /Cy3 fluorescence signal intensity for each gene, we normalize the data relative to the mean intensity from all genes.</description>

    <description>Fifteen µg of DNA will be sonicated for 60 seconds on ice into 200 bp-1000 bp fragments. Samples are then denatured at 1000C for 5 minutes and cooled on ice to prevent re-annealing. Sixty units of nuclease S1 (Invitrogen) and 112.5 mu of snake venom phosphodiesterase I (Sigma) in 12 µl of S1 dilution buffer is then added to the samples and incubated at 370C for 18 hours. Samples are reheated to 1000C for 5 minutes, snap cooled again on ice, and another sixty units of nuclease S1 and 112.5 mu of snake venom phosphodiesterase I are added and incubated at 370C for another 4 to 6 hours. The pH of each sample was raised to 8.5 with 0.5 M Tris, pH 10. Two and a half units of alkaline phosphatase (Sigma) are added and incubated for 2 additional hours at 370C. One hundred µl of 0.05M potassium phosphate, pH 7 is added to final samples before 50 µl of the clear supernatant is injected into the reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC).</description>

        <description>Initially, 3 patients will be enrolled into a dose level during the dose-escalation portion:
If no patient experiences dose-limiting toxicities during the first 4 weeks, then 3 patients will be enrolled into the next dose level.
If one of the three patients develops dose-limiting toxicities, then 3 additional patients will be enrolled in that cohort. If none of the additional 3 patients experiences dose-limiting toxicities, then further dose-escalation occurs.
If one additional patient experiences dose-limiting toxicities, then the maximum tolerated dose is exceeded.</description>
