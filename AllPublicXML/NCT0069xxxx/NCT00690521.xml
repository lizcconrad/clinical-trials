      The purpose of this research study is to compare the effectiveness of hydrochlorothiazide or
      metolazone in combination with furosemide. Patients with heart failure suffer from swelling
      because of too much fluid in the body. Furosemide, hydrochlorothiazide, and metolazone are
      all water pills used to treat the swelling. For most patients, taking furosemide alone is
      successful. However, sometimes patients need to add another water pill. Doctors usually add
      either metolazone or hydrochlorothiazide. It is not clear which water pill is better when
      added to furosemide. The purpose of this study is to determine which water pill when added to
      furosemide is the best at reducing excess fluid in the body.

      Objective: To establish which combination of diuretics is the most effective in promoting
      diuresis in congestive heart failure patients. Secondary Objectives: To determine the
      duration of action of furosemide as monotherapy and in combination with either
      hydrochlorothiazide or metolazone. To determine the effect of diuretic combination therapy on
      neurohormonal activation. Background: Diuretic resistance occurs when a potent diuretic drug,
      such as furosemide, is given in therapeutic doses and fails to reduce extracellular fluid
      volume to the desired level in an edematous patient. Studies have shown that metolazone and
      hydrochlorothiazide have demonstrated a synergistic response when used in combination with
      furosemide in congestive heart failure patients. The current guidelines for treating diuretic
      resistance in congestive heart failure patients recommend the metolazone-furosemide
      combination. However, there is no evidence to conclude that this combination is superior to
      hydrochlorothiazide-furosemide in increasing diuresis. Methods: Randomized, double-blind,
      crossover study to compare the efficacy of hydrochlorothiazide and metolazone in combination
      with stable doses of furosemide in 13 patients with congestive heart failure. The primary
      endpoint will be change in urinary output. Secondary endpoints will be changes in weight,
      neurohormones (angiotensin II, catecholamines, brain natriuretic peptide, aldosterone), and
      electrocardiographic parameters of ventricular instability. Study procedures will be
      performed at the UNM General Clinical Research Center. Patients will be hospitalized for 2
      separate 4-day admissions, separated by a 1-week washout period. At each admission each
      patient will receive furosemide in combination with either metolazone or hydrochlorothiazide
      (metolazone for one admission and hydrochlorothiazide for the other). Following
      administration of combination therapy, blood and urine samples will be collected throughout
      the day to chart the onset and magnitude of effect of each treatment regimen. Various
      hemodynamic, renal, endocrine, and neurohormonal parameters will be assesed as will the
      effect of each combination treatment on ventricular instability using 12-lead
      electrocardiography. Data will be analyzed using ANOVA to compare changes from baseline and
      the Student t-test to analyze intertreatment differences.

      All statistical analysis will be performed using SAS v6.12.

    <description>Patients will be randomized to receive either metolazone or HCTZ in a randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled crossover trial. The patients will receive the alternative medication if The specific dose of hydrochlorothiazide will be determined by the individual's creatinine clearance. A creatinine clearance of 30-50 mL/min will indicate a dose of 50 mg per day. A creatinine clearance of &gt; 50 mL/min will indicate a dose of 25 mg per day.5 If metolazone is added to their regimen, the specific dose will be determined using the equivalence ratio of 5 mg metolazone to 50 mg hydrochlorothiazide.</description>
