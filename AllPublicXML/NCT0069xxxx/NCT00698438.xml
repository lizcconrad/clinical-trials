      the purpose of this study was to compare standard trabeculectomy to the Ex-PRESS mini
      glaucoma shunt implantation under a scleral flap in eyes with open-angle glaucoma.In this
      report, we describe the results of a prospective, randomized trial in which subjects with
      bilateral primary open-angle glaucoma underwent the two procedures in fellow eyes.Design:
      Prospective, randomized clinical trial.

      Participants: 15 subjects with bilateral primary open-angle glaucoma Methods: Subjects
      underwent the two procedures in fellow eyes. Safety and efficacy were evaluated for up to two
      years.

      Main Outcome Measures: Mean IOP and surgical success rates. Results: Mean IOP was similar in
      Ex-PRESS and trabeculectomy eyes at all time points except month 9, when Ex-PRESS eyes had
      lower mean IOP (13.2 mmHg vs 16.5 mmHg, respectively; p=0.025). Percent IOP reduction was
      also similar at all time points except postoperative day 1, when trabeculectomy eyes were
      lower (75.5% vs 65.8%, respectively; p=0.003), likely due to a higher rate of early hypotony
      in trabeculectomy eyes versus Ex-PRESS eyes (47% vs 7%, respectively). Complete (without
      medications) and qualified (with or without medications) successes were more common at all
      IOP cut-off values in Ex-PRESS eyes than trabeculectomy eyes at last visit (p=0.015, p=0.015
      respectively). Postoperative complications were uncommon in both groups, but trabeculectomy
      eyes required more postoperative interventions than Ex-PRESS eyes.

    <description>I. Mobility check of the device. II. Administration of a local or topical anesthetic. III. Preparation and coverage of the eye by conventional sterile procedures. IV. Injection of viscoelastic material into the AC through a paracenthesis. V. Creation of a scleral tunnel up to clear cornea. VI. Creation of a (5 mm) conjunctival tunnel fornix based. VII. Lifting of the conjunctiva and tenon. VIII. Formation of a 2mm scleral incision at 0.3mm depth, 1.5mm from the limbus. IX. Application of 0.5Âµg/ml MMC under the tunnel for one minute.
X. Penetration into the AC using a 0.65mm stiletto, inside the tunnel of the sclera-corneal junction.
XI. Implantation of the Ex-PRESSTM through that pre-incision at the sclerocorneal junction.
XII. Introducer withdrawal. XIII. Tucking the plate under the scleral tunnel, and verification of the position inside the tunnel.
XIV. Reposition the conjunctiva with 1 - 2 sutures at the limbus. XV. Closing the conjunctiva with a suture.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects were at least 18 years of age and

          -  Had medically uncontrolled primary open-angle glaucoma requiring incisional surgery
             for reduction of intraocular pressure in both eyes.

          -  Subjects with prior cataract or failed filtration surgery in either eye were eligible
             to participate if surgery occurred at least 3 months prior to enrollment.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Any form of glaucoma other than primary open-angle glaucoma;

          -  History of or active uveitis; or

          -  Any ocular abnormality that would prevent accurate assessment of intraocular pressure
