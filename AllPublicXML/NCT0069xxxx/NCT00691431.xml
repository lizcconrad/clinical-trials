      This study compared the clinical outcomes between fellow eyes randomized to either IntraLase
      femtosecond laser-created flaps or Hansatome mechanical keratome-created flaps during
      wavefront-guided laser in situ keratomileusis.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        Inclusion criteria were &quot;T 6.00 D of spherical myopia, &quot;T 3.00 D of refractive astigmatism,
        stable refraction (less than 0.50D per year of sphere or cylinder), corneal diameter less
        than 11.0 mm to allow for suction fixation ring, soft contact wearer with discontinuation
        of wear at least 7 days prior to preoperative evaluation, visual acuity correctable to at
        least 20/20 in both eyes, more than 21 years of age, ability to participate in follow-up
        examinations for 12 months after LASIK surgery. In order to fairly compare the visual
        outcomes of the two keratomes, patients were required to have closely matched eyes, in
        terms of refractive error. Exclusion Criteria:Exclusion criteria include rigid gas
        permeable contact lens wearer, severe dry eyes, severe blepharitis, anterior segment
        pathology (cataracts or corneal scarring or neovascularization within 1 mm of intended
        ablation zone), recurrent corneal erosion, severe basement membrane disease, progressive or
        unstable myopia or keratoconus, unstable corneal mires on central keratometry, corneal
        thickness in which LASIK procedure would result in less than 250 micros or remaining
        posterior corneal thickness below the flap postoperatively, baseline standard manifest
        refraction &gt; 0.75 D more minus in sphere power, or a difference of greater than 0.50D in
        cylinder power compared to baseline standard cycloplegic refraction, two eyes for which the
        baseline standard cycloplegic refraction differ from each other more than 0.75 in sphere,
        0.50 D in cylinder, or have a different type of astigmatism (i.e. with-the-rule) when the
        cylinder is &gt; 0.50D, or preoperative assessment of ocular topography and/or aberrations
        indicates that either eye is not suitable candidate for LASIK vision correction procedure
        (ie forme fruste keratoconus, corneal warpage, or pellucid marginal degeneration), previous
        intraocular or corneal surgery, and history of herpes zoster or simplex keratitis, patients
        on systemic corticosteroid or immunosuppressive therapy, immunocompromised subjects or
        clinically significant atopic disease, connective tissue disease, or diabetes, steroid
        responder, macular pathology, pregnant or lactating patients, patients with sensitivity to
        planned study concomitant medications or patients participating in another ophthalmic drug
        or device clinical trial.
