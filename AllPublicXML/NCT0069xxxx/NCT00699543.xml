      Objectives

      : To evaluate the clinical efficacy, angiographic outcomes, and safety of the new
      paclitaxel-eluting coronary stent (CoroflexTM Please, B Braun, Germany), compared with
      another paclitaxel-eluting coronary stent system (TaxusTM, Boston Scientific, USA) in the
      treatment of coronary stenosis.

      Study Design

      : Prospective, open label, 2: 1 randomized multi-center trial. Patients will be randomized
      according to the type of drug eluting stent ( CoroflexTM Please vs. TaxusTM). Randomization
      will also be stratified per hospital for the presence of DM and the presence of long lesions
      (lesion length &gt; 28mm)

      Patient Enrollment

      :915 patients enrolled at 13 centers in Korea.

      Patient Follow-Up

      :Clinical follow-up will occur at 1, 4, 9, 12 months and 2, 3years after intervention.
      Investigator or designee may conduct follow-up as telephone contacts or office visits.

      Primary Endpoint

      :Clinically driven Target vessel Revascularization (TVR) at 9 months.

      Secondary Endpoints

      :A. Clinical safety and efficacy end points

        1. Major Cardiac Adverse Events (MACE; All Death, cardiac death, Myocardial infarction
           (Q-wave and non-Q wave), TVR)

        2. Target Vessel Failure (TVF; cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, clinically
           driven TVR)

        3. Stent thrombosis

      B. Angiographic efficacy end points

        1. in-stent binary restenosis by QCA

        2. in-stent and in-lesion late loss by QCA

        3. in-stent and in-lesion MLD and percentage diameter stenosis by QCA immediately after the
           index procedure and at 9 months of follow-up
