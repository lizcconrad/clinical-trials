      Working toward Wellness is a telephone care management and outreach monitoring program
      designed to help Medicaid recipients who are experiencing major depression to enter and
      remain in evidence-based treatment. To study the effects of Working toward Wellness,
      individuals receiving Medicaid in Rhode Island who are eligible for mental health services
      through United Behavioral Health were screened by telephone for depression. Those who were
      found to have major depression and who agreed to be in the study were randomly assigned.
      Program participants received intensive monitoring from Master's level clinicians called care
      managers to facilitate and support clinical treatment. The control group received usual care
      that included only referrals to mental health treatment providers. The study hypothesis is
      that telephonic care management would increase visits to mental health professionals and use
      of appropriate medication, which in turn would reduce depression severity and lead to greater
      employment and productivity at work.

    <description>Individuals received intensive outreach from care managers, first to help them to enter treatment and then, if treatment began, to remain in it for an appropriate time. Treatment is based on the American Psychiatric Association's Evidence-Based Practice Guidelines for Major Depression, which includes psychotherapy and antidepressant medications. Outreach and care management took place by telephone.</description>
