      The purpose of this prospective clinical data collection is to document the performance and
      clinical outcomes of the M2a-Magnum™ Hip System

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a 10 year prospective data collection documenting the function and survivorship of
      the M2a-Magnum™ Hip System. Patients are required to come in for preoperative, operative, one
      year follow-up, three year follow-up, five year follow-up, and ten year follow-up exams.

      This product was FDA cleared in 2004.
