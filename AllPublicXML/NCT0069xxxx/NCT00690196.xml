  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Breast Cancer is the most common cancer in women. After completion of successful therapy, may
      behavioral symptoms persist with over 20% of breast cancer survivors reporting chronic
      insomnia of greater than 6 months duration that fulfils clinical diagnostic criteria with
      associated functional limitations, decreased quality of life, and possible effects on
      long-term survival. Behavioral interventions are highly efficacious in the treatment of
      insomnia and preferred over hypnotic medication when insomnia is chronic. However, insomnia
      studies conducted in cancer are scarce. The proposed research builds upon program of study
      that has examined the efficacy of mind-body intervention, Tai Chi Chih (TCC), on health
      outcomes including sleep impairments. Preliminary studies show that TTC, a slow moving
      meditation, contributes to improvement in subjective sleep quality, sleep amounts and sleep
      efficiency. The investigators have further found that sleep, fatigue and proinflammatory
      cytokine activity are reciprocally related and that TCC decreases the mechanism through TCC
      carries its effects on sleep outcomes.

      This investigation is a randomized controlled trial that will evaluate the effects of
      cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) and Tai Chi Chih (TCC) on objective and subjective
      measures of sleep, on mood and fatigue, on health functioning and on two biological
      parameters, sympathovagal tone and proinflammatory cytokine activity in older adults with
      insomnia. One hundred breast cancer survivors will be randomly assigned to CBT, or TCC.
      Patients will be assessed at pre-treatment, during midtreatment, post-treatment, 3-month
      follow-up and 12-month follow-up. At all 5 assessment periods, indices of sleep quality as
      measured by sleep diaries and clinical ratings will be obtained along with measures of mood,
      health functioning, proinflammatory cytokine activity and heart rate variability (HRV). The
      pre-treatment and post-treatment assessment periods will also include all-night
      polysomnography along with nocturnal sampling of proinflammatory cytokine activity and HRV
      tone. Hence, polysomnographic measures of sleep which are coupled with nocturnal measures of
      cytokines by serial blood sampling will occur at the baseline assessment and again at the
      post-treatment assessment. During midtreatment and at 3 month follow-up and 12 month
      follow-up, we will obtain questionnaire ratings of sleep quality along with a single morning
      sample of cytokine levels.

    <description>Tai Chi Chih (TCC) employs &quot;meditation through movement&quot; as a means of helping breast cancer survivors cope with fatigue, perceived physical limitations, and negative emotional states which are commonly associated with insomnia. In groups of 7-8, subjects will learn to perform 20 movements under the guidance of expert TCC teacher (K. Hollister, certified instructor) who will oversee treatment sessions throughout the 12 week treatment, consistent with our preliminary studies (9). Sessions will be taught over 120 minutes with 90 minutes of active TCC, 20 minutes of warm-up (e.g., stretching, breathing),10 minutes of cool down. Sessions will be mainly given in the late afternoon at 16:00 h. Thus, the TCC will be given once a week per week for a total of 120 minutes, similar in total time allocation with Cognitive Behavioral Therapy. The final week of treatment will include the development of a TCC adherence plan to ensure continuity of practice and skill maintenance during follow-up.</description>

    <description>Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) for insomnia will be supervised by a Ph.D. level psychologist, with specialty training in behavior therapy and behavioral medicine. The CBT sessions will be held once a week for 120 minutes (each session) over the 12-week treatment period, identical to the time schedule which was to be used for health education. Treatment will be given in small groups of 7-8 subjects. The content of the intervention will be organized around a series of modules that will be presented to patients in manualized form. For each session, the CBT treatment manual will outline objectives, patient skills, and treatment activities. Therapists will direct role-playing and other skill-development exercises that will be designed to increase patients' self-efficacy in managing their insomnia. Homework assignments will be planned weekly to ensure practice and skill application.</description>
