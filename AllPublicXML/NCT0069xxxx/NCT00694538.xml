      The purpose of this study is to determine the advantages of the interferential laser therapy
      in shoulder pain reduction compared with the conventional low level laser therapy modality.

    <textblock>
      The spatiotemporal superposition of two independent and opposite beams of laser generates a
      constructive interference pattern that increases the therapeutic effects in the irradiated
      tissue. Patients diagnosed of shoulder pain from different musculoskeletal disorders will
      received conventional or interferential laser therapy. This is a comparative, randomized and
      double - blind clinical study. Two identical equipments of near infrared laser therapy will
      be used. Number of sessions: 15. Frequency of the sessions: daily. Irradiation technique:
      manual, contact and punctual.Pain will be evaluated by visual analog scale (VAS) at rest and
      during analytical shoulder movements (abduction, adduction, internal rotation, external
      rotation, flexion, extension) and by means of a pain and disability index (SPADI).
      Evaluations will take place at pre and post treatment.

    <description>Two GaAlAs laser (810 nm, 100mW)were used. In the interferential laser treatment, two probes were simultaneously applied. In the conventional laser group, only one probe was switched on. Laser was applied at five points over the pain area. The laser emission mode was continuous with an energy dose of 6 joules per point and session, a power density of 1.09 w/cm2 and an irradiation time per point of 60 s. The average output power was 100 mW and the total energy dose delivered in a patient session was 30 J. Every treatment was along 15 sessions. Hence, the accumulated energy delivered on the whole was 450 Joules for the conventional group of patients (using one beam) and 900 Joules for the interferential one (using two beams).</description>
