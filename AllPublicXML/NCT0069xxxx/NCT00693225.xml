  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study was to determine the effect of morning versus bedtime
      administration of omeprazole/sodium bicarbonate (Zegerid) on endoscopic healing for patients
      with moderate or severe reflux esophagitis. Our hypothesis was that bedtime administration of
      Zegerid would be superior in healing esophagitis compared to morning administration prior to
      a meal.

      Hypothesis: The timing of administration of omeprazole/sodium bicarbonate (Zegerid) will
      impact nocturnal esophageal acid exposure and healing of esophagitis. Specifically, we
      hypothesize that omeprazole/sodium bicarbonate, taken at bedtime, will be superior in healing
      esophagitis compared to omeprazole/sodium bicarbonate taken in the morning.

      Specific Aim: Compare the percent of subjects with moderate/severe esophagitis who achieve
      complete endoscopic resolution after 8 weeks of treatment (morning vs. bedtime).

      Intervention: All subjects received a one-on-one educational session describing the normal
      physiology of the upper gastrointestinal tract, the pathophysiology of hiatal hernia and
      reflux esophagitis, and food stuffs that contribute to reflux, prior to their invitation to
      participate in the trial. Outpatients who underwent a clinically indicated
      esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) as advised by their primary health care provider in an
      open-access endoscopy unit who were diagnosed with Los Angeles grade C or D erosive reflux
      esophagitis were invited to participate.

      Omeprazole/sodium bicarbonate powder for oral suspension 40 mg was supplied in individual
      packets that are emptied into a small cup containing 15-30 ml (1-2 tablespoons) of water, one
      per day, for 8 weeks. They were asked to stir well and drink immediately then refill the cup
      with water and drink. Subjects assigned to morning dosing were instructed to take the
      medication on an empty stomach, immediately upon rising, 20 to 60 minutes prior to chewing a
      solid. Subjects assigned to bedtime dosing were instructed to keep the medication by their
      bedside; taking the medication in a standing or seated upright position immediately before
      turning off the lights with the intention to sleep. The subject was instructed to not use
      other liquids or foods for 20 minutes after taking their study medication for those allocated
      to morning dosing, and until the next morning for those allocated to bedtime dosing.

      Gelusil™ was distributed for use as an &quot;on demand&quot; rescue antacid; the frequency of use was
      recorded with the plan to use Gelusil™ consumption as a potential confounder of
      omeprazole/sodium bicarbonate efficacy. Other antacids, including sodium bicarbonate,
      magnesium hydroxide, calcium carbonate, and sucralfate were prohibited. Subjects taking
      non-omeprazole proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) and/or Histamine Receptor Antagonist (HRAs) were
      advised to discontinue these medications while they participated in this study. No other
      medication was altered for this study.

      After 8 weeks, a follow-up EGD was performed to assess mucosal integrity by an endoscopist
      blinded to the study and subject allocation.

             (PPI)(s) or histamine receptor antagonist (HRA) were invited to participate without a
             wash-out period.

          3. Subjects able to return to Mayo Clinic Rochester for follow up endoscopy 8 weeks after
             start of study.

             following criteria is met:

               2. At least one year postmenopausal (no menses for greater than or equal to 12
                  months).

               3. Subject is using a highly effective method of contraception, if of childbearing
                  potential and has a negative urine human chorionic gonadotropin beta subunit
                  (B-HCG) pregnancy test during screening, and prior to trial drug administration.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Subjects already on or failed omeprazole in past, or intolerant of PPI therapy

          2. Subjects who are using clopidogrel (Plavix)

          3. Subjects with one or more of the following diagnoses:

               1. Neoplasm of the esophagus or stomach

               2. Previous upper gastrointestinal surgery (esophagectomy, Heller myotomy, hiatal
                  hernial repair)

               3. Diabetic gastroparesis

               4. Esophageal motility disorder: Achalasia or scleroderma

               5. Zollinger-Ellison syndrome

              10. Disorders which predispose to unreliable responses such as Schizophrenia,
                  Alzheimer's disease or significant memory loss

              11. Pregnant and lactating females will be excluded as PPIs are not thought safe for
                  the fetus (Pregnancy Category C).

          4. Children younger than 18 years of age will be excluded as their compliance might be
             dictated by others, such as their parents, and their results would not be
             generalizable to the adult population. Other vulnerable populations, such as those
             with diminished mental acuity, will be excluded for the same reason.

          5. Residence outside of the US (due to difficulties with overseas postal service) or in
             prison.

      <pi_employee>All Principal Investigators ARE employed by the organization sponsoring the study.</pi_employee>
      <restrictive_agreement>There is NOT an agreement between Principal Investigators and the Sponsor (or its agents) that restricts the PI's rights to discuss or publish trial results after the trial is completed. </restrictive_agreement>

    <limitations_and_caveats>Our methods relied upon pill counting as a proxy for adherence to medical therapy. Now that PPIs are available over the counter, few patients present de novo with LA C and LA D esophagitis. We didn't control for other factors that can affect GERD.</limitations_and_caveats>
