    <measure>Mean Percent Change in Reflective Total Nasal Symptom Score (rTNSS) From Baseline</measure>
    <time_frame>14 Days minus baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Responses to patient-completed diaries for reflective Total Nasal Symptom Scores (rTNSS). TNSS is composed of 4 individual assessments, which included runny nose, itchy nose, stuffy nose, and sneezing; each of the 4 assessments were rated using a 4 point scale that ranged in whole units from 0 (none) to 3 (severe). All 4 assessments are then added together for a composite score (TNSS score), the maximum of which could be 12. Reflective scores were assessed from the hour since the last dose of study medication.</description>

        <title>Mean Percent Change in Instantaneous Total Nasal Symptom Score (iTNSS) From Baseline</title>
        <description>Responses to patient-completed diaries for instantaneous Total Nasal Symptom Scores (iTNSS). TNSS is composed of 4 individual assessments, which included runny nose, itchy nose, stuffy nose, and sneezing; each of the 4 assessments were rated using a 4 point scale that ranged in whole units from 0 (none) to 3 (severe). All 4 assessments are then added together for a composite score (TNSS score), the maximum of which could be 12. Instantaneous scores were assessed at the time of daily dosing.</description>

        <description>Responses to patient-completed diaries for reflective Total Ocular Symptom Scores (rTOSS). TOSS is composed of 3 individual assessments of ocular symptoms (itching/burning, tearing/watering, redness) each of the 3 assessments were rated using a 4 point scale that ranged in whole units from 0 (none) to 3 (severe). All 3 assessments are then added together for a composite score (TOSS score), the maximum of which could be 9. Reflective scores were assessed from the hour since the last dose of study medication.</description>
