        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. males

          2. age 12-15

          3. a minimum level of physical skill to mount and dismount the vehicle

          4. ability to speak and understand English.

        We have used this age group because it is the most often injured group and represents an
        entire age group for ATV size restriction (other age groups not studied here are 6-11, and
        16 or greater).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. inability to participate in physical education without restrictions

          2. visual acuity &lt; 20/40 corrected

          3. females

          4. emancipated minors.

        We have excluded females to gain the most consistent body dimensions in this preliminary
        study.
