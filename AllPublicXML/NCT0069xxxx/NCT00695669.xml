  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to characterize the immunogenicity &amp; safety of 2 doses of GSK's
      avian flu vaccine GSK 1557484A given according to different regimens to adults aged 18 to 64
      years

      A Phase 2, open-label, randomized, parallel group, multi-centered study designed to evaluate
      the immunogenicity and safety of a 2-dose series of avian influenza vaccine plus AS03
      adjuvant according to different regimens, in adults aged 18-64 years. All subjects will
      receive active study vaccine; no subjects are to receive placebo. A total of 312 subjects
      will be enrolled in this study at approximately 3 study centers in Canada. All subjects will
      attend formal study center visits for safety and immunogenicity assessments on Days 0, 21,
      42, and 182. Additional formal study center visits will be scheduled at additional timepoints
      for subjects in particular dose groups. In addition, a telephone call will be conducted for
      all subjects on Day 51

        <description>A seroconverted subject was defined as a vaccinated subject who had either a pre-vaccination (Day 0) reciprocal hemagglutination inhibition (HI) titer &lt; 1:10 and a post-vaccination (at Day 14 post Dose 2) reciprocal titer ≥ 1:40 or a pre-vaccination reciprocal HI titer ≥ 1:10 and at least a four-fold increase in post-vaccination (at Day 14 post Dose 2) titer.</description>

        <population>The analysis was performed on the According-to-Protocol (ATP) cohort for immunogenicity, which included all evaluable subjects for whom immunogenicity data for the primary outcome variables were available i.e. all subjects had to have at least Day 0 and post-vaccination HI titer results for the A/Indonesia/5/05 virus.</population>
