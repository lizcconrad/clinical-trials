    <textblock>
      To determine the sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of preoperative ultrasound,
      elastography, mammography and breast MRI in women with dense breast tissue diagnosed with
      breast cancer; to test whether elastography or MRI can improve upon routine mammogram and
      conventional ultrasound in women with dense breast tissue.
