  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Children can have or develop certain problems with their heart function, specifically with
      the heart muscle or myocardium. This problem can be caused by many things specifically by
      infection resulting in myocarditis (inflammation of the heart muscle) or dilated
      cardiomyopathy (caused by many factors including high blood pressure and heart attacks). The
      body goes through many processes to repair the injured tissue including using proteins that
      cause the muscle mass to increase called matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs). The body also uses
      proteins that direct the MMPs to stop increasing the muscle mass called tissue inhibitory of
      metalloproteinases (TIMPs). Currently, there are no published studies that explain or
      evaluate the relationship that MMPs and TIMPs have in myocarditis and dilated cardiomyopathy
      in children.

      The investigator wishes to perform a prospective study of the serum levels of these proteins
      and their regulators in children with myocarditis and/or dilated cardiomyopathy and compare
      them with children that have no heart disease.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      All children who present with signs and symptoms of myocarditis and have laboratory findings
      consistent with cardiomyopathy will be eligible. After prospective consent, all subjects will
      receive: (1) a complete physical examination, (2) complete transthoracic echocardiogram to
      better characterize the disease process. Follow-up echocardiograms will be performed at 24-72
      hours after admission into the protocol and at discharge from the hospital. Approximately 2
      teaspoons of blood will be drawn at: (1) enrollment, (2) 24 hours after, (3) 72 hours after,
      (4) and at hospital discharge. Those subjects that receive a heart transplant will have blood
      drawn at the time of transplantation. For those that have a cardiac catheterization or have a
      muscle biopsy as part of their standard of care, will also have a biopsy of their right
      ventricle performed.

      Data to be collected: Minimum patient demographic data (age, sex, ethnic origin), vital
      signs, clinical course events/data (i.e. need for dialysis, length of stay, surgical time
      points, etc), diagnostic test results (EKGs, ECHOs, etc), significant medical history data,
      and standard of care laboratory results.

      The investigator wishes to evaluate the relationship of this data with the patient's
      diagnosis, clinical course, and serum levels of MMP and TIMP proteinases.
