  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with primary hepato-biliary malignancies or liver metastases from gastrointestinal
      cancer suffer substantial morbidity and mortality from their hepatic disease. Curative
      resection is feasible only for selected subgroups of patients. The majority of patients have
      unresectable and incurable disease. Aggressive arterial and systemic chemotherapy have been
      used in recent years with improved response and survival. However, a significant number of
      patients, at least one-third of patients with liver metastases from colorectal cancer and
      two-third or higher of unresectable hepatobiliary cancer, continue to die of liver failure
      from progressive disease in the liver. Percutaneous ethanol injections, chemoembolization,
      cryotherapy and thermal ablation using radiofrequency have been used to treat selected
      patients with smaller tumors (3-4 cm) in areas away from major blood vessels and the biliary
      tract. However, most unresectable liver cancers did not fit the criteria for these
      treatments. Therefore, other regional therapeutic option like external radiation therapy may
      be considered for local control in the liver or symptom palliation

    <description>Radiation Dose: 48 Gy in 4 fractions in 2 weeks. A minimum of 48 hours should separate each treatment (e.g. every Tuesday and Friday). The dose is prescribed to the marginal isodose (80-90%) that encompasses the entire target lesion (GTV). Treatment will be delivered using a linear accelerator. For verification of the accuracy of these external skin fiducial markers, 10 patients will also have implanted internal gold coil markers. The implantable gold coil markers will be implanted into the liver in the proximity of the target lesions via a percutaneous transhepatic route under fluoroscopy guidance.</description>
