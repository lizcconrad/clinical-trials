    <textblock>
      A significant number of patients with high risk superficial bladder cancer has progression to
      invasive disease. No consensus exists regarding the optimal treatment to decrease the
      recurrence and progression rate. The aim of this research is to evaluate the safety,
      tolerability and efficacy of adjuvant intravesical gemcitabine vs. BCG in the treatment of
      high-risk superficial bladder cancer

      This was a prospective, randomized study conducted from 2004 to 2006 at a single tertiary
      urban teaching University Urological Department regarding sixty-four patients with high-risk
      superficial bladder cancer (pT1, and/or G3 and/or CIS), who were assigned to interventions
      (gemcitabine or BCG) by using random allocation 1:1. Group A, 32 patients, were treated
      weekly (6 weekly instillations) with BCG dose 5 x 108 CFU and then maintenance therapy at
      3-6-12-18-24-30-36 months; Group B, 32 patients, received gemcitabine 2 gr/instillation on a
      weekly basis (6 weekly instillations), followed by maintenance therapy at 3-6-12-18-24-30-36
      months.
