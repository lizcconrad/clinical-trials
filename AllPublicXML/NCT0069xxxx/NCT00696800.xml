  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To investigate the efficacy and safety of a single injection of 150 μg Corifollitropin Alfa
      (Organon 36286) to induce multifollicular development for controlled ovarian stimulation
      using daily recombinant FSH (recFSH) as a reference. The primary hypothesis is that a single
      injection of Corifollitropin Alfa is non-inferior to daily treatment with recFSH in
      initiating multifollicular growth.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, double-blind, active-controlled, non-inferiority clinical trial
      investigating the efficacy and safety of a new treatment regimen with Corifollitropin Alfa, a
      recombinant gonadotropin applied to initiate and sustain follicular stimulation in controlled
      ovarian stimulation for Assisted Reproductive Technology (ART). For this regimen,
      participants receive a single injection of Corifollitropin Alfa and one week later, treatment
      is continued with daily recFSH up to the day of triggering final oocyte maturation. In the
      reference group participants receive daily injections of recFSH up to the day of triggering
      final oocyte maturation. Non-inferiority in ongoing pregnancy rates (assessed at least 10
      weeks after embryo transfer) will be the primary endpoint for this trial. The number of
      oocytes retrieved will be analyzed as co-primary endpoint.

    <description>An ongoing pregnancy is a fetus with heart activity at least 10 weeks after embryo transfer as assessed by Ultrasound Scan (USS) or Doppler or is confirmed by live birth. The ongoing pregnancy rate is 100 times the number of participants with an ongoing pregnancy after embryo transfer, divided by the total number of participants who started treatment. Calculations were made per attempt, meaning that participants who did not have embryo transfers were considered not pregnant.</description>

The ongoing pregnancy rate is 100 times the number of participants with an ongoing pregnancy after embryo transfer, divided by the total number of participants who started treatment.

Total and good quality embryos are presented, with good quality embryos, Grades 1 and 2, defined as the following: Grade 1: excellent: No fragmentation, 6-10 cells, and equal blastomere size taking the impact of cell division into account. Grade 2: good: &lt; 20% fragmentation, 6-10 cells, and equal blastomere size taking the impact of cell division into account.</description>
