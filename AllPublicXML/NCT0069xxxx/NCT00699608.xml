    <measure>Mean Tracking Error Assessed During the Continuous Tracking Test (CTT)</measure>
    <time_frame>7.5, 8, 8.5, 9, and 9.5 hours post-dose (double-blind)</time_frame>
    <description>Analysis was performed on the mean of the five assessments conducted 7.5, 8, 8.5, 9, and 9.5 hours post-dose (double-blind) The CTT is a task (duration of 8 minutes) of psychomotor function that entails using a slider to keep a cursor in alignment with a moving target on a visual display unit screen. The movement of the target is the function of an irregular sine wave, and cursor accuracy is measured by the mean tracking error - the difference between the centers of target and cursor in pixels, sampled 5 times per second, over the test. Lower scores are indicative of more accurate tracking.</description>

The mean reaction time, in milliseconds, to these stimuli over the trial period is taken as the response measure for this component of the divided attention task. A lower mean reaction time is indicative of better peripheral awareness.</description>

    <description>Critical Flicker Fusion (CFF) is a validated cognitive assessment task that provides an index of central nervous system (CNS) activity and attention modulated motion detection. Participants are required to discriminate flicker from fusion, and vice versa, in a set of four light-emitting diodes arranged in a one-centimetre square. These diodes are held in foveal fixation when viewed at a distance of one metre. Individual thresholds are determined on four ascending and four descending scales. The mean of the four ascending presentations give the ascending threshold frequency in hertz.</description>

The Digit Symbol Substitution Test (DSST) is a pen and paper test that consists of rows of blank squares paired with randomly assigned digits (between 0 and 9). Participants are required to substitute each digit with a different nonsense symbol, according to a key printed at the top of the sheet that indicates the nonsense symbol that corresponds to each digit. Participants are given 120 seconds in which to complete the test.</description>

    <description>The N-Back task requires the participant to indicate, using the mouse, whether the current stimulus presented on the screen and the one immediately before it visually match (i.e., &quot;one-back&quot;). In the versions of the tests used in this study, the stimuli are presented on screen for 500 ms, and the interval between stimuli is 2500 ms, with a ratio of 1:2 of &quot;match&quot; trials to non-match trials. The duration of the test is 2 minutes. The percentage of correct responses is the percentage of correct responses given in 2 minutes.</description>

    <description>The Linear Analogue Rating Scale (LARS) is used as a measure of the subjective effects of psychoactive drugs. Participants mark a series of 10 cm (100 unit line) analogue scales (1-100, 100 = most impaired) relating to dizzy, clumsy, anxious, relaxed, tired, drowsy, alert, energetic, sad, and depressed, indicating their present feeling with regard to a mid-point, representing their &quot;usual&quot; state of mind before treatment began. The higher the score, the more impaired the participant feels. The Tiredness, Alertness, Energy, and Drowsiness scores are averaged to derive an overall Sedation score.</description>

        <title>Mean Tracking Error Assessed During the Continuous Tracking Test (CTT)</title>
        <description>Analysis was performed on the mean of the five assessments conducted 7.5, 8, 8.5, 9, and 9.5 hours post-dose (double-blind) The CTT is a task (duration of 8 minutes) of psychomotor function that entails using a slider to keep a cursor in alignment with a moving target on a visual display unit screen. The movement of the target is the function of an irregular sine wave, and cursor accuracy is measured by the mean tracking error - the difference between the centers of target and cursor in pixels, sampled 5 times per second, over the test. Lower scores are indicative of more accurate tracking.</description>

        <title>Mean Tracking Error (MTE) Assessed During the CTT</title>
        <description>Analysis was performed on the individual assessments conducted at 7.5, 8, 8.5, 9, 9.5, 10, 10.5, 11, and 11.5 hours post-dose (double-blind) . The CTT is a task (8 minute duration) of psychomotor function that entails using a slider to keep a cursor in alignment with a moving target on a visual display unit screen. The movement of the target is the function of an irregular sine wave, and cursor accuracy is measured by the MTE, the difference between the centers of target and cursor in pixels, sampled 5 times per second, over the test. Lower scores are indicative of more accurate tracking.</description>

        <title>Critical Flicker Fusion Test–Ascending Threshold</title>
        <description>Critical Flicker Fusion (CFF) is a validated cognitive assessment task that provides an index of central nervous system (CNS) activity and attention modulated motion detection. Participants are required to discriminate flicker from fusion, and vice versa, in a set of four light-emitting diodes arranged in a one-centimetre square. These diodes are held in foveal fixation when viewed at a distance of one metre. Individual thresholds are determined on four ascending and four descending scales. The mean of the four ascending presentations give the ascending threshold frequency in hertz.</description>

        <population>Intent-to-Treat (ITT) Population: all participants who gave informed consent, were randomised, and received at least one dose of double-blind study medication. Only participants who had assessment of the measure the day after double-blind treatment were analyzed.</population>

The Digit Symbol Substitution Test (DSST) is a pen and paper test that consists of rows of blank squares paired with randomly assigned digits (between 0 and 9). Participants are required to substitute each digit with a different nonsense symbol, according to a key printed at the top of the sheet that indicates the nonsense symbol that corresponds to each digit. Participants are given 120 seconds in which to complete the test.</description>

        <title>Total Number of Correct Symbol Substitutions, as Assessed by the Digital Symbol Substitution Test</title>
        <description>Analysis was performed on the individual assessments conducted at 7.5, 8, 8.5, 9, 9.5, 10, 10.5, 11, and 11.5 hours post-dose (double-blind). The Digit Symbol Substitution Test (DSST) is a pen and paper test that consists of rows of blank squares paired with randomly assigned digits (between 0 and 9). Participants are required to substitute each digit with a different nonsense symbol, according to a key printed at the top of the sheet that indicates the nonsense symbol that corresponds to each digit. Participants are given 120 seconds in which to complete the test.</description>

        <description>Analysis was performed on the individual assessments conducted at 7.5, 8, 8.5, 9, 9.5, 10, 10.5, 11, and 11.5 hours post-dose (double-blind). In “3-back” tasks, a comparison is made between the current stimulus and the two before the immediately preceding stimulus. In the versions of the tests used in this study, the stimuli are presented on screen for 500 ms, and the interval between stimuli is 2500 ms, with a ratio of 1:2 of “match” trials to non-match trials. The duration of the test is 2 min. The percentage of correct responses is the percentage of correct responses given in 2 min.</description>

        <title>Sedation Score, as Assessed by the Linear Analogue Rating Scales</title>
        <description>The Linear Analogue Rating Scale (LARS) is used as a measure of the subjective effects of psychoactive drugs. Participants mark a series of 10 cm (100 unit line) analogue scales (1-100, 100 = most impaired) relating to dizzy, clumsy, anxious, relaxed, tired, drowsy, alert, energetic, sad, and depressed, indicating their present feeling with regard to a mid-point, representing their “usual” state of mind before treatment began. The higher the score, the more impaired the participant feels. The Tiredness, Alertness, Energy, and Drowsiness scores are averaged to derive an overall Sedation score.</description>
