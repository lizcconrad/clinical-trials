      The purpose of the study is to investigate the effectiveness of a sun lotion containing a
      specific Jellyfish sting inhibitor versus regular sun lotions as controls. In addition, to
      investigate the effectiveness of hot/cold immersion for the treatment of Cyanea sp stings
      versus local pain relief with prescription free pharmaceutical drug (Xylocain 30 mg/ml (3%)
      lidocain).

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>The purpose of the study is to investigate the effectiveness of a sun lotion containing a specific Jellyfish sting inhibitor versus regular sun lotions or no protection at all when in contact with Cyanea SP.</measure>
    <time_frame>Repeated jellyfish contact for total of 240 second or until pain occurs</time_frame>
    <description>We want to find out how much longer it takes before you get stung if one at all gets stung when you have a protective layer on the skin. We also want to find out if the reduction in pain is significantly less when the skin has jellyfish protection using visual analog scale (VAS).</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Investigate the effectiveness of hot/cold immersion for the treatment of Cyanea sp stings versus local pain relief with prescription free pharmaceutical drugs called Xylocain with lidocaine</measure>
    <time_frame>Pain relief treatment will start after 10 minutes, repeat treatment after 30 minutes if VAS score &gt; 10.</time_frame>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Volunteers

          -  men or women

          -  aged 18 or over

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  People with atopic diseases, e.g., asthma, allergic rhinorrhea or rhinitis, hay fever,
             or atopic skin inflammation

          -  People who suffer from skin diseases in the testing regions or whose inner forearms
             are too hairy to allow for interpretation of the test

          -  People who have used any medical or cosmetic product on either arm for 48 hours before
             the start of the experiment

          -  People who are taking antihistamines or steroids

          -  Subjects with medical conditions which, in the opinion of the investigator, pose risks
             that would prohibit participating

          -  Subjects with a history of keloid formation will be excluded from the Jellyfish
             protocol

          -  Subjects with allergy to lidocain or other local pain substances

        If the arms contain hair that might reduce the jellyfish tentacle contact with the skin,
        the arm must be shaved in advance, so the skin has no sign of piling or any skin damage
        before the test.
