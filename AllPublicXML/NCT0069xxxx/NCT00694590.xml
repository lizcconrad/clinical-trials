  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to determine if plerixafor can make CLL/SLL (Chronic
      Lymphocytic Leukemia/ Small Lymphocytic Lymphoma) cells more sensitive to being killed by
      rituximab, an anti-cancer drug that is commonly used in treating CLL and SLL. In this study,
      plerixafor will be added to standard treatment with rituximab. Subjects will be monitored to
      see how well they tolerate the use of these drugs together and how well they work to treat
      the leukemia.

      The primary objective is to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of plerixafor when
      combined with rituximab as treatment for previously treated patients with CLL or SLL.

    <description>Drug Course 1: plerixafor (20mg/mL). Dose escalation starting with 80 mcg/kg then 160, 240, 320, 420, and 540 mcg/kg, or to de-escalate to 40mcg/kg. Dosing 3 times/week for 3 weeks beginning at start of second week. Rituximab is also administered 3 times per week for 4 weeks using a fixed dose of 100 mg on Day 1 and a dose of 375 mg/m2 for all subsequent doses.
Drug Course 2: plerixafor (20 mg/m) same dose as course 1. Dosing 3 times/week for 4 weeks. Rituximab is also administered 3 times per week for 4 weeks using a dose of 375 mg/m2 for all doses.</description>
