  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      During transcutaneous mechanical nerve stimulation in spinal cord injured men an increase in
      pressure was observed in the external urethral sphincter along with an increase in bladder
      capacity. In a subsequent study it was demonstrated that TMNS in women could induce pressure
      increment of the external urethral sphincter. A pilot study have since shown that after 6
      weeks of stimulation 24 out of 33 women suffering from urinary stress incontinence were able
      to contract their pelvic floor muscles and had become free of symptoms. Another pilot study
      has shown promising effect on the overactive bladder syndrome.

      The present study aims to treat urinary incontinence and includes 3 groups of patients with
      40 patients in each group: Women suffering from urinary stress incontinence, women suffering
      from urge incontinence and men suffering from urinary incontinence after a prostatectomy. A
      medical vibrator is used and in each group the subjects will be randomized to active
      treatment or placebo treatment.

      In women the stimulation will be performed at the perineum every day for 6 weeks with an
      amplitude of 2 mm and a frequency of 100 Hz. In men the vibration parameter/location will be
      determined by the results of a pressure profile study also included. Results will be
      evaluated on the basis of questionnaires, micturition diaries and diaper tests.

      If we are able to demonstrate a significant reduction in the incontinence symptoms in the
      subjects we asses that vibration can be a way of reestablishing a normal function of the
      pelvic floor muscles and bladder function in incontinent patients.

    <intervention_name>Transcutaneous mechanical nerve stimulation by A medical vibrator (FERTI CARE personel, Multicept A/S, Albertslund, Danmark)</intervention_name>
    <description>A medical vibrator (FERTI CARE personel, Multicept A/S, Albertslund, Denmark) will be used. The stimulation works through a vibrating disc of hard plastic with a diameter of 3.5 cm. The stimulation point will be the perineum in women and the perineum or the frenulum in men.
In the women the stimulation will be performed with a vibration amplitude of 2 mm and a frequency of 100 Hz. In the men the vibration parameter/location will be determined by the results of the new pressure profile studies (aim 3).
A daily stimulation sequence consisting of 10 seconds of stimulation followed by a 10 second pause repeated 10 times will be used through 6 weeks in both the women with stress incontinence and overactive bladder syndrome.
In the 3 groups of patients the subjects will be randomized to either active treatment or placebo treatment. The placebo treatment will be done with a vibration device with an amplitude of 0 mm. Subjects will be randomized by a draw.</description>
