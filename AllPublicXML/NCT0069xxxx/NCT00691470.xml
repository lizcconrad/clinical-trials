      The purpose of this research study is to test an experimental drug ATI-5923 vs Coumadin. The
      study is intended to demonstrate ATI-5923 is superior to Coumadin for keeping INR values in
      the desired therapeutic range. Patients who require chronic anticoagulation with one or more
      of the following conditions are eligible for the study: atrial fibrillation or atrial
      flutter, prosthetic heart valve, venous thromboembolic disease, or history of myocardial
      infarction or cardiomyopathy will be enrolled.

      The primary study objective is to evaluate whether ATI-5923 is superior to adjusted dose
      warfarin in the quality of anticoagulation as measured by interpolated INR time in
      therapeutic range. This is a Phase II/III multi-center, randomized, stratified, double blind,
      parallel group, active control study comparing ATI-5923 with Coumadin in patients who require
      chronic, oral anticoagulation. Up to 600 patients who successfully complete all screening
      assessments and meet all eligibility criteria will be enrolled in the study and receive study
      drug treatment for 6-12 months depending on time of study entry.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients with one or more of the following indications for chronic warfarin
             anticoagulation (the patient may either be a new candidate for anticoagulation or may
             already be receiving warfarin):

               1. Atrial fibrillation (paroxysmal, persistent or permanent, not due to a reversible
                  cause, documented by ECG) or atrial flutter.

               2. A prosthetic heart valve in the aortic or mitral position that requires chronic
                  anticoagulation.

               3. A history of venous thromboembolic disease (DVT and/or PE) requiring long term
                  anticoagulation (&gt; 6 months).

               4. A history of myocardial infarction or cardiomyopathy requiring anticoagulation.

               5. Currently receiving chronic warfarin therapy for another indication not listed,
                  with Sponsor approval.

          2. Male or female greater than 18 years of age.

          3. Able and willing to sign IRB approved written informed consent to participate in the
             study.

          4. Able and willing to follow instructions, to comply with protocol requirements, and to
             attend required study visits.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Contraindications to anticoagulation as listed in the warfarin package insert
             (Appendix D), such as active bleeding or lesions at risk of bleeding such as gastric
             ulceration, colonic or cerebral AV malformations, cerebral or aortic aneurysms,
             pericarditis or endocarditis. Patients who have had recent (&lt; 14 days from screening)
             surgery or invasive procedures or are about to undergo surgery or other invasive
             procedures, such as lumbar puncture. Patients with blood dyscrasias or inherited
             disorders of hemostasis. Patients with a history of hemorrhagic tendencies or prior
             serious hemorrhagic events such as hemorrhage within the cranium, eye, spinal cord,
             retroperitoneum, or gastrointestinal tract.

          2. Laboratory evidence at screening of clinically significant active bleeding, such as
             unexplained positive occult blood in stool, or unexplained positive urinary blood that
             is more than trace positive for hemoglobin.

          3. Concomitant use of other anticoagulant or antiplatelet agents that may add to the
             hemostatic burden such as clopidogrel, ticlopidine, heparin or low molecular weight
             heparin (LMWH), or regular use of non selective long acting NSAIDs that cannot be
             discontinued prior to initiating ATI 5923/warfarin dosing (daily use of 81-100 mg
             aspirin is allowed).

          4. A life expectancy of &lt; 1 year, end stage renal failure requiring dialysis, end stage
             pulmonary disease requiring home oxygen, severe heart failure (NYHA class IV).

          5. Dementia, severe psychiatric disorder, or ongoing alcohol or substance abuse.

          6. Laboratory screening values indicating severe anemia (Hb &lt; 10 gm/L), thrombocytopenia
             (platelet count &lt; 90,000/mcL), or active liver disease.

          7. Patients with conditions that will interfere with determination of the INR using the
             INRatio device, i.e., hematocrit &lt;30% or &gt;55%. Patients with the antiphospholipid
             syndrome may have abnormal INR results and should not be enrolled.

          8. History of non disabling ischemic stroke within the last 3 months, prior major
             disabling ischemic stroke, or any history of intracranial bleeding.

          9. Pregnant or nursing women or women of childbearing potential who will not use adequate
             contraception, such as oral or implantable contraceptives, IUD, or barrier methods

             investigational drug within 30 days of the first dose of study medication, or patients
