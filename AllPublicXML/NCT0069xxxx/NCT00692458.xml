        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Confirmed primary State II or Stage III breast cancer

          -  Patient is not receiving adjuvant chemotherapy (e.g., cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin,
             carboplatin) at the time of randomization and has not received adjuvant chemotherapy
             for at least 6 weeks prior to the randomization visit (Visit 2). This inclusion
             criterion does not include hormone therapy, which is permitted (see inclusion
             criterion # 7)

          -  Patient is not receiving hormonal therapy OR if patient is receiving hormonal therapy
             (e.g., leuprolide, tamoxifen, anastrozole) she is on a stable regimen for at least 3
             months at the time of screening (Visit 1). If patient is HER2-positive and is
             receiving trastuzumab treatment, she must be on a stable regimen for at least 1 month
             at the time of Visit 1

          -  Patient is not pregnant or breast-feeding. All women of childbearing potential must
             have a negative urine pregnancy test at screening (Visit 1)

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Bone metastases or history of bone metastases

          -  Patient has evidence of other distant metastases (e.g., visceral, soft-tissue, or
             brain)

          -  Patient has had a prior local or regional recurrence of her breast cancer, or a
             contralateral tumor. DCIS (ductal carcinoma in-situ), and LCIS (local carcinoma
             in-situ) in either the ipsilateral or contralateral breast are permitted

          -  Patient has ANY of the following:

               1. is currently receiving a bisphosphonate or other drug therapy for osteoporosis

               2. has been treated with an oral bisphosphonate for osteoporosis for more than 3
                  months within the 2 years prior to Visit 1, or for a total of more than 6 months
                  at any time prior to Visit 1

               3. has been treated with an intravenous bisphosphonate within the 12 months prior to
                  Visit 1

          -  Patient has a history of malignancy other than breast cancer &lt;5 years prior to signing
             informed consent, except for adequately treated basal cell or squamous cell skin
             cancer or in situ cervical cancer. Patients with melanoma, leukemia, lymphoma, and
             myeloproliferative disorders of any duration are exclusionary

          -  Patient is currently participating or has participated in a study with an
             investigational compound or device within 30 days of signing the informed consent

          -  Patient is currently participating in or has at any time in the past participated in a
             breast cancer study with a registered medication (i.e., approved by the regulatory
             agency in which she resides) being tested for the treatment of breast cancer (an
             unapproved indication)
