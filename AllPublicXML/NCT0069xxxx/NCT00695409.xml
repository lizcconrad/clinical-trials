      This phase II clinical trial studies how well yttrium Y 90 ibritumomab tiuxetan, rituximab,
      and high-dose chemotherapy followed by peripheral blood stem cell transplant in treating
      patients with relapsed B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Monoclonal antibodies, such as yttrium Y
      90 ibritumomab tiuxetan and rituximab, can block cancer growth in different ways. Some block
      the ability of cancer cells to grow and spread. Others find cancer cells and help kill them
      or carry cancer-killing substances to them. Radiolabeled monoclonal antibodies can find tumor
      cells and carry tumor-killing substances to them without harming normal cells. Giving
      monoclonal antibody therapy, radioimmunotherapy (RIT), and high-dose combination chemotherapy
      before a peripheral blood stem cell transplant may be an effective treatment for non-Hodgkin
      lymphoma.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To estimate the progression free/relapse free survival and overall
      survival probabilities among patients with poor risk/relapsed follicular lymphoma (grade
      1-3), mantle cell lymphoma, diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, and transformed low-grade lymphoma
      who undergo radioimmunotherapy (RIT) based autologous stem cell transplant (ASCT).

      II. To evaluate hematopoietic recovery, using neutrophil (absolute neutrophil count [ANC] &gt;=
      500 x 10^3/ul, ANC &gt;= 1000 x 10^3/ul) and unmaintained platelet (&gt;= 20 x 10^3/ul, &gt;= 100 x
      10^3/ul) engraftment as primary criterion, following RIT based autologous stem cell
      transplant (ASCT).

      III. To characterize early and late pulmonary, cardiac and hepatic toxicities during the
      first 100 days post ASCT and again one year post ASCT.

      IV. To evaluate the response rate and the disease progression/relapse rate in patients
      treated with RIT based ASCT.

      V. To evaluate long-term incidence of myelodysplasia and therapy related acute myeloid
      leukemia (AML) with this new preparative regimen.

      VI. To descriptively compare the outcomes of patients treated on this protocol to a
      comparable patient population treated with chemotherapy alone.

      VII. To perform exploratory studies on expression of costimulatory molecules before and after
      RIT based ASCT.

      OUTLINE: RADIOIMMUNOTHERAPY: Patients receive yttrium Y 90 ibritumomab tiuxetan intravenously
      (IV) following rituximab IV on day -14.

      HIGH-DOSE COMBINATION CHEMOTHERAPY: Patients receive carmustine IV on days -7 and -6;
      etoposide IV over 1 hour twice daily (BID) and cytarabine IV over 2 hours BID on days -5 to
      -2; and melphalan IV on day -1.

      STEM CELL TRANSPLANTATION: Patients undergo autologous peripheral blood stem cell transplant
      on day 0. Patients also receive rituximab on day 8*. NOTE: * Some patients may also receive
      rituximab on day -1. Treatment continues in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up
      periodically.

             performance status (KPS) &gt;= 80

          -  No active central nervous system (CNS) disease or prior history of CNS disease

          -  Patients must have recovered from last therapy and should be at least four weeks from

             cell mobilization is not considered therapeutic) and prior to initiation of high dose
             treatment, the patient should have a baseline computed tomography (CT) scan and
             positron emission tomography (PET) scan done; an fluorodeoxyglucose-computed
             tomography (FDG/CT) scan is sufficient, however, is clinically indicated, an
             additional diagnostic CT may be ordered; exception: if scans were done and were
             negative for disease just prior to priming chemotherapy (therapeutic or
             nontherapeutic) and subsequent stem cell harvest, they do not need to be repeated
             prior to initiation of high dose treatment

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Presence of human anti-Zevalin antibody (HAZA)

          -  Abnormal cytogenetic study not related to the underlying lymphoma on the bone marrow
             aspirate sample prior to stem cell collection; if cytogenetics were not performed on

             blood may be performed

          -  Prior bone marrow transplantation

          -  Prior malignancy except for:

               -  Adequately treated basal cell or squamous cell skin cancer

               -  Adequately treated noninvasive carcinoma

               -  Other cancer from which the patient has been disease-free for at least five years

          -  Active evidence of Hepatitis B or C infection; Hepatitis B surface antigen positive

          -  Patients who have had prior radiation to the lung will be excluded from the study,
             although mediastinal irradiation will be permitted if minimal lung is in the treatment
             volume

          -  Patients who have received &gt; 500cGy radiation to the kidneys will be excluded from the
