      The aims of this study are:

        1. to compare the toxicity profile and efficacy of gemcitabine/carboplatin or docetaxel in
           East Asian and Caucasian patients.

        2. to determine the genotype distribution of genes involved in docetaxel and gemcitabine
           pathways in East Asian and Caucasian patients.

        3. to evaluate the association between genotypes and

             1. treatment toxicity

             2. treatment efficacy

             3. pharmacokinetics.

    <textblock>
      Germline polymorphisms are inherited genetic variations present in all cells of the body.
      Mounting evidence has shown that genetic polymorphisms in drug metabolizing, transporter and
      targets genes are major determinants of response to drugs.

      The aims of this study are to compare (i) the toxicity profile and efficacy of
      gemcitabine/carboplatin or docetaxel, (ii) the distribution of genes involved in docetaxel
      and gemcitabine pathways and (iii) to evaluate the association between pharmacogenetics,
      pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics in East Asian and Caucasian patients.

      To date, most pharmacogenetic strategies are predominantly focused on the role of single
      genes, in the regulation of drug metabolism. However, there is clear evidence that treatment
      outcomes are under the control of a network of genes, each contributing to the patient's
      phenotype. In this study, we propose taking a global approach to include relevant candidate
      genes in drug pathways to evaluate the effect of polymorphisms and treatment outcomes. We
      have selected two commonly used chemotherapy regimens based on our previous observation of
      interethnic variability in treatment outcomes and candidate polymorphisms.

      By incorporating pharmacokinetic (drug level, drug elimination etc), pharmacodynamic
      (treatment response, survival etc) and pharmacogenetic approaches in clinical trials, it
      would enhance our understanding of the inter-individual variability in response and toxicity
      to drug treatment, and is the first step towards individualized drug treatment.

    <description>Gemcitabine (Gemzar®, Lily Inc.) is available in vials containing 1000 mg or 200 mg of active drug formulated with mannitol (200 mg or 1 g, respectively) and sodium acetate (12.5 mg or 62.5 mg, respectively) as a sterile lyophilized powder.
Carboplatin (Spectrum Pharmaceuticals, Inc.) is supplied as a 10 mg/mL aqueous solution. Unopened vials of gemcitabine are stable when stored at controlled room temperature at 25°C, protected from bright light. It can be diluted in normal saline or 5% dextrose. The solution remains stable for 8 hours at 25°C after reconstitution.
Carboplatin will be administered as a 1-hour infusion on day 1 of a 21-day cycle. It will be given before gemcitabine at the dose to achieve an AUC of 5 using the Calvert formula.
Gemcitabine will be administered as a 30-minute infusion at the dose of 1000 mg/m2 in 250 mL over 30 minutes, on day 1 and 8 of a 21-day cycle. It will be given after carboplatin infusion.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients must have histologically or cytologically confirmed i) AJCC/UICC stage IIIB
             or IV non small cell lung cancer and stage IV breast cancer for which docetaxel is
             indicated. ii) AJCC/UICC stage IIIB or stage IV non small cell lung cancer for which
             gemcitabine/carboplatin is indicated.

          -  Patients must have measurable disease, defined as at least one lesion that can be
             accurately measured in at least one dimension (longest diameter to be recorded) as
             &gt;=20 mm with conventional techniques or as &gt;=10 mm with spiral CT scan. See section
             11.2 for the evaluation of measurable disease.

          -  Eligible patients must not have been on previous anticancer therapy including
             chemotherapy, radiotherapy, biological therapy, or investigational therapy for at
             least 4 weeks before study entry (6 weeks if prior therapy included nitrosoureas or
             mitomycin C). Prior neoadjuvant or adjuvant chemotherapy, or chemotherapy given
             concurrently with radiotherapy for non- metastatic disease, is allowed if the last
             dose last dose was given 6 months or more before study entry.

          -  Patients eligible for docetaxel should have received at least one prior line of
             palliative chemotherapy. Patients eligible for gemcitabine/carboplatin should not have
             prior palliative therapies.

          -  Age &gt;=18 years.

          -  Life expectancy of greater than 8 weeks.

          -  ECOG performance status &lt;=2 (Karnofsky &gt;=60%).

          -  Patients must have normal organ and marrow function as defined below:

               -  leukocytes &gt;=3,000/mcL

               -  absolute neutrophil count &gt;=1,500/mcL

               -  platelets &gt;=100,000/mcL

               -  total bilirubin within normal institutional limits

               -  AST(SGOT)/ALT(SGPT) &lt;=2.5 X institutional upper limit of normal

               -  creatinine within normal institutional limits OR

               -  creatinine clearance &gt;=60 mL/min/1.73 m2 for patients with creatinine levels
                  above institutional normal

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients who have had chemotherapy or radiotherapy within 4 weeks (6 weeks for
             nitrosoureas or mitomycin C) prior to entering the study or those who have not
             recovered from adverse events due to agents administered more than 4 weeks earlier.

          -  Patients should not be receiving any other investigational agents.

          -  Patients with rapidly progressing brain metastases should be excluded from this
             clinical trial because of their poor prognosis. Furthermore they often develop
             progressive neurologic dysfunction that would confound the evaluation of neurologic
             and other adverse events.

          -  History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic
             composition to docetaxel or gemcitabine.

          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac
             arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with
             study requirements.

          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study because docetaxel and gemcitabine are
             embryotoxic/fetotoxic with the potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects.
             Because there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants
             secondary to treatment of the mother with docetaxel or gemcitabine, breastfeeding
             should be discontinued if the mother is treated with docetaxel or gemcitabine. These
             potential risks may also apply to other agents used in this study.
