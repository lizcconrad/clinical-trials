  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study to conduct a small randomized control trial to compare the relative
      effectiveness of a single-session of HIV testing and counseling risk reduction intervention
      (HCT-only) to an enhanced intervention that includes the standard HCT intervention plus a
      theory-based and culturally-tailored group-level intervention designed to reduce or eliminate
      HIV and STI risk behaviors (HCT-plus) among African-American men who have sex with men
      (AA-MSM).

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The HCT-plus intervention will consist of the HCT-only intervention, as well as 8 small group
      intervention sessions focused on HIV risk reduction. Small groups will consist of 10 men who
      will meet once-a-week for 8 consecutive weeks. Each meeting will last approximately 2 hours.
      In each small group session, staff will work with men to reassess their HIV risk behavior,
      re-prioritize their goals as appropriate, and provide motivational support for their risk
      reduction accomplishments. Participants will be asked to discuss ways they have successfully
      avoided HIV risk behavior since the previous session, as well as to discuss situations in
      which they found it difficult to avoid risk. Staff will reinforce successful risk avoidance,
      and problem-solve with men to overcome barriers to risk reduction.

    <description>Participants will receive HIV counseling and testing. Those selected for the intervention arm will attend small groups consisting of 10 men who meet once a week for 8 consecutive weeks. The weekly two hour discussion sessions will address HIV risk behavior within a framework of contextual influences that may moderate men's risk reduction motivation and behavior. The factors include identity, stigma, connections to community, and situation factors.</description>
