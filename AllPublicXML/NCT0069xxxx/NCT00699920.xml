  <acronym>SMART-CURE</acronym>
  <official_title>A Randomised Study to Compare a Fixed Dose Combination of Artesunate Plus Amiodaquine (Coarsucam) Versus a Fixed Dose Combination of Artemether Plus Lumefantrine (Coartem) in the Treatment of Repeated Uncomplicated Plasmodium Falciparum Malaria Attacks Occurring During the 2 Years of Follow-up, in Children in Uganda.</official_title>

  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Primary objective is to demonstrate the non-inferiority of PCR (Polymerase Chain Reaction)
      adjusted adequate clinical and parasitological response at Day 28 of Coarsucam versus
      Coartem, based on the first malaria attack of each patient.

      Secondary objectives:

      For the first attack:

      To compare the 2 groups of treatment in terms of:

        -  Day 42 efficacy

        -  Parasitological and fever clearance

        -  Clinical and Biological tolerability

        -  Evolution of gametocyte carriage

      For attack 2nd and following:

      To compare the 2 groups of treatment in terms of:

        -  Day 28 and Day 42 clinical and parasitological effectiveness

        -  Clinical and Biological tolerability

        -  Proportion of patients without fever at Day 3

        -  Proportion of patients without parasites at Day 3

        -  Evolution of gametocyte carriage

        -  Compliance

      During the total follow up of the cohort:

      To compare the 2 groups of treatment in terms of:

        -  Treatment incidence density

        -  Impact of repeated treatment on clinical and biological tolerability

        -  Impact on anaemia

        -  Impact on Hackett score.
