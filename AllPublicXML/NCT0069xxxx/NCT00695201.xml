  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to see how well patients tolerate the side effects of treatment
      with Floxuridine, Oxaliplatin and Irinotecan. We also want to know if these methods used
      together are a useful way of treating cancer. We have studied these drugs and know the best
      doses of each when they are used alone. We do not yet know how well the drugs work with each
      other. This study will tell us the best doses of each drug when they are given over the same
      period of time.

    <description>For patients on the 4-week cycle: On the first day of each cycle, the pump will be filled with FUDR and dexamethasone. The pump will be emptied of drugs after 2 weeks (on day 15 of each cycle) and filled with heparin (which is used to prevent blood from clotting) and saline. Whether the pump contains drug or heparin and saline, it will need to be emptied and refilled about every two weeks. We will inject either the drugs or the saline and heparin into the pump through the skin using a needle and syringe. In summary, 2 weeks of drug in the pump is followed by 2 weeks without drug in the pump. The systemic chemotherapy (Oxaliplatin/CPT-11) will be administered on the same day as the pump is filled and emptied, ie. Day 1 and Day 15 of each cycle.</description>

The pump will be emptied of drugs after 2 weeks (on day 15 of each cycle) and filled with heparin and saline. This is repeated on day 29 of each cycle). In summary, 2 weeks of drug in the pump are followed by 3 weeks without drug in the pump. The systemic chemotherapy (Oxaliplatin/CPT-11) will be administered on the same day that the pump is emptied and filled with heparin and saline, i.e. Day 15 and Day 29 of each cycle.</description>
