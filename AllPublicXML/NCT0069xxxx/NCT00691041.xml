  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to examine the efficacy of a network-oriented &quot;outreach
      intervention&quot; to reduce HIV and sexually transmitted infection (STI) related risk behaviors
      among African American men who have sex with men (AA MSM)and their social network. The
      hypothesis is to determine whether the new intervention is more efficacious at reducing high
      risk sexual behaviors than the standard normal of care provided to the public (a single
      session of individual HIV counseling and testing.
