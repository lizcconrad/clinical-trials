  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Serious bacterial infections are often difficult to detect in children with fever without
      source. Procalcitonin is a better blood marker of infection than White blood cell count and
      possibly than C-reactive protein. This could lead to a reduction in antibiotic prescription.
      Our objective is to evaluate the impact of Procalcitonin result on antibiotic prescription in
      children 1 to 36 month old with fever without source and our hypothesis is that it will lower
      the antibiotic prescription rate
