  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This prospective randomized controlled study will determine the efficacy of continuous local
      anesthesia at decreasing pain scores compared to patient controlled analgesia for pelvic
      organ prolapse procedures including posterior colporrhaphy and sacrospinous ligament
      fixation.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Direct post-operative analgesia can be administered via a direct continuous analgesia pumps
      providing local anesthetic into a dissected area. To date, no studies have been conducted to
      evaluate pain control or infection with vaginal placement of catheters for pelvic organ
      prolapse surgery. To help pelvic surgeons assess the relative benefit of continuous local
      infusion of topical anesthetic following sacrospinous ligament fixation versus PCA pump, we
      compared pain scores, narcotic, anti-pruritic and anti-emetic drug usage, and wound
      complications.

    <description>Patients assigned to the study group had an ON-Q PainBuster Post-Op Pain Relief System (270 ml x 4 ml/hr, dual catheter, 2 ml per site, 72 hours continuous) with dual five inch fenestrated catheters placed at the sacrospinous ligament. The catheter was placed in the operating room with a peel-away trocar and attached to the pump. The trocar was inserted through a 5 mm stab incision made near the superior part of the pubic bone between the genitoinguinal fold and the midline of the symphysis. Once through the incision, the trocar is advanced subcutaneously and made to exit the posterior fourchette just beneath the posterior vaginal mucosa where it is advanced by tenting up the skin.</description>
