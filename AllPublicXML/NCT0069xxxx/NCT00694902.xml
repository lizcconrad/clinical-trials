  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is the first administration of GSK610677 to man. The main aim of this clinical
      study is to investigate the safety and tolerability of different doses of the investigational
      medicinal product GSK610677. 2 cohorts of 8 subjects (Cohorts I and II) will be enrolled into
      this study. Individual subjects in each cohort will have up to 3 treatment periods. In each
      treatment period, subjects will receive a single inhaled dose of GSK610677 or placebo.
      Predicted doses are: 10, 30, 50 100 250 and 500ug.For individual subjects in each cohort,
      there will be a minimum wash out period of at least 10 days. In this period safety and
      tolerability data will be collected prior to dose to the next level.After safety review
      meetings between the site and the sponsor following the administration of the 500 ug dose, it
      was decided to add an extra cohort (Cohort III) of 8 subjects and administer 1000Âµg. Each
      subject in Cohort III will undergo a screening visit, one treatment period, and a follow up
      visit.

          -  Where participation in the study would result in donation of blood or blood products
             in excess of 500 mL within a 56-day period.

          -  Unwillingness or inability to follow the procedures outlined in the protocol.
