  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Visceral and somatic hypersensitivity as evidence of central sensory sensitization occur in
      the majority of Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS) patients. We recently demonstrated abnormal
      endogenous pain modulation as a cause of the sensitization in IBS and identified the
      underlying dysfunctional neuromatrix using functional MR-imaging (fMRI). Endogenous pain
      mechanisms regulate, fine-tune and integrate sensory and homeostatic, including
      neuroendocrine, immune and autonomic nervous system processes. Specific measures of
      sensitization and endogenous pain modulation correlate with clinical measures of somatic and
      neuropathic pain, suggesting usefulness as surrogate markers for clinical pain outcomes.
      Validation of experimental measures as surrogate markers in IBS would provide a considerable
      advance in pathophysiological and therapeutic research in this pharmacoeconomically
      burdensome disease.

The treatments will be identical in appearance and will be administered in double-blind fashion. Treatment with any anticoagulants, antidiabetics, antimigraine drugs, antispasmodics, analgesics, psychoactive agents including antidepressants, Zelmac®, TCM or acupuncture for IBS and any drugs affecting nociception as judged by investigator are prohibited during the entire study.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

        IBS patients:

          -  One hundred fifty male and female IBS patients (Rome III criteria), aged 18 to 70
             years, recruited from primary and secondary care via advertisements and referral
             networks.

          -  Minimum IBS symptom rating of 75 in IBS severity scoring system (IBS-SSS) in last two
