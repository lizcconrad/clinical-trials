      The purpose of this research study is to examine the role of nerves in the skin in psoriasis
      and to better understand the effects of capsaicin in psoriasis.In this study, capsaicin will
      be compared to a moisturizer (aquaphor ointment).

          -  Subjects must be willing to receive topical capsaicin weekly for 6 weeks and must be
             willing to undergo 3mm punch biopsies at baseline and at week 6.

          -  Subjects may not receive any systemic therapies during the study.

          -  Subjects are required to complete a 4 week washout period from any systemic medication

             least 14 days.

          -  Women of child bearing age will be required to have a negative pregnancy test in order

             diabetes, alcoholism, uremia, HIV infection, hypothyroidism, or cancer chemotherapy.

          -  Subjects who are currently enrolled in any investigational study in which the subject
             is receiving any type of drug, biologic, or non-drug therapy and subjects undergoing
             treatment with another investigational drug or approved therapy for investigational
             use within 28 days prior to investigational drug administration.

          -  Subjects who have used any topical therapy for psoriasis or other skin diseases in the
             past 7 days.

          -  Subjects receiving any of the following treatments or agents within the 28 days prior
             to investigational drug administration will be excluded: systemic retinoids, systemic
             steroids, methotrexate, cyclosporine, azathioprine, thioguanine, etanercept,
             efalizumab, infliximab, adalimumab or mofetil or other systemic immunosuppressant, and
