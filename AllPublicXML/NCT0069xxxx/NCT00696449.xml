    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to investigate potential differences between four
      treatment intervention groups in the adherence to treatment with Differin® Gel, 0.1%.
      Differin is approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to treat acne.

      Subjects will be enrolled and randomized in a 1:1:1:1 ratio to one of four treatment
      intervention groups. All Subjects will be treated once-daily for 12 weeks with Differin® Gel,
      0.1%. The four intervention groups were designated according to follow-up strategies as
      follows:

        -  More frequent than normal office visits

        -  Electronic reminders (voice, e-mail, text messages)

        -  Parental involvement/intervention reminders

        -  No intervention or reminders
