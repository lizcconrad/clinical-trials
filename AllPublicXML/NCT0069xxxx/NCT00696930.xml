      Subjects will be screened to determine OctreoScan® uptake. And upon meeting the eligibility
      criteria, 90 subjects will complete a symptom assessment scale at baseline and throughout the
      study at specific time points. Actual treatment will consist of three six-week cycles of a
      fixed total dose of 13.3 GBq (360 mCi) of 90Y-SMT487. The total dose will be divided into
      three equal doses and administered as a single activity of 4.4 GBq (120 mCi) of 90Y-SMT487
      once every six weeks for three cycles. An amino acid infusion will be administered along with
      each dose. Long-term follow up will occur at 6 and 12 months after Day 1/ Cycle 1. Survival
      will be assessed every six months.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Life expectancy &gt; 6 months.

          2. Subjects must have distant metastases.

          3. Subjects must be able to discontinue Sandostatin LAR treatment for at least 1 month
             prior to Day 1/Cycle 1; last dose of Sandostatin LAR must be 60 days or more prior to
             the first OctreoTher™ dose. For subcutaneous Sandostatin discontinuation should be 12
             hours. Subjects taking other long acting somatostatin analogues must discontinue the
             analogue at least 2 times the dosing interval.

          4. Upon baseline disease assessment, all subjects must have at least 1 measurable site of
             disease that either has never been irradiated or if the measurable lesion has been
             previously irradiated; this same lesion has since demonstrated progression base don
             the SWOG response criteria.

          5. Subjects must state or agree with the statement that &quot;I have symptoms from my cancer
             that bother me.&quot; Subjects must have failed to gain complete symptom control despite an
             optimal attempt at somatostatin therapy in the judgement of their physician.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Chemotherapy, biologic therapy or other investigational therapy within 4 weeks of Day
             1.

          2. Surgery, hormonal therapy (not including somatostatin analogues) or radiation, within
             2 weeks of Day 1.

          3. Subjects with know brain metastases unless these metastases have been treated and
             stabilized for at least six months prior to study start.

          4. Subjects who received high dose OctreoScan therapy or other radiolabelled somatostatin
             therapy or other systemic radiolabelled therapy (e.g. MIBG) for treatment of
             metastatic carcinoid.
