      The purpose of this research study is to better understand African American hair and scalp,
      its biologic appearance and how this relates to African Americans' perceptions of their hair
      and scalp health. Since most hair studies have looked at Caucasian hair and scalp, we will
      use a population of Caucasian subjects for comparison in evaluating various hair and scalp
      parameters.

        Healthy female subjects between the ages of 21-60 will be enrolled in this study. These

        and our Institutional Review Board (IRB) approved advertising. Half of the participants
        will be African American and the other half will be Caucasian.
