      Type 2DM is present in the populations of almost all the countries in the world and is a
      significant disease burden in most countries .Evidences suggest that population in India
      develop Type 2 DM at an increasing rate as they reject their traditional life styles.

      Awareness and knowledge regarding Diabetes and role of physical inactivity in producing
      complications is still grossly inadequate( Mohan. D, Raj.D Awareness and knowledge of
      Diabetes in Chennai.The Chennai urban Rural Epidemiology study(CURES-9)J Assoc. Physicians
      India 2005 April;53:283-7).Exercise is a low cost , non pharmacological intervention that has
      been shown to be effective in metabolic control. Exercise is still vastly under-utilized in
      the management of Type 2 DM.

      Most proximal behavioral cause of insulin resistance is physical inactivity.(Michael J.
      LaMonte, Steven N. Blair et al.( Physical activity and Diabetes prevention J Appl Physiol.
      99: 1205-1213,2005)

      This study was designed to promote physical activity among type 2 DM female subjects aged
      35-65 yrs attending Diabetic clinic of a tertiary care hospital in Kerala.

      The BCC model consisted of 1.an audio visual module imparting knowledge about DM, its
      complications, advantages of PA in Diabetes control, how to include more PA in routine life
      style 2. pamphlets.All these were standardised. Physical activity was measured using
      international physical activity questionnaire validated(responsiveness&amp; reliability) for our
      cultural activity.IPAQ covers four domains of physical activity: work-related,transportation,
      housework/gardening and leisure-time activity. PA data from the questionnaire were
      transformed into energy expenditure estimates as MET using published values. To calculate the
      weekly physical activity (MET-h /week), the number of hours dedicated to each activity class
      was multiplied by the specific MET score for that activity.

      follow up once in a month (4 times) measure incremental physical activity and reinforcement
      in each visit. Students t test was used to compare the experimental and control groups with
      respect to the incremental physical activity measured in calorie expenditure. It was found
      that the incremental physical activity(final-basal) measured in METS is significantly higher
      in intervention group.
