      To perform a laboratory sensitivity testing survey of antibiotic agents against Neisseria
      gonorrhea isolates from men with symptomatic urethritis seen at an STD clinic.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Until recently, the fluoroquinolones (ofloxacin, ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin) have been the
      first line oral agents for the empiric treatment of gonorrhea. The prevalence of quinolone
      resistant Neisseria gonorrheae (QRNG) has been rising since 2000. In 2006, the CDC updated
      its guidelines to include recommendations against the use of quinolones for treatment of
      Neisseria gonorrheae. Ceftriaxone (available only by intravenous or intramuscular route) was
      named as the first line treatment for urogenital and pharyngeal disease. Availability, in the
      United States, of the other two CDC recommended agents cefixime (oral) and spectinomycin (IM)
      has been nonexistent.

      At this time, there is little data on the in-vitro (laboratory test) susceptibility of
      antibiotics against gonorrhea, particularly oral drugs. The purpose of this study is to
      collect specimens of gonorrhea in a non-invasive swab manner from men with symptomatic
      urethral discharges for laboratory sensitivity testing against a wide array of antibiotic
      agents.

      Specific Aims:

      To perform a laboratory sensitivity testing survey of antibiotic agents against Neisseria
      gonorrhea isolates from men with symptomatic urethritis seen at a Duval County STD clinic .
