    <textblock>
      This study is designed to evaluate the effectiveness of preladenant in the prevention (Part
      1) or treatment (Part 2) of antipsychotic induced akathisia in participants with acute
      psychosis using the Barnes Akathisia Scale.

    <measure>Part 1: Number of Participants With Akathisia</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 13 days</time_frame>
    <description>Incidence of akathisia is reported as the number of participants who experienced akathisia. Akathisia is defined as a score of 3 on the Barnes akathisia scale (BAS) for 3 consecutive intervals or an akathisia score (BAS) of ≥4 for any single day, or the use of a rescue medication within 13 days of initiating treatment with haloperidol and preladenant. The BAS is scored as follows: objective akathisia, subjective awareness of restlessness and subjective distress related to restlessness are rated on a 4-point scale from 0 - 3 and are summed yielding a total score ranging from 0 (no akathisia) to 9 (severe akathisia).</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Part 2: Number of Participants Who Were Treatment Failures</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 14 days</time_frame>
    <description>Incidence of treatment failure is reported as the number of participants who were treatment failures. A treatment failure is defined as the failure to achieve at least a 1 point reduction from baseline in BAS score at 24 to 26 hours following study treatment. The BAS is scored as follows: objective akathisia, subjective awareness of restlessness and subjective distress related to restlessness are rated on a 4-point scale from 0 - 3 and are summed yielding a total score ranging from 0 (no akathisia) to 9 (severe akathisia).</description>

    <measure>Part 1: Mean Global Clinical Impression at Day 14</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 14 of Part 1</time_frame>
    <description>Global clinical impression (GCI) was administered to assess whether any deterioration is due to akathisia or uncontrolled psychoses. Score on a scale +2 to -2 (+2 represents much improvement, +1 some improvement, 0 no change, -1 some worsening, and -2 much worsening).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Part 1: Mean Positive and Negative Symptom Scale for Schizophrenia (PANSS) Total Score at Day 14</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 14 of Part 1</time_frame>
    <description>The PANSS is a 30-item clinician-rated instrument for assessing the symptoms of schizophrenia. It consists of 3 subscales: positive subscale (7 items), negative subscale (7 items), and general psychopathology subscale (16 items). Positive symptoms refer to an excess or distortion of normal mental status (e.g., delusions). Negative symptoms represent a diminution or loss of normal functions (e.g., emotional withdrawal).
For each item, symptom severity was rated on a 7-point scale, from 0=absent to 6=extreme. The PANSS total score for each participant was calculated as the sum of the rating assigned to each of the 30 PANSS items, and ranged from 0 to 180 with a higher score indicating greater severity of symptoms. Although the PANSS is traditionally scored with a range of 30-210, with a score of absent = 1 (for each item), for this analysis the range was set from 0-180, with a score of absent = 0 (for each item).</description>

          -  Female of childbearing potential must:

               -  Have used a medically accepted method of contraception for 1 month (or abstained

        <title>Part 1: Number of Participants With Akathisia</title>
        <description>Incidence of akathisia is reported as the number of participants who experienced akathisia. Akathisia is defined as a score of 3 on the Barnes akathisia scale (BAS) for 3 consecutive intervals or an akathisia score (BAS) of ≥4 for any single day, or the use of a rescue medication within 13 days of initiating treatment with haloperidol and preladenant. The BAS is scored as follows: objective akathisia, subjective awareness of restlessness and subjective distress related to restlessness are rated on a 4-point scale from 0 – 3 and are summed yielding a total score ranging from 0 (no akathisia) to 9 (severe akathisia).</description>

        <title>Part 1: Mean Positive and Negative Symptom Scale for Schizophrenia (PANSS) Total Score at Day 14</title>
        <description>The PANSS is a 30-item clinician-rated instrument for assessing the symptoms of schizophrenia. It consists of 3 subscales: positive subscale (7 items), negative subscale (7 items), and general psychopathology subscale (16 items). Positive symptoms refer to an excess or distortion of normal mental status (e.g., delusions). Negative symptoms represent a diminution or loss of normal functions (e.g., emotional withdrawal).
For each item, symptom severity was rated on a 7-point scale, from 0=absent to 6=extreme. The PANSS total score for each participant was calculated as the sum of the rating assigned to each of the 30 PANSS items, and ranged from 0 to 180 with a higher score indicating greater severity of symptoms. Although the PANSS is traditionally scored with a range of 30-210, with a score of absent = 1 (for each item), for this analysis the range was set from 0-180, with a score of absent = 0 (for each item).</description>

          <title>Part 1: Mean Positive and Negative Symptom Scale for Schizophrenia (PANSS) Total Score at Day 14</title>
          <description>The PANSS is a 30-item clinician-rated instrument for assessing the symptoms of schizophrenia. It consists of 3 subscales: positive subscale (7 items), negative subscale (7 items), and general psychopathology subscale (16 items). Positive symptoms refer to an excess or distortion of normal mental status (e.g., delusions). Negative symptoms represent a diminution or loss of normal functions (e.g., emotional withdrawal).
For each item, symptom severity was rated on a 7-point scale, from 0=absent to 6=extreme. The PANSS total score for each participant was calculated as the sum of the rating assigned to each of the 30 PANSS items, and ranged from 0 to 180 with a higher score indicating greater severity of symptoms. Although the PANSS is traditionally scored with a range of 30-210, with a score of absent = 1 (for each item), for this analysis the range was set from 0-180, with a score of absent = 0 (for each item).</description>
          <population>Efficacy analysis population was defined as participants who received at least one dose of study drug. The study was terminated early by the sponsor due to lack of enrollment. No formal statistical analysis was done due to the very small sample size in this study.</population>
