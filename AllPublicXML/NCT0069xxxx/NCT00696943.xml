  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the potential of [18F]-ML-10 to serve as a
      non-invasive imaging tool for the early detection of apoptosis in brain metastases in
      response to radiation therapy, in patients subjected to stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS). Such
      early detection may improve clinical management of patients with brain metastases, as it may
      help early identification of non-responders, and subsequently potentially lead to
      optimization of radiation techniques such as the need for whole brain radiation therapy
      (WBRT), addition of brain penetrating chemotherapy or an early decision on referral of the
      patient with non-responsive lesions to surgery or to systemic chemotherapy. The experimental
      design of the present study aims to evaluate the potential of non-invasive PET examination
      with [18F]-ML-10, to provide the clinician with an assessment of response early in the course
      of treatment, via non-invasive molecular imaging of radiation-induced apoptosis. This
      information on tumor responsiveness is currently available only several weeks to months after
      completion of radiotherapy.

      Early assessment of the efficacy of anti-cancer therapy is highly desirable and an unmet need
      in clinical oncology. Currently, treatment efficacy is mostly measured by following tumor
      size by anatomical imaging (CT scan or MRI). However, changes in tumor size may be observed
      only after several weeks to several months after completion of treatment. Meanwhile, in cases
      where there is no response, the patient is unnecessarily exposed to treatment's side effects,
      and precious time may be lost before the initiation of an alternative, potentially more
      beneficial line of therapy. Therefore, there is an urgent and serious need for better tools
      for monitoring of tumor response to anti-cancer treatments.

      To address this need, [18F]-ML-10, a novel small molecular-weight probe (MW 205) was
      developed for clinical detection of apoptosis in vivo by positron emission tomography (PET).
      [18F]-ML-10 is a member of the ApoSense family of compounds, a novel class of molecular
      probes for molecular imaging of cell death. The first clinical indication for which
      [18F]-ML-10 is being developed is imaging of apoptosis in clinical oncology to monitor tumor
      response to radiation therapy.

      Previous preclinical and clinical studies have substantiated the safety of [18F]-ML-10, its
      very high stability in vivo, its favorable biodistribution profile, and its efficacy in
      clinical detection of cell death. In preclinical studies, the selective retention of
      [18F]-ML-10 in the focus of the neurovascular cell death in cerebral ischemia was
      demonstrated in respective animal models. [18F]-ML-10 has been examined in two clinical
      trials in Uppsala Imanet, Sweden, and has been found safe in administration to healthy
      subjects and to elderly subjects with acute ischemic cerebral stroke. In these clinical
      trials, [18F]-ML-10 was also found efficacious in the clinical imaging of apoptosis, being
      either physiological apoptosis as observed in the testes in young healthy males, and
      pathological cell death, as observed in the brains of patients with acute ischemic cerebral
      stroke.
