    <textblock>
      The goal of this clinical research study is to learn if revlimid (lenalidomide) in
      combination with rituximab in previously untreated indolent non-Hodgkin's lymphoma can
      control the disease. The safety of this combination will also be studied.

      The Study Drugs:

      Rituximab is a type of drug known as a monoclonal antibody. It is designed to act against the
      CD20 antigen that is found on the surface of both normal B lymphocytes or on the malignant
      lymphoma cells. When rituximab attacks the CD20 antigen, it may kill the lymphoma cells.

      Lenalidomide is designed to change the body's immune system. It may also interfere with the
      development of tiny blood vessels that help support tumor growth. Therefore, in theory, it
      may decrease or prevent the growth of cancer cells.

      If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, you will take lenalidomide by
      mouth on Days 1-21 of each 28-day study cycle in schedule &quot;A&quot;, or on Days 2-22 of schedule
      &quot;B&quot;. You should swallow lenalidomide capsules whole, with water, at the same time each day.
      Do not break, chew or open the capsules.

      If you miss a dose of lenalidomide, take it as soon as you remember on the same day. If you
      miss taking your dose for the entire day, take your regular dose the next scheduled day (do
      not take double your regular dose to make up for the missed dose).

      Lenalidomide is being provided to you under a special distribution program called RevAssist®.
      A company called Biologics will directly mail you your supply of lenalidomide to your home.
      The RevAssist® toll-free contact number for patients is 1-888-423-5436. You should contact
      that number in order to ask for information on how to properly dispose of any unused supply
      of lenalidomide by shipping the drug back.

      You will receive rituximab through a needle in your vein on Day 1 (Schedule A) or on Days 1,
      8, 15, and 22 of Cycle 1 (Schedule B) over 4-8 hours. You will receive rituximab on Day 1 of
      all subsequent cycles.

      You will be given a diary to record when you take all of the study drugs and any problems or
      illnesses you may experience. You should also write down in the diary any other drugs you
      take while you are on this study.

      Study Visits:

      After you begin your treatment, you will have study visits at the beginning of each cycle. If
      your doctor thinks it is necessary, the check-up visits may take place more often.

      At these visits, the following tests and procedure will be performed:

        -  You will have a complete physical exam, including measurement of vital signs.

        -  You will be asked questions about how you have felt since your last visit.

        -  You will be asked about any drugs you have taken since your last visit.

        -  You should bring the diary you were given earlier to each visit.

        -  Blood (about 8 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine blood tests and to check on the
           status of the disease.

      On Days 8 and 22 of Cycle 1, blood (about 2 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests.

      On Day 14 of Cycles 2-12, blood (about 2 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests.

      At the end of each 28-day treatment cycles, you will have a visit with the study doctor to
      see if it is safe for you to continue on this study and make sure the cancer has not gotten
      worse. At this visit, blood (about 8 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine blood tests to
      check on the status of the disease.

      If your doctor thinks it is necessary, at any of the study visits you may have a bone marrow
      biopsy/aspirate, x-rays, CT scans, positron emission tomography (PET) scans, or
      gastrointestinal endoscopy to check the status of the disease.

      Pregnancy Tests:

      Women who are able to become pregnant with regular or no menstrual cycles must agree to have
      pregnancy tests weekly for the first 28 days of study and then every 28 days while on study,
      at the end-of-study visit, and at Day 28 following discontinuation from the study.

      Women with irregular menstrual cycles must have pregnancy tests weekly for the first 28 days,
      then every 14 days while on study, at the end-of-study visit, and at days 14 and 28 following
      discontinuation from the study.

      Length of Study:

      You may continue to take the study drugs for up to 12 cycles. You will be taken off study
      earl if the disease gets worse or you experience intolerable side effects.

      End-of-Study Visit:

      Once you are off-study, you will have an end-of-study visit. At this visit, the following
      tests and procedures will be performed:

        -  You will have a complete physical exam, including measurement of vital signs and weight.

        -  You will be asked questions about how you have felt since your last visit.

        -  You will be asked about any drugs you have taken since your last visit.

        -  Blood (around 3 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine blood tests to check on the
           status of the disease.

        -  You will have bone marrow biopsy/aspirate to check the status of disease.

        -  You will have x-rays or CT scans to check the status of the disease.

        -  You should return any unused lenalidomide capsules.

      Long-Term Follow-Up:

      After the end-of-study visit, you will be contacted by phone every 6 months from then on to
      check on your health and for information about any other cancer treatments you may have
      received.

      You will have CT scans of your neck, thorax, abdomen and pelvis every 3 months for 1 year,
      every 6 months for the following year, and then 1 time a year after that.

      This is an investigational study. Lenalidomide is FDA approved and commercially available for
      multiple myeloma and myelodysplastic syndrome. Its use in patients with indolent
      non-Hodgkin's lymphoma is investigational.

      Rituximab is FDA approved and commercially available for the treatment of non-Hodgkin's
      lymphomas, including indolent non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.

      Up to 155 participants with take part in this study. All will be enrolled at MD Anderson.
