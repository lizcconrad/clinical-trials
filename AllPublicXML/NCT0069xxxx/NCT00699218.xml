  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a pilot project to study if repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (rTMS) will
      benefit patients with bipolar depression safely. Based on published studies, this study
      hypothesizes that rTMS on the left dorsal prefrontal lobe will improve symptoms in some
      patients who have failed at least two medications.

      Candidate with bipolar depression will be screened after signing informed consent. Those who
      meet the selection criteria will be treated with daily rTMS for 3 weeks and be followed-up at
      2 weeks. Participants will keep their ongoing medication unless a medication significantly
      increases the possibility of seizure. They must be on the same dose of antidepressant
      medication for least 4 weeks without improvement of symptoms before being recruited into the
      study. Mood and other observed mental status will be measured by standard psychological
      scales.
