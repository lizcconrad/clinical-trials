    <textblock>
      Background:

      The intra-tracheal intubation of a patient is a most delicate medical procedure performed
      under often life-threatening conditions in in- and out-of-hospital acute care medicine.
      Correct placement of the tube after intra-tracheal intubation is thus absolutely vital.
      Incorrect position of the tube can be fatal through loss of the airway or through barotrauma
      of the airway and lungs possibly leading to cardiac arrest. The mid-tracheal point of the
      trachea is the perfect place for an intra-tracheal tube to be to guarantee ventilatory
      support without problems for neonates and children. Supra-sternal palpation of the tube tip
      (SSTTP) is a method validated in newborns only, which has a very high accuracy rate in
      placing the tube-tip at the mid-tracheal point. In addition, it is easy to learn and without
      side effects. In infants and children, SSTTP is widely used in Switzerland although never
      validated in a controlled trial.

      Objective:

      To validate supra-sternal palpation of the endo-tracheal tube tip as a valuable measure to
      correctly determine the depth of intubation in infants from one month of age to children up
      to eight years of age, when correct depth of the tube-tip is defined as tube-tip being within
      plus/minus 0.25cm of the line between the medial points of the claviculae (IMP) for infants
      and within plus/mius 0.25 respectively plus/mius 0.38cm for toddlers and children.

      Hypothesis:

      Supra-sternal Tube Tip Palpation (SSTTP) is a valid and easy to perform measure to identify
      the correct depth of intubation after oral or nasal tracheal intubation in infants, toddlers
      and children. Correct depth is defined as tube tip placed within plus/minus 0.25cm of the IMP
      for infants and within plus/minus 0.25 respectively plus/minus 0.38cm for toddlers and
      children.

      Study design and methods:

      Sixty-four toddlers and children and 18 infants will be enrolled into the study. Three
      Respiratory Therapists (RT) from the Pediatric Intensive Care Unit (PICU) will be trained in
      SSTTP before the start of the study. Successful training of the RTs will be confirmed by
      x-ray before final qualification as &quot;Expert in SSTTP&quot;. All patients with an intubation
      requiring a post-manipulation x-ray in the PICU at CHEO will be enrolled into the study. No
      randomization will be necessary; all infants and children in need of an intubation will be
      enrolled into the study. Potential patients will be excluded if there is presence of
      anatomical malformation or any other reason that would prevent accurate SSTTP, or if there is
      no Expert in SSTTP available. The location of the tip of the tube after SSTTP will be
      measured on standard post-intubation x-rays by a radiologist. The tube-tip location
      difference will be calculated as the difference between the actual tube-tip location and the
      IMP.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  &quot;Primary intubations&quot;:

               -  All infants and children from 1 month of age up to the end of the seventh year of
                  life, who are being intubated for medical reasons on the pediatric intensive care
                  unit (PICU) at the Children's hospital of Eastern Ontario.

          -  &quot;Secondary intubations&quot;:

               -  All infants and children from 1 month of age up to the end of the seventh year of
                  life already intubated in the PICU at the Children's Hospital of Eastern Ontario,
                  who's tube needs to be exchanged, who's tube needs to be repositioned according a
                  previous x-ray or who's tube needs any other manipulation requiring a
                  post-manipulation chest x-ray.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  &quot;Primary, peracute intubations&quot;. Intubations required at once or within a few minutes.

          -  Anatomical malformation of the child's or infant's airway, lungs or neck.

          -  Tracheostoma, history of tracheotomy, jugular scars or any other reason that might
             prevent accurate supra-sternal palpation.

          -  After placement of the tube according to supra-sternal palpation, any difficulties
             ventilating the patient or endo-bronchial intubation as per auscultation will lead to
             placement of the tube according to previously used criteria. The case will be
             described but the patient excluded from determination of the tube tip placement with
             x-ray.

          -  Any case when the study procedures had to be discontinued because the treating
             physician or RT felt that care could be disrupted by virtue of the study procedures.
             The case will be described but the patient excluded from determination of the tube tip
             placement with x-ray.

          -  Unavailability of an expert in SSTTP at the time point of needed intubation.

          -  For ethical reasons, we will exclude patients who we know will have a detrimental
             outcome despite intubation.
