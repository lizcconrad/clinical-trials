  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary focus of this five-year study will be to optimize the melatonin dosing regimen
      for synchronizing the body clocks of elderly blind individuals to the 24-hour day.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators intend to study as many as 26 subjects through up to four melatonin
      treatment regimens, all of which involve a dose step-down in which the melatonin dose will be
      reduced gradually to find the lowest effective dose. The 4 treatment plans differ only in the
      start dose and the time of administration. Successfully treated subjects will enter a
      one-year intensive assessment of the safety and efficacy of melatonin treatment in which the
      subject will take the same dose for one year and complete biweekly assessments of efficacy
      and side-effects. The final phase of the study involves a placebo discontinuation, in which
      the subject's circadian rhythm will be returned to the baseline rhythm (this may take up to 6
      months for some subjects).

    <description>Subjects will be given 0.5 mg at a time when melatonin should delay the timing of their body clock. If the subject's body clock responds successfully to the dose, the dose will be reduced gradually until the lowest effective dose is found. If the treatment does not work, the subject will be taken off treatment and later entered into a new treatment regimen.</description>

    <description>Subjects will be given a larger dose (up to 10 mg) at a time when the melatonin should advance the timing of the body clock.

    <description>Subjects will be given a larger dose (up to 20 mg) at a time when the melatonin should advance the timing of the body clock. If the subject successfully responds to the treatment, the dose will be reduced gradually until the lowest effective dose is determined (down to 0.025 mg). If the treatment does not work, the subject will be taken off treatment and later entered into a new treatment regimen.</description>
