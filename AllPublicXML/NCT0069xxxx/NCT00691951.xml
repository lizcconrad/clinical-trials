  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A reduced response to inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) has been reported in smoking compared to
      non-smoking asthmatic patients. However, the comparative response to other currently
      prescribed medications such as combination therapy of long-acting beta agonists and ICS
      remain to be further evaluated.

      No significant differences were found between our group of subjects in regard to changes in
      asthma control pulmonary function and airway inflammation following budesonide or the
      association of budesonide with formoterol for a period of 2 months. This should be further
      explored in larger groups of subjects.
