        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  For use in individuals with osteoarthritis or avascular necrosis limited to the medial
             compartment of the knee. The implant is intended to be implanted with bone cement.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Infection

          -  Use in the lateral compartment of the knee

          -  Rheumatoid arthritis or other forms of inflammatory joint disease

          -  Revision of a failed prosthesis, failed upper tibial osteotomy or post-traumatic
             arthritis after tibial plateau fracture

          -  Insufficiency of the collateral, anterior, or posterior cruciate ligaments which would
             preclude stability of the device

          -  Disease or damage to the lateral compartment of the knee

          -  Uncooperative patient or patient with neurologic disorders who is incapable of
             following directions

          -  Osteoporosis

          -  Metabolic disorders which may impair bone formation

          -  Osteomalacia

          -  Distant foci of infections which may spread to the implant site

          -  Rapid joint destruction, marked bone loss, or bone resorption apparent on
             roentgenogram

          -  Vascular insufficiency, muscular atrophy, neuromuscular disease

          -  Incomplete or deficient soft tissue surrounding the knee

          -  Charcot's disease

          -  A fixed varus deformity (not passively correctable) of greater than 15 degrees

          -  A flexion deformity greater than 15 degrees
