  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to collect data while monitoring muscles and nerves during spine
      surgery. The data being collected and analyzed will be used to learn more about how the
      body's nerves and muscles are distributed and develop a map of human muscle innervation
      patterns.

      In this large scale study it is proposed to examine root-to-muscle innervation directly,
      using the standard Intra-Operative Monitoring procedures during scheduled cervical and lumbar
      spinal surgeries. The study would directly map muscle and sensory distributions of nerve root
      innervations with no additional risk to patients.
