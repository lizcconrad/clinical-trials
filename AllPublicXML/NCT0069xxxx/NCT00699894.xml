  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) persists as one of the more common complications of
      surgery. Although rarely life-threatening, it is the postoperative outcome that is most
      unfavorable to patients, even more undesirable than pain. Orthognathic surgery corrects
      conditions of the jaws and face related to structure, growth, sleep apnea, bad bite, or
      congenital malformations. The bones of the face and jaws are cut and placed in a new
      position. There is a high rate of PONV in orthognathic surgery (56%). It is particularly
      challenging to the patient as their jaws are kept closed together with wires or elastic
      bands. Nausea in a patient with restricted mouth opening can be psychologically unnerving and
      puts them at risk for fluid in their lungs.

      Gan and colleagues showed a higher efficacy of aprepitant over ondansetron in preventing PONV
      and nausea severity after open abdominal surgery. From this study, the FDA approved the use
      of aprepitant for PONV prevention in patients &gt;18 years of age. Gan suggested further
      investigation in different populations.

      Our randomized, double-blind, prospective study will compare the efficacy of aprepitant PO
      versus ondansetron IV in a high risk setting for PONV: adolescents undergoing orthognathic
      surgery.

      Our study will involve 200 consecutive, adolescent patients (ages 15-25) who will undergo at
      least a Le Fort 1 osteotomy (upper jaw surgery) under general anesthesia and require hospital
      admission for at least one night. We will exclude patients who are currently taking
      medications that have interactions with aprepitant (pimozide, terfenadine, astemizole,
      cisapride), those who have a known vomiting disorder such as bulimia, and those who have
      vomited for any reason within 24 hours of surgery. The procedure will be performed by 5
      surgeons and general anesthesia will be administered by 3 anesthesiologists at one
      institution. A study coordinator, who will not be involved in the treatment, will create the
      randomization schedule in order to ensure blindness. The patients will be randomized to
      either of two groups: 1) aprepitant 40 mg PO 2) ondansetron 4 mg IV. Appropriate verbal and
      written consent will be obtained by the priniciple investigator or surgeon.

      On the day of the procedure, all patients will receive a pill (aprepitant or aprepitant
      placebo) at least 1 hour prior to induction of anesthesia and an IV infusion (ondansetron or
      saline) over 2-5 minutes prior to intubation. The timing and doses of medications will be
      consistent with manufacturer's recommendations. An established protocol will ensure every
      patient will receive the same anesthetic regiment. Patient's fluid status will be closely
      monitored and hydrated appropriately according to known fluid balance calculations.

      Efficacy will be assessed based on criteria set by Gan et al and will be based on the
      presence/absence of a vomiting episode, use of rescue medication and subjective evaluation of
      nausea. Patients will be monitored continuously in the PACU and on the hospital floor by the
      caring team (nurse, resident, anesthesiologist, surgeon) for any emetic episode or use of
      rescue therapy. An emetic episode is defined as an act of vomiting (oral expulsion of stomach
      contents) or retching (non-productive vomiting). Nausea will be assessed at intervals of 0,
      2, 6, 24 hours after surgery with T0 being time of extubation. Patients will rate nausea on a
      11-point verbal rating scale, with 0 being &quot;not nausea&quot; to 10 being &quot;the worst nausea.&quot;
      Rescue medication will be offered if the patient has more than one episode of vomiting or
      retching, if the patient has nausea lasting longer than 15 minutes, or if the patient
      requests it for established nausea or vomiting.
