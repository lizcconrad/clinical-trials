  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Short chain fatty acids (mainly acetate, propionate and butyrate) are produced in the large
      intestine by bacterial fermentation of unabsorbed carbohydrates, such as dietary fibers.
      Mainly butyrate is an important energy source of the mucosa and has a pivotal role in the
      regulation of mucosal proliferation, immune function and mucosal protection.

      High fiber diets increase the concentrations of colonic butyrate, what has often been
      proposed as one of its protective mechanisms. Furthermore, butyrate enemas have been proved
      effective in the treatment of ulcerative colitis. In the present study the direct effects of
      butyrate on the distal colon will be studied in 30 healthy volunteers using rectal enemas.
      The study has been divided into two parts, each part studying different parameters, which
      interfere when measured synchronously and, therefore, need to be studied separately.

      A. The effects of butyrate enemas on colonic permeability (n=15) B. The effects of butyrate
      enemas on parameters of colonic defense, integrity and inflammation (n=15) The effects of
      butyrate will be studied in a healthy and in a stressed colon. This way the protective
      effects of butyrate on intestinal stress can be studied. Prior to the main study, two small
      pilot studies will be carried out. In the first pilot study the retrograde spread of a rectal
      enema will investigated (n=2). In the second pilot study the dose and the type of a suitable
      stressor that will induce reversible damage to intestinal mucosa will be determined (n=12).
