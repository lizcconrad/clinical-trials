        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients having primary cemented or cementless total hip replacement for
             non-inflammatory degenerative joint disease (NIDJD) or any of its composite diagnosis
             of osteoarthritis, avascular necrosis, traumatic arthritis, subcapital fracture, legg
             perthes, slipped capital epiphysis, fracture of the pelvis, diastrophic variant.

          -  Patients with full skeletal maturity

          -  Patients undergoing unilateral total hip arthroplasty or bilateral total hip
             arthroplasty, either staged or simultaneously

          -  Patients of all races and gender

          -  Patients who are able to follow postoperative care instructions

          -  Patients who are able and willing to return for follow-up evaluations

          -  Patients have preoperative total Harris Hip Score less than 70 with at least moderate
             pain.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients diagnosed with inflammatory degenerative arthritis (IDJD) to include the
             following composite diagnoses: rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematous,
             pigmented villonodular synovitis, juvenile rheumatoid arthritis and other arthritic
             processes of inflammatory or autoimmune etiology.

          -  Patients less than 18 years.

          -  Patients with the presence of a previous prosthetic hip replacement device (any type,
             including surface replacement arthroplasty, endoprosthesis, etc.)in the hip joint to
             be operated.

          -  Patients with previous Girdlestone procedures.

          -  Patients with above the knee amputation of the contralateral and/or ipsilateral leg.

          -  Patients with osteoporosis, or marked bone loss which would preclude proper fixation
             of the prosthesis.

          -  Patients who are pregnant.

          -  Patients with an active or suspected infection in or around the hip.

          -  Patients with Parkinson's disease.

          -  Patients with vascular insufficiency, muscular atrophy, or neuromuscular disease in
             the affected limb.

          -  Patients with severe instability or deformity of the ligaments and/or surrounding soft
             tissue which would preclude stability of the prosthesis.

          -  Patients with a highly communicable disease or diseases that may limit follow-up (e.g.
             immuno-compromised conditions, hepatitis, active tuberculosis, neoplastic disease,
             etc.).

          -  Patients unwilling or unable to comply with a rehabilitation program for a cemented or
             cementless total hip replacement or who indicate difficulty or inability to return for
             follow-up visits prescribed by the study protocol.

          -  Patients with previous hip surgery or conditions that may interfere with the total hip
             replacement's survival or outcome, e.g., Paget's disease, Charcot's disease, severe
             osteoporosis compromising bone stock (Dorr type C bone).

          -  Patients who qualify for inclusion in the study, but refuse consent to participate in
             the study.

          -  Patients with a &quot;fused&quot; hip.

          -  Patients who have had a total hip arthroplasty on the contralateral hip within the
             last year.
