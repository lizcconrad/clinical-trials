      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Male or non pregnant female between 18 years and 45 years of age, inclusive.

          2. Female subjects of childbearing potential (ie, who have not undergone a hysterectomy,
             have not had a tubal ligation, have not been postmenopausal for at least 12
             consecutive months, or whose partner has not undergone a vasectomy) must commit either
             to abstain continuously from heterosexual sexual contact or to use two methods of
             birth control, one of which must be a barrier method (eg, hormonal contraception,
             latex condom, diaphragm, or cervical cap), beginning at screening and throughout study
             participation.

          3. A body mass index (BMI) of 19 kg/m2 to 28 kg/m2, inclusive.

          4. Agrees to abstain from alcohol consumption for at least 3 days before first dosing
             with study drug and throughout study participation.

          5. Agrees to abstain from caffeine and nicotine replacement therapy during the days of
             study drug administration and serial ECG measurements.

          6. No clinically significant abnormal findings on the physical examination, ECG, blood
             pressure, heart rate, medical history, or clinical laboratory tests during screening.

          7. Serum magnesium and potassium levels within the normal range per the local lab at the
             time of screening.

          8. Healthy volunteer as determined by the screening assessments.

          9. Willing and able to comply with all trial requirements.

         10. Provide written informed consent before initiation of any study related procedures.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Known or suspected pregnancy.

          2. Increased bleeding risk: ischemic stroke within the last year or any previous
             hemorrhagic stroke, tumor, or intracranial aneurysm; recent (&lt;1 month) trauma or major
             surgery; active bleeding.

          3. Impaired hemostasis: known International Normalized Ratio (INR) &gt;1.5; past or present
             bleeding disorder (including congenital bleeding disorders such as von Willebrand's
             disease or hemophilia, acquired bleeding disorders, and unexplained clinically
             significant bleeding disorders), thrombocytopenia (platelet count &lt;100,000/ÂµL).

          4. Sustained supine systolic blood pressure &gt;140 mmHg or &lt;100 mmHg or a diastolic blood
             pressure &gt;95 mmHg or &lt;60 mmHg at screening or baseline. Blood pressure may be retested
             twice in the supine position at intervals of 5 minutes. Blood pressure is considered
             sustained if either the systolic or the diastolic pressure exceeds the stated limits
             after three assessments.

          5. Resting pulse rate of &lt;50 beats per minute (bpm) or &gt;100 bpm.

          6. Abnormality in the 12 lead ECG that, in the opinion of the investigator, increases the
             risk of participating in the study, such as a corrected QT interval (QTcB or QTcF)
             &gt;450 milliseconds. The following conduction abnormalities may confound QTc analysis
             and should be avoided: PR &gt;220 milliseconds, second or third degree atrioventricular
             (AV) block, intraventricular conduction defect (IVCD) with QRS &gt;120 milliseconds,
             complete left bundle branch block (LBBB), left anterior fascicular block (LAFB), left
             posterior fascicular block (LPFB), right bundle branch block (RBBB), or Wolff
             Parkinson White syndrome (WPW) (WPW defined as PR &gt;120 milliseconds, P axis from 1 to
             90, QRS complex &gt;120 milliseconds, delta wave present).

          7. Personal history of long QT syndrome, heart failure, or hypokalemia.

          8. Personal history of unexplained syncope.

          9. Immediate-family history of long QT syndrome.

         10. Family history of sudden death.

         11. Concurrent medical conditions, therapy, or medications that affect the ECG, especially
             prolongation of the QT/QTc interval.

         12. Use of prescription or over the counter (such as pseudoephedrine containing cold
             medicines) medication, including herbal remedies and health supplements, known to
             prolong the QT/QTc interval within 14 days prior to start of the study and throughout
             study participation.

         13. Intention to use prescription (other than thyroid hormone replacement if the dose and
             regimen of such replacement therapy has been stable for at least 4 weeks prior to
             screening and is expected to remain stable during study participation or hormonal
             contraception) or over the counter medication, including herbal remedies and health
             supplements, within 14 days before the initial dose of study drug and throughout study
             participation. If this situation arises, inclusion of an otherwise suitable volunteer
             may be at the discretion of the investigator in discussion with the Sponsor.

         14. Current smokers or subjects who have discontinued smoking fewer than 6 months prior to
             study entry.

         15. Donation of any blood or plasma in the last month, or donation of &gt;400 mL of blood
             within the 3 months preceding study drug administration.

         16. Clinically significant abnormalities in clinical laboratory test results.

         17. Positive virology screen for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis B, or
             hepatitis C.

         18. Positive urine test for drugs of abuse or alcohol.

         19. Clinically significant disease or condition affecting a major organ system, including,
             but not limited to, gastrointestinal, renal, hepatic, bronchopulmonary, neurological,
             metabolic or cardiovascular disease.

         20. Allergy, hypersensitivity, or contraindication to quinolone antibiotics, cangrelor, or
             any of their excipients.

         21. History of multiple adverse drug allergies of any origin.

         22. Deemed by the investigator, for any reason, to be inappropriate for this study,
             including subjects who are unable to communicate or to cooperate with the
             investigator.

         23. Treatment with other investigational agents or devices within the 30 days preceding
             randomization, planned use of other investigational drugs or devices during study
             participation, or previous enrollment in this trial.

         24. Inability to give informed consent or high likelihood of being unable to complete the
             necessary confinement.
