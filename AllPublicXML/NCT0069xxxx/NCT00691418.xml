  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a feasibility study to determine if it will be possible to conduct a larger study of
      the effect of docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), an omega fatty acid, on increased length of
      gestation among women who have had a previous preterm delivery.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      We propose to conduct an 18-month feasibility study to determine (a) how many women we could
      approach during a 4-month period, (b) how many of these women would be eligible for a future
      RCT, (c) how many would consent to participate in the RCT, and (d) how many would be
      subsequently rendered ineligible due to poor compliance. Women enrolled during the 4-month
      recruitment period would be followed until 1 month after delivery using telephone contact
      (for assessing compliance) and scanning of KPMCP electronic databases (for quantifying
      outcomes). We hope to enroll 50 to 75 women during our fixed time (4 months) recruitment
      period. Half of these 50-75 women would receive DHA; half would receive placebo.

      We will identify potential subjects based on their response to the Preterm Birth Prevention
      Program questionnaire (a screening instrument administered by the Regional Perinatal Service
      Center [RPSC] to all women in the KPMCP entering prenatal care). Eligible women are those
      pregnant women entering prenatal care who, based on their response to the abovementioned RPSC
      questionnaire, are identified as having had a previous preterm delivery (delivery prior to 37
      completed weeks of gestation).

      Results of this study will (a) permit us to determine whether an RCT is feasible at a
      reasonable cost, and (b) assuming the answer to (a) is positive, it would then be possible
      for us to design an RCT that could address our primary study question.
