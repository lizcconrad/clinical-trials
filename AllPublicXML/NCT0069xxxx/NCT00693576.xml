  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with panel reactive antibodies have many difficulties to find a crossmatch-negative
      kidney for transplantation and are at the risk of post transplantation rejection more than
      other transplanted patients. We evaluated the effect of simvastatin on PRA and post
      transplant outcome of these sensitized patients. We also performed a descriptive study.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The presence of panel reactive antibodies (PRAs) in the sera of renal transplant candidates
      is associated with hyperacute or delayed humoral immune responses against the graft after
      transplantation .

      In addition, these sensitized patients wait for a long time to find a cross-match negative
      kidney for renal transplantation . As a result, some modalities have been used for
      desensitization including plasmapheresis and intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) in combination
      with immunosuppressive drugs .

      However, recently, the use of statins such as simvastatin, pravastatin and etc. has been
      proposed to be safer and more effective for desensitization .
