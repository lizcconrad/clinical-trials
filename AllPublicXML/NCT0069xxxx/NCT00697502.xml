    <textblock>
      Hypothesis:

      Patients with TYMS 2R/2R or 2R/3R appear to be more sensitive to fluoropyrimidines,
      conferring a higher risk of grade 3-4 fluoropyrimidine related toxicity and a higher response
      rate compared with 3R/3R. The genotype 3R/3R is more common in East Asia and is associated
      with greater tolerability to fluoropyrimidine as measured by lower toxicity but also lower
      response rates. As sensitivity to fluoropyrimidine appears to be affected by TYMS genotype,
      we hypothesise that patients with TYMS 3R/3R are more tolerant to standard doses of
      capecitabine and require higher doses to overcome fluoropyrimidine resistance. We designed
      this study to develop TYMS genotype specific dosing of capecitabine.

      Aims:

        1. To determine the maximal tolerated dose (MTD) of capecitabine twice a day for two weeks
           followed by one week rest period (intermittent schedule) in patients with the advanced/
           and or metastatic cancer based on TYMS genotype.

        2. To determine a suitable phase II dose of intermittent schedule capecitabine.

        3. To determine the safety and toxicity of this regimen.

        4. To perform plasma pharmacokinetics of capecitabine.

        5. To determine the relationship between genes of relevance in the fluoropyrimidine pathway
           with pharmacokinetics and toxicity.

    <description>Pharmacokinetic sampling will be performed during cycle 1 on days 1 and 14 at the following time points:
Baseline (predose), and 15 min, 30 min, 1 hr, 2 hr, 4 hr, 5 hr and 6 hr after dosing. Blood samples will be centrifuged at 1500 g and 4oC for 10 min and supernatant plasma removed and stored below -20oC until analysis. Plasma concentrations of capecitabine and its metabolites will be quantified by a validated liquid chromatography with mass-spectrometry detection (LC-MS-MS) method</description>

    <description>Capecitabine (XELODA) is supplied as biconvex, oblong film-coated tablets for oral administration and will be obtained from NUH Cancer Centre pharmacy.
Each light peach-colored tablet contains 150 mg capecitabine and each peach-colored tablet contains 500 mg capecitabine. Capecitabine is to be administered orally within 30 minutes after the end of a meal (breakfast, dinner). Tablets should be swallowed with about 200 mL of water (not fruit juices). Capecitabine will be administered for 14 days followed by a 7 day rest period.</description>
