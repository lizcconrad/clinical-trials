    <textblock>
      Being a parent to a premature infant in NICU is an anxious state. Parents ask a lot of
      questions, and look for information all the time. Organizing the information given to parents
      could reduce their anxiety. The parents will be divided into two groups: one group will get
      organized information, by a lecture at the first week of their infant's life, and the other
      group will not. Of course, questions will be answered all the time. The parents will answer a
      questionnaire on the first week of the infant's life, and on the last week, just before
      releasing the infant home.
