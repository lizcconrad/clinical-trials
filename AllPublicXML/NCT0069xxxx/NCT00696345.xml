    <textblock>
      Epigenomics is developing a colon cancer screening assay based on differential methylation of
      specific CpG sites for the detection of early stage disease. A genome-wide methylation
      analysis and oligonucleotide array study using DNA from various stages of colon cancer and
      normal tissue have been completed to obtain candidate CpG markers. Based on results obtained
      in the above studies, Epigenomics has moved to the final stages of feasibility with a
      specific, highly sensitive real-time marker assay that is able to detect colon cancer DNA in
      blood plasma.

      From public health as well as health economics perspectives, the poor adoption of current
      screening options limits the effectiveness of CRC screening initiatives; as stated by Sidney
      Winawer, MD, &quot;the best test is the one that gets done.&quot; Current CRC screening guidelines
      include FOBT, sigmoidoscopy (alone or with FOBT), or colonoscopy. Non-invasive screening is
      conducted using FOBT, which while inexpensive, exhibits a low compliance rate (around 16% in
      the US) due to its use restrictions, perceived inconvenience and lack of consumer acceptance.
      The gold standard procedure for CRC detection is colonoscopy; it exhibits excellent
      performance characteristics, but has a limited utility as a first line screen due to its high
      cost, healthcare delivery resource limitations, and inadequate patient acceptance. It is
      believed a noninvasive, first-line screening assay capable of detecting individuals with
      colorectal disease, confirmed by colonoscopy, would have greater utility for population
      screening.

      Epigenomics has identified methylated gene regions that are specific for colorectal cancer or
      pre-malignant tissue. Aberrantly methylated genes represent attractive candidate markers for
      cancer screening, as cancer-specific methylation changes occur early in tumorigenesis, appear
      to be stable, yield a positive amplifiable signal, and can be assayed with high analytical
      sensitivity. Since methylation occurs early and in distinct genomic areas, it is possible to
      achieve high clinical sensitivity with a small number of methylated DNA markers. Studies have
      shown that aberrantly methylated DNA markers can be detected in tissue and body fluids and
      are highly correlated to colorectal cancer.

        Subjects are identified at colonoscopy as having or not having colorectal cancer. Blood
        from all subjects was drawn either before or more than 2 days and up to 6 months after
        colonoscopy and prior to starting any cancer specific treatment. Cancer diagnosis was
        confirmed histologically from the surgical specimen and only adenocarcinomas were included
        in this study.
