  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Force enhancement (FE) describes the phenomenon of strength potentialization of a muscle cell
      or the complete muscle during and after active extension compared to the strength of an
      isometric contraction with same muscle length. The underlying physiological mechanism of this
      phenomenon is not completely known today. In vitro trials indicate that the interaction of an
      active and a passive component on the cellular level are responsible for the higher strength
      measurements. So far FE could be shown in vitro and in vivo on muscle fibers and small human
      muscles. Further research is needed for verification of the existence of FE in voluntary
      motor activity in everyday life. In order to approach this objective the investigators will
      scrutinize the functionality of the deliberately activated musculus (m) quadriceps femoris
      during and after active extension on the basis of in vivo studies.
