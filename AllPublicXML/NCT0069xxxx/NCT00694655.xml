      The objective of this study is to study immune memory generated against the yellow fever
      vaccine (YFV) in participants who recently received the YFV vaccine. Volunteers who are
      planning to travel to yellow fever endemic areas will be recruited into this study.
      Volunteers will receive the yellow fever vaccine at the Hope Clinic of Emory University or at
      their private health care provider's office. Blood tests will be drawn before the vaccination
      and at upto 8 visits following vaccination. A volunteers's study participation may will last
      as short as 1 month or as long as one year depending on the immune responses.

      We plan to compare the immune responses in younger people (18 to 45 years) to that of older
      people (55 or above).

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Able to understand and give informed consent

          2. Age 18-45 years or greater than or equal to 55 years

          3. If possible, participants agree not to take any vaccines within 30 days before or 30
             days after yellow fever vaccination

          4. Women of child bearing potential must agree to use effective birth control throughout
             the duration of the study. A negative urine pregnancy test must be documented prior to
             vaccination.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Travel to or having lived in a country/area which is endemic for yellow fever

          2. History of previous yellow fever, West Nile, Dengue, St. Louis encephalitis, Japanese
             encephalitis vaccination or infection

          3. Any history of allergy to eggs, chicken or gelatin or to any previous vaccine

          4. A history of a medical condition resulting in impaired immunity (such as HIV
             infection, cancer, particularly leukemia, lymphoma, use of immunosuppressive or
             antineoplastic drugs or X-ray treatment). Persons with previous skin cancers or cured
             non-lymphatic tumors are not excluded from the study.

          5. History of HIV infection, Hepatitis B or Hepatitis C infection

          6. History of any chronic medical conditions that are considered progressive (ex,
             diabetes, heart disease, lung disease, liver disease, kidney disease, gastrointestinal
             diseases and uncontrolled hypertension). Use of systemic immunosuppressive medications
             (ex, prednisone) for 2 weeks or more in the past 3 months

          7. History of excessive alcohol consumption, drug abuse, psychiatric conditions, social
             conditions or occupational conditions that in the opinion of the investigator would
             preclude compliance with the trial

          8. Thymus gland problems (such as myasthenia gravis, DiGeorge syndrome, thymoma) or
             removal of thymus gland or history of autoimmune disorder.

          9. Recipient of a blood products or immune globulin product within 42 days of the
             vaccination visit

         10. Pregnant women and nursing mothers or women who are planning to become pregnant for
             the study duration

         11. Any condition in the opinion of the investigator that would interfere with the proper
             conduct of the trial
