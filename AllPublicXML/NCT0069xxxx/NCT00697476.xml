    <description>Vorinostat/topotecan dose escalation regimen. vorinostat is administered orally once a day for 7 to 14 consecutive days, according to the dose level.Topotecan is administered I.V. for 5 consecutive days every three weeks.
Vorinostat dose levels go from 300 mg/day for 7 days to 400 mg/day for 14 days. Topotecan dose levels go from 1,2 mg/m2 to 1,5 mg/m2</description>

    <description>Phase I study: vorinostat will be administered daily for a number of days per cycle variable from 7 to 14 according to the level of dose escalation; topotecan will be administered I.V. for 5 consecutive days every 3 weeks.
Phase II study: Patients will receive treatment at the recommended dose established by phase I part of the trial, for a maximum of 6 cycles or until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity or patient's refusal.</description>
