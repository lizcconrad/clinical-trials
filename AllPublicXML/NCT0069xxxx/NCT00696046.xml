      Compared to other stemcell sources cord blood (CB) is easier and safer to procure, has no
      donor attrition, a limitless supply, reduced viral transmission, less acute &amp; chronic GVHD,
      is rich in hematopoietic progenitor cells, and immaturity of T-cell-mediated immunity. CB has
      delayed neutrophil and platelet engraftment, a prolonged immune reconstitution, uncertain
      graft-vs-tumor activity, and cell doses from single CB units (U) are a limiting factor for
      larger recipients Using the intravenous route (IV), a close match between the patient (pts)
      and the donor or CBU can improve a pts outcome after transplant. Even though a closely
      matched CBU is preferred, the studies suggest the match may not have to be as close as is
      needed for marrow or peripheral blood transplants If one has an uncommon tissue type, the
      doctor may not find a closely matched adult donor and a CBU may be an option, are stored and
      ready to use. GVHD is a complication after an allogeneic transplant. Studies founded that
      after a CBtransplant, fewer pts get GVHD than after marrow or peripheral blood transplants.
      Pts in the studies who did get GVHD after CBtransplant tended to get less severe cases We
      hypothesized that direct intrabone transplant of CBcells could improve haematologic recovery
      due to a better stem cell homing, based on the following observations: stem cells recirculate
      in animals irradiated with limb shielding; a limited fraction (10-15%) of cells injected iv
      to the haematopoietic sites, possibly because the large majority is lost in other organs; in
      a mousemodel, HSC directly injected ib repopulated the marrow of lethally irradiated mice
      10times more efficiently than HSC cells injected iv; delayed engraftment after CB transplant
      is possibly not caused by insufficient stem cell numbers; indeed, children grafted with CB
      cells have superior stem cell reservoir 1year posttransplant when compared to marrow
      transplant recipients Based on these data, we set-up a phase I-II study to evaluate whether
      ib injection could be safely performed and whether this procedure could ensure engraftment
      and shorten the time of complete hematopoietic recovery in adults with high risk
      haematopoietic malignancies compared to the published data. Neutrophil recovery &gt;80% at day60
      and Platelets recovery &gt;80% at days100 were defined as success. 1째 endpoint was the
      probability of neutrophils and platelets recovery after ib CB transplant, 2째 included
      incidence of acute GVHD, relapse, overall survival

      Study Design Phase I-II study. Neutrophil recovery &gt; 80% at day 60 and Platelets recovery &gt;
      80% at days 100 are defined as success. The limit of 60 days for neutrophil recovery was
      chosen because it represents the time at which rescue with a second transplant is decided in
      case of failure to engraft; the day 100 for platelets recovery is taken corresponds to first
      form reported after transplant to the European Blood and Marrow Transplant Registry.

      HLA-A and -B antigens will be identified by low resolution DNA typing, whereas HLA-DRB1 type
      was determined by high resolution DNA typing techniques. HLA-A, HLA-B, and HLA-DRB1 typing
      was used to select the most closely matched donor unit-recipient pair, with preference given
      to HLA-DRB1-matched unit

    <description>Cord blood CB units will be thawed in a 37째 CB cells will be resuspended in 20ml salinesolution + dextran/albumin, and aliquoted in 4 syringes of 5ml Pts were prepared in a surgical &amp; steril room The anaesthesia consist in a short propofol sedation The injection will last 8-15 minutes. 1째 sedation is established, a standard needle for bone marrow aspiration (14 gauge) was inserted few cms in the supero-posterior iliac crest then, an aspiration of about 0.5-1 ml will be performed to assess that the needle was securely introduced in the bone marrow cavity After, we will insert the syringe containing 4-5ml of CB cell suspension which will be gently infused This procedure will be then repeated for all the remaining aliquots at a distance of 2-3cm from the previous one following the iliac crest</description>
