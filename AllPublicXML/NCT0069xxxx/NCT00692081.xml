  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Emotional and behavioural problems as well as a lack of social competence are supposed to be
      common phenomena in adolescents with borderline intellectual functioning, consequently
      impairing their social and vocational integration. Considering the lack of evaluated group
      interventions for this population, a cognitive-behavioural training is developed and its
      effectiveness is examined in a population of students attending special vocational schools.

      77 adolescents with borderline intelligence are enrolled participated in the study. They are
      randomized either to the intervention group, who received 9 group sessions over a period of 3
      months additionally to the standard vocational training (Social Competence Training for
      Adolescents with Borderline Intelligence, SCT-ABI) or to the control group who received only
      the standard vocational training. Outcome measures at the end of the intervention and at a
      6-months follow-up assessment comprise self-reports, caregiver-reports, and behavioural
      observations of cognitive, emotional, and behavioural factors of social competence.
