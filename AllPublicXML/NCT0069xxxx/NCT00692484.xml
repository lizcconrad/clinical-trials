    <textblock>
      Evaluate the effect of application procedure on the antimicrobial properties of a new product
      and a currently marketed product. Study will be conducted using methods dictated by the FDA.

      Study uses topical sampling from the abdomen and groin on intact skin and evaluates the
      germs. Effects of blotting versus not blotting will be assessed.
