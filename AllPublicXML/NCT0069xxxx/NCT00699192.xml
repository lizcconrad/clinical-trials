      To characterize the safety, tolerability, and efficacy profile of amlodipine/valsartan 5/80
      mg as compared to amlodipine/valsartan 5/40 mg (with optional titration to 5/80 mg) and
      amlodipine 5 mg monotherapy in elderly patients (≥ 65 years of age) with essential
      hypertension. All three regimens are expected to be well tolerated.

    <measure>Change in Mean Sitting Systolic Blood Pressure (msSBP) From Baseline to End of Study (Week 8)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to end of study (Week 8)</time_frame>
    <description>At study entry, blood pressure (BP) was measured in both arms with an automatic BP monitor. The arm with the higher systolic BP reading was used for all measurements throughout the study. At each study visit, 3 separate sitting BPs were obtained 23-26 hours post-dose with at least 2 minutes between measurements and with the cuff fully deflated. Mean BP was automatically calculated from the 3 readings. A negative change from baseline indicates lowered BP.</description>

        <description>At study entry, blood pressure (BP) was measured in both arms with an automatic BP monitor. The arm with the higher systolic BP reading was used for all measurements throughout the study. At each study visit, 3 separate sitting BPs were obtained 23-26 hours post-dose with at least 2 minutes between measurements and with the cuff fully deflated. Mean BP was automatically calculated from the 3 readings. A negative change from baseline indicates lowered BP.</description>

        <title>Percentage of Patients Achieving Systolic Blood Pressure Control at the End of the Study (Week 8)</title>
        <description>Systolic blood pressure control was defined as a msSBP &lt; 140 mmHg at the end of the study (Week 8). At study entry, blood pressure (BP) was measured in both arms with an automatic BP monitor. The arm with the higher systolic BP reading was used for all measurements throughout the study. At each study visit, 3 separate sitting BPs were obtained 23-26 hours post-dose with at least 2 minutes between measurements and with the cuff fully deflated. Mean BP was automatically calculated from the 3 readings.</description>
