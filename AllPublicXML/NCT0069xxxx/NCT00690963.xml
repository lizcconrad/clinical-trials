  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients who have inoperable non-small cell lung cancer are presently treated with
      chemotherapy and radiation therapy. Despite this combined approach, the vast majority of
      patients will have their cancer recur after treatment. A recurrence is not curable at this
      time. Because of the sensitivity of surrounding structures to chest irradiation, it has not
      been possible to give radiation doses that can cure many of these tumors. Intensity-modulated
      radiation therapy is a special form of radiotherapy delivery that allows doctors to reduce
      the amount of radiation dose to normal tissues and therefore reduce side effects. The
      reduction of radiation side effects may allow more radiation to be delivered to tumors,
      therefore improving tumor control and possibly longevity of patients. The purpose of this
      study is to determine whether the combination of custom designed intensity-modulated
      radiotherapy (based on individual tumor anatomy) with regular chemotherapy, will be safe
      enough to allow further intensification of radiation treatment.

      All patients must have a satisfactory IMRT plan prior to starting radiation therapy, which
      will commence concurrently with chemotherapy. All patients will be treated to a minimum of 48
      Gy in 20 daily fractions over 4 weeks [2.4 Gy per fraction (fx)], to the planning target
      volume (PTV) defined by pre chemotherapy CT with PET imaging. This is approximately
      biologically equivalent to a dose of 54 Gy in 27# (5 fractions/week). A differential boosting
      will then be selected from one of 5 dose escalation schemes. The total individual
      radiotherapy dose will be prescribed according to the highest dose level that can satisfy all
      of the set radiotherapy planning constraints for the individual's anatomy. The trial will
      proceed in 2 phases. In the first phase only the first 3 dose escalation schedules will be
      used. Once all of these 3 schedules have been deemed safe then dose levels 4 and 5 will be
      opened up to participation.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with histologically-proven, by biopsy or cytology, unresected lung cancer of
             the following histologic types: Squamous cell carcinoma, Adenocarcinoma,
             Undifferentiated large cell carcinoma, Non-Small cee; not otherwise specified (NOS,
             diagnosis on cytology alone)

          -  Patients with AJCC Stage II, IIIA or IIIB if all detectable tumour can be encompassed
             by radiation therapy fields, including both the primary tumor and the involved
             regional lymph nodes
