  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Prolactinomas are usually associated with hypogonadotropic hypogonadism in both sexes.
      Clomiphene citrate is a well known selective estrogen receptor modulator that increases
      gonadotropin secretion via hypothalamic-pituitary action. We conducted a prospective, open
      label clinical trial of CC to evaluate its effects in reverting persistent HH in male
      patients with prolactinomas under dopaminergic agonist treatment.
