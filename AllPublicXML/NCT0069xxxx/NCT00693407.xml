  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Visceral hypersensitivity as evidence of central sensory sensitization is evident in many
      patients with functional disorders such as functional dyspepsia (FD) and irritable bowel
      syndrome (IBS). We recently demonstrated both somatic hypersensitivity and abnormal
      endogenous pain modulation in IBS, both of which indicate central sensitization as a crucial
      mechanism in IBS. Endogenous pain mechanisms regulate, fine-tune and integrate sensory and
      homeostatic, including neuroendocrine, immune, motor and autonomic nervous system processes.
      Hitherto, no studies have investigated the role endogenous pain modulation in FD. Abnormal
      modulation could explain several of the symptom complexes associated with FD and provide a
      rationale for exploration of new treatments.

      The current study was designed to

        1. investigate the gastric sensitivity in FD patients and healthy controls during gastric
           capsaicin stimulation

        2. assess the endogenous pain inhibitory modulation system in FD patients and healthy
           controls during heterotopic stimulation

        Inclusion Criteria:

        FD patients:

          -  Eighty male and female FD patients according to Rome III criteria (Drossman, 2006),
             aged 18 to 70 years, will be recruited from primary and secondary care via
             advertisements and our referral networks.

          -  FD discomfort or pain should be the most prominent symptom.

          -  Patients must have been off all FD and analgesic medication and any drugs potentially
             influencing sensory function for at least two weeks before study start and be able to
             remain off such medication for the duration of the study period.

        Healthy controls:

          -  Forty male and female healthy volunteers, aged 18 to 70 years without any
             gastrointestinal pathology or history of significant abdominal pain, bowel disorders,
             bloating or discomfort during the last 3 months will be recruited.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Exclusion criteria for both FD patients and healthy controls:

          -  Organic gastrointestinal or other significant systemic disease, including
             cardiovascular, dermatological, psychiatric, neurological and endocrine diseases.
             Patients with peptic ulcer scars are also excluded.

          -  Chronic or acute pain, except related to other functional syndromes (irritable bowel
             syndrome, chronic pelvic pain, fibromyalgia, migraine).

          -  H. pylori positive.

          -  Abdominal surgery, including gastric resection or cholecystectomy (except
             appendectomy)

          -  History of brain disease or brain surgery.

          -  Ongoing treatment with any drugs or need for drugs (or complementary medication)
             within last 14 days.

          -  Treatment with any investigational drug during the preceding 30 days.

          -  Ingestion of spicy, chilli pepper containing meal, or use of capsaicin skin cream in
             last 48 hours before start of study or any study day.

          -  Pregnancy or lactation.

          -  No written informed consent obtained from subject.
