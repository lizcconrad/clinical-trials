      Objective: The purpose of the present study is to assess if perioperative variation of Brain
      Natriuretic Peptide (BNP) levels is a predictor of mortality and morbidity after cardiac
      surgery.Material and Methods: 500 consecutive patients will be enrolled prospectively in this
      study before cardiac surgery under cardiopulmonary bypass. BNP levels will be measured prior
      to surgery and at postoperative day 1. Variations of BNP levels will be analyzed to determine
      if it is a predictor of mortality and morbidity after cardiac surgery. This dynamic
      evaluation will be compared to other tools of risk stratification in cardiac surgery as the
      EuroScore. All patients will be followed 3 years after the procedure.

      Hypothesis: Perioperative BNP variations may be more sensitive than pre- or postoperative BNP
      levels alone. Furthermore the perioperative homeostasis will be measured to assess its impact
      on BNP secretion during the perioperative period.
