    <textblock>
      L-[3-18F]-α-methyltyrosine (18F-FMT) is an amino-acid tracer for positron emission tomography
      (PET). The aim of this study was to determine whether PET-CT with 18F-FMT provides additional
      information for the preoperative diagnostic workup as compared with 18F-FDG PET. Tumor uptake
      of 18F-FMT was compared with several immunohistochemical markers including L-type amino acid
      transporter 1 (LAT1).
