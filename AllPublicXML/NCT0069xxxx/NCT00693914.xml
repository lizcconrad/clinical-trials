  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Children treated with radiation therapy for brain tumors are at risk for cognitive problems.
      These problems have typically been demonstrated on global cognitive measures including
      measures of intellectual functioning (IQ). Identification of specific areas of impairment can
      assist in isolating vulnerable brain areas and developing targeted interventions.

      In this study, we assess brain tumor survivors, solid tumor controls and healthy sibling
      controls using measures of working memory (online maintenance and manipulation of
      information) in order to identify a specific cognitive process that may underlie the observed
      decline in IQ. We are also exploring relationships among working memory performance with IQ,
      clinical characteristics and a specific genetic factor of interest.

      This is a cross-sectional controlled study of brain tumor survivors treated at St. Jude with
      conformal radiation therapy. Brain tumor survivors (n= 50, solid tumor survivors (n=40), and
      healthy sibling controls (n= 40) are evaluated once only with laboratory measures of
      cognitive skills (working memory, episodic memory and estimated IQ) and parental
      questionnaires (executive and adaptive functions). We also use buccal (cheek) swabs to gather
      samples for DNA extraction. We hypothesize: brain tumor survivors will perform significantly
      worse than solid tumor and healthy controls on measures of working memory, working memory
      will correlate significantly with IQ, working memory will be associated with parent report of
      executive functions and a specified genotype related to dopamine metabolism will be
      associated with working memory impairment.
