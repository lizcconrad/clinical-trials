    <textblock>
      This is a single arm open label trial to test the tolerability of the combination of monocyte
      derived DCs loaded with KRN7000 (DC-KRN7000) and Lenalidomide (LEN) in patients with
      asymptomatic myeloma. Phase I component of the study will evaluate the optimal dose of LEN,
      with particular emphasis on safety. After an interim analysis of these data, a single dose
      level will be chosen for phase II component in additional patients.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Previously untreated asymptomatic multiple myeloma

          -  Prior therapy: Patients cannot have received prior thalidomide, lenalidomide or
             corticosteroids for the intent of treating their myeloma. Prior corticosteroid use for
             the treatment of non-malignant disorders is permitted; concurrent use should be
             restricted to the equivalent of prednisone 10 mg per day or less. Prior radiation
             therapy for the treatment of solitary plasmacytoma is permitted, but more than 3
             months should have elapsed from the last day of radiation.

          -  Measurable disease as defined by one of the following:

               -  Serum monoclonal protein ≥1.0 g by protein electrophoresis

               -  &gt;200 mg of monoclonal protein in the urine on 24 hour electrophoresis

               -  Measurable soft tissue plasmacytoma.

               -  ≥10% plasma cells as measured on the bone marrow aspirate or bone marrow biopsy.

                    -  Age ≥18 years.

                    -  ECOG Performance status 0, 1, or 2.

                    -  All study participants must be registered into the mandatory RevAssistSM

                       RevAssistSM.

                    -  Females of childbearing potential (FCBP)† must have a negative serum or
                       urine pregnancy test with a sensitivity of at least 50 mIU/mL 10 - 14 days
                       prior to and again within 24 hours of prescribing lenalidomide
                       (prescriptions must be filled within 7 days) and must either commit to
