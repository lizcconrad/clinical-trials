      The purpose of this research is to study the sleep patterns of people with moderate to severe
      atopic dermatitis and how itching affects those patterns. This study will also measure your
      body's activity during sleep using non-invasive tests described below.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Adult men and women who are between 18 and 50 years of age

          -  Diagnosis of moderate to severe atopic dermatitis including involvement of the forearm
             confirmed by published consensus diagnostic criteria57 (except for healthy control
             subjects)

          -  Subjects must be in general good health with no other skin disease, disease state or
             physical condition which would impair evaluation of their skin or which would increase
             their health risk by study participation

          -  Subjects must be willing to stay overnight in the sleep laboratory and/or to undergo
             dermal microdialysis

          -  Women of child bearing age will be required to have a negative pregnancy test in order
             to enroll in the study and will be required to maintain adequate birth control
             throughout the study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Adults over age 50

          -  Children less than 18 years of age.

          -  Unable to complete the required measures

          -  Diagnosis with other skin diseases that would affect the measurement of transepidermal
             water loss (TEWL) as determined by the investigators

          -  Currently enrolled in any investigational study in which the subject is receiving any
             type of drug, biologic, or non-drug therapy and patients undergoing treatment with
             another investigational drug or approved therapy for investigational use within 28
             days prior to study participation

          -  Evidence of depression based on the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI &gt; 10)

          -  Evidence of sleep apnea based on the results of the Epworth Sleepiness Scale score
             (ESS &gt; 10)

          -  Evidence of insomnia based on the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI) that is determined by
             the principal investigator to be unrelated to atopic dermatitis

          -  Individuals who work shifts between 8 pm and 6 am because such night shifts can alter
             subjects' circadian rhythms.

          -  Typically sleep less than 5 hours per night

          -  Reported habitual bedtime earlier than 9pm or later than 1 am (&gt; 2 times per week on
             screening diaries)

          -  Reported habitual rising time later than 9 am (&gt; 2 times per week on screening diaries

          -  Diagnosis of sleep apnea, periodic limb movement disorder, or restless leg syndrome 58

          -  Consumption of more than 3 alcoholic beverages per day

          -  Chronic pain judged to be a significant sleep-disturbing factor as determined by the
             investigators62

          -  Current treatment with lipophilic beta blockers, opioids, glucocorticoids,
             theophylline, or other medications known to interfere with sleep as determined by the
             investigators 63-69

          -  Uncontrolled asthma or COPD 70-73

          -  Uncontrolled thyroid disease 74,75

          -  Poorly controlled diabetes mellitus

          -  Poorly compensated congestive heart failure 76

          -  Use of herbal or naturopathic treatments for sleep

          -  Habitual smoking between 11 pm and 7 am 77,78
