  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with facial atopic eczema and a poor response to topical corticosteroid applied
      either Protopic or Fluticasone ointment twice a day for 3 weeks. They could continue during 3
      more weeks once a day if needed or change for the other ointment.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Treatments were to be applied twice daily over all lesions on the face (except for the
      eyelids) until clearance, for a maximum of 3 weeks and then, in case of uncleared residual
      lesions, once daily for up to 3 further weeks. In the event of a flare-up the treatment was
      to be resumed twice a day until the end of the study.
