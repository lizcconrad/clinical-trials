  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      We propose to use actigraphy (measured by activity watches) as a tool to quantify sleep
      disturbances in patients with orthostatic intolerance compared with healthy control subjects.
      In this pilot study, we will test the null hypothesis (Ho) that there are no differences in
      the sleep quality between patients with orthostatic intolerance and healthy control subjects.

        Patients diagnosed with the Postural Tachycardia Syndrome. The criteria include:

          -  an increase in heart rate on standing (from supine) of &gt;30 bpm

          -  in the setting of symptoms of cerebral hypoperfusion that are worse with standing and
             better when recumbent

          -  the symptoms are daily or almost daily

          -  the symptoms are chronic (lasting greater than 6 motnsh)

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Diagnosed with orthostatic intolerance by the Vanderbilt Autonomic Dysfunction Center

          -  Control subjects will be free of orthostatic intolerance and other major medical
             problems, free of medications during the study

          -  Age between 18-65 years

          -  Male and female subjects are eligible.

          -  Able and willing to provide informed consent

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Overt cause for postural tachycardia (such as acute dehydration)

          -  Self-report of pregnancy

          -  Inability to give, or withdrawal of, informed consent

          -  Other factors which in the investigator's opinion would prevent the subject from
             completing the protocol
