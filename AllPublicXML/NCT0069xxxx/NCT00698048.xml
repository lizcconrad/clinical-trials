  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with severe infection can develop very low blood pressure. There are many mechanisms
      leading to this, and one of them appears to involve a hormone called vasopressin. In children
      as compared to adults, the mechanism and response to low blood pressure are different for
      reasons that are not clear. One possibility is the difference in the production and/or
      response to vasopressin. Vasopressin has become part of the treatment of children with low
      blood pressure in the setting of severe infection, when other treatment has failed, but its
      use is on the basis of animal and adult studies. The exact timing and dose is uncertain.

      In this research study, the patients will receive standard treatment for sepsis and septic
      shock, and the investigators will measure the blood levels of vasopressin and a related
      compound called copeptin (both are required to understand the mechanism of control involved).
      Blood will need to be taken from patients without any sepsis so as to be able to compare the
      values in health and in sickness. The patient groups the investigators have chosen for this
      are those children who will have blood taken anyway as part of their routine care. The aim of
      this study is to develop an understanding of the body's hormonal response (with respect to
      vasopressin) to severe infection in children. The long-term aim is to improve the care of
      critically ill children with severe infection by using the most appropriate dose of
      vasopressin at the most appropriate time.
