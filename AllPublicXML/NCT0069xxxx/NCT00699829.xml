  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Mohs' micrographic surgery (MMS) is a treatment of choice for high recurrence risk basal-cell
      carcinomas (BCC). Realized under local anaesthesia, it induces very low recurrence rates and
      spares unnecessary excision of intact surrounding tissues, thus decreasing the needs for
      flaps, skin grafts, and allows immediate reconstruction…. Its disadvantages are mainly: need
      for a significant training of the operator, the pathologist and the non-medical personnel;
      longer duration of the procedure, with higher a priori costs, and constraints for the patient
      related to the duration of the intervention. Traditional surgical excision with immediate or
      differed reconstruction is the technique of reference. Provided that re-excisions are
      performed as long as previous ones do not guarantee free margins, it gives good results. Its
      real costs are poorly known and can be enhanced by several considerations: multiplicity of
      the operational acts if the initial excision is insufficient, more complex reconstruction
      procedures, duration of post-operative dressings, ….

      The investigators' objective is to know the costs of the surgical treatment of the high risk
      CBC, comparing the CMM with the surgical excision with immediate or differed reconstruction,
      along with its effectiveness defined by the absence of recurrence. by its impact on the
      quality of life of the patient. It is a prospective, multicentric, comparative, not
      randomized, open, cohort study, of the type &quot;here and elsewhere&quot;. Patients with high-risk
      CBC, as defined by the French ANAES Guidelines (2004), will be included:

        -  clinically morpheaform aspect or ill-limited margins, aggressive histological forms;

        -  already recurred BCC (except for superficial BCCs));

        -  nodular BCC located in the high-risk zone (nose, peri-orificial areas of the head) and
           with diameter larger than 1 cm.

      The effectiveness will be measured by the rate of recurrence at 5 years (as measured by the
      prolongation of the follow-up after the surgical procedure). The utility from the patient
      point of view will be evaluated by a specific dermatologic quality of life questionnaire
      (Skindex) and by a generic questionnaire (Euroqol 5D), supplemented by a questionnaire of
      satisfaction of the care (Attkisson). The economic perspectives studied will be those of the
      hospital, of the payer and of the society. Direct medical costs will be evaluated by
      micro-costing. The main production factors implied in the realization of one CMM or one
      traditional surgery in dermatology/surgery and anatomopathology wards will be identified,
      counted, and developed. The measuring units will be the estimate of the time devoted to each
      individual procedure, reported to the total activity of each ward and the wages of the
      various categories of personnel implied, and the unit costs in consumable and redeemable
      material, reported to their utilisation factor. The hospital indirect costs will be estimated
      by the financial services of the hospitals. Accrual of 150 CMM and 300 traditional excisions
      will be performed within a two year period of time.
