    <textblock>
      Idiopathic osteoporosis (IOP) is an uncommon disorder in which otherwise healthy young
      individuals sustain one or more low-trauma fractures. Teriparatide [PTH(1-34)], which is FDA
      approved for treatment of osteoporosis in men and postmenopausal women, works by stimulating
      bone formation. We hypothesize that teriparatide will significantly increase bone density
      (BMD) and improve bone structure in premenopausal women with IOP.

    <textblock>
      Idiopathic osteoporosis (IOP) is an uncommon disorder in which otherwise healthy young
      individuals sustain one or more low-trauma fractures. In our studies of IOP in men,
      histomorphometric indices of bone formation are depressed, and affected men respond to
      PTH(1-34) with robust increases in lumbar spine (LS) bone mineral density (BMD). We are now
      beginning the third year of an R01 (AR4989603) investigating the etiology and pathogenesis,
      as well as the histomorphometric and bone microarchitectural features of IOP in premenopausal
      women. We have found evidence of markedly decreased bone formation and microarchitectural
      deterioration with decreased mechanical competence/strength.

      Teriparatide [PTH(1-34)] is an anabolic agent that stimulates bone formation and improves
      bone microarchitecture. Based upon our findings, we hypothesize that teriparatide will
      significantly increase BMD and improve microarchitecture in premenopausal women with IOP.

      We will test this hypothesis in an open-label study of carefully characterized premenopausal
      women with IOP who are participating in our NIH-funded study and who have fragility fractures
      or very low bone density. Participants in the study will receive 18-24 months of teriparatide
      and the effects on BMD and microstructure, bone mechanical competence, and bone turnover will
      be assessed. In order to assess whether teriparatide stimulates bone formation to the same
      extent in women with IOP as it does in normal women, we will compare the short-term changes
      (2 and 4 weeks) in biochemical markers of bone formation in response to teriparatide between
      women with IOP and normal women who are participating in our NIH-funded study as controls.
