      The purpose of this study is to determine the safest and maximum tolerated dosing regimens
      for intraperitoneal oxaliplatin with intravenous docetaxel and intravenous oxaliplatin with
      intraperitoneal docetaxel for recurrent ovarian, primary peritoneal, or fallopian tube
      cancer.

      This is a non-randomized, open-label Phase I trial in patients with previously treated,
      recurrent ovarian, primary peritoneal, or fallopian tube cancer. Patients may have either
      platinum -sensitive (relapse &gt; 12 months from primary therapy) or platinum-resistant (relapse
      ≤ 12 months from primary therapy) disease.

      Up to 20 patients will be enrolled into each of the following arms:

        -  Arm 1 patients will receive intravenous docetaxel at standard dosing of 75 mg/m2 over 1
           hour on day #1 followed by intraperitoneal oxaliplatin on day #2 until maximum tolerated
           dose is achieved.

        -  Arm 2 patients will receive intravenous oxaliplatin at standard dosing of 75 mg/m2 over
           1 hour on day #1 followed by intraperitoneal docetaxel on day #2 until maximum tolerated
           dose is achieved.

      Treatment will be repeated every 3 weeks until disease progression, intolerable toxicity.
