  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      We expect subjects in the interventional groups, who wear shrinkers, to heal more quickly
      than control subjects who wear no shrinkers. We also expect them to experience greater
      reduction in residual limb volume during the early stages of postoperative care leading up to
      prosthetic fitting, fewer healing complications, reduced time to the prosthetic fitting,
      increased time to the first prosthetic socket replacement, and fewer socket replacements by
      the end of the &quot;transition to stable phase&quot;.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Edema is an inevitable result of amputation surgery. Persistent edema can affect oxygen and
      nutrient flow into, as well as waste flow out of the residual limb. Shrinkers are a common
      and effective treatment for edema. However, their influence on healing and long term limb
      volume has not been studied. This study will pertain to human subjects affected by primary
      transtibial amputation. Two interventional groups of patients will use shrinkers with
      different levels of compression as part of their rehabilitation. A third, control group will
      not use shrinkers. The groups will be studied to determine the effects of shrinker use on
      healing and long term residual limb volume.
