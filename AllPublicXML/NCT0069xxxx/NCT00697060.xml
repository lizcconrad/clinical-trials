  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Protocol AMP-024 is a Phase 2 study of imexon plus docetaxel for patients with previously
      treated lung cancer that has spread in the body. Docetaxel is approved by the Food and Drug
      Administration (FDA) as a second line therapy for this cancer. The imexon is administered on
      days 1-5 and the docetaxel on day 1 of every 3 week cycle. The objective of the protocol is
      to determine if the combination of imexon plus docetaxel is safe and effective.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Subjects with histologically or cytologically confirmed NSCLC.

          2. Subject with metastatic disease (Appendix D) who have received no more than 2 prior
             chemotherapy regimens for their metastatic disease.

               -  Adjuvant chemotherapy is considered one prior regimen.

               -  Immunological and targeted agents such as bevacizumab, erlotinib or gefitinib are
                  considered prior regimens.

          3. Subjects must have at least one measurable lesion by RECIST criteria (Appendix C). If
             the only measurable lesion is a lymph node, it must measure at least 20 mm in LD, and
             if the only target lesion is a single lesion, a cytological or histological
             confirmation of NSCLC is required.

          4. Resolution of all chemotherapy or radiotherapy-related toxicities to CTCAE grade 1 or
             lower, except for stable sensory neuropathy of &lt; grade 2 and/or alopecia.

          5. Men and women age &gt; 18 years.

          6. ECOG performance status of 0 - 1 (Appendix E).

          7. Not pregnant nor lactating.

          8. If of child bearing potential must be able and agree to use adequate contraception.

          9. Adequate renal function defined by:

               -  serum creatinine level &lt; 2.0 mg/dL.

         10. G6PD (quantitative) greater than or equal to the lower limit of normal.

         11. Adequate hematologic function defined by:

               -  absolute neutrophil count (ANC) &gt;1,500/mm続, and

               -  platelet count &gt; 100,000/mm続, and

               -  hemoglobin level &gt; 9 g/dL.

         12. Adequate hepatic function defined by:

               -  total bilirubin level &lt; ULN, and

               -  AST and ALT levels &lt; 1.5 x ULN

               -  Alkaline phosphatase &lt; 2.5x ULN

         13. Prior brain metastasis are allowed but must have been treated and controlled for &gt; 1

          5. Subjects with meningeal carcinomatosis.

          6. Women who are pregnant or breast-feeding, women of child bearing potential (WOCBP)
