  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background: Autism is a complex developmental disorder involving difficulties in verbal and
      nonverbal communication, social-emotional functioning, and markedly restricted interests and
      activities. Strong evidence from research conducted with family members of children with
      autism supports the role of genetic factors in its etiology. Thus, some family members are
      characterized by the broad autism phenotype (BAP) which involves a clinical picture of milder
      but qualitatively similar difficulties.

      Working hypothesis and aims: Researchers recently initiated prospective longitudinal studies
      investigating the early developmental profiles of young siblings of children with autism
      (SIBS-A). Such longitudinal SIBS-A study is currently conducted at the Hebrew University and
      includes the oldest siblings studied to date. Our main aim is to identify siblings who
      manifest any autism or BAP characteristics.

      Methods: Two groups, SIBS-A (n = 42) and siblings of children with typical development
      (SIBS-TD, n = 62), were seen at ages 4, 14, 24, 36, 54 months and 7 years. We plan to
      continue the investigation at age 10 years, a time when school related abilities and
      social/emotional competences are more consolidated and to investigate the developmental
      trajectories of children's abilities from age 4 months to 10 years using growth curve
      analyses.

      Expected results: We expect that compared to SIBS-TD, significantly more 10-year-old SIBS-A
      will display difficulties related to ASD or BAP related difficulties. We also expect to
      identify different patterns of stability and/or change in the development of children's
      abilities from age 4 months to 10 years, between the two groups.

      Importance: This study provides a useful approach for the examination of the main research
      hypothesis regarding the development of SIBS-A. One of the main advantages of using the
      growth curve analysis is the identification of early predictive markers for future
      development.

      Probable implications to Medicine: This research has significant implication for early
      identification and the search into the causes of autism and the BAP, as well as for
      implementation of early treatment and prevention programs. By highlighting expressions of ASD
      and the BAP in siblings, we may identify early clinically predictive behavioral markers
      associated with their onset and contribute to the investigation of underlying genetics
      mechanisms.

        The participants in the SIBS-A and SIBS-TD groups, who are now reaching the age of 10
        years, participated in the longitudinal study and were seen at the ages of 4, 14, 24, 36,
        54 months and 7 years. The SIBS-A group (n = 42) comprises children who have an older
        sibling with autism. All probands were diagnosed using the Autism Diagnostic Observation
        Schedule (Lord, Rutter, DiLavore &amp; Risi, 2002) and/or the Autism Diagnostic Interview -
        Revised (ADI-R; Lord, Rutter, &amp; Le Couteur, 1994). Families were recruited through
        treatment centers, special schools, the national organization for children with autism in
        Israel, and through families of children with autism.

        The SIBS-TD group (n = 62) comprises children who have an older sibling with typical
        development and who participated in the longitudinal study. Families were recruited from
        maternity wards in Jerusalem. (more information is available in Yirmiya et al., 2006).
