      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of cetuximab combined with
      FOLFIRI in patients with advanced gastric cancer who failed first-line chemotherapy

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Up to now, although FU based, cisplatin based and taxane based regimen, and ECF regimen have
      been suggested as the first line therapy for A/MGC by FDA, there is no standard regimen for
      patients with A/MGC as second line treatment. Based on the promising results of cetuximab
      combined with FOLFIRI in metastatic colorectal cancer, we design this clinical trial to
      evaluate the efficacy and safety of cetuximab combined with FOLFIRI for A/MGC patients as a
      second line treatment.
