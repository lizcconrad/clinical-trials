  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Heart failure affects over 5.3 million Americans and, while other cardiovascular diseases
      have enjoyed a reduction in mortality rates over the last decade, the mortality from heart
      failure continues to rise[1]. Thus, identifying novel therapies that can reduce heart failure
      development and/or progression are warranted. Unifying to most cardiomyopathic processes is
      an impaired handling of reactive oxygen species (ROS)[2-4]. Reactive oxygen species are
      generated as byproducts of inflammation and oxidative stress that occur in the setting of
      normal myocardial aerobic metabolism. Metallothionein, glutathione reductase, and superoxide
      dismutase are major antioxidants in the myocardium that help combat oxidative stress and
      prevent myocardial damage. In certain clinical settings, including cardiac ischemia,
      diabetes, and heavy metal excess (copper, iron), myocardial oxidative stress levels are
      greatly increased. When pro-oxidant levels exceed myocardial antioxidant capabilities,
      ROS-induced membrane, protein, and DNA inactivation can lead to the development of cardiac
      dysfunction.

      One means of preventing the development or progression of cardiomyopathy is to reduce
      oxidative stress through up-regulation of intramyocardial antioxidants. Murine studies of
      cardiomyopathy have shown that oral administration of zinc acetate may succeed as an indirect
      myocardial anti-oxidant because zinc sufficiently up-regulates the intramyocardial production
      of superoxide dismutase (a zinc-dependant anti-oxidant enzyme) and metallothionein (a &quot;super
      antioxidant&quot;) [5-8]. Zinc also directly reduces prooxidant Cu levels by reducing
      gastrointestinal zinc absorption. However, to date, no studies have examined the impact of
      zinc acetate supplementation in subjects with cardiomyopathy and systolic failure on
      antioxidant capacity and remodeling.

      The hypothesis of this pilot study is that administration of oral zinc acetate to humans with
      cardiomyopathy will lead to an up-regulation of myocardial anti-oxidant capabilities,leading
      to a favorable reduction in oxidative stress. This study will provide preliminary data to
      support a randomized, placebo-controlled trial of zinc therapy in heart failure as a means of
      improving or preventing the progression of systolic dysfunction in subjects with
      mild-moderate heart failure.

      Altered regulation of the transition-metal copper (Cu) may lead to an overproduction of
      reactive oxygen species (ROS) with subsequent development of a nonischemic cardiomyopathy
      (NISCM). Myocardial Cu levels are elevated in NISCM, and Cu levels are highest in the
      &quot;diabetic cardiomyopathy.&quot; In humans, zinc (Zn) is an essential component of proteins
      critical for regulating myocardial cytoskeleton turnover and cellular proliferation. Zn also
      serves as an antioxidant and indirect regulator of redox-active Cu. By upregulating the
      chelator metallothionein, Zn reduces the levels of free Cu implicated in oxidative myocardial
      damage.

      Transgenic over-expression of the antioxidant metallothionein has been shown to reduce
      ROS-induced myocardial damage. In diabetic cardiomyopathy, Cu chelation improves left
      ventricular (LV) diastolic relaxation abnormalities. However, it is unknown if Zn
      supplementation could alter the progression of LV systolic dysfunction through Cu depletion
      and ROS reduction. The aim of this pilot study is to assess the impact of a novel
      intervention, Zn supplementation, on myocardial remodeling by examining changes in serum
      levels of the types I (PINP) and III (PIIINP) collagen N-terminal propeptides. The primary
      study hypothesis is that Zn supplementation will have a favorable impact on the
      pathophysiology of NISCM by either repleting a Zn deficiency/insufficiency or by reducing
      myocardial damage and adverse remodeling in the setting of redox-active Cu excess.

      Stable outpatients (n=40) with chronic NISCM (ejection fraction ≤40%) will receive daily oral
      Zn-acetate (50 mg po tid) for 10 months. Serum PINP, PIIINP, and markers of inflammation
      (CRP, sedimentation rate, myeloperoxidase) and oxidative stress (8-isoprostane, superoxide
      dismutase) will be obtained at baseline and following 10 months of Zn supplementation.
      Changes in collagen turnover will then be correlated with changes noted in LV systolic and
      diastolic function by echocardiography. Finally, we will examine for a differential treatment
      effect of Zn therapy in a diabetic subset (n=20) with NISCM compared with the nondiabetics.

        <description>The intervention group (patients with systolic heart failure) was given Zinc Acetate 50 mg po three times daily for 10 months. The change from baseline in markers of cardiac collagen turnover (PINP) in patients with systolic heart failure after 10 months of zinc acetate was measured and compared with a single measure from healthy controls.</description>
