      The purpose of this data collection is to determine long term survival rate of ArComXL®
      highly cross-linked polyethylene

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Approximately 500 patients (cases) will be enrolled in this data collection effort and
      10-year follow-up will be attempted. Follow-up will be obtained by sending a questionnaire
      directly to the patients by mail. The follow-up will be annually and only survivorship data
      will be collected.

      This data collection project was developed in order to determine the actual long-term
      (10-year) survival rate of Biomet's ArCom XL highly cross-linked polyethylene. Data will be
      collated for uncemented cases only. This will eliminate the possibility of cement or cement
      debris being a confounding variable.

      The data gathered will be collated and used to provide feedback to designing engineers,
      support marketing efforts, and answer potential questions from reimbursement agencies.
