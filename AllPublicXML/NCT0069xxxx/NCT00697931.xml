      The purpose of this study is to compare the immunogenicity and reactogenicity of the
      adjuvanted recombinant hepatitis B vaccine with that of Engerix™-B when both are injected
      according to a three dose schedule (0, 1, 6 months) in an adult non-responder population

             the time of entry.

          -  Female participants who are at risk to become pregnant will be on a contraceptive
             programme if necessary during the study period.

          -  Written informed consent obtained from the subjects

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Positive at screening for anti-HBV antibodies

          -  Elevated serum liver enzymes.
