    <textblock>
      The objective of the trial is to assess the non-immunogenicity and safety of corifollitropin
      alfa (also known as Org 36286, SCH 900962 and MK-8962) in participants undergoing repeated
      COS cycles using a multiple dose GnRH antagonist protocol.

    <textblock>
      This trial is designed as an open-label, uncontrolled, repeated cycle trial to assess the
      non-immunogenicity and safety of corifollitropin alfa in participants undergoing repeated COS
      cycles for in vitro fertilization (IVF) or intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) using a
      multiple dose GnRH antagonist protocol. The trial period per participant will cover 1, 2 or 3
      COS treatment cycles and no more than three (in-between two stimulation cycles) Frozen-Thawed
      Embryo Transfer (FTET) cycles following either or both of the first two treatment cycles. In
      each stimulation cycle, participants receive a single injection of corifollitropin alfa and
      one week later, treatment is continued with a daily dose of any FSH-containing preparation up
      to the day of (rec)hCG administration for final oocyte maturation. Assessment of
      anti-corifollitropin alfa antibodies and local tolerance after corifollitropin alfa injection
      are important safety endpoints in this trial.

    <time_frame>Pre-dose (Stimulation Day 1) and up to approximately 40 days post dose in each treatment cycle</time_frame>
    <description>Serum samples obtained pre-dose and at 2 weeks after embryo transfer (ET), or at cycle discontinuation and 2-3 weeks after cycle discontinuation if cycle was stopped before ET was performed, were analyzed for presence of anti-corifollitropin alfa antibodies using screening and confirmatory tests. If a participant was confirmed to have anti-corifollitropin alfa antibody present in a post dose sample according to these tests, review of adverse events (AEs) in the participant was performed. The sample was also tested to evaluate whether the antibody appeared to have neutralizing activity that would interfere with the study drug biological effect. A participant was determined to have clinically relevant immunogenicity if the participant had a confirmed post dose anti-corifollitropin alfa antibody test result accompanied by clinical signs of immunogenicity (e.g., hypersensitivity reaction), considering also the results of the test for neutralizing activity of any antibody present.</description>

    <time_frame>Up to approximately 1 month after oocyte pick-up (34-36 hours after [rec]hCG administration [approximately Stimulation Day 10]), within a treatment cycle</time_frame>
    <description>OHSS was classified on study based on a slightly modified WHO Scientific Group (1973) classification: Grade I (mild) = characterized by excessive steroid secretion and ovarian enlargement (5-7 cm). Abdominal discomfort, including abdominal pain, is present. Grade II (moderate) = characterized by distinct ovarian cysts (ovary size 8-10 cm), accompanied by abdominal pain and tension, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea. Grade III (severe) = characterized by enlarged cystic ovaries (ovary size &gt;10 cm), accompanied by ascites and occasionally hydrothorax. Abdominal tension and pain may be severe. Pronounced hydrothorax together with an abdominal cavity filled with cysts and fluid elevating the diaphragm may cause severe breathing difficulties. Large quantities of fluid inside the cysts and in the peritoneal and pleural cavities cause haemoconcentration and increased blood viscosity. In rare cases, the syndrome may further be complicated by the occurrence of thromboembolic phenomena.</description>

    <time_frame>Day of oocyte pick-up, 34-36 hours after (rec)hCG administration (approximately Stimulation Day 10), in Treatment Cycle 1</time_frame>
    <description>This measure summarizes results of assessment of the quality of oocytes performed following oocyte retrieval, among participants scheduled for ICSI in Treatment Cycle 1. For oocytes obtained from each participant, the number in each of 3 stages of oocyte development were determined. The earliest phase is the germinal vesicles stage, during which the immature oocyte appears as a large vesicular nucleus. Metaphase I is an intermediate stage during which the vesicles have broken down and the polar body has not yet formed; the oocyte is still immature. Metaphase II is the mature oocyte and is indicated by the presence of the polar body. Rating of quality for usefulness in ICSI follows the order metaphase II (best quality), metaphase I (lesser quality) and germinal vesicles stage (poorest quality). Only metaphase II oocytes can be fertilized. Metaphase I oocytes can develop in vitro to metaphase II oocytes. Germinal vesicles stage oocytes are the least useful for ICSI procedures.</description>

    <description>Up to 3 COS cycles (also called treatment cycles) were performed, each including the following: A single injection of 150 µg corifollitropin alfa was administered on Day 2 or 3 of the menstrual cycle (Stimulation Day 1). Administration of GnRH antagonist (0.25 mg/day) started on Stimulation Day 5 or 6 and continued through day of administration of recombinant Human Chorion Gonadotropin ([rec]hCG) (5,000-10,000 IU/250 µg). Administration of (rec)hCG occurred when 3 follicles ≥17 mm were observed on ultrasound scan (USS). Daily dosing with Follicle Stimulating Hormone (FSH) (not to exceed 225 IU/day) began on Stimulation Day 8 and continued up to day of (rec)hCG administration. Progesterone for luteal phase support was administered starting on the day of oocyte pick-up (34-36 hours after [rec]hCG) and continued for approximately 6 weeks. After COS cycles 1 and 2, Frozen-Thawed Embryo Transfer cycles (up to 3 after each COS cycle) could occur.</description>

        <description>Serum samples obtained pre-dose and at 2 weeks after embryo transfer (ET), or at cycle discontinuation and 2-3 weeks after cycle discontinuation if cycle was stopped before ET was performed, were analyzed for presence of anti-corifollitropin alfa antibodies using screening and confirmatory tests. If a participant was confirmed to have anti-corifollitropin alfa antibody present in a post dose sample according to these tests, review of adverse events (AEs) in the participant was performed. The sample was also tested to evaluate whether the antibody appeared to have neutralizing activity that would interfere with the study drug biological effect. A participant was determined to have clinically relevant immunogenicity if the participant had a confirmed post dose anti-corifollitropin alfa antibody test result accompanied by clinical signs of immunogenicity (e.g., hypersensitivity reaction), considering also the results of the test for neutralizing activity of any antibody present.</description>

An AE could therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal (investigational) product, whether or not related to the medicinal (investigational) product.</description>

        <title>Number of Participants With Moderate to Severe Ovarian Hyperstimulation Syndrome (OHSS)</title>
        <description>OHSS was classified on study based on a slightly modified WHO Scientific Group (1973) classification: Grade I (mild) = characterized by excessive steroid secretion and ovarian enlargement (5-7 cm). Abdominal discomfort, including abdominal pain, is present. Grade II (moderate) = characterized by distinct ovarian cysts (ovary size 8-10 cm), accompanied by abdominal pain and tension, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea. Grade III (severe) = characterized by enlarged cystic ovaries (ovary size &gt;10 cm), accompanied by ascites and occasionally hydrothorax. Abdominal tension and pain may be severe. Pronounced hydrothorax together with an abdominal cavity filled with cysts and fluid elevating the diaphragm may cause severe breathing difficulties. Large quantities of fluid inside the cysts and in the peritoneal and pleural cavities cause haemoconcentration and increased blood viscosity. In rare cases, the syndrome may further be complicated by the occurrence of thromboembolic phenomena.</description>

Administration of GnRH antagonist (0.25 mg/day) started on Stimulation Day 5 or 6 and continued through day of administration of (rec)hCG (5,000-10,000 IU/250 µg). Daily dosing with FSH (not to exceed 225 IU/day) began on Stimulation Day 8 and continued up to day of (rec)hCG administration. Progesterone was administered for luteal phase support. After COS cycles 1 and 2, FTET cycles (up to 3 after each COS cycle) could occur.</description>

        <title>Quality of Oocytes Assessed Prior to Planned ICSI in Treatment Cycle 1</title>
        <description>This measure summarizes results of assessment of the quality of oocytes performed following oocyte retrieval, among participants scheduled for ICSI in Treatment Cycle 1. For oocytes obtained from each participant, the number in each of 3 stages of oocyte development were determined. The earliest phase is the germinal vesicles stage, during which the immature oocyte appears as a large vesicular nucleus. Metaphase I is an intermediate stage during which the vesicles have broken down and the polar body has not yet formed; the oocyte is still immature. Metaphase II is the mature oocyte and is indicated by the presence of the polar body. Rating of quality for usefulness in ICSI follows the order metaphase II (best quality), metaphase I (lesser quality) and germinal vesicles stage (poorest quality). Only metaphase II oocytes can be fertilized. Metaphase I oocytes can develop in vitro to metaphase II oocytes. Germinal vesicles stage oocytes are the least useful for ICSI procedures.</description>

          <title>Quality of Oocytes Assessed Prior to Planned ICSI in Treatment Cycle 3</title>
          <description>This measure summarizes results of assessment of the quality of oocytes performed following oocyte retrieval, among participants scheduled for ICSI in Treatment Cycle 3. For oocytes obtained from each participant, the number in each of 3 stages of oocyte development were determined. The earliest phase is the germinal vesicles stage, during which the immature oocyte appears as a large vesicular nucleus. Metaphase I is an intermediate stage during which the vesicles have broken down and the polar body has not yet formed; the oocyte is still immature. Metaphase II is the mature oocyte and is indicated by the presence of the polar body. Rating of quality for usefulness in ICSI follows the order metaphase II (best quality), metaphase I (lesser quality) and germinal vesicles stage (poorest quality). Only metaphase II oocytes can be fertilized. Metaphase I oocytes can develop in vitro to metaphase II oocytes. Germinal vesicles stage oocytes are the least useful for ICSI procedures.</description>

Administration of GnRH antagonist (0.25 mg/day) started on Stimulation Day 5 or 6 and continued through day of administration of (rec)hCG (5,000-10,000 IU/250 µg). Daily dosing with FSH (not to exceed 225 IU/day) began on Stimulation Day 8 and continued up to day of (rec)hCG administration. Progesterone was administered for luteal phase support. After COS cycles 1 and 2, FTET cycles (up to 3 after each COS cycle) could occur.</description>

            <description>Up to 3 COS cycles (also called treatment cycles) were performed, each including the following: A single injection of 150 µg corifollitropin alfa was administered on Day 2 or 3 of the menstrual cycle (Stimulation Day 1). Administration of GnRH antagonist (0.25 mg/day) started on Stimulation Day 5 or 6 and continued through day of administration of (rec)hCG (5,000-10,000 IU/250 µg). Daily dosing with FSH (not to exceed 225 IU/day) began on Stimulation Day 8 and continued up to day of (rec)hCG administration. Progesterone was administered for luteal phase support. After COS cycles 1 and 2, FTET cycles (up to 3 after each COS cycle) could occur.</description>
