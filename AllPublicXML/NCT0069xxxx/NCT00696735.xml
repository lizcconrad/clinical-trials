  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Follicular lymphomas are a subgroup of B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphomas, accounting for 15% to
      30% of newly diagnosed lymphomas.1-3 Median survival varies from 5 to 10 years depending on
      the prognostic factors at diagnosis and response to first-line therapy.4-6 Whatever the
      treatment, no plateau appears on survival curves, and virtually all patients relapse;
      follicular lymphomas are ultimately progressive, and fatal.2,3,5 No reference first-line
      treatment is clearly defined. One of the most active therapies is still doxorubicin-based
      chemotherapy with or without interferon.7-9 New therapeutic approaches including purine
      analogs and anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody are promising and are progressively included in the
      management of these lymphomas.2,3,10-13 The role of high-dose therapy (HDT) as a salvage
      treatment for patients with relapsing follicular lymphoma is demonstrated by some authors;
      several reports have shown the superiority of HDT followed by autologous stem-cell
      transplantation, purged or unpurged, compared with conventional chemotherapy in terms of no
      relapse and overall survival.14-18 Only a few reports have been published showing HDT results
      as a first-line treatment for poor-risk patients with follicular lymphoma, and the results
      remain controversial.19-26 These data prompted the French Groupe Ouest-Est des Leuc√©mies et
      Autres Maladies du Sang (GOELAMS) to conduct a prospective randomized trial using patients
      with newly diagnosed follicular lymphoma with a high tumor burden. A combined
      doxorubicin-based chemotherapy associated with interferon was compared to front-line HDT
      followed by purged autologous stem-cell transplantation.

    <description>standard chemotherapy arm, the CHVP (cyclophosphamide, low-dose doxorubicin, teniposide, and prednisone) regimen consisted of cyclophosphamide (600 mg/m2), doxorubicin (25 mg/m2), and teniposide (60 mg/m2), all administered intravenously on day 1, and prednisone (40 mg/m2), administered orally on days 1 to 5.4,12 Treatment consisted of a 6-course induction phase administered monthly, followed, for responders and patients presenting a stable disease, by a maintenance phase that consisted of 1 cycle every 2 months for 1 year. Concomitant subcutaneous interferon alfa-2b was administered at 5 x 106 3 times a week for 18 months.</description>

Patients with less than PR after the VCAP cycles received, as salvage therapy, 2 to 3 courses of DHAP (dexamethasone, high-dose cytarabine, and cisplatin) combining cisplatine (100 mg/m2) on day 1, cytarabine (4 g/m2) on day 2, and dexamethasone (40 mg/m2) on days 1 through 4. If at least a PR was obtained after DHAP, stem cells were harvested or patients were considered as failures</description>
