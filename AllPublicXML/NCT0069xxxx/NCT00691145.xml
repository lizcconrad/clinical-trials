    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to assess the efficacy and safety of 0.1% and 0.03% Tacrolimus
      ointment for 12 months in adults with moderate to severe atopic dermatitis.

      The main phase is 6 months duration, but the follow up phase up to 12 months will allow the
      collection of efficacy and safety data in a period which will include all seasons in each
      patient, to account for seasonal variability which strongly affect atopic dermatitis course.
