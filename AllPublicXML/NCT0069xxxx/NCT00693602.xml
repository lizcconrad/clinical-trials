    <textblock>
      This is a compassionate use protocol for patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) who
      have developed hypersensitivity or intolerance to E. coli L-asparaginase and/or
      PEG-L-asparaginase.

      Primary Objective

      To provide Erwinase to patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) or non-Hodgkins
      lymphoma who are intolerant or have developed hypersensitivity to E. coli asparaginase and/or
      PEG-asparaginase.

      TREATMENT PLAN

      Erwinia L-asparaginase administration will be given according to the protocol or non-protocol
      treatment plan under which the patient is currently being treated.

      Erwinase will be discontinued in any patient experiencing an allergic reaction or any Grade 3
      or higher adverse event believed to be attributable to this agent.
