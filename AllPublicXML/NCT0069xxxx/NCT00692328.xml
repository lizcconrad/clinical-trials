  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To investigate how levodopa and acupuncture affect fatigue and muscle function in people who
      suffer from Parkinson's disease. Subjects may choose to participate in levodopa or
      acupuncture part, or both. Study procedures include an exercise protocol, transcranial
      magnetic stimulation (a non-invasive type of brain stimulation that cause small muscle
      twitch), a blood draw, and personality surveys.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Subjects will answer surveys, have their blood drawn, undergo TMS and perform an exercise.
      The TMS/exercise task will measure fatigue and muscle response. The surveys will describe
      personality and measure fatigue. The CTRC will do genotype studies on the blood to look for
      genetic differences. Each subject is eligible to receive both study treatment types (levodopa
      and acupuncture). Depending upon the study treatment type they choose, each subject will be
      randomly assigned to one of six possible subject groups:

      Ia. Full expectancy; levodopa: Subjects will be told that they are taking levodopa.

      Ib. Half expectancy; levodopa: Subjects will be told that they have 50% chance of receiving
      levodopa or placebo.

      Ic. No expectancy; levodopa: Subjects will be told that they are receiving placebo levodopa.

      IIa. Full expectancy; acupuncture: Subjects will be told that they are receiving real
      acupuncture.

      IIb. Half expectancy; acupuncture: Subjects will be told that they have 50% chance of
      receiving real or sham-acupuncture.

      IIc. No expectancy; acupuncture: Subjects will be told that they are receiving
      sham-acupuncture.

      Subjects will attend four visits for the levodopa part and/or three visits in the acupuncture
      part. On the first visit, subjects will answer questionnaires and have samples of their blood
      collected. On the other visits, subjects will undergo TMS while they perform a repetitive
      exercise task. Subjects will then either wait for 30 minutes or receive the investigative
      intervention that they have been randomly assigned for that particular visit, and then repeat
      the TMS/exercise task.
