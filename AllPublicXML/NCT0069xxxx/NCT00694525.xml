  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      21-hydroxylase deficiency (21-OHD) is an inherited disorder that results from a mutation on
      the CYP21A2 gene. It affects the adrenal glands and is the most common cause of congenital
      adrenal hyperplasia (CAH). 21-OHD CAH causes the body to produce an insufficient amount of
      cortisol and an excess of androgen, the type of hormone that produces male characteristics.
      The primary treatment for 21-OHD CAH, glucocorticoid replacement therapy, has been shown to
      cause bone loss. However, the elevated hormone levels caused by 21-OHD CAH may increase
      production of the protein osteoprotegerin (OPG), which in turn may protect against bone loss.
      This study will compare bone density and OPG levels in women who have 21-OHD CAH and have
      undergone a lifetime of glucocorticoid replacement therapy to that in women who have neither
      of these criteria. In doing so, the study will aim to determine the relationship between OPG
      and bone loss.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Because of the excess of androgen caused by 21-OHD CAH, women with CAH may exhibit some
      male-like characteristics. Glucocorticoids are a member of a class of drugs called
      corticosteroids, which are used in hormone replacement therapy. In order to counteract the
      effects of 21-OHD CAH, women with the disease are given hormone replacement therapy with
      glucocorticoids beginning at infancy. Glucocorticoids are known to cause bone loss. Despite
      many years of treatment with glucocorticoids, however, young women with 21-OHD CAH seem to be
      protected against bone loss. Researchers believe that the increased androgen levels in these
      women leads to increased estrogen levels, which in turn increases OPG production. The
      increase in OPG levels may protect women against bone loss. This study will evaluate bone
      density and OPG levels in women with and without 21-OHD CAH to determine the relationship
      between OPG and bone loss.

      Participants in this observational study will attend only one study visit. At this visit,
      they will undergo a blood draw; a scan of their lower spine, hip, and forearm; height and
      weight measurements; and a body fat analysis test. This last test will entail a weak and
      painless electrical signal being sent from foot to foot. Participants will not attend any
      follow-up visits for this study.
