  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to assess if gemcitabine in combination with carboplatin as 1st line
      chemotherapy in patients with metastatic or recurrent nasopharyngeal carcinoma has reasonable
      efficacy and a favourable toxicity profile that warrants further comparative study. A
      parallel group of randomly selected patients of equal number to the carboplatin and
      gemcitabine combination arm will be treated with the cisplatin and 5-FU combination
      chemotherapy (active control arm).

      The hypothesis is that this combination of chemotherapy is at least as active and less toxic
      than the reference regimen of cisplatin in combination with 5-fluorouracil (5-FU).

      52 patients with metastatic or recurrent nasopharyngeal carcinoma who meet
      inclusion/exclusion criteria will be enrolled into the trial. After initial screening,
      patients will attend clinic for baseline examination. Subjects will then be randomly
      allocated to carboplatin and gemcitabine or cisplatin and 5-FU combinations in a ratio of
      1:1. Study visits will occur depending on which arm the patient is on.

      An economic evaluation of the costs and benefits of gemcitabine-carboplatin will be
      implemented within this protocol.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Written informed consent obtained from patient or parents/guardian.

          2. Subject age greater than or equal to 18 years

          3. Histologically proven recurrent or metastatic undifferentiated or squamous
             nasopharyngeal carcinoma, not amenable to local therapy.

          4. Measurable disease in distant sites and/or loco-regional sites defined as at least one
             lesion that can be accurately measured in at least one dimension (longest diameter to
             be recorded as &gt;=10mm with CT scan or MRI. Tumour lesions that are situated in a
             previously irradiated field are measurable only if the tissue planes are preserved on
             CT or MRI).

          5. Prior concurrent chemotherapy and radiation therapy is permitted.

          6. Primary chemo-radiotherapy must be completed at least 6 months prior to study entry.

          7. Life expectancy over 3 months.

          8. ECOG performance status less than or equal to 2.

          9. Patients must have normal organ and marrow function as follows:

               -  White blood cell count : &gt;= 3.0 x 10^9/L

               -  Absolute neutrophil count : &gt;= 1.5 x 10^9/L

               -  Platelets : &gt;= 100 x 10^9/L

               -  Total bilirubin : within normal limits

               -  AST/ALT/ALP : &lt;= 2.5 x upper limit of normal

               -  Creatinine clearance or estimated GFR : &gt;=50 mls/min.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Patients with any of the following are not eligible for enrollment into the study:

          1. Pregnant women are excluded from this study because gemcitabine has potential for
             teratogenic or abortifacient effects. Because there is an unknown but potential risk
             for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother with
             gemcitabine, breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is treated with
             gemcitabine. These potential risks may also apply to other agents used in this study.

          2. Women of child-bearing potential and men without an adequate contraception prior to
             study entry and for the duration of study participation. Should a woman become
             pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while participating in this study, she should
             inform her treating physician immediately.

          3. Prior use of gemcitabine

          4. History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic
             composition to gemcitabine or carboplatin.

          5. Prior lines of chemotherapy for metastatic NPC

          6. Prior radiotherapy to the indicator lesion(s) to be measured in the study.

          7. Patients receiving any other investigational agents

          8. Patients with known brain metastases should be excluded from this clinical trial
             because of their poor prognosis and because they often develop progressive neurologic
             dysfunction that would confound the evaluation of neurologic and other adverse events.

          9. Patients with bone-only metastases.

         10. Clinically significant cardiac disease (e.g. congestive cardiac failure, symptomatic
             coronary artery disease and cardiac arrhythmias not well controlled with medication)
             or myocardial infarction within the last 12 months.

         11. Severe sensorineural hearing loss affecting normal daily activities or requiring the
             use of hearing aids.

         12. Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active
             infection or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with
             study requirements.

         13. Patients with immune deficiency. They are at increased risk of lethal infections when
             treated with marrow-suppressive therapy.

         14. HIV-positive patients receiving combination antiretroviral therapy. There is a
             possible pharmacokinetic interaction between antiretroviral and gemcitabine or other
             agents administered during the study. Appropriate studies will be undertaken in
             patients receiving combination antiretroviral therapy when indicated.
