  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to compare the performance of the tuberculin skin test, used for more than 50
      years as a diagnostic tool for latent tuberculosis infection, with 2 blood tests which have
      recently become commercially available (Interferon-gamma release assays) in a population of
      immunosuppressed individuals with chronic renal failure undergoing long term hemodialysis

    <textblock>
      This prospective study includes all adults aged over 18 years of age who accept to be
      included in the study and provided written informed consent. All patients are under long term
      hemodialysis for chronic renal failure. They are subjected to a questionnaire including
      history of contacts with tuberculosis (TB), prior treatment for TB, history of prior
      tuberculin skin testing, history of BCG vaccination, country of origin, trips or prolonged
      stays in high incidence areas, smoking history, and medications. All patients will have a
      chest X-ray, and simultaneous testing with the tuberculin skin test according to the Mantoux
      technique, and with the T-SPOT. TB and QuantiFERON Gold in tube Interferon-gamma release
      assays. The study analysis agreement between tests, detection of prior TB and presumptive
      latent tuberculosis infection, based on these items.
