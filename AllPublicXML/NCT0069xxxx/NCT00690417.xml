  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the research is to describe vitamin D levels and bone status in a rural
      Wisconsin population. It is probable that individuals of varying age and ethnicity require
      different amounts of D to achieve optimal status. These likely scenarios will be explored in
      various populations. We hypothesize that the increase in serum 25(OH)D resulting from daily
      D3 ingestion is less pronounced with advancing age and different in Native than Caucasian
      Americans. In addition, the women in the middle age group, between the ages of 55 and 65,
      will have ultrasound tests completed to assess the impact of the Vitamin D supplementation on
      cardiovascular health.

             allowed.

          -  Willing to utilize sunscreen of SPF-15 or higher when sun exposure for more than 15
             minutes is expected.

        Exclusion criteria:

          -  Current hypercalcemia (serum calcium &gt; 10.5 mg/dl) or untreated primary
             hyperparathyroidism.

             Paget's disease.

          -  History of any form of cancer within the past five years with the exception of
             adequately treated squamous cell or basal cell skin carcinoma.

          -  Renal failure; defined as a calculated creatinine clearance (using the Cockroft-Gault
             approach) of ≤ 25 ml/minute.

          -  Severe end-organ disease, e.g., cardiovascular, hepatic, hematologic, pulmonary, etc.,
             which might limit the ability to complete this study.

          -  Treatment with any drug known to interfere with vitamin D metabolism, e.g., phenytoin,
             phenobarbital.

          -  Known malabsorption syndromes, e.g., celiac disease, active inflammatory bowel
             disease, etc.

          -  Use of medications known to alter bone turnover including bisphosphonates, estrogen,
             selective estrogen receptor modulators, parathyroid hormone, testosterone or
             calcitonin.

          -  Treatment with high dose vitamin D (≥ 50,000 IU weekly) or any active metabolites of
             vitamin D, e.g., calcitriol, within six months of screening.
