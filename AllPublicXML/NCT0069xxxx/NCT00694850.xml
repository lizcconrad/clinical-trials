  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess multiple ascending doses of a new drug (BAY63-2521)
      given orally, to evaluate if it is safe and can help to improve the well-being, symptoms
      (e.g. disturbed breathing) and outcome of pulmonary hypertension associated with lung
      fibrosis. Patients living with pulmonary hypertension associated with interstitial lung
      disease have a risk of increased number of hospitalisations because of worsening of their
      condition. Until now there is no approved medication for this disease. The current treatment
      of pulmonary hypertension associated with interstitial lung disease consists: of oxygen and
      medical treatment with vasodilators, e.g. so-called Calcium-antagonists. Therefore, there is
      a need for new drugs in the treatment of pulmonary hypertension associated with interstitial
      lung disease.
