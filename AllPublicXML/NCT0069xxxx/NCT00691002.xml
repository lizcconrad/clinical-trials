    <textblock>
      There are few therapies suitable for the treatment of psoriasis on the face and skin folds.
      As these areas are sensitive, irritation and other adverse reactions are more common than
      elsewhere on the body. The purpose of the study is to compare the efficacy and safety of once
      daily treatment for up to 8 weeks of an ointment containing calcipotriol 25 mcg/g plus
      hydrocortisone 10 mg/g with calcipotriol 25 mcg/g in the ointment vehicle, hydrocortisone 10
      mg/g in the ointment vehicle and the ointment vehicle alone in patients with psoriasis
      vulgaris on the face and on the intertriginous areas (= double-blind phase). Furthermore, the
      safety and efficacy will be evaluated for up to 60 weeks treatment as required of
      calcipotriol 25 mcg/g plus hydrocortisone 10 mg/g ointment in psoriasis vulgaris on the face
      and intertriginous areas (= open-label phase).

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Clinical diagnosis of psoriasis vulgaris involving the face

          -  Clinical signs of psoriasis vulgaris on the trunk and/or the limbs, or earlier
             diagnosed with psoriasis vulgaris on the trunk and/or the limbs

          -  An extent of psoriatic involvement of the face of at least 10 cm2 (the sum of all
             facial lesions)

          -  Treatment areas (the face and the intertriginous areas) amenable to topical treatment
             with a maximum of 100 g of ointment per week

          -  Disease severity graded as mild, moderate, severe or very severe according to the

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Systemic treatments with all other therapies than biologicals, with a potential effect
             on psoriasis vulgaris (e.g., corticosteroids, vitamin D analogues, retinoids,
             immunosuppressants) within the 4-week period prior to randomisation

          -  Systemic use of biological treatments, whether marketed or not, directed against or
             with a potential effect on psoriasis vulgaris (e.g., alefacept, efalizumab,
             etanercept, infliximab, adalimumab) within 3 months prior to randomisation

          -  PUVA therapy or Grenz ray therapy within the 4-week period prior to randomisation

          -  Topical treatment with very potent WHO group IV corticosteroids within the 2-week

             vulgaris (e.g., beta blockers, anti-malaria drugs, lithium and ACE inhibitors) during

          -  Current diagnosis of erythrodermic, exfoliative, guttate or pustular psoriasis

             parasitic infections, skin manifestations in relation to syphilis or tuberculosis,
             rosacea, perioral dermatitis, acne vulgaris, atrophic skin, striae atrophicae,

             cutaneous mycosis) that may confound the evaluation of psorisis vulgaris on the face
             or on the intertriginous areas

          -  Planned exposure to sun, UVA or UVB that may affect the psoriasis vulgaris during the

          -  Known or suspected disorders of calcium metabolism associated with hypercalcaemia
