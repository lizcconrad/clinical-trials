  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The incidence of pelvic organ prolapse (POP) in parous women is estimated over 50%. A variety
      of urinary, bowel and sexual symptoms may be associated with POP. Moreover, a proportion of
      women who underwent a surgical correction of POP may occur post-surgical urinary incontinence
      and, thus, if this last presents as genuine stress-type or mixed-type, a second surgical
      intervention may be required. At this proposal, with the aim to reduce the incidence of
      postoperative urinary incontinence, the addition of a preventive continence procedure to a
      POP repair intervention has been widely proposed, but the potential benefits needs to be
      balanced against potential disadvantages.

      Based on these considerations, the aim of this trial will be to compare two different
      surgical strategies for women with POP without urinary stress incontinence. Specifically, the
      efficacy to associate and to follow a preventive continence procedure to the correction of
      POP will be compared.

      Women with POP not associated to urinary stress incontinence will be enrolled and randomized
      in two arms(groups A and B). Patients of group A will be treated with unique surgery
      (correction of POP plus preventive continence procedure), whereas in patients of group B POP
      will be surgically corrected and, in case of stress or mixed postoperative incontinence, a
      further intervention for urinary stress incontinence will be tailored.

      All patients eligible will undergo baseline assessment consisting of anthropometric,
      clinical, hormonal, ultrasonographic and urodynamic evaluations. During the study, the
      clinical outcomes, and the adverse experience will be evaluated in each patient.

      Data will be analyzed using the intention-to-treat principle and a P value of 0.05 or less
      will be considered significant.
