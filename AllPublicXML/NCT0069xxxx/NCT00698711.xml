  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research is to help us study a vaccine treatment for patients with
      prostate cancer. A vaccine is a medicine that teaches the body to destroy harmful infections
      and other foreign substances. The immune system is made up of many different types of cells,
      which fight infection and disease in your body. A vaccine may stimulate the immune system to
      destroy the cancer cells. It may also help to slow the growth of the cancer. The vaccine is a
      solution given as an injection given into or under the skin. It is made up of several parts.
      The first part is MUC-2, a protein present in many cancers, especially prostate cancer. MUC-2
      is attached to a material called KLH or keyhole limpet hemocyanin. KLH is purified from a
      snail- like marine mollusk called a keyhole limpet and has been used for many years to boost
      immune responses in animals and in people. Attaching MUC-2 to KLH helps the immune system
      react to MUC-2. The mixture of MUC-2 attached to KLH is in turn mixed with a material called
      QS21, from the bark of a tree, which also helps the immune system to make more cancer-
      fighting cells. A vaccine like the one you will receive has been given to laboratory animals
      and been shown to produce an immune response in these animals.

    <description>Three groups of 5 patients enrolled sequentially comprised from will receive MUC-2-KLH vaccines at the following g amounts of MUC-2-KLH per vaccination.

    <description>The MUC-2-KLH conjugate will be administered subcutaneously to random sites on the upper arm and upper leg at weekly intervals for 3 weeks. This will be followed by a 4 week break and then a fourth vaccination during week 7, and 3 months later during week 19. Booster vaccinations may be given at or after week 50 and 100, and every 6 months thereafter to select patients who show no evidence of radiographic disease progression.
After 5 patients have been enrolled and completed two vaccinations without Grade II or greater toxicity, we will proceed to the next higher dose level. No dose escalations will be performed in the same patient.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with prostate cancer that is histologically confirmed by the Department of
             Pathology at MSKCC will be considered if they show progression of disease based on
             biochemical parameters. Patients with radiographic evidence of disease are not
             eligible.

          -  Hormonal status will be recorded on the basis of serum testosterone levels.

          -  Patients who have progressed after primary therapy to include surgery or radiation
             (with or without neo-adjuvant androgen ablation), or intermittent hormonal treatment
             who have non-castrate levels of testosterone (&gt;50 ng/ml). Patients with soft tissue
             and/or bone disease or patients who are androgen- independent with no evidence of
             radiographic disease are not eligible. Those patients who are symptomatic or who are
             anticipated to develop symptoms within 6 months of entry will be excluded.
