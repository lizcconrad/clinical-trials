  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study was to determine the safety, tolerability, dose-limiting
      toxicity (DLT) and maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of CHR-2797 when administered orally, once
      daily, to patients with advanced solid tumours.

      The secondary objectives of this study were:

        -  To determine pharmacokinetic parameters for CHR-2797 when administered orally at
           increasing dose levels;

        -  To investigate the pharmacodynamic effects of CHR-2797 in blood mononuclear cells and,
           when possible, tumour cells; - To enable a preliminary assessment of anti-tumour
           activity of CHR-2797.

    <description>Drug was given orally, once daily, ensuring a dosing interval of approximately 24 hours. Dose escalations took place starting at 10mg and escalating (per protocol) as follows: 20, 40, 90, 130, 180, 240 and 320 mg</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Signed, informed consent

          -  Histological or cytologically confirmed malignant solid tumour refractory to standard
             therapy or for which no standard therapy exists

          -  Evaluable disease

          -  Recovered from the acute adverse effects of prior therapies (excluding alopecia and
             grade 1 neuropathy)

          -  Adequate bone marrow, hepatic and renal function including the following:

               1. Hb ≥ 9.0 g/dl, absolute neutrophil count ≥ 1.5 x 109/L, platelets ≥ 100x109/L

               2. Total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 x upper normal limit

               3. AST and ALT ≤ 2.5 x upper normal limit (or ≤ 5 x UNL in the presence of liver
                  metastases)

               4. Creatinine ≤1.5 x upper normal limit

          -  Age &lt; 18 years

          -  Performance status (PS) &lt; 2 (ECOG scale)

          -  Estimated life expectancy greater than 3 months

          -  Female patients with reproductive potential had to have a negative serum pregnancy
             test within 7 days of treatment. Both women and men had to agree to use a medically
             acceptable method of contraception throughout the treatment period and for 3 months
             after discontinuation of treatment. Acceptable methods of contraception included IUD,
             oral contraceptive, sub-dermal implant and double barrier (condom with a contraceptive
             sponge or contraceptive pessary)

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Anti-cancer therapy including chemotherapy, radiotherapy, endocrine therapy,
             immunotherapy or use of other investigational agents within the 4 weeks prior to study
             entry (or a longer period depending on the defined characteristics of the agents used
             e.g. 6 weeks for mitomycin or nitrosourea). In patients with progressive disease (PD),
             continuation of LHRH agonists for prostate cancer, bisphosphonates for bone disease
             and corticosteroids was permitted provided the dose was stable before and during the
             study

          -  Co-existing active infection or serious concurrent illness

          -  Significant cardiovascular disease as defined by

               1. History of congestive heart failure requiring therapy

               2. History of unstable angina pectoris or myocardial infarction up to 6 months prior
                  to study entry

               3. Presence of severe valvular heart disease

               4. Presence of a ventricular arrhythmia requiring treatment

          -  Any co-existing medical condition that in the Investigator's judgement substantially
             increased the risk associated with the patient's participation in the study

          -  Psychiatric disorders or altered mental status precluding understanding of the
             informed consent process and/or completion of the necessary studies

          -  Gastrointestinal disorders that might have interfered with absorption of the study
             drug

          -  Persistent grade 2 or greater toxicities from any cause

          -  Patients with known brain tumours or metastases should have been excluded from this
             clinical study because of their poor prognosis and because they often develop
             progressive neurologic dysfunction that would have confounded the evaluation of
             neurologic and other AEs

          -  Pregnant or breast-feeding women
