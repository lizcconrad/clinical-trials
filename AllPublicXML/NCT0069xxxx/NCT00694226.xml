    <textblock>
      The objective of the study was to assess the efficacy in decreasing the likelihood of
      substance use of a brief motivational enhancement intervention in adolescents referred to
      psychiatric treatment.

      237 adolescents consecutively admitted to a psychiatry department completed an evaluation of
      their substance use. Subjects identified as users were randomly allocated to one of two
      groups: an experimental group that received a brief intervention aimed at increasing their
      awareness of the risks of substance use, or a control group. All subjects received standard
      treatment according to the primary diagnosis. Structured questionnaires assessing knowledge,
      attitudes, perception of risks and intention of use of psychoactive substances were
      administered upon admission and 1 month later.

    <description>Brief intervention, consisting in an intervention with the adolescent and a session with parents or mentors. The session with the adolescent lasted 60 minutes. Materials related to the interview were developed according to previous reports on the subject. After building a good rapport the interviewer involved the patient in an initial discussion about the results of the evaluation. This led to a review of the drugs used by the subject and an elicitation of positives and negatives of drug use. The relationship between drug use and current and long-term goals was explored. Discrepancies and problems in the future related to substance use were examined, and information and counseling was offered. The basic components of the motivational interview approach were contemplated, and several skills were used by the interviewers. The individual session with parents or mentors consisted in the presentation of educational materials and a brief counseling intervention on parenting skills.</description>
