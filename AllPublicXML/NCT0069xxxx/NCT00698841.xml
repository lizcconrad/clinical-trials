    <measure>Number of Participants With Clinically Meaningful Prolongation of the QT Interval Corrected for Heart Rate (QTc) From Time-matched Baseline</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Day 1, and then weekly to end of Cycle 1 (28 days)</time_frame>
    <description>12-Lead continuous digital electrocardiogram (ECG) data were collected at preselected time points at baseline visit and on Days 1, 8, 15, 22, and 29. The QT interval is the time between the start of the Q wave and the end of the T wave in the cardiac electrical cycle. The corrected QTc is the QT interval corrected for heart rate. Prolongation of the QTc was identified as clinically meaningful at the investigator's discretion.</description>

    <measure>Mean Change in QTc From Time-matched Baseline Assessed Using Fridericia's Correction Formula (QTcF) by Study Day and Time Point</measure>
    <time_frame>Predose Day 1 (Baseline) to end of Cycle 1 (28 days)</time_frame>
    <description>The QT interval is the time between the start of the Q wave and the end of the T wave in the cardiac electrical cycle. The QTc is the QT interval corrected for heart rate. The QTcF=QT/RR^1/3, where RR=RR interval in seconds. Baseline=predose. Mean change in QTc interval from baseline to time t=QTc interval at time t minus QTc interval at baseline.</description>

    <measure>Number of Participants With Clinically Significant Changes in PR Interval, QRS Interval, and Heart Rate</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Day 1, and then weekly to end of Cycle 1 (28 days)</time_frame>
    <description>12-Lead continuous digital ECG data were collected at preselected time points at baseline visit and on Days 1, 8, 15, 22, and 29. The PR interval is the time from the onset of the P wave to the beginning of the QRS complex. The QRS interval=deflections in the ECG, comprising Q, R, and S waves, that represent depolarization of the ventricles. Clinically significant was determined at the investigator's discretion.</description>
