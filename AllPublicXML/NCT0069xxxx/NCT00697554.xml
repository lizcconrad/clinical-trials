      The purpose of this study is to enroll pre-liver transplant patients who will be vaccinated
      with either the novel adjuvanted HBV vaccine or double doses of Engerix™-B. The
      immunogenicity and safety of the novel adjuvanted vaccine will be compared to Engerix™-B as
      the control vaccine
