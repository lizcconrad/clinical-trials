  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Radiation therapy technology that allows increased radiation dose to the tumor while sparing
      healthy tissue will improve the balance between complications and cure.

      The primary objective is to establish the maximum tolerated fractional dose (MTfD) of
      radiotherapy to a total dose of 78Gy using gated IMRT, delivered in single daily fractions
      that can be administered concurrently with Taxol® and carboplatin chemotherapy. Secondary
      objectives include: to evaluate the toxicity of concurrent Taxol® and carboplatin with gated
      IMRT; identify partial organ tolerance doses for lung and esophagus when treating with
      involved field thoracic 3D; estimate complete response rate as defined by PET performed 3
      months after completion of all therapy.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with histologically-proven, by biopsy or cytology, unresectable lung cancer
             of the following histologic types: squamous cell carcinoma, adenocarcinoma, large cell
             carcinoma, non-small cell carcinoma, not otherwise specified.

          -  Patient with AJCC Stage IIIA-IIIB, if all detectable tumor can be encompassed by
             radiation therapy fields, including both the primary tumor and the involved regional
             lymph nodes.

          -  18-fluoro-2-deoxyglucose positron emission tomography required for staging and image
             fusion for treatment planning.

          -  Patients must have measurable disease on the planning CT.

          -  Patient must have a completed the IMRT plan and the attending physician must have
             reviewed and approved the dose volume histograms as follows (based on treatment
             planning to the Phase 4 dose level): total lung V20 &lt; 30%, mean esophageal dose &lt; 34
             Gy, the esophageal V55 &lt; 30%, the heart V40 &lt; 50%.

          -  No prior or concurrent malignancy except non-melanomatous skin cancer unless
             disease-free for one year or more; no prior lung cancer within last two years.

          -  No prior RT to thorax.

          -  No previous chemotherapy or previous biologic response modifiers for current lung
             cancer or within the past five (5) years.
