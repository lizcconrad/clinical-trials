      This study will evaluate the efficacy of lapatinib in eradicating chemo- resistant tumour
      cells circulating in the blood of patients with breast cancer.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Breast cancer is considered a systemic disease since early tumour cell dissemination may
      occur even in patients with small tumours; several investigators using immunocytochemistry or
      real time PCR (RT-PCR) have shown that cytokeratin-positive epithelial cells could be
      identified in the bone marrow aspirates or the peripheral blood of otherwise metastases-free
      patients with stage I and II breast cancer. The clinical importance of the immunocytochemical
      detection of occult tumour cells in the bone marrow has been confirmed in many prospective
      studies to represent an independent predictive and prognostic factor for distant relapse and
      reduced survival.

      Patients with metastatic breast cancer who have persistent detection of tumour cells in the
      peripheral blood (≥5 cells/7.5 ml) despite at least one line of chemotherapy will receive
      lapatinib for a minimum of one month unless disease progression occurs at an earlier time
      point.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Provision of written informed consent

          -  Histologically or cytologically confirmed breast cancer

          -  Metastatic breast cancer (stage IIIB and IV). EGFR and/or HER-2 expression on the
             primary tumor is not mandatory.

          -  Patients should have received at least one course of standard systemic chemotherapy
             for their metastatic disease. Prior hormonal therapy is allowed.

          -  Patients should have achieved objective response (CR or PR) or stable disease to
             previous first or second line treatment.

          -  There should be at least one month between the end of chemotherapy treatment and trial
             entry. In case of prior Herceptin administration, 3 months are required to have
             elapsed before study entry.

          -  Detection of ≥5 cells/7.5ml of peripheral blood detected by Cell Search System despite
             the previous administration of chemotherapy and/or hormonal therapy.

          -  HER-2 expression on CTCs.

          -  Age 18 years and over

          -  Adequate Haematological function, Absolute neutrophil count ≥1.5 x 109/L, Platelet
             count ≥100 x 109/L and Haemoglobin ≥9 g/dL (may be transfused to maintain or exceed
             this level)

          -  Adequate Liver Function, total bilirubin &lt;1.5 x upper limit of normal, AST and ALT
             &lt;2.5 x upper limit of normal in patients without liver metastases and &lt;5 x upper limit
             of normal in patients with liver metastases

          -  Adequate Renal function, Serum creatinine ≤1.25 x upper limit of normal or calculated
             creatinine clearance ≥50 mL/min

          -  LVEF within institutional normal range

          -  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 to 2

          -  Life expectancy of at least 12 weeks

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Any concurrent systemic treatment for breast cancer (including chemotherapy,
             radiotherapy, hormonotherapy, monoclonal antibodies)

          -  Other co-existing malignancies or malignancies diagnosed within the last 5 years with
             the exception of basal cell carcinoma or cervical cancer in situ

             trial within 28 days prior to enrolment

          -  Known hypersensitivity to drugs chemically related to lapatinib

          -  Concomitant requirement for medication classified as CYP3A4 inducers or inhibitors

          -  Evidence of any other disease, neurological or metabolic dysfunction, physical
             examination finding or laboratory finding giving reasonable suspicion of a disease or
             condition that contraindicates the use of an investigational drug or puts the patient
             at high risk for treatment-related complications
