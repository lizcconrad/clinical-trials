  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Many patients with heart failure are unable to increase their heart rate appropriately when
      their body needs increased blood flow. As a result, they may be unable to mobilize excess
      fluid that their body retains. We hypothesize that we can provide assistance to their body in
      mobilizing this fluid by artificially increasing their heart rate using a pacemaker. We plan
      to conduct a prospective clinical trial to evaluate this hypothesis.

      We will use a cross over design to study patients who already have biventricular pacemakers
      implanted or a narrow QRS and volume overload. We will screen them using a blood test that is
      a rough estimate of volume overload. Patients who meet the inclusion criteria will be
      randomly assigned to have their pacemakers adjusted or to have no intervention during the
      first of 2 visits. They will be unaware of which group they are in. Following adjustment,
      they will be monitored for six hours.

      Prior to the pacemaker adjustment, several tests will be performed to evaluate heart function
      and the levels of hormones related that are affected by heart failure. These tests will be
      repeated at the end of the six hour intervention period in each visit. At the end of the
      visit patients who had their pacemakers adjusted will have it reset to their original
      settings.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Many patients with heart failure suffer from chronotropic incompetence, an inability to raise
      their heart rate in response to metabolic demand. Previous studies have shown that brief
      increases in pacing rates in patients with biventricular pacemakers can improve cardiac
      contractility. We hypothesize that the benefits of an increased biventricular pacing rate
      could be sustained and would improve cardiovascular and neurohormonal parameters in patients
      suffering from volume overload. We intend to prospectively evaluate this hypothesis in a
      single blind randomized cross-over design trial.

      We will screen 40 patients who have previously implanted biventricular pacemakers (or a
      narrow QRS) and an elevated B-type Natriuretic Peptide (BNP) level. Following enrollment,
      patients will be randomly assigned to have their atrial pacing rate increased to 85 beats per
      minute or to be unchanged during the first of 2 visits. Patients will be unaware of their
      treatment assignment. They will be observed for six hours in a monitored setting. The primary
      outcome will be cardiac output, as measured noninvasively by NICOM (Cheetah Medical Inc.,
      Israel) system before and after the observation period. Secondary outcomes will include
      changes in neurohormonal measures and thoracic impedance. If this proof-of-concept study
      demonstrates a positive effect, future research would evaluate the ability of increased
      pacing rates to prevent or abort decompensation of Congestive Heart Failure (CHF).

    <description>Ambulatory out-patients will be identified at Columbia-Presbyterian and New York University Medical Centers.
On the first encounter, patients will come to clinic in the morning for baseline measurements. Subsequently, the atrial pacing rate will be increased to 85bpm for 6 hours. Patients will eat a standard breakfast provided by the hospital prior to the treatment session, and then will fast for the six-hour observation period. Patients will remain in supine position and will be clinically monitored for 6 hours. All patients will be on continuous cardiac monitors. Vital signs and symptoms of congestion/ischemia will be recorded every hour.
On the second encounter, patients will come to clinic in the morning for baseline measurements.Subsequently, they will be given the illusion that their pacer has been adjusted, but the settings will remain unchanged. The rest of the protocol will be as described for the first encounter.</description>

On the first encounter, patients will come to clinic in the morning for baseline measurements. Subsequently, the atrial pacing rate will be increased to 85bpm for 6 hours. Patients will eat a standard breakfast provided by the hospital prior to the treatment session, and then will fast for the six-hour observation period. Patients will remain in supine position and will be clinically monitored for 6 hours. All patients will be on continuous cardiac monitors. Vital signs and symptoms of congestion/ischemia will be recorded every hour.
On the second encounter, patients will come to clinic in the morning for baseline measurements.Subsequently, they will be given the illusion that their pacer has been adjusted, but the settings will remain unchanged. The rest of the protocol will be as described for the first encounter.</description>
