    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subject is 18 years of age or older.

          -  Subject has a diagnosis of cutaneous sarcoidosis for greater than 6 months with a
             physician global assessment score of at least 4. Diagnosis (based on the
             recommendations of an expert panel 24) can be made by either:

          -  Skin lesions characteristic of sarcoidosis and a biopsy showing granulomas with no
             evidence of mycobacteria, fungus, or malignancy.

          -  A biopsy that does not show granulomas, but the patient has characteristic skin
             lesions and another clinical feature suggesting sarcoidosis (bilateral hilar
             adenopathy, erythema nodosum, uveitis, raised ACE level, BAL lymphocytosis
             (CD4:CD8&gt;3.5), panda/lambda sign on gallium scan)

          -  If female of childbearing potential, subject will have a negative urine pregnancy test
             at Screening and Week 0.

          -  If female, subject will be either post-menopausal for &gt; 1 year, surgically sterile
             (hysterectomy or bilateral tubal ligation), or practicing one form of birth control
             (abstinence, oral contraceptive, estrogen patch, implant contraception, injectable
             contraception, IUD, diaphragm, condom, sponge, spermicides, or vasectomy of partner).
             Female subjects will continue to use contraception for 6 months following the last
             infusion.

          -  Screening laboratory results are within the study parameters.

          -  Subject has been on a stable dose of antibiotics, thalidomide, antimalarials, oral
             corticosteroids or other immunosuppressives, such cyclosporine, tacrolimus,
             azathioprine, methotrexate, or mycophenolate mofetil over the previous 4 weeks.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subject has evidence of a clinically significant, unstable or poorly controlled
             medical condition including unstable systemic sarcoidosis.

          -  Subject has a chest X-ray consistent with an active infection or previous exposure to
             TB and/or a positive purified protein derivative test at screening (&gt;5 mm).

          -  Subject has a serious, active or recurrent bacterial, viral, or fungal infection. This
             includes hepatitis B and C, and HIV.

          -  Subject has been hospitalized for infection or received IV antibiotics within the
             previous 2 months prior to baseline.

          -  Subject has a history of tuberculosis at anytime or close contact with a person with
             active tuberculosis within the previous 6 months.

          -  Subject has received a live vaccination within the previous 3 months.

          -  Subject has a history of a central nervous system disorder/demyelinating disease or
             symptoms suggestive of multiple sclerosis or optic neuritis.

          -  Subject has current signs or symptoms or history of systemic lupus erythematosus.

          -  Subject has been diagnosed with a malignancy within the past 5 years except for
             successfully treated non-melanoma skin cancer.

          -  Subject has signs or symptoms suggestive of a possible lymphoproliferative disease.

          -  Subject has a diagnosis of severe congestive heart failure (Class III or IV NYHA).

          -  Subject has had a substance abuse problem within the previous 3 years.

          -  Subject has any dermatologic disease in the target site that may be exacerbated by
             treatment or interfere with examination.

          -  Subject has been treated with an anti-TNF biologic immune response modifier, such as
             infliximab, adalimumab, or etanercept within the past 8 weeks.

          -  Subject has been treated with topical corticosteroids, tacrolimus, or pimecrolimus
             within 2 weeks or intralesional corticosteroids within 4 weeks of baseline.

          -  Subject has been administered an investigational drug in another clinical study within
             30 days prior to baseline (or 5 half-lives, whichever is longer).

          -  Subject has a known allergy to adalimumab.

          -  Subject is female and is pregnant, is considering becoming pregnant during the study
             and for 6 months afterwards, or is nursing.
