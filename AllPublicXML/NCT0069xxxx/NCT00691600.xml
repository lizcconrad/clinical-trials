    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare successful rates of cure of abscesses less than 5 cm
      with antibiotic versus non-antibiotic treatment after incision and drainage. We will also
      compare successful rates of cure and time to healing with IV antibiotics and 23-hour
      observation unit stay versus hospitalization with IV antibiotics for abscesses greater than 5
      cm but less than 10 cm in pediatric patients.
