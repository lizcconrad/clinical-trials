  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall objective of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of fish oil
      omega-3-fatty acid supplementation in treating pediatric HAART-associated
      hypertriglyceridemia.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There are no guidelines as to the clinical threshold at which treatment for
      hypertriglyceridemia is necessary in pediatric populations, and extreme hypertriglyceridemia
      is relatively infrequent in HIV-infected children. Adult studies have suggested that there is
      a proportionate reduction in triglycerides of approximately 15-25% when taking fish oil
      omega-3 fatty acid supplementation, irrespective of the degree of initial triglyceride
      elevation. This trial would thus represent a proof-of-concept study in children with mild to
      moderate hypertriglyceridemia.

      The results of this study would contribute to the pool of knowledge regarding the efficacy
      and safety of this nutriceutical in the treatment of HAART-associated hypertriglyceridemia in
      children. Compared with other interventions (such as dietary changes and drug therapies),
      nutritional supplementation with fish oil is an inexpensive, simple, and likely preferable
      treatment for a potentially significant medical condition. In addition, the results of this
      study could presumably be extrapolated to benefit children with hypertriglyceridemia
      secondary to other types of drugs or illnesses.

    <description>Subjects in this arm will begin the study on active capsules (containing Omega Pure). Subjects in the 5-11 age group will take 2 capsules containing 500mg EPA/DHA twice daily for 12 weeks. Subjects in the 12-18 age group will take 2 capsules containing 1.0g EPA/DHA twice daily, also for a period of 12 weeks. Both age groups will then be switched to the placebo capsules containing citrus-flavoured soybean and corn oil, identical in appearance to the active agent, to be taken on an identical regimen to the active pills, for a period of 12 weeks.</description>
