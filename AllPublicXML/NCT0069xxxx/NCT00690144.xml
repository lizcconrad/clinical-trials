  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether the use of high-fidelity simulation in
      health care education is an effective training and evaluation model.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      High-fidelity simulation has many advantages in medical education. Simulation-based critical
      care training is especially valuable due to error-prone work settings and the high cost of
      patient adverse events. This study was conducted to assess the effectiveness of implementing
      the high-fidelity simulation in critical care training, and the feasibility of high-fidelity
      simulation as an evaluation tool.
