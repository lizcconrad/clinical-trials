  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of chlorhexidine-impregnated
      disk in preventing catheter exit-site infection in peritoneal dialysis patients
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary aim of the study is to examine the exit-site infection rate in patients using
      chlorhexidine-impregnated dressing.

      The participant will be followed up at 2, 6, 12, 24, 36 and 52 weeks of study and during each
      visit the catheter exit-site will be examined by one of the investigators for any sign of
      infection or allergic reaction, and questionnaires about satisfaction with use of study
      material (biopatch) will be asked by a study team member at the 12 week visit of the study.
      Each participant will be followed up for one year.
