  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Fast and accurate platelet inhibition is an important therapeutic goal in the acute treatment
      of patients with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). Platelet inhibitory
      effects induced by normal oral P2Y12 receptor antagonists, for example ticagrelor, are
      delayed in STEMI patients undergoing primary percutaneous coronary intervention (primary
      PCI), which may be attributed to impaired absorption affecting drug pharmacokinetics (PK) and
      pharmacodynamics (PD). Another therapeutic goal in the acute treatment of STEMI is reduction
      of sympathetic stress and catecholamine release, thereby improving the balance between the
      demand for and supply of oxygen, by analgesia like fentanyl of morphine. To date, there are
      no studies that have specifically assessed the pharmacodynamics influences of fentanyl on
      platelet inhibition in STEMI patients who are pre-treated with crushed ticagrelor tablets.
      Therefore, In the ON-TIME-3 study, the investigators seek to show the influence of fentanyl
      on platelet inhibition in STEMI patients who are pre-treated with crushed ticagrelor in the
      ambulance.
