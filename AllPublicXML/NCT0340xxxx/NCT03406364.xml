  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The proposed initial trial is a Phase I/IIa, open label study to evaluate the safety and
      explore efficacy of MG005 in combination with sorafenib in patients with solid tumor. The
      eligible patients will receive 200 mg of sorafenib with 3 pre-defined dose levels of GW5074,
      escalated from 750 mg to 1500 mg (daily dose), to determine the Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD)
      and dose limiting toxicities (DLT) (if any) at Phase I stage. For the preliminary
      proof-of-concept stage (Phase IIa), a small number of patients will be recruited, and given a
      chosen dosing regimen of MG005 co-administered with sorafenib (a fixed-dose combination
      within the safe dosing range defined at Phase I) to assess its anti-tumor activity.

    <description>Phase I:
Eligible patients will receive different dosages of GW5074 in 1 of the 3 dose cohorts plus 200 mg of sorafenib. Dose cohorts will be escalated sequentially from Cohort 1 at 750 mg QD GW5074 plus 200 mg QD sorafenib to Cohort 2 at 1500 mg QD GW5074 plus 200 mg QD sorafenib, and Cohort 3 at 750 mg BID GW5074 plus 200 mg QD sorafenib. Owing to the fact that there is no previous human experience for GW5074, Cohort 1 will include a monotherapy stage with 750 mg QD GW5074 prior to administration of the GW5074 and sorafenib combination to initially assess the safety of GW5074 monotherapy.
Phase IIa:
Following the MTD level determined at Phase I, the efficacy and safety profiles will be investigated in approximate 15 patients to achieve at least 12 evaluable patients. The enrolled patients at Phase IIa will be instructed to follow the chosen dosage regimen of MG005 for ≥168 days. Concurrent administration with 200 mg of sorafenib once daily will be implemented for each patient.</description>
