  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to validate a pre-defined single-patient classifier algorithm
      for predicting prognosis and benefit from adjuvant chemotherapy for patients who underwent D2
      gastrectomy for stage II and III gastric cancer. This algorithm classifies gastric cancer
      into five groups according to its molecular characteristics based on RNA expression levels.
      The prognosis and response from adjuvant chemotherapy will be different according to
      prognostic and predictive clusters respectively based on these groups, thus this algorithm
      can identify as patients which will have benefit from adjuvant chemotherapy or which will
      not. Consequently, this algorithm can be translated into clinical practice to help doctors
      who decide the necessity of adjuvant chemotherapy after D2 gastrectomy for patients who had
      diagnosed stage II and III gastric cancer.

      The cohort for this validation study is from patients who were enrolled the CLASSIC
      (Capecitabine and oxaliplatin Adjuvant Study in Stomach Cancer) trial, a randomized,
      open-label, multicenter, parallel-group, phase 3 study which compared the effect of adjuvant
      capecitabine plus oxaliplatin (XELOX) after D2 gastrectomy with surgery alone strategy. This
      trial was conducted between June, 2006 and June, 2009. The patient were from both surgery
      alone arm and surgery plus adjuvant XELOX arm, and have tumor blocks available for RNA
      extraction.

    <description>Patients with stage II-III GC who underwent D2 resection were randomized (1:1) after surgery to receive adjuvant capecitabine and oxaliplatin (eight three-week cycles of oral capecitabine 1000 mg/m² twice daily on days 1-14 plus intravenous oxaliplatin 130 mg/m² on day 1) for 6 months or observation alone. Assessment whether patients were disease free were done by abdominal CT or MRI and chest radiograph at regular intervals as planned by protocol.</description>
