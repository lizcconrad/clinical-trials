  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to evaluate the rate of SYNERGY 48 mm stent strut coverage and
      assess neointimal progression via OCT measurement in patients who underwent PCI.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with stable, unstable angina and non-ST-elevation ACS will be included in this
      study. Patient will undergo coronary angiography for coronary anatomy assessment and
      estimation indications for PCI . After screening an OCT-guided PCI with extra long SYNERGY
      stent implantation will be provided in all patients. Patient will be divided into 2 groups of
      follow-up and will be followed within 3 and 6 month after procedure. Final clinical follow-up
      will be assessed at 12 month for all patients. At each follow-up visits the data regarding
      clinical events, coronary angiography and OCT-imaging will be collected.

    <description>The neointimal healing score is based on four stent-related characteristics and is calculated on a lesion level:
Presence of filling defect (% intraluminal defect, ILD) is assigned a weight of &quot;4&quot;.
Presence of both malapposed and uncovered struts (% malapposed/ uncovered, MU) is assigned a weight of &quot;3&quot;
Presence of uncovered struts alone (% malapposed, M) is assigned a weight of &quot;2&quot;
Presence of malapposed struts alone (% uncovered, U) is assigned a weight of &quot;1&quot;</description>
