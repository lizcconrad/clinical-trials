    <textblock>
      This study proposes to carefully examine the hypothesis that human inducible pluripotent stem
      cells (iPSCs) can be effectively employed as a future therapeutic option for individuals with
      diabetic retinopathy and macular ischemia. iPSCs will be generated from the peripheral blood
      cells of subjects with diabetes and age matched controls. The human iPSC cells will be used
      to generate mesoderm cells for injection into the vitreous cavity of diabetic rodents and
      primate eyes. The ability of mesoderm cells to generate endothelial cells and pericytes in
      areas of degenerated capillaries will be examined. The human iPSCs will also be used to
      generate hematopoietic CD34+CD45+ cells. The combination of CD34+CD45+ cells derived from
      iPSCs and iPSC derived mesoderm will be examined in combination for their potentially
      beneficial effect to enhance the vessel formation.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Vascular complications due to diabetes mellitus (DM) are the result of sustained vascular
      injury with insufficient vascular repair. In chronic diabetes, vascular reparative mechanism
      can be lost resulting in development of microvascular complications (MVC), such as diabetic
      retinopathy (DR). We assessed the reparative function of progenitor cells that circulate in
      the peripheral blood of diabetic individuals and found that the vascular wall-derived
      progenitor cells, endothelial colony forming cells (ECFCs), were depleted in diabetics with
      MVC. Bone marrow-derived progenitor cells, CD45+CD34+ were dysfunctional in diabetics with
      MVC. We found that human inducible pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs)-derived ECFCs displayed
      the ability to form functional and durable blood vessels in vivo and conferred therapeutic
      revascularization by connecting with and remaining integrated with host rodent vessels long
      term. We characterized a mesoderm subset (SSEA5-KNA+ cells) generated from hiPSCs that gives
      rise to ECFCs. Finally, we used hiPSCs to generate CD34+CD45+ cells and tested the impact of
      co-administration of these cells with ECFCs within the vitreous. The addition of CD34+CD45+
      cells with ECFCs resulted in the enhanced survival, function and reparative ability of the
      ECFCs. This beneficial effect was mediated by reducing retinal oxidative stress and
      inflammation.

      These novel and paradigm shifting findings led us to hypothesize: the hiPSC-derived-mesoderm
      subset (SSEA5-KNA+) can be utilized for long term revascularization of vasodegenerative
      capillaries and their reparative action can be further enhanced by coinjection of CD34+CD45+
      cells that provide anti-oxidant and anti-inflammatory effects.

        Patients who have history of malignant disease or hematologic disorder. We will record
        medications that the patient is taking at the time of biopsy. Baseline characteristics will
        also be recorded, including age, lipid parameters, body mass index, blood pressure, smoking
