  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to implement and test the efficacy of photovoice, Short Messaging Service
      (SMS) and phone call reminders in improving childhood immunization coverage (uptake,
      timeliness and completion rates) and reducing incidence of vaccine-preventable diseases
      (VPDs) among infants in Nigeria
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This will be a single-blind three-arm cluster randomized controlled trial involving
      post-partum mothers and/or caregivers of infants (age 0-12months) attending immunization
      clinics in 12 randomly selected Primary Health Care Centres (clusters) across Sokoto, Jigawa,
      Kano, Ogun, Oyo and Lagos States of Nigeria. Additionally, a photovoice methodology will be
      implemented in 6 community clusters (one in each State) involving group discussions between
      community members (pregnant women in their third trimester, parents/caregivers of infants age
      0-12 months), community leaders, service providers and policy makers on benefits of timely
      immunization and consequences of non-vaccination. Parent-infant pairs will be followed up for
      12 months during which SMS and phone call immunization clinic appointment reminders will be
      provided to mothers and/or caregivers in intervention arm 1, and photovoice intervention
      provided at study commencement to participants in intervention arm 2. Respondents in the
      control group would receive standard care (routine paper-based appointment scheduling alone).
      The investigators will document and compare immunization uptake (all doses and vaccines),
      timeliness of receipt and completion rates of scheduled immunization between the three
      groups, as well as incidence of VPDs between the groups using multivariate statistical
      analyses.

    <description>Intervention will consist of a &quot;Reminder module&quot; delivered via SMS and telephone calls by an automated, customized software application. This will include standardized SMS reminder 3 days prior to scheduled immunization clinic appointments, telephone call reminders a day prior to scheduled clinic appointment (4 to 6pm) (in addition to standard care - routine paper-based appointment scheduling and counselling by care providers) for routine immunization. Reminders will be provided consistently for all immunization clinic appointments until the child turns 12 months of age.</description>

    <description>In two small groups of 15 participants each per state, purposively selected pregnant women in their third trimester and parents of infants aged 0-12 months in the community, as well as community leaders, service providers and policy makers will be exposed to photographs (taken from other sources) of debilitating consequences of non-immunization, which will form the basis of the group discussions, knowledge sharing and consensus-building sessions, each lasting about 45 minutes to 1 hour. Each community cluster will be linked to a PHC.</description>
