  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to test the efficacy of transcranial direct current stimulation
      combined with bimanual training on hand function in children with unilateral spastic cerebral
      palsy (USCP). Children who enroll in the protocol will be randomized to receive either sham
      (not stimulating) tDCS plus bimanual training, or active (stimulating) tDCS plus bimanual
      training.

    <masking>Triple (Participant, Care Provider, Outcomes Assessor)</masking>
    <masking_description>Participants and care providers will not be told of their group allocation. Participants in the sham group will receive a brief stimulation of the scalp, which will give them a feeling of being stimulated. This sham stimulation has been shown to effectively blind participants to group. Assessors will not be told the type of study being conducted.</masking_description>

    <description>In this arm, participants will engage in 120 min of bimanual training. Bimanual training involves using both hands to play with toys and games during the study. During the first 20 min of bimanual training, participants will receive active tDCS via sponges over the scalp.</description>

    <description>In this arm, participants will engage in 120 min of bimanual training. Bimanual training involves using both hands to play with toys and games during the study. During the first 20 min of bimanual training, participants will wear the tDCS device that is worn by the active tDCS group, but in the sham group, participants will not receive stimulation during this 20 min period.</description>
