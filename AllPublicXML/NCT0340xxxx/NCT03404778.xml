      This study is a multicenter, prospective, non-randomized, non-controlled clinical outcome
      study. The primary objective of this study is to evaluate improvement of pain score at one
      year for the Biomet Comprehensive Reverse Shoulder. The secondary objective is collection of
      long term clinical outcomes.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The Biomet Comprehensive Reverse Shoulder was developed to provide an additional surgical
      option for patients anatomically and structurally suited to receive a reverse shoulder
      arthroplasty. The aim of the Biomet Comprehensive Reverse Shoulder is to increase shoulder
      function while reducing pain.

      A total of 3 sites will be involved in this study. Having three clinical sites will allow for
      multiple investigators to contribute to the results of the study. 175 implants will be
      included into the study. All potential study subjects will be required to participate in the
      Informed Consent Process.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Biomet® Comprehensive™ Reverse Shoulder products are indicated for use in patients
             whose shoulder joint has a grossly deficient rotator cuff with severe arthropathy
             and/or previously failed shoulder joint replacement with a grossly deficient rotator
             cuff.

          -  The patient must be anatomically and structurally suited to receive the implants and a
             functional deltoid muscle is necessary.

          -  The Comprehensive® Reverse Shoulder is indicated for primary, fracture, or revision
             total shoulder replacement for the relief of pain and significant disability due to
             gross rotator cuff deficiency.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Absolute contraindications include infection, sepsis, and osteomyelitis.

          -  Uncooperative patient or patient with neurologic disorders who is incapable or
             unwilling to follow directions.

          -  Osteoporosis.

          -  Metabolic disorders which may impair bone formation.

          -  Osteomalacia.

          -  Distant foci of infections which may spread to the implant site.

          -  Rapid joint destruction, marked bone loss or bone resorption apparent on
             roentgenogram.
