  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study was to verify the effect of 10-day sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO3) and
      placebo (PLA) supplementation on physical and specific performance capacity, as well as
      concentrations of the selected biochemical blood markers in trained combat sports athletes,
      in a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO3) was proposed as an ergogenic agent, because it improves
      high-intensity and resistance exercise performance. Until now the major limitation to NaHCO3
      supplementation has been the gastrointestinal (GI) side effects. Therefore, this study aims
      to examine the effect of chronic, progressive-dose NaHCO3 ingestion on physical capacity and
      specific performance capacity, and concentrations of the selected biochemical blood markers
      in trained combat sports athletes, in a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial.

    <description>The experimental procedure for each athlete included a 10-day NaHCO3 supplementation in a progressive-dose regimen in order to reduce the likelihood of gastrointestinal side effects (from 25 to 100 mg ∙ kg-1). NaHCO3 was administered in the form of unmarked disk-shaped tablets (Alkala T, SANUM, Poland). The tablets were ingested with at least 250 mL of water and could be either swallowed or dissolved in the mouth. On training days the supplements were taken in the morning, in the evening and 1.5 hours before training session. On rest days the supplements were taken in the morning, in the afternoon and in the evening.</description>
