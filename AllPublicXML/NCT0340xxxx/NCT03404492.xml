  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Clinical improvement has been demonstrated after cardiorespiratory rehabilitation in patients
      with pulmonary hypertension. Rehabilitation is therefore now part of the recommendations for
      good practice. However, no data is available to elucidate the mechanism of this improvement:
      an improvement in myocardial reserve or an improvement in peripheral muscular capacity? The
      main objective of this study is to evaluate the difference in right ventricular contractile
      reserve before and after cardiorespiratory rehabilitation during stress ultrasound in
      pulmonary hypertension in 10 patients with pulmonary hypertension.
