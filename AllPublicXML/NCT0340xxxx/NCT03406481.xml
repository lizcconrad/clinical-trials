  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The minimum period of fasting recommended by the 'American Society of Anesthesiologists' for
      the preoperative period is 6 hours for solid foods and 2 hours for clear liquids. Knowing the
      effect of preoperative fasting time on intravascular volume status may lead us to determine
      the amount of fluid to be administered intraoperatively. Cardiac preload static indicators
      are often insufficient to predict the need for fluid and are often measured by invasive
      methods. Knowing the adequacy of the preload is important in anesthesia practice; there is no
      hemodynamic benefit of fluid replacement in non-responsive patients. In this study, the
      investigators aimed to determine the effect of preoperative fasting period on cardiac index
      change after anesthesia induction in pediatric patients aged 5-12 years. The primary
      implication of this study is to determine the fasting period of fluid evacuation by assessing
      patients' intravascular volume status.
