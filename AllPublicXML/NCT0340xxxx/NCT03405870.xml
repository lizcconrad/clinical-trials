    <textblock>
      Briefly, this pilot clinical trial will evaluate preliminary safety and efficacy of the study
      drug (Smoflipid) at elevating cholesterol levels (primary outcome) in patients with sepsis
      and moderate organ dysfunction and will also evaluate measures of organ dysfunction,
      mortality, and biological activity (secondary outcomes).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Sepsis is a life-threatening disease for which there are no effective treatments. It results
      from metabolic and immunologic derangements that lead to organ dysfunction, shock and
      sometimes death. Both &quot;good&quot; (high density lipoprotein, HDL) and &quot;bad&quot; (low density
      lipoprotein, LDL) cholesterol should be protective against sepsis by helping to clear
      bacterial toxins from the blood stream and by providing a fuel for endogenous
      corticosteroids, part of the body's protective stress-response in shock. However, for
      partially unknown reasons, cholesterol levels drop to critically low levels in early sepsis,
      leaving the body unable to protect itself against sepsis via these mechanisms. Currently,
      lipid emulsions are available that are FDA approved for intravenous nutrition in critically
      ill patients (including sepsis) and may be capable of elevating serum cholesterol levels.
      This Phase II randomized pilot clinical trial, proposes to assess the following in a cohort
      of patients with early sepsis (first 24 hours): 1) safety and tolerability of the proposed
      lipid injectable emulsion (Smoflipid) and any adverse effects, 2) the drugs ability to
      optimally elevate cholesterol at 48 hours, and 3) preliminary measures of biological activity
      and clinical outcomes.

    <intervention_model_description>The study has a Phase I/II design, with the first 16 patients enrolled in the study to evaluate for dose limiting toxicity (DLT). For the first 16 patients enrolled in the Phase I dose-escalation study, there will be no control group, with doses starting at 1.0g/kg and increasing incrementally by 0.2g/kg to a maximum dose of 1.8g/kg. Dose escalation or de-escalation will occur based on whether DLTs are observed at a specific dose, with the threshold for toxicity set at 10%. After evaluating for DLT, the two highest and safest doses will be used to randomize the remaining 48 patients into the Phase II study to either Smoflipid or control (no active treatment) using a Bayesian Optimal Interval Design. Thus, the Phase II arm will include 24 patients randomized to one of the two most efficacious doses of the study drug, while the control group will receive no drug.</intervention_model_description>

    <masking_description>Because this is a pilot study, and because the lipid emulsion appears white and will be visible to the treatment team, the study will not be blinded. Data abstractors will, however, be blinded to the treatment effect. As the treatment effects are objective measurements (lipid levels, SOFA score, etc.) the likelihood of bias is low.</masking_description>
