  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Shoulder injury is a common problem of overhead athletes, as swimmers. It's reported a
      reduction of side-to-side glenohumeral rotation from 11 to 18 degrees can increase 1.9 points
      the injury risk, because an alteration in biomechanics can turn lead to clinical findings of
      impingement and labral pathology. Posterior deltoid is a main muscle for propulsion in
      swimming stroke. To our knowledge, it isn't known how a posterior deltoid static passive
      stretch could reduce glenohumeral rotation restriction after swimming competition.
