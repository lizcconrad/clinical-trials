  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to learn how a hormone called estradiol (estrogen) affects the
      levels of luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) in women with
      polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). The study will assess whether estradiol-induced LH and FSH
      release is impaired in women with PCOS.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      LH and FSH are hormones made by the pituitary gland. The pituitary is a small gland located
      below the brain. LH and FSH control the ovaries, including ovarian follicle (egg) development
      and ovarian hormone production. Estradiol is a hormone that mostly comes from the ovaries. In
      particular, as an ovarian follicle (egg) develops and grows, it makes more and more
      estradiol. Ovulation is the release of an egg from the ovary. Ovulation happens after
      estradiol, and then LH and FSH, rise to high levels. Specifically, high estradiol levels
      cause the pituitary gland to produce high LH and FSH levels, and these high LH and FSH levels
      cause ovulation. Women are normally expected to ovulate with most menstrual cycles.

      PCOS is a hormonal disorder common among women of reproductive age. Women with PCOS may have
      infrequent or prolonged menstrual periods or excess male hormone (androgen) levels. Women
      with PCOS may ovulate irregularly (or not at all), which can make it difficult to become
      pregnant.

      During this study, researchers hope to learn how women with and without PCOS may respond
      differently to estradiol. The investigators think that, in women with PCOS, LH and FSH levels
      may not increase normally when estradiol levels are high, so their LH and FSH levels may not
      be high enough to cause ovulation effectively. This study will be done by measuring LH and
      FSH in urine and blood specimens while women wear skin patches that deliver estradiol to the
      woman's body.

      During this study, women will have estradiol skin patches placed on their abdomen every
      morning in the University of Virginia (UVa) Clinical Research Unit. This form of estrogen is
      17-beta estradiol, which is identical to the main estrogen hormone that the body produces.
      The dose of the estradiol will be gradually increased in the study, because in the normal
      menstrual cycle, the body's estradiol level gradually increases to cause ovulation. This
      method of estradiol administration is expected keep hormone levels within the normal range
      that would be seen during a normal menstrual cycle.

    <description>The peak 24-h mean value after E2 administration divided by the nadir 24-h mean value (prior to or during E2 administration). A comparison of the mean LH Augmentation Index (LH AI) values between the healthy normal and the PCOS study populations will be conducted by way of analysis of covariance (ANCOVA). Determining whether the component of variability in the LH AI attributed to &quot;Study Group&quot; (i.e. healthy normal versus PCOS) is a significant component of the overall variability in the LH AI will be the central hypothesis that will be tested. Variability in LH AI attributed to baseline disparities in mean LH will be accounted for in testing this central hypothesis by treating subject-specific baseline mean LH as a covariate in the ANCOVA model. A p≤0.05 decision rule will be utilized as the null hypothesis rejection criterion for testing the central null hypothesis that the mean LH AI is the same for healthy normal and the PCOS subjects who have common baseline LH.</description>

In addition, the investigators will perform real-time monitoring of serum E2 levels (i.e., real-time monitoring of transdermal estradiol dosing) to ensure achievement of appropriate target levels. That is, the investigators want to ensure that serum E2 levels are high enough to trigger a gonadotropin surge (~250-350 pg/ml), but the investigators wish to avoid prolonged exposure to excessive serum E2 levels (&gt; 400 pg/ml).</description>

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  All included subjects will be adult women ages 18-30 years. The investigators will use
             age 30 as a cutoff because early manifestations of reproductive senescence (e.g.,
             evidence for reduced ovarian reserve) are more common in women older than age 30
             years. Additionally, the risk of development of venous clots on estrogen treatment
             appears to increase beyond age 35 years, so by limiting our population to women age
             18-30, risk associated with estrogen treatment will be limited in a healthy
             population.

          -  Adult women with PCOS and normally-cycling, non-hyperandrogenic controls

          -  General good health (excluding, for example, overweight, obesity, hyperandrogenism,
             PCOS, and adequately-treated hypothyroidism)

          -  Capable of and willing to provide informed consent

          -  Willing to strictly avoid pregnancy with use of non-hormonal methods during the study
             period

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Incapacity to provide informed consent including due to cognitive impairment

          -  Males will be excluded as E2-induced gonadotropin surges and PCOS are relevant to
             females only

          -  Children (age &lt;18 years) will be excluded

          -  Prisoners will be excluded due to the high frequency of required visits

          -  Evidence for etiologies of anovulation/hyperandrogenism due to conditions other than
             PCOS

          -  Positive pregnancy test or current lactation

          -  Menstrual cycle frequency &lt;26 days: Cycles &lt;26 days suggest the possibility of
             relatively short follicular phases (e.g., &lt; 12 days). If a subject with a follicular
             phase shorter than 12 days participates in our protocol, they could experience an
             endogenous gonadotropin surge under surveillance. Since the investigators wish to
             capture only experimentally-induced surges, they will exclude such subjects.

          -  History or physical exam evidence suggesting Cushing's syndrome or adrenal
             insufficiency

          -  Evidence of virilization (e.g., rapidly progressive hirsutism, deepening of the voice,
             clitoromegaly)

          -  Total testosterone &gt;150 ng/dL, which suggests the possibility of virilizing neoplasm

          -  DHEA-S greater than the upper limit of reference range for controls; mild elevations
             may be seen in PCOS, and elevations &lt;1.5 times the upper limit of normal will be
             accepted in these groups.

          -  Early morning follicular phase 17-hydroxyprogesterone greater than the follicular
             phase reference range, which suggests the possibility of congenital adrenal
             hyperplasia (if elevated during the luteal phase, the 17-hydroxyprogesterone will be
             repeated during the follicular phase). NOTE: If a 17-hydroxyprogesterone level greater
             than the follicular phase reference range is confirmed on repeat testing, an ACTH
             stimulated 17-hydroxyprogesterone &lt; 1000 ng/dl will be required for study
             participation.

          -  Previous diagnosis of diabetes, fasting glucose ≥126 mg/dL, or a hemoglobin A1c ≥6.5%

          -  Abnormal thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH). Note that subjects with stable and
             adequately treated primary hypothyroidism, reflected by normal TSH values, will not be
             excluded.

          -  Hyperprolactinemia. Any degree of hyperprolactinemia (confirmed on repeat) will be
             grounds for exclusion for controls. Mild prolactin elevations may be seen in women
             with PCOS; elevations &lt;50% higher than the upper limit of the reference range will be
             accepted in this group.

          -  Persistent hematocrit &lt;36% and hemoglobin &lt;12 g/dL.

          -  Severe thrombocytopenia (platelets &lt;50,000 cells/microL) or leukopenia (total white
             blood count &lt;4,000 cells/microL)

          -  Persistent liver laboratory study abnormalities, with these exceptions: Mild bilirubin
             elevations will be accepted in the setting of known Gilbert's syndrome; mild
             transaminase elevations may be seen in PCOS, therefore elevations &lt; 1.5 times the
             upper limit of normal will be accepted in this group

          -  Significant history of cardiac or pulmonary dysfunction (e.g., known or suspected
             congestive heart failure; asthma requiring intermittent systemic corticosteroid; etc.)

          -  Decreased renal function evidenced by GFR &lt;60 mL/min/1.73m2

          -  No medications known to affect the reproductive system can be taken in the 3 months
             prior the study. Such medications include hormonal contraceptives, spironolactone,
             metformin, progestins, glucocorticoids, antipsychotic psychotropic drugs, etc.

          -  Personal history of any disorders that may potentially be complicated or exacerbated
             by high-dose estradiol administration, such as hypertension (persistent,
             appropriately-measured blood pressure &gt;140/90 mmHg), severe hypertriglyceridemia
             (fasting triglycerides &gt;500 mg/dL), venous thromboembolism (deep venous thrombosis,
             pulmonary embolism), proven or suspected hypercoagulability, arterial thrombosis,
             stroke, coronary artery disease, myocardial infarction, migraine with aura, and
             breast, ovarian, or endometrial cancer

          -  History of any other cancer diagnosis and/or treatment (with the exception of basal
             cell or squamous cell skin carcinoma) unless they have remained clinically disease
             free (based on appropriate surveillance) for five years

          -  History of allergy or intolerance to transdermal estradiol

          -  BMI less than 18 kg/m2 or greater than or equal to 40 kg/m2

          -  Subjects with body weight &lt;110 lbs. will be excluded from the study
