      The purpose of this study is to provide expanded access to gilteritinib (ASP2215) for
      patients with FMS-like tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3)-mutated relapsed or refractory acute myeloid
      leukemia (AML) or with FLT3-mutated AML in composite complete remission (CRc: [complete
      remission (CR), complete remission with incomplete hematologic recovery (CRi), complete
      remission with incomplete platelet recovery (CRp)]) with minimal residual disease (MRD)
      without access to comparable or alternative therapy.

      This treatment protocol is being conducted while phase 3 gilteritinib (ASP2215) studies are
      ongoing in FLT3-mutated AML patients.

      Patients will be administered treatment over 28-day cycles. Patients will complete visits on
      cycle 1 days 1, 4, 8, 15; cycle 2 days 1, 15; day 1 of cycles 3 through 6; and day 1 of every
      2 cycles thereafter until discontinued from the program.

      An end of treatment visit will be performed within 7 days after last dose of medicinal
      product (gilteritinib [ASP2215]), or prior to initiation of another anticancer therapy,
      whichever occurs earlier, followed by a 30-day follow-up.

                  addition of new agent/modality in prior 2 weeks (note that increasing calcineurin
                  inhibitors or sirolimus to achieve therapeutic trough levels is allowed).
