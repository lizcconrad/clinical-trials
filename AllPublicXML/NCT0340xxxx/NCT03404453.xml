  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The incidence of difficult airway in paediatric population is up-to date not well described.
      Difficult airway is connected with significant airway-related morbidity and mortality. The
      majority of difficult airway in paediatric patients should be predictable. The aim of the
      study is to evaluate the incidence of difficult airway in paediatric patients scheduled for
      surgery under general anaesthesia and to test the predictability of the set of prediction
      tests to reveal the patients with high risk of difficult airway.

      At the preanaesthetic visit the paediatric patients will be examined for difficult airway.
      The Mallampati score, interincisor garp, cervical spine mobility, upper lip bite test and
      thyromental distance will be measured. The distances will be measured in centimeters and the
      width of the distal part of the third finger will be measured to obtain the distance
      according to the patients fingers. The airway management plan will be defined and the
      incidence of the difficult airway (difficult face mask ventilation - two hand, two operators,
      desaturation, difficult intubation - Cormack-Leehane 3-4, intubation on 3 and more attempts,
      difficult laryngeal mask insertion and the incidence of cannot intubate cannot ventilate
      scenario will be evaluated. The predictability of the test for difficult airway prediction
      (Cormack-Leehane 3-4, cannot-intubate - cannot ventilate scenario, difficult mask
      ventilation) will be statistically analyzed.

    <description>The incidence of the difficult airway will be evaluated by the anaesthesiologist in the operating room. Difficult airway will be considered as difficult face mask ventilation, difficult intubation (Cormack-Leehane 3 and 4, intubation at 3 and over 3rd attempt), difficult laryngeal mask insertion (more than 2 attempts) and the presence of the cannot intubate - cannot ventilate scenario.</description>
