  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Subnormal level of Glutamate+Glutamine (Glx) in the Anterior Cingulate Cortex (ACC) of the
      brain has been associated with depression and PTSD. Similarly, interventions that increase
      the level of Glx in the brain, specifically electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) and intravenous
      ketamine infusion have been associated with a rapid decrease in depression and suicidal
      ideation. This effect has been demonstrated in a dose-dependent manner in randomized clinical
      assessments. D-cycloserine, a glycine site modulator of NMDA receptor function has been
      demonstrated to increase Glx in the ACC of normal volunteers. The purpose of this study is to
      determine whether NRX-101, an experimental drug containing a fixed dose combination of
      D-cycloserine and lurasidone (1) raises Glx by a greater amount than either placebo or
      lurasidone alone in patients with bipolar depression, and (2) whether that elevation in Glx
      is correlated with a decrease in depression.
