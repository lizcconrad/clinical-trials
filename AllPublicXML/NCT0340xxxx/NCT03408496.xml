  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Muscle stretching is a therapeutic technique commonly used by physiotherapists, but for the
      treatment of fibromyalgia it still has weak evidence to support its real effect. On the other
      hand, myofascial mobilization in the location of tender points, as it is the solution for the
      population, demonstrating effects on the improvement of the symptoms, but not yet achieving
      the minimal clinically important change. In this context, myofascial release guided by
      physiological chains, so far not studied, is presented as an alternative to improve pain and
      quality of life in patients with fibromyalgia because it acts in a global way and, probably,
      more effective.

      This study evaluates the effect of myofascial release of the trunk physiological chains and
      muscle stretching on pain, quality of life and functional capacity of patients with
      fibromyalgia when compared to the control group.

    <description>Eight consecutive weekly sessions lasting 40-45 minutes of myofascial release of the trunk physiological chains. The connective tissue of the flexion chain and the posterior static chain will be released. The myofascial release will be obtained through the mechanical effect produced by the friction of the therapist's hand with a surface of the patient's body, which is performed through &quot;traces&quot; executed with the fingers (thumb supported or middle finger on the indicator to achieve effect local) following as addressed chains. The release will be repeated until the feeling of local relaxation of the tissue.</description>

    <description>The muscle stretching protocol described by Bressan (2008) will be followed, which consists of 8 consecutive weekly sessions, lasting 40-45 minutes. In dorsal decubitus or sitting, the triceps surae, hamstring, gluteal, paravertebral, latissimocondyloideus, pectoral, trapezius and respiratory muscles will be stretched. The exercises will be performed in a series of five repetitions for 30 seconds.</description>
