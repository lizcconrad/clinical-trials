      The purpose of the study is to evaluate the pharmacokinetics (PK), safety, and tolerability
      of brivaracetam (BRV) administered intravenously (iv) in subjects &gt;= 1 month to &lt; 16 years of
      age with epilepsy.

    <description>Brivaracetam will be administered to various age-based cohorts. Cohort 1: Subjects &gt;=12 to &lt;16 years; Cohort 2: Subjects &gt;=6 to &lt;12 years; Cohort 3: Subjects &gt;=2 to &lt;6 years; Cohort 4: Subjects 1 month to &lt;2 years. Enrollment will be sequential by descending age beginning with Cohort 1. For each cohort, the first half will receive a 15-minute iv infusion. The Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) will then review safety and, as available, PK data to make the following recommendations: the progression of the current cohort (up to 2-minute iv bolus infusion) and progression to initiate enrollment in the preceding cohort.</description>

          -  Acceptable candidate for venipuncture and intravenous (iv) infusion

          -  Treatment with &gt;=1 anti epileptic drug (AED; including BRV) without a change of dose
             regimen for at least 7 days prior to Screening

          -  No treatment with vagus nerve stimulation (VNS), OR the subject is being treated with
             VNS and the settings have been constant for &gt;=7 days prior to Screening

          -  For female subjects: not of childbearing potential, OR of childbearing potential and
             not sexually active/negative pregnancy test, OR of childbearing potential and sexually
             active/negative pregnancy test/uses medically acceptable contraceptive methods

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subject has previously received iv Brivaracetam (BRV) in this study

          -  Subject is being treated with BRV at a dose &gt;5mg/kg/day (rounded) or &gt;200mg/day for
             subjects with body weights &gt;40kg

          -  Subject requires or is likely to require a change in concomitant antiepileptic drug(s)
             (AED[s]), dose of concomitant AED(s), or formulation of AED(s) during the 7 days prior
             to the intravenous (iv) pharmacokinetic (PK) Period

          -  Subject is likely, in the opinion of the Investigator, to require rescue medication
             during the Initiating Oral BRV (IOB) Treatment or iv PK Periods

          -  Subject has experienced generalized convulsive status epilepticus in the 28 days prior
             to Screening or during the Screening Period
