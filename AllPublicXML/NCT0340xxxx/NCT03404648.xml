  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to find out if a PET/MR scan in combination with standard MRI
      and CT scans can improve the early detection and treatment of patients with prostate cancer.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      High risk prostate cancer patients will undergo C11-Choline PET/MR whole body fusion scan and
      pelvic mpMRI for accurate staging. The PET/MR imaging findings, including the primary lesion
      with the prostate bed and pelvic lymph nodes, will be correlated with the histopathologic
      result. Researchers aim to provide accurate one-stop shopping opportunity in diagnosis and
      staging of high risk prostate cancer using the C11-choline PET/MR scan.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

        1. Untreated patients with high-risk and very high-risk prostate cancer, who require
        clinical pelvic mpMRI, CT, and bone scan as standard clinical care for diagnosis and
        management of prostate cancer.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients who already received primary treatment or neo-adjuvant therapy.

          2. Patients who refuse undergoing routine clinical imaging (i.e., pelvic mpMRI, CT, bone
             scan) for staging. Reimbursement of pelvic mpMRI in this study is denied. CT and bone
             scan may be done elsewhere outside of Mayo Clinic but should be of diagnostic quality.
             Research C-11 choline PET/MR will not substitute pelvic mpMRI, CT, or bone scan in
             this study.

          3. Patients cannot tolerate MRI (e.g., claustrophobia, severe back pain or spasm,
             involuntary movement [e.g., tremor, dystonia]).

          4. Patients have total hip arthroplasty (THA), which can cause substantial susceptibility
             artifact and degrade image quality of mpMRI.

          5. Patients have cardiac pacemaker, cochlear implants, neurostimulator, medical device
             which is unsafe at 3 Tesla, or foreign metallic body in the eyes or orbit.

          6. Patients have contraindication to gadolinium based MR contrast agents (e.g., renal
             failure, severe reaction to gadolinium based MR contrast agents). Epidermal growth
             factor receptor (eGFR) should be above 30 within 30 days the time of mpMRI.
