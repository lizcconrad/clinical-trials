  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is an italian multicentric and will be conducted in 20 centers. The aim of this
      study is to evaluate poor mobilizer (PM) rate in newly diagnosed MM patients who are
      mobilized with cyclophosphamide and G-CSF and plerixafor on demand.

      Plerixafor is a specific reversible inhibitor of the chemokine receptor CXCR4 and prevents
      the binding of its ligand stromal cell derived factor SDF-1α also known as CXCL12, thereby
      releasing hematopoietic stem cells into the circulation.

    <description>Plerixafor (AMD3100) is a selective, reversible inhibitor of the receptor chemokine (C-X-C motif) receptor 4 (CXCR4) and prevents binding of its cognate ligand stromal cell derived factor-1α (SDF-1α), also known as chemokine (C-X-C motif) ligand 12 (CXCL12) [3]. CXCR4 is a co-receptor, along with CD4, for the binding of human immunodeficiency virus, type 1 (HIV-1) to its receptor cells.</description>

  <eligibility>
    <study_pop>
      <textblock>
        300 eligible patients ≥18 years old diagnosed with MM who are eligible to undergo treatment
        with an autologous haematopoietic stem cell transplant may be enrolled. Patients must meet
        all the inclusion criteria listed below within 7 days of first administration of
        cyclophosphamide in addition to signing an informed consent form.

        A patient will be considered enrolled after he/she has met all eligibility criteria and has
        started the protocol treatment.
