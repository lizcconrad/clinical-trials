  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective case-control study to compare the usefulness of 18F-FDG PET/MRI with
      that of 18F-FDG PET/CT in detection of functioning pituitary microadenomas.A single dose of
      370 Mega-Becquerel (MBq) 18F-FDG will be injected intravenously.Visual and semiquantitative
      method will be used to assess the PET/MRI and PET/CT images.

      Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) may be insufficient to locate functioning pituitary
      microadenoma.This study compared the usefulness of 18F-FDG PET/MRI with that of 18F-FDG
      PET/CT in detection of functioning pituitary microadenomas in patients with inconclusive
      conventional MRI findings. Trans-sphenoidal adenomectomy was performed within 2 weeks of
      imaging.The PET/CT and PET/MRI findings and tracer uptake levels were correlated with the
      surgical findings and pathological results.
