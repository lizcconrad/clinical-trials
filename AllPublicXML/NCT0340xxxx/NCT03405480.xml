  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This project aims to evaluate a rehabilitation program as treatment and uncover potential
      pathophysiological mechanisms of a newly identified chronic condition named &quot;Post Pulmonary
      Embolism Syndrome&quot; (PPS).

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The newly identified Post Pulmonary Embolism Syndrome (PPS) is characterized by chronic
      persistent, but unexplained dyspnea (i.e. without signs of pulmonary hypertension or
      pulmonary abnormality). Symptoms are considerable, but less severe than in CTEPH patients. A
      recent study performed by our group confirmed that up to 50% of our patients complained of
      various grades of persistent unexplained dyspnea 1-10 years after the diagnosis of PE.

      In this multifaceted project we wish to evaluate the effect of an eight week rehabilitation
      program led and supervised by a trained physiotherapist on exercise capacity in PPS patients.
      This interventional part of the study will be formed as a randomized controlled trial.
      Patients will be randomized to either usual care or a physiotherapist-supervised
      rehabilitation program.

      The study also aims to explore potential underlying pathophysiological mechanisms in PPS,
      using state of the art methods such as cardiac magnetic resonance imaging and transthoracic
      echocardiography involving novel methods focusing on the right ventricle. The
      pathophysiological part of the study will be formed as a case control study, where post
      PE-patients who do not fulfill the criteria for PPS will serve as controls.
