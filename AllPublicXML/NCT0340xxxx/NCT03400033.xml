  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This Phase 3 study in hemodialysis-dependent subjects with anemia will evaluate the efficacy
      and safety of daprodustat administered three-times weekly compared to epoetin alfa, the
      current standard of care. This study includes a 4 week Screening Period, a 52 week Treatment
      Period and a 4 to 6 week follow-up period. Each subject will remain in the study for up to 62
      weeks. Approximately 402 subjects will be randomized to receive either daprodustat three
      times weekly or epoetin alfa three-times weekly or once weekly, depending on dose level.
