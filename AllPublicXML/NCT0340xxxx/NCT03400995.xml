  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a single centre, single-dose, non-randomised, open label study. The primary
      objectives of this study are to assess the mass balance recovery and provide biosamples for
      metabolite profiling and structural identification after a single oral dose of [14C]-AK0529
      in healthy male subjects. 7 subjects will be recruited to receive a single oral
      administration of a solution containing 300 mg AK0529. The total duration of the study will
      be approximately 6 weeks.
