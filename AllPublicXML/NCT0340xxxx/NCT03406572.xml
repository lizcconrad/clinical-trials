  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic respiratory insufficiency and COPD are the third leading cause of death worldwide.
      Patients decompensate at various stages of their disease and exhibit acute-on-chronic
      respiratory failure (ACRF), a frequent cause of ICU hospitalization for hypercapnic acute
      respiratory failure (ARF). Non-invasive ventilation (NIV) is the first line ventilatory
      treatment for hypercapnic ARF. It is applied intermittently, separated by periods of
      spontaneous breathing (SB) with standard oxygen (O2).

      Standard O2 has drawbacks that limit the benefit of intermittent NIV in hypercapnic ARF:
      limited gas flow which is well below the patient's inspiratory flow rate, limited capacity
      and efficiency of oxygenation with non-controlled FiO2 (risk of excessive oxygen and induced
      hypercapnia), and cold and dry gas leading to discomfort and under-humidification of the
      airways and tracheobronchial secretions. Benefits in terms of work of breathing and CO2
      removal resulting from PEEP and pressure support applied during NIV periods could be rapidly
      lost during standard O2.

      Recently, use of high-flow heated and humidified nasal oxygen therapy (HFHO) has gained
      enthusiasm among intensivists to manage ARF. HFHO delivers high flows (up to 60L/min, that
      generate moderate PEEP) of heated and humidified oxygen at a controlled and adjustable FiO2
      (21 to 100%) that rapidly improve respiratory distress symptoms, oxygenation, respiratory
      comfort and outcome of patients with hypoxemic ARF.

      These unique features of HFHO could overcome some of the drawbacks of standard O2 during SB
      periods in hypercapnic ARF. Indeed, PEEP effect, washout of nasopharyngeal dead-space
      limiting CO2 re-breathing and inspired gas conditioning preserving adequate mucosal function
      and secretion removal, could potentially contribute to decrease airways resistance, intrinsic
      PEEP and work of breathing, while improving patient comfort. Investigators aim to determine
      if the use of HFHO, as compared to standard O2, increases the number of ventilator-free days
      (VFDs) and alive at day 28 in patients with hypercapnic ARF admitted in an ICU, an
      intermediate care, or a respiratory care unit, and requiring NIV.

      In both groups, treatment will start with a first NIV session of 2 hours, with arterial blood
      gas measurement between one hour and two hours after initiating the NIV session. The NIV will
      be extended for those patients with a pH &lt; 7.30. In both groups, patients will be assessed
      for their tolerance of NIV and their ability to switch to spontaneous breathing every hour
      +/- 30 min, except during sleep (10 pm-8 am); they will be assessed for their tolerance of
      spontaneous breathing and for the need of resumption of NIV every 2 hours+/- 30 min and every
      4 +/- 1 hours thereafter. To ensure the consistency of indications of NIV and invasive
      mechanical ventilation (IMV) across centers and reduce potential bias, NIV and IMV will be
      initiated and stopped in the same way in the two groups, using predefined criteria.

        -  Inclusion (day 0): informed consent, randomisation (HFHO group/standard O2 group), NIV
           initiation (for 2 hours), clinical and paraclinical exam including ABG, data collection

        -  Follow-up (day 1 to day 28) : NIV, clinical exam, ABG, data collection
