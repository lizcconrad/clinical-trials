  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Comparison between high and low frequency percutaneous electrical nerve stimulation as
      treatment of myofascial chronic neck pain. The main hypothesis is that low frequency
      treatment will have more hypoalgesic effects than high frequency, and low frequency effects
      will last longer.

    <description>Subjective feeling expressed by subjects in the area of discomfort. It will be measured by a Visual Analogue Scale, meaning a score of 0 points/centimiters &quot;no pain&quot; and a score of 10 points/centimiters &quot;unbearable pain&quot;.</description>

    <time_frame>Changes on pain will be assessed during one month follow up. Baseline will be measured on the first day and one month later pain score will be reassessed.</time_frame>
    <description>Minimal amount of pressure that induces pain. An algometer will be used to measure pressure pain threshold. Units will be kilograms per square centimeter. The higher the score is, the less sensitive the area will be.</description>

    <time_frame>Pre treatment at the beginning of the study and one month later, on the last of the follow up period.</time_frame>
    <description>Ten items questionnaire designed to asses the level of pain and self-assessment of cervical disability. The NDI (Spanish version) is composed of 10 questions related to daily functional activities. NDI presents an acceptable reliability with an intraclass correlation coeffcient (ICC) ranging from 0.50 to 0.98. It has been proposed that the clinically important difference required for NDI is seven points.</description>

    <description>A dry needling on trapezius muscle is performed, until two local twitch responses are obtained. The needle is kept inside the trigger point, as it will be the negative electrode, and an adhesive electrode will be added as the positive one. After that, a low frequency TENS is applied, at 2 Hz frequency and 120 microseconds of pulse width.</description>
