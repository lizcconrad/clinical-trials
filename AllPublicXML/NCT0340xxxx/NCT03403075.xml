  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To date, studies published on multidimensional rehabilitation programs are addressed to
      patients with different types of cancer and, frequently, these studies only include a limited
      number of patients with blood neoplasms. So, there is no evidence of the effectiveness of
      multidimensional rehabilitation programs in this particular category of patients. A
      systematic review of the effectiveness of aerobic exercise alone, not associated with
      therapeutic education, has recently been conducted in adult individuals with hematological
      malignancies (reference 25386666). The review highlighted the effectiveness of physical
      activity on the quality of life of the target population. However, the medium and long term
      effects that physical exercise have on other clinically relevant endpoints, such as fatigue,
      psychological distress, and physical performance level, remain to be clarified. Thus, it is
      important to investigate the effectiveness of multidimensional interventions that integrate
      physical activity to therapeutic education targeted at the specific needs of individuals with
      blood neoplasm.

      The aim of this study is to evaluate, in blood cancer patients, the feasibility of a
      therapeutic education program associated with physical activity, and to verify its effect by
      a long-term follow-up.

      This is a randomized controlled pilot study • Control Group will be offered usual care (UC),
      which includes two sessions of therapeutic education delivered in small groups. In these
      educational sessions, patients are provided with useful information on communication
      strategies, problem solving strategies, recognition and management of symptoms and the
      management of any aids/orthoses provided in everyday life, etc. In the meetings, it will be
      emphasized the importance of maintaining an active lifestyle as much as possible by
      encouraging involvement in physical activity even during the cancer treatment period.

      Written information material that summarizes the concepts addressed during group meetings
      will be provided.

      • Intervention group will be offered therapeutic education as described for the control
      group, plus 6 individual sessions of therapeutic education and physical activity (ETAF). The
      6 individual session will be held by a physiotherapist dedicated to the study, on a weekly /
      bi-weekly basis, according to the objectives set and the needs of the patient.

      In these sessions, the topics already discussed in group will be deepened, personalizing them
      according to the patient's characteristics. Furthermore, personalized physical activity is
      planned, taking into account the context of execution, the clinical condition and the
      patient's preferences. Patients will be trained to build an action plan aimed at self-plan
      physical activities and a diary will be provided to monitor the physical activity carried out
      autonomously.

      Written information material that summarizes the concepts addressed during group and
      individual sessions will be provided.
