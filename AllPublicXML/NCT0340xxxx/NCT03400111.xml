  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with class I malocclusion who have mild to moderate crowding will be treated in this
      study. The efficacy of low level laser therapy and Panadol-extra® in relieving pain due to
      orthodontic treatment will be assessed. The effect of these two interventions on oral-health
      related quality of life during all stages of orthodontic treatment will be explored, i.e. at
      the following stages: (1) separation between teeth, (2) archwire changing, (3) bonding of
      brackets, (4) removal of the fixed appliances.

      There are three groups :

        1. a group of patient being irradiated with low-level laser therapy (LLLT) at specific time
           points to relieve pain and discomfort.

        2. a group of patient in which pain control will be accomplished by prescribing Panadol
           Extra tablets in a regular manner.

        3. a group of patients in which nothing will be given to them during the course of
           treatment.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The assessment of oral-health-related quality of life during the different stages of
      orthodontic treatment is probably unique in the literature.

      The study will cover the different stages of orthodontic treatment from A to Z. In other
      words, patients will be followed up till the end of treatment at which fixed appliances are
      removed. Pain control will be accomplished in one arm using LLLT and in another arm by
      prescribing Panadol Extra®. A third group will be left without any medication or laser
      irradiation to serve as a control group.

    <masking_description>Patients in the first group will undergo active irradiation with low-level laser therapy but they will consume placebo tablets. Patients in the second group will consume real Panadol-extra tablets but they will be subjected to a placebo red-beam as if they are irradiated with a laser beam.
