  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate whether placing stent(s) for a blockage in a leg
      vein will help improve the healing of diabetic foot ulcers (DFU). The investigators know from
      having taken care of many patients with diabetic foot ulcers that it is a major cause of
      disability and amputation. These diabetic foot ulcers frequently heal slowly or not at all.
      They sometimes become infected and require antibiotic therapy, debridement and amputation.
      The investigators normally take care of a diabetic foot ulcer with a combination of local
      wound care, surgical debridement if necessary, antibiotics if there is an infection, and
      reduction of pressure on the area of the foot with the ulcer. The investigators observed that
      some patients with a diabetic foot ulcer also have a blockage in a major leg vein referred to
      as the iliac vein. This blockage in the iliac vein prevents the proper flow of blood from the
      leg. This blockage results in pressure within the leg veins leading to swelling in the legs
      which may also prevent healing of the diabetic foot ulcer. This study will investigate
      whether placing stent(s) to treat the blockage(s) will improve healing of the diabetic foot
      ulcer and reduce some of the complications associated with a diabetic foot ulcer. The results
      of this study could result in a new treatment that will allow future patients with diabetic
      foot ulcers to heal better. Right now, placing stents for these blockages in the iliac vein
      is not the standard of care treatment for a diabetic foot ulcer. In order for us to determine
      whether stent placement is helpful, the researchers will have to randomize each patient. In
      other words, to reduce bias, patients will be assigned either to a group receiving a stent or
      to a group not receiving a stent. Every patient in both groups will receive the standard of
      care for a diabetic foot ulcer and undergo an x-ray with contrast and intravenous ultrasound
      examination of the legs. The standard of care for a diabetic foot ulcer may include local
      wound care, antibiotic therapy, debridement and/or amputation, and pressure offloading in the
      foot.

      This will be a single center, patient-blinded, randomized controlled trial. In the event that
      a patient does not meet inclusion criteria after signing the consent for and undergoing
      venogram/IVUS (screen fail), additional patients will be enrolled until 60 patients have been
      successfully randomized. Up to 80 patients will be consented in order to account for
      potential screen fails. Randomized patients will be followed monthly until their ulcer heals,
      every 3 months after healing for one year postoperatively.

      Every patient subject will undergo venogram &amp; IVUS. The investigator experience with over 600
      patients who underwent venous stenting at Mount Sinai - all of whom had preoperative MR
      venogram or CT venogram - revealed that pre-operative imaging missed the diagnosis of PVOO in
      approximately 10% of patients (this is unpublished data). Due to the small sample size of
      this pilot study, the very low risks associated with venogram and IVUS, and the 100% accuracy
      of venogram and IVUS in diagnosing PVOO, every study subject will undergo these two imaging
      studies. Once the diagnosis of PVOO is confirmed, the study subject will be immediately
      randomized in the OR. Study subjects randomized to convention therapy plus venous stents will
      undergo venous stent placement at the same sitting. For study subjects randomized to
      conventional therapy alone, the procedure will be terminated after venogram and IVUS.

    <description>Local wound care consists of at least once daily dressing Occasionally, a limited bedside debridement is indicated to excise small quantity of devitalized tissues and to provide better drainage. Antibiotic therapy including both gram-positive and gram-negative coverage when the DFU appears infected is guided by wound cultures and when necessary, Infectious Disease consultation. Debridement and amputation will be performed as clinically indicated. To promote healing after the more acute processes have been addressed, pressure offloading is frequently helpful in the healing of DFU. Pressure offloading treatment ranges from special dressings and devices to special diabetic foot wares. Offloading will be utilized as indicated.</description>
