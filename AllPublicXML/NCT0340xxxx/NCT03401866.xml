      This clinical trial is to validate and demonstrate the clinical usefulness of a protocol for
      Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) in people with high grade glioma brain tumors.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Although DSC-MRI itself is not novel, the consensus protocol tested herein is newly developed
      in response to a stated need by federal agencies (FDA, NCI) for standardization of imaging
      endpoints, including perfusion-weighted MRI, in multi-center clinical trials of GBM
      therapies. Through use of stereotactic methodologies that have been used to demonstrate that
      rCBV(relative cerebral blood flow) and FTB(fractional tumor burden) measures made by the
      consensus DSC-MRI protocol are concordant with tissue histology, this multi-site trial will
      be the first to validate a consensus DSC-MRI protocol on multiple platforms representing all
      major MRI scanner manufacturers. The trial also formally compares two contrast agent dosing
      schemes proposed in the consensus protocol, a single-dose BTIP-compliant scheme and a
      double-dose scheme. Such a comparison has never been tested in patients before, and addresses
      a longstanding controversy regarding contrast agent administration and dosing for DSC-MRI.
      Successful validation of the consensus DSC-MRI protocol will likely shift clinical practice
      paradigms. To date, the widespread adoption of DSC-MRI has been limited by inconsistent
      published methodologies, rCBV thresholds, and impact on clinical decision making. This trial
      seeks to improve confidence in DSCMRI methodology as it will foster its adoption for
      multicenter trials, facilitating the development and testing of novel therapeutic agents and
      treatment strategies for GBM, and shift clinical practice paradigms by providing strong
      evidence to support the inclusion of DSC-MRI in established response assessment criteria
      (i.e., modified RANO).

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Histologically proven intracranial glioblastoma or gliosarcoma at initial surgery

          -  Patient is currently being treated with standard first-line therapy for
             glioblastoma/gliosarcoma

          -  Karnofsky performance status ≥ 70

          -  Age ≥ 18 years

          -  Women must not be pregnant or breast-feeding as gadolinium enhanced MRI is
             contra-indicated

          -  Progressive contrast enhancement (&gt; 25% increase in contrast enhancing volume compared
             to nadir, not corresponding to a region of peri-operative infarct seen on immediate
             post-op MRI) identified on routine surveillance MRI, with plan for surgical
             biopsy/resection. Measurable enhancement is defined as two perpendicular in-plane
             diameters of at least 10 mm and at least 10 mm in the 3rd orthogonal direction. This
             must be the patient's initial recurrence.

          -  Intratumoral hemorrhage (acute, subacute, or chronic) as seen on hemosiderin-sensitive
             (gradient-echo) MRI may preclude patient inclusion because of anticipated limited
             evaluation due to magnetic susceptibility artifact on the heavily T2*-weighted DSC-MRI
             images. If the region of enhancing tumor not affected by blooming artifact on the
             hemosiderin-sensitive images does not meet the 10 x 10 x 10 mm &quot;measurable
             enhancement&quot; threshold specified elsewhere, the patient is ineligible.

          -  Patients must be able to tolerate brain MRI scans with dynamic intravenous
             gadolinium-based contrast agent injections

          -  No known allergy-like reaction to gadolinium or moderate or severe allergic reactions
             to one or more allergens as defined by the American College of Radiology (ACR);

          -  Weight compatible with limits imposed by the MRI scanner table.
