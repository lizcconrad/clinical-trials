  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a study of EMB-001 (a combination of two FDA-approved drugs, metyrapone and oxazepam)
      in healthy adults.This is a Phase 1, single dose, 3-period, 3-sequence, crossover study in 9
      healthy male and female (not of childbearing potential) volunteers. The study will evaluate
      the bioavailability and food effect of a new formulation of EMB-001 relative to the original
      formulation of EMB 001.

      During the study, a total of 9 eligible subjects will be randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio to each
      of 3 treatment sequences

             includes documented surgical sterilization (hysterectomy or bilateral oophorectomy) or
             being postmenopausal. Menopause is defined clinically as 12 months of amenorrhea in a
             woman over age 45 in the absence of other biological or physiological cause. In
             addition, women must have a documented serum follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) level
             &gt;40 mIU/mL.

          4. Light smokers (&lt;10 cigarettes per day), non-smokers, or ex-smokers

          5. Body mass index ≥18.5 and &lt;30 kg/m2

          6. Able to take oral medications and willing to adhere to medication regimen during the
             study

          7. No clinically relevant abnormal physical findings at the Screening examination

          8. Electrocardiogram without clinically significant abnormality at Screening

          9. Normal blood pressure (BP) and heart rate (systolic BP 90 to 140 mmHg; diastolic BP 50
             to 90 mmHg; heart rate 50 to 100 beats per minute)

         10. No clinically relevant abnormal laboratory findings (general biochemistry, hematology,
             urinalysis, endocrinology [cortisol]) at Screening

         11. Adequate organ function at screening as defined by:

               1. Serum aspartate aminotransferase (AST) ≤ 2.5 × upper limit of normal (ULN; unless
                  the increased AST is assessed by the Investigator as due to hemolysis and/or
                  hepatic iron deposition); and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) ≤ 2.5 × ULN (unless
                  the increased ALT is assessed by the Investigator as due to hepatic iron
                  deposition).

               2. Normal or elevated levels of serum bilirubin. Serum bilirubin &gt;2× ULN is

             globulin, including but not limited to: consuming estrogens, selective estrogen
             receptor modulators, or herbal/natural estrogen-like compounds; low serum albumin or

             biologic within 30 days of study completion (including the follow-up visit)

          7. Women of childbearing potential.

          8. Have positive serology test results at Screening for human immunodeficiency (HIV)
             1/HIV 2 antibodies, Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) or Hepatitis C Antibody
             (HCVAb) before Day -2 of this study.

          9. Suicidal, homicidal thoughts and behaviors, or evidence of current severe mental
             illness such as schizophrenia, bipolar disorder or others that may interfere with
             subject safety or data integrity

         10. Use of serotonin reuptake inhibitor/serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor
             antidepressants in the 30 days prior to Period 1 or during the study.
