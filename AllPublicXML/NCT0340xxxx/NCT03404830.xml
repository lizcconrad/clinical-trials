  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Due to the high incidence of falls in the elderly population, this study is presented as a
      method to reduce the risk of falls through a specific type of training in people over 60
      years of age.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A 16-week high intensity interval training (HIIT) program, compared to a continuous exercise
      program and one that does not perform any training program, decreases the risk of falls and
      improves the state of health, physical condition and quality of life to a greater extent than
      a group that does not perform any type of exercise in people over 60 years.

    <time_frame>Up to twelve weeks.</time_frame>
    <description>Be employed for the assessment of dynamic balance, in which the subject starts from the sitting position in a chair (without palm rest). The evaluator's verbal signal initiates time control (sec). The evaluator must: get up from the chair, travel a distance of 3 meters, go around a pivot, travel the same distance back and sit back in the chair as quickly as possible. The closing of the time is established when the evaluated subject makes contact with the chair sitting down.</description>

    <description>The HIIT program training:
5 minutes of heating will be done. The intervention will consist of a training in suspension (TRX) performing squats. The session will be divided into four four-minute intervals at an intensity of 90-95% of the maximum heart rate, followed by three-minute active rest intervals of 50-70%. This intensity will be assigned to each subject individually. After the training, there will be a return to calm of 10 minutes of exercises of joint range. There will be 2 weekly training, with three days between both training, for a period of 12 weeks.
The training of the MICT program:
5 minutes of heating will be done. Subsequently, participants will perform a squat training with the Suspension Training System (TRX) with an intensity close to 70% of their maximum heart rate maintained for 40 minutes. The session will conclude with a return to calm of 10 min of joint width and stretching.</description>
