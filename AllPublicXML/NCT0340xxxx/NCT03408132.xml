    <textblock>
      This is a repeated dose, open label trial investigating safety, efficacy, PD and PK of FE
      203799 in 6 patients with SBS and intestinal insufficiency (SBS-II). The patients will
      receive a subcutaneous (SC) dose of 25 mg FE 203799 once weekly for 4 consecutive weeks, and
      efficacy parameters and PK will be assessed after the fourth dose. Safety follow up
      assessments will be performed 4-6 weeks after the last dose.

      Trial design This is a repeated dose, open label trial investigating safety, efficacy, PD and
      PK of FE 203799 in 6 patients with SBS and intestinal insufficiency (SBS-II). The patients
      will receive a subcutaneous (SC) dose of 25 mg FE 203799 once weekly for 4 consecutive weeks,
      and efficacy parameters and PK will be assessed after the fourth dose. Safety follow up
      assessments will be performed 4 6 weeks after the last dose.

      The first two administrations of trial drug will be performed at the clinic, while the third
      dose can be either self-administered by the patient or administered at the clinic if the
      patient prefers to travel to the site or other considerations make a site visit preferable.
      The fourth administration of trial drug will be performed at the clinic just prior to
      assessment of efficacy parameters in the treatment balance study.

      Prior to each administration of trial drug, liver function parameters will be analysed and
      assessed. During the entire trial, patients who develop extremely high or persistently
      elevated liver enzymes following trial drug administration will be discontinued from the
      trial.

      The patients will complete a diary with data on trial drug administration performed at home,
      local tolerability and adverse events (AEs).
