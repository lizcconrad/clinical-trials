    <textblock>
      Multicenter, randomized, open-label, 2-arm, parallel-group, phase III study whose goal is to
      assess the efficacy and safety profile of bone-targeted treatments (Arm A: denosumab or
      zoledronic acid) versus the control arm (Arm B: no specific treatment) in patients with bone
      metastases under targeted therapy for Metastatic Renal Cell Carcinoma.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Age ≥ 18 years.

          -  Histologically proven mRCC.

          -  Administration of one of the systemic agents in use for the treatment of mRCC (no more
             than three prior systemic therapy regimens).

          -  Appearance or worsening of the bone disease, whether symptomatic or not, with more
             than 1 bone metastasis.

        Worsening of the bone disease is defined as:

          -  Appearance of a new bone metastatic site (new bone metastasis);

          -  OR Significant progression: at least one dimension x 2 of at least one known BM
             between 2 successive MRI or specific CT-scans;

          -  OR Bone complication (fracture, nerve compression…) with successful local treatment at
             least 4 weeks before inclusion.

               -  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Performance Status (PS) ≤ 2.

               -  Adequate renal function (serum creatinine ≤ 200 mmol/L or creatinine clearance ≥
                  30 mL/min according to Cockroft formula or MDRD formula for patients older than
                  65 years).

               -  Covered by a medical insurance.

               -  Willingness and ability to comply with scheduled visits, treatment plans,
                  laboratory tests, and other study procedures.

          -  Prior bisphosphonate or denosumab treatment in the year before inclusion. E2. Imminent
             or ongoing nerve or spinal compression as per the investigator's judgement.

          -  Initiation of first-line therapy (patients with BM at time of metastases diagnosis
             will initially benefit from the angiogenesis targeted agents used and are not at
             higher risk).

          -  Anticancer treatment under investigation.

          -  Paraneoplastic hypercalcemia (corrected total calcium &gt; 2.7 mmol/L).

          -  Grade 4 toxicity under previous targeted agents.

          -  Liver failure (AST and/or ALT ≥ 5.0 x upper limit of normal (ULN) or total bilirubin
             beyond normal limits).

          -  Severe hypocalcaemia &gt; 2.8 mmol/l.

          -  Fructose intolerance.

          -  Invasive dental procedure (i.e. tooth extraction, dental implants, oral surgery)
             within the 10 days prior to randomization or required dental procedures at the
             pre-inclusion dental examination.

          -  Psychological, familial, sociological, geographical conditions that would limit
             compliance with study protocol requirements.

          -  Pregnant or breastfeeding woman. Females of child-bearing potential must have a
             negative serum pregnancy test within 7 days prior inclusion.

          -  Life expectancy ≤ 3 months.

          -  Participation to another clinical trial that might interfere with the evaluation of
             the main criterion.

          -  Known hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients of
             bisphosphonate or denosumab.
