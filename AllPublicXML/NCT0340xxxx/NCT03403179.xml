  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Bipolar Disorder is a major mood disorder with periodic mood episodes that may be very
      distressing, both to the individual and to others. When ill, the person is at particular risk
      for disruptions to social and occupational functioning, physical health, and even premature
      death. When not in an episode, individuals with BD may still be feeling well but have ongoing
      neurobiological processes, as well as the psychological sequelae from illness episodes, that
      can lead to subtle neurocognitive impairment that impedes overall functioning. This study is
      a test of an existing, published intervention that ameliorates deficits in functioning in
      euthymic bipolar individuals.

    <intervention_model_description>This study is a single center, open-label, outpatient clinical trial with no randomization or blinding. The Barcelona Functional Remediation for Bipolar Disorder (FR) Program will be tested over a 21-week period using 30 participants split into two equal cohorts. The study will evaluate the feasibility and preliminary efficacy of the intervention.</intervention_model_description>

    <description>The Functioning Assessment Short Test (FAST) is an interviewer-administered scale for disability due to psychiatric illness, used both pre-and post-completion. The instrument has 24 items capturing 6 domains of functioning: (1) Autonomy (2) Occupational Functioning (3) Cognitive Functioning (4) Financial Issues (5) Relationships (6) Leisure Time. Scores above 11 identify at least mild functional impairment. Impact of the intervention on change in FAST score will be examined.</description>

    <description>Functional Remediation: The functional remediation program consists of 21 weekly sessions, each lasting 90 min. This intervention addresses neurocognitive issues such as attention, memory and executive functions, but it focuses even more on enhancing functioning in daily routine. The content of the intervention is based on ecological tasks to be performed in two settings, in the clinic as well as at home. Participants will be trained with exercises for memory, attention, problem solving and reasoning, multitasking and organization in order to improve their functional outcome. Most of the techniques are based on paper-and-pencil tasks and group activities.</description>

             (according to CANMAT treatment guidelines) for at least 3 months prior to screening,
             with ability to continue that dose during the study.
