  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-site exploratory study aiming to demonstrate the effect of a fresh fermented
      dairy drink containing a probiotic strain on stress-related intestinal hyperpermeability in
      students defending a bachelor's or master's thesis in front of a jury at the University of
      Leuven (Belgium).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study is conceived as a single-site exploratory study with a randomized, controlled,
      parallel group design. There will be a double blind with 2 intervention arms (Test product
      with probiotic and acidified milk Control) plus an extra open label arm without intervention
      in a 2:2:1 ratio. The goal of the open-label arm is to confirm our previous data on the
      effect of stress on small intestinal permeability (see reference), without powering the study
      to detect a significant difference within this open-label arm. The participants and the
      investigators are blinded to the allocation to the probiotic vs. acidified milk control arm.
      However, there is no blinding in the arm without intervention.

      In vivo intestinal permeability and salivary markers of psychological stress and activation
      of the autonomous nervous system will be measured and questionnaires will be completed at 4
      different test days: baseline (V2), two weeks after randomization (V3), during an oral
      defense of a master's or bachelor's thesis (V4) and finally after pretreatment with
      Indomethacin (V5).

      The 5 study visits are organized around the thesis defence (D0):

      V1 (screening + inclusion) takes place within 2 to 3 weeks prior to the randomization.

      V2 (baseline + randomization) will take place between D-35 to D-27. V3 (randomization + 2
      weeks) will take place at D-14 +/-1day. V4 (thesis defense) is D0 and organized by the
      University. V5 (Indomethacin) will take place at D+14 +/-1day.

      For subjects in the intervention arm (Test product with probiotic and acidified milk
      Control), products will be supplied (for 1 week). In addition, alternate product supply will
      take place at D-21, D-7 and D+7 (each one +/-1day).
