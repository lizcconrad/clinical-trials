  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Preterm labor is the first cause of hospitalization during the pregnancy, and at the origin
      of more than 60 000 births before 37 weeks of amenorrhea every year in France. It is however
      difficult to predict if a patient consulting in emergencies with symptoms of preterm labor,
      will give birth prematurely or not. Current diagnostic tools to identify patients with high
      risk of premature delivery in 7 days are insufficient because of their low positive
      predictive value. Yet the neonatal complications in case of premature delivery are important,
      with respiratory distress syndrome, hyaline membrane disease, necrotizing enterocolitis,
      intraventricular hemorrhage and post-natal death. Recent studies suggested that the detection
      of the placental alpha microglobulin 1 (PAMG-1) in the vaginal secretions, by Partosure® test
      at the women presenting symptoms of preterm labor with intact membranes would indicate that a
      premature spontaneous delivery could arise in 7 days with a good positive predictive
      value.The test is interesting all the more as the repetition of the prenatal cures of
      corticosteroids, aiming at the fetal lung maturation, is this day more recommended and as the
      beneficial effect takes place within 24 hours in 7 days following their administration. It
      seems thus essential to make studies to specify the interest of this test at the patients
      presenting a preterm labor. This study aims at estimating the diagnostic performance of the
      test of detection of PAMG-1 in the prediction of a delivery in 7 days, at the patients
      presenting symptoms of preterm labor.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Preterm labor is the first cause of hospitalization during the pregnancy and complicates of a
      premature delivery in about 30 % of the cases during single pregnancy. It is about a clinical
      situation arising between 22 and 36 amenorrhea weeks (SA) + 6 days, which are observed the
      cervical modifications and the uterine contractions confirmed by an ultrasound measure with
      cervical length ≤25mm.The main complication of the threat premature delivery (MAP) is the
      premature birth, which is an essential factor of perinatal morbidity and is the second cause
      of death before the age of 5 years. The measure of cervical length with ultrasound and the
      detection of the fetal fibronectin were estimated to identify the patients with risk of
      spontaneous premature delivery, however their capacity to discriminate these patients is
      insufficient (predictive value is positive of 20 %). It thus seems necessary to find a
      diagnostic alternative more relevant.The prenatal corticosteroid therapy is recommended for
      all the patients at risk of premature delivery in 7 days between 24 and 34 SA. Indeed the
      maximal profit of corticoids arises when the delivery occurs between 12 hours and 7 days
      following their administration, with a significant reduction in neonatal period the hyaline
      membrane diseases (50 %), intraventricular hemorrhage, necrotizing enterocolitis and deaths
      (40 %). Thus corticosteroids establishes the most important treatment in the
      prematurity.However, the beneficial effect of the corticosteroid therapy decreases if the
      birth arises beyond 7 days after the administration. So the efficiency of a complete cure of
      corticoids in the prevention of the neonatal respiratory morbidity is in connection with
      deadline between the administration and the delivery. The challenge consists in administering
      the cure of corticoids in 7 days preceding the birth to benefit from the maximal neonatal
      profit. Besides, the repetition of the cures of corticoids could be responsible for noxious
      effects on the future of the future adult by distorting the growth of the child and its
      cognitive future, by increasing the risk of obesity or insulin resistance, as well as the
      cardiovascular risk in the adulthood.The capacity to discriminate between the patients who
      are going to give birth prematurely in 7 days so answers a double objective: allow the
      implementation of an effective and beneficial preventive treatment for the newborn child and
      avoid treatments and inconvenient hospitalizations, generators of unwanted effects and
      useless spending.A recent study estimates the interest of an interesting molecule, the
      placental alpha microglobulin 1 (PAMG-1), in this diagnostic approach. She concludes that the
      detection of PAMG-1 by a vaginal taking is the best test to predict spontaneous delivery in 7
      days compared with the measure of the cervical length by transvaginal ultrasound and the test
      of fetal fibronectin. If the performance of the test is validated by the study, the coverage
      of the patients would be optimized with less frequent and less long hospitalizations, as well
      as a decrease of treatments pointlessly prescribed at the patients not giving birth finally
      prematurely (tocolytics, corticoids). For those giving birth prematurely, corticoids could be
      administered for an optimal deadline to obtain the maximal profit for the newborn child.

    <description>To perform the analysis, a sample of cervicovaginal secretions is collected using a vaginal swab provided in the PAMG-1 Detection Test Kit.After removing the swab from its packaging, hold the swab in the middle of the stem and carefully insert the end of the swab into the vagina over a length of 5-7cm (using a speculum). Is not necessary for sampling), when the patient is lying down.Remove the swab from the vagina after 30 seconds. Once the swab has been removed, immediately place the end in the solvent vial provided for this purpose, then rinse the swab by repeating several rotations for 30 seconds. The strip is removed as soon as two bands are clearly visible in the test area, or after 5 minutes.Two bands in the test area indicate a positive result, while a line in the test area indicates a negative result. It is not recommended to read or interpret results beyond 10 minutes of immersion.</description>
