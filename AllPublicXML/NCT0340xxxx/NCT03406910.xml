  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a longitudinal study that will collect demographic, anthropometric and dietary data
      to determine the relationships between meat and egg intake and the incidence of Type 2
      Diabetes.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Subjects of the Adventist Health Study who are non-diabetic will provide demographic,
      anthropometric and dietary data at baseline. Meat and egg intake will be assessed with a
      validated quantitative food frequency intake questionnaire. The relationship between meat and
      egg intake and the incidence of Type 2 Diabetes will be determined using
      multivariate-adjusted logistic regression.

        The AHS-2 is a prospective cohort of &gt;96,000 Seventh-day Adventist adults recruited from
        the USA and Canada between February 2002 and May 2007. Designed primarily to examine
        associations between diet and health outcomes, the study is composed of approximately 65%
        females and 27% blacks. Recruitment and data collection methods for the parent cohort have
        been described previously. The cohort is composed of participants with different dietary
        patterns and a wide variation in egg and meat intake ranging from non-consumption to daily
        consumption. Approval for the AHS-2 study was obtained from the Loma Linda University Human
        Subjects Committee Institutional Review Board and written informed consent was acquired
        from all AHS-2 participants upon enrollment.
