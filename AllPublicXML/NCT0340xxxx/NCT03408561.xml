    <textblock>
      This pilot clinical trial studies how well social media listening works in improving clinical
      trial recruitment in patients with cancer. Social media listening and recruitment on Twitter
      may enhance enrollment for cancer-related clinical trials.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Examine the feasibility (acceptance among University of Southern California [USC] Norris
      study team members and Twitter users in Los Angeles [LA] county) of targeted social media
      listening (SML) via Twitter as a tool for enhancing recruitment to cancer trials.

      II. Gain preliminary data on the impact (i.e., numbers recruited versus projected accrual
      compared to historic recruitment) of targeted social media listening (SML) as a tool for
      enhancing recruitment to cancer trials among Twitter users in LA county.

      III. Estimate the effect size of the number of people enrolled associated with the use of
      targeted social media listening (SML) via Twitter as a tool for enhancing recruitment to
      cancer trials.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients who mention specific cancer disease keywords and/or hashtags are identified and
      receive a message via Twitter. Patients are then contacted for recruitment into a clinical
      trial.

    <measure>Accrual rate</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 14 months</time_frame>
    <description>To be determined by comparing monthly actual versus (vs.) projected rate of recruitment for the trial disease groups (i.e., non-small cell lung cancer, colon cancer, breast cancer, prostate cancer, kidney cancer, lymphoma) using generalized estimating equations, accounting for intra-disease random effects and trends across the 12 months (9 months exposure per trial). These results will then be put into context of the historic recruitment for these diseases at the center.</description>
