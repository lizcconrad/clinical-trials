    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the safety and efficacy of brodalumab in the treatment of
      moderate-to-severe psoriasis in patients who have previously failed treatment with
      interleukin (IL)-17A therapies. Forty patients will be enrolled in this 16-week open-label
      study. Patients will receive 210 mg of brodalumab subcutaneous injection at weeks 0, 1, and
      2, followed by 210 mg every 2 weeks. The primary efficacy endpoint will be the proportion of
      patients achieving a score of &quot;0-clear&quot; or &quot;1-almost clear&quot; in the sPGA score after 16 weeks
      of treatment. After completion of the 16-week trial, patients may desire to continue
      treatment with brodalumab.

      This study will evaluate the safety and efficacy of brodalumab in the treatment of
      moderate-to-severe psoriasis in patients who have previously failed treatment with
      interleukin (IL)-17A therapies. Failure of IL-17A therapy will be defined as previous
      treatment with either secukinumab or ixekizumab for at least 3 months without achieving
      PASI-75 response or a 50% loss of original improvement. Forty patients will be enrolled in
      this 16-week open-label study. Patients will be enrolled at three to four different sites in
      the US. After enrollment, study visits will occur at monthly intervals, with patients
      receiving 210 mg of brodalumab subcutaneous injection at weeks 0, 1, and 2, followed by 210
      mg every 2 weeks. At each visit, patients will be evaluated for change in sPGA (Physician's
      Global Assessment), PASI score, and any signs or symptoms of adverse events. Laboratory
      screening will include tests for tuberculosis and neutropenia. After completion of the
      16-week trial, patients may desire to continue treatment with brodalumab. Efforts will be
      made to provide drug to these study patients, including those who do not have insurance.

      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Male or female subject at least 18 years of age

          -  Subject is able to provide written informed consent and comply with the requirements
             of this study protocol.

          -  Have both a sPGA score of ≥3 and BSA ≥ 5% prior to randomization.

          -  Subjects who are women of childbearing potential must have a negative urine pregnancy
             test at screening and must be practicing an adequate, medically acceptable method of
             birth control for at least 30 days before Day 0 and at least 6 months after the last
             study drug administration. Acceptable methods of birth control include intrauterine
             device (IUD); oral, transdermal, implanted or injected hormonal contraceptives (must
             have been initiated at least 1 month before entering the study); tubal ligation;
             abstinence and barrier methods with spermicide. Otherwise, if not of childbearing
             potential, subjects must: have a sterile or vasectomized partner; have had a
             hysterectomy, a bilateral oophorectomy or be clinically diagnosed infertile; or be in
             a menopausal state for at least a year.

          -  Tuberculin purified protein derivative (PPD) or QuantiFERON TB-Gold test (QFT)
             negative at the time of screening, or if patient has a history of positive PPD or
             QuantiFERON, he/she has initiated or completed the appropriate prophylaxis.

          -  Subject is judged to be in good general health as determined by the principal
             investigator based upon the results of medical history and laboratory profile.

          -  Subject has previously failed treatment with an IL-17A agent, secukinumab or
             ixekizumab, (where available, defined as previous treatment with either drug for at
             least 3 months without achieving PASI-75 response or a 50% loss of original
             improvement).

          -  Last administration of secukinumab or ixekizumab ≥ 28 days prior to Baseline.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Have predominantly pustular, erythrodermic, and/or guttate forms of psoriasis.

             indeterminate PPD or QFT test may participate in the study if a full tuberculosis work
             up (according to local practice/guidelines) is completed within 12 weeks prior to
             randomization and establishes conclusively that the subject has no evidence of active
             tuberculosis. If presence of latent tuberculosis is established, then treatment must
             have been initiated at least for 4 weeks prior to randomization and the course of
             prophylaxis is planned to be completed.
