      This study will determine the effectiveness of a free before-school physical activity
      program, BOKS (Build Our Kids' Success), in increasing objectively measured physical activity
      levels among children in elementary and middle school in 7 schools in Massachusetts. The
      study focuses on capturing valid and objective assessments of student-level physical activity
      during BOKS program time and assessing the impact of the BOKS program on overall daily
      physical activity levels using minute-by-minute physical activity level data among elementary
      aged students. Data is also collected to understand how increasing physical activity may
      impact students' sleep.

    <description>BOKS is a before school physical activity program offered at no cost to participating families that focuses on engaging elementary and middle school students in physical activity, skill development and brief nutrition education sessions that prepare them for a day of learning. The BOKS curriculum includes 12 weeks of instruction and 40 minutes of structured kid-friendly activities that include warm-ups, skill of the week, running, relay and obstacle course activities and nutritional tips. The BOKS team provides training for BOKS leaders free of charge each month. BOKS is currently being used in more than 1,800 schools in the US and Canada.</description>
