  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Among the well-known factors that contribute to the development of obesity, childbearing has
      been reported as an important influential factor. Physical activity is strongly recommended
      as one of the main tools to reduce any excessive weight gain during pregnancy and also to
      reduce weight retention in the postpartum period. During the postpartum period, exercise
      training coupled with a well-balanced nutritional plan, offers an effective intervention to
      help mothers lose weight safely. International guidelines for physical activity after
      pregnancy include strengthening routines. Worth noting, most of the above cited studies
      focused on the benefits of aerobic activities. Strength training interventions are virtually
      unexplored in postpartum women despite its potential benefits. Compared to the pregnancy
      period, postpartum barriers to physical activity seem to focus less on health-related
      barriers. In postpartum, time limitations for childcare become a more common barrier. For
      this reason, a postpartum exercise program that incorporates the babies in a specific
      exercise session has a better chance to succeed. The aim of this project is to determine the
      benefits of strength training in a group class setting in postpartum healthy women with their
      babies. Whereas mother's participation in regular physical activity may encourage regular
      physical activity habits in her offspring, a second aim of this project is to also quantify
      the infant's physical activity. The main measured outcomes are: maternal muscular strength;
      body composition; aerobic capacity; exercise self efficacy; depressive symptoms; physical
      activity level and food habits and baby's physical activity level.

      Research Questions:

      Maternal:

      Is a strength training group class (with babies) in postpartum women associated with (I)
      strength and lean body mass improvement, (II) improvement aerobic capacity, (III) more
      spontaneous physical activity, (IV) better self efficacy and (V) better mood?

      Baby:

      Does maternal lifestyle affect the baby's (0-12 months) physical activity level?

      Hypothesis:

      It is hypothesized that women who complete the 10 week exercise program will have improved
      strength from pre-intervention to post intervention. It is also hypothesized that women who
      are adherent to the exercise program will have more active babies.

      Methods:

      Participants train 60 min per session for 10 weeks on non consecutive days (Tues and Thurs).
      All training sessions will be supervised by a qualified exercise instructor (graduate in
      kinesiology) to ensure proper technique and to minimize the risk of injury. Each training
      session will include a warm up phase of 5 minutes of dynamic and static stretching and a cool
      down phase consisting of 5 minutes of static stretching. The strength training protocol is
      based on the American College of Sports Medicine (ACSM) guidelines. Whole-body exercises and
      different equipment such as weights, elastic bands and balls will be used. Babies will also
      be included in the exercise routine. Participants will perform 1-3 sets per exercise, 8-12
      repetitions per set and a 90-s rest interval between sets. The principle of progressive
      overload will follow a linear increase as described in ACSM position stand.

      All participants will be tested at time points t0 , t1 ( after 5 weeks) and t2 (after 10
      weeks; at the and of the study) on: i) strength and body composition; ii) aerobic capacity;
      iii) objective and subjective physical activity level; vi) exercise self efficacy; v)
      depressive symptoms and vi) dietary habits.

      I. Strength/Body composition assessment At each time point, strength will be assessed for the
      upper body (push-ups), lower body (squats), and trunk (abdominal curl-up test). The
      participants will perform push-ups (as many as possible using a fixed pattern of 40 beats per
      minute - time and number will be recorded up to a maximum of 1 minute). This will be repeated
      for the number of lower body squat position performed (as many squats as possible using a
      fixed pattern of 40 beats per minute -time and number will be recorded up to a maximum of 1
      minute); these methods have been chosen to reduce the likelihood of any adverse events. The
      participant will also complete the ACSM-recommended partial curl-up test to assess abdominal
      strength and endurance. Briefly, as many abdominal curl-ups as possible has to be performed
      until the participant either stops, or cannot stay in rhythm with a fixed cadence (40
      beats/min) up to 1 minute as per ACSM guidelines.

      Body composition assessment will include body mass, height, BMI and body fat (sum of five
      skinfolds: triceps, biceps, subscapular, suprailiac, thigh) measures.

      II. Aerobic capacity Briefly, participants perform a 5- min. bout of exercise, stepping up
      and down from a standard step (height 30 cm) following a specific cadence. During the step
      test, heart rate (HR) is measured continuously using a heart-rate monitor. Then, VO2max is
      estimated based on HR and a target exercise intensity (estimated VO2).

      III. Physical activity assessment At each time point, participants will to complete two self-
      reported questionnaires regarding physical activity level, the International Physical
      Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ; and the Physical Activity Readiness Questionnaire (PAR-Q+).The
      IPAQ asks participants to recall their levels of physical activity within five domains
      (leisure, work, transportation, household, recreation) and three intensity categories over a
      7-day recall period. The PAR-Q+ determines if it is safe to start an exercise program.
      Additionally, at t0, t1 and t2 each participant will complete an individual physical activity
      diary for 7 days. Moreover, during this period participants will continuously wear a
      pedometer .

      IV. Exercise self efficacy Exercise self-efficacy will be measured at each time point (t0,t1
      and t2). This survey includes five separate items targeting self-efficacy.

      V. Depressive symptoms Levels of postpartum mood will be assessed through the Edinburgh
      Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS).

      VI. Eating Habits Mother's eating habits will be measured through the Short-Form Frequency
      Questionnaire (SFFFQ).

      VII. Breastfeeding habits will be measured through a Breastfeeding and Infant Feeding
      Questionnaire.

      Baby At each time point, a Rothbart Infant Behavior Questionnaire- Revised (IBQ-R) will be
      completed by the participants to measure temperament and gross motor activity in infants
      between the ages of 3 and 12 months.

      This study will take place at the Canadian Centre for Activity and Aging gymnasium on Tuesday
      and Thursday afternoons (time to be determined). Women who contact us will be asked when
      their baby was born. Those women whose babies are less than 20 weeks of age will be placed in
      Group A and those women whose babies are older than 20 weeks will be placed in Group B. These
      groups were divided by baby age because early postpartum women and babies are a different
      group than those women with babies 6 months and older.

    <time_frame>10 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Women will complete only the activity component of the Rothbart Infant Behavior Questionnaire- Revised (IBQ-R) that contains 15 items to assess infant gross motor activity at baseline, after 5 weeks and at 10 weeks at the end of the intervention. Each question is answered using a 7 point scale (indicating activity over the last 7 days). The scare ranges from 1 - &quot;never&quot;, 2 - &quot;very rarely&quot;, 3 - &quot;&lt; half the time&quot;, 4 - &quot;about half the time&quot;, 5 - &quot;&gt; half the time&quot;, 6 - &quot;almost always&quot;, 7 - &quot;always&quot;. The score for the 15 questions is totaled. The higher the score, the more active the infant in gross motor activity. A perfect score is 105 and at each time point the total activity scores will be compared.</description>
