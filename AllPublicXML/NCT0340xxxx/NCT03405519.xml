  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Radiotherapy to the breast and lymph nodes is routinely planned using CT scans. The
      introduction of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has the potential to better visualise the
      lymph nodes and so define a smaller treatment area or 'target'. This means that the dose
      delivered to the target could be increased without increasing the dose to normal tissues. The
      MIRABELLE study is designed to test if this is possible by recruiting patients diagnosed with
      breast cancer including lymph node disease. The investigators will ask participants to have a
      CT scan and an MRI scan before they have radiotherapy. The investigators will then plan
      radiotherapy using both these scans and compare the possible dose delivered to the lymph
      nodes using the MRI and CT defined lymph nodes. This will not affect the patient's future
      treatment.

      MR imaging has the potential to improve both the localisation of pan-LN treatments and the
      subsequent treatment delivery using MR-linac technology. The MIRABELLE study will apply the
      MR sequences developed in LN-negative volunteers/patients to the context of node-positive
      breast cancer patients with the aim of reducing the delineated nodal volume thereby
      facilitating dose-escalation to involved LNs. The benefit of using MRI for LN localisation as
      compared to conventional CT imaging will be investigated by determining whether a higher dose
      can be delivered using MRI- as compared to CT-based delineation. Any increase in dose will be
      deemed a success as this has potential to improve tumour control. In addition, inter-observer
      errors in outlining will be explored to investigate whether these are reduced using MRI.
      Reduced inter-observer errors would result in smaller margins for error such that less normal
      tissue could be irradiated.

    <description>MR images are acquired with patient in a position as close as possible to the radiotherapy CT planning position. Images are acquired in a radiotherapy CT scanner with patient in a position replicating that achieved in the MRI scanner. The images are imported into a treatment planning system and consensus lymph node volume agreed between an expert radiation oncologist and MR radiologist. All pan-LN will be delineated on co-registered MRI sequences and on CT (using ESTRO guidelines) by 7 observers.</description>
