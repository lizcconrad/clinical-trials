      the efficacy and safety ofhe use of regorafenib in combination with nivolumab
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The present trial consists of a dose-escalation cohort to verify the tolerability of
      nivolumab and regorafenib when used in combination for patients with solid tumors, and to
      examine the clinical recommended dose(RD). The trial also consists of an expansion cohort to
      examine the safety and efficacy when the clinical RD is administered for several advanced
      solid tumors.

      In the dose-escalation cohort, three patients with solid tumors will be administered 3.0
      mg/kg of nivolumab once every 2 weeks and regorafenib daily for 21days, with a 1-week washout
      period at dose of 80 mg (level 1), 120 mg (level 2), or 160 mg (level 3). As a general rule,
      one cycle will last 28 days (day 1-29); however, in the event of treatment prolongation, the
      cycle period will be extended. The Dose Limiting Toxicity(DLT) evaluation period will be 28
      days. Furthermore, for each level, three additional subjects will be added depending on the
      state of DLT.

      In the expansion cohort, the target subject sample will consist of approximately 30 patients
      who will be administered 3.0 mg/kg of nivolumab once every 2 weeks, and the clinical RD of
      regorafenib will be determined in the dose-escalation cohort.
