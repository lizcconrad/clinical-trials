      A total of 40 major depressive disorder (MDD) subjects between the ages of 18-65 who have
      current major depressive disorder diagnosed by DSM-5 will be recruited, Subjects will be
      accepted into the protocol after an opportunity to review and provide voluntary written
      informed consent and completion of a comprehensive medical and psychiatric history, physical
      examination, mental status examination, and routine laboratory assessments The subjects will
      accept the drug treatment twice daily orally for 6 weeks, During the treatment follow up will
      occur at 8±1 days after treatment, 15±1 days after treatment, 29±2 days after treatment ,43±2
      days after treatment to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the drug.
