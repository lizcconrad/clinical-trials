  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this data registry is to prospectively collect data from patients referred to
      an Complex Chronic Diseases Program (CCDP) at BC Women's Hospital + Health Centre to assess
      the quality of life of the CCDP Patients before, during and after their care at the CCDP.

      1. Before their initial intake appointment, all CCDP patients are given a patient binder
           that includes the baseline Standardized Questionnaires. These are clinical
           questionnaires that all patients complete regardless of whether or not they consent to
           participation in research. In addition to the questionnaires completed at baseline,
           patients who consent to participate in the data registry will complete the
           questionnaires, via email or paper copy, at the following time points: approximately 6
           months after intake, at discharge and 3 months post-discharge.

        2. Patients who consent to the data registry will also be asked to complete a short
           questionnaire collecting basic demographic information at baseline. The demographic
           questionnaire will be either mailed to their home or sent via an online link; the
           investigators will ask participants to complete this form either before or when they
           come in for their first in-person visit at the CCDP.

        3. Additional data will be collected and entered from the clinical chart. Specifically,
           after the patient's initial clinic appointment, the Research Coordinator or designate
           will enter data points from the Interdisciplinary Assessment Tool, into REDCap.

        Patients of the Complex Chronic Diseases Program at BC Women's Hospital + Health Centre all
        have signs, symptoms or a diagnosis of: Fibromyalgia (FM), Chronic Fatigue Syndrome/Myalgic
        Encephalomyelitis (ME/CFS), and/or Chronic Lyme-Like Syndrome (CLLS).

        The factors involved in causing all three of these diseases are not well understood (Jain
        et al. 2003, Wolfe et al. 2010, Carruthers et al. 2003). Furthermore, symptoms, severity of
        symptoms and the effects of all of these complex chronic diseases can vary greatly among
        people with the same diagnosis.

        All of these conditions are currently diagnosed according to the particular group of
        symptoms described by the patient.
