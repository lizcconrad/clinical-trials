    <textblock>
      This trial studies how well celecoxib, recombinant interferon alfa-2b, and rintatolimod work
      in treating patients with colorectal cancer that as spread to the liver. Celecoxib may stop
      the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Recombinant
      interferon alfa-2b is a substance that can improve the body's natural response and may
      interfere with the growth of tumor cells. Rintatolimod may stimulate the immune system.
      Giving celecoxib, recombinant interferon alfa-2b, and rintatolimod may work better at
      treating colorectal cancer that has spread to the liver.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the impact of a chemokine-modulatory regimen on the immune microenvironment
      of colorectal liver metastases, specifically the changes in the ratio between cytotoxic
      T-lymphocyte (CTL) marker (CD8a gene expression) to regulatory T cell (Treg) markers (FoxP3
      gene expression).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Estimate the objective response rate of a chemokine-modulatory regimen in metastatic
      colorectal cancer (per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors [RECIST] 1.1).

      II. Examine the safety and tolerability profile of the combination of recombinant interferon
      alfa-2b (interferon alpha-2b), rintatolimod, and celecoxib when given as chemokine modulation
      to colorectal cancer patients prior to surgical resection using the Cancer Therapy Evaluation
      Program (CTEP) National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events
      (CTCAE version 4.0).

      III. Estimate the median progression free survival of a chemokine-modulatory regimen in
      metastatic colorectal cancer.

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Comparison (using Taqman, immunofluorescence [IF] and immunohistochemistry [IHC] on serial
      sections) of the metastatic tissue specimen with regard to total numbers of infiltrating T
      cells, their CD4/CD8 ratios, frequencies of FoxP3 cells, and the expression of chemokine
      receptors on CD4+ and CD8+ T cells (CXCR3, CCR5, CCR4, CCR6, and CXCR4).

      II. Evaluate the local expression of effector T cells (Teff)-attracting chemokines (CCR5,
      CXCL9, CXCL10 and CXCL11) and Treg-favoring chemokines (CCL22 and CXCL12) using IF and
      Taqman.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive celecoxib orally (PO) twice daily (BID), recombinant interferon alfa-2b
      intravenously (IV) over 20 minutes, and rintatolimod IV on days 1-3. Treatment repeats every
      21 days for up to 3 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for up to 12
      months.
