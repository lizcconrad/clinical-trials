  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to assess the impact of a mental health training program in
      volunteer and career firefighters.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      THE PROBLEM: Firefighters are frequently exposed to distressing events, or critical incidents
      such as motor vehicle accidents, burnt bodies, failed rescue attempts, threats to one's own
      life, and completed suicides that can trigger posttraumatic stress reactions. Previous
      research show that first responders and other public safety personnel report frequent
      exposure to traumatic events and are at increased risk for mental health illnesses.

      THE STUDY OBJECTIVE: To assess the impact of a mental health training program in volunteer
      and career firefighters.

      THE STUDY SAMPLE: 240 firefighters (volunteer or career) in Prince Edward Island

      INTERVENTION: Vancouver Fire &amp; Rescue Services and the Canadian Mental Health
      Association-Vancouver Fraser co-developed a new program called, &quot;Resilient Minds-Building the
      Psychological Health of Fire Fighters.&quot; The Resilient Minds training will educate
      firefighters about the effects of trauma, how to recognize signs of mental health illness and
      how to access support after critical events. It also trains firefighters to recognize mental
      health and addictions in co-workers and how to facilitate their help-seeking.

      OUTCOMES: The impact of the program will be assessed by pre- and post-program surveys and a
      3-month follow-up survey.
