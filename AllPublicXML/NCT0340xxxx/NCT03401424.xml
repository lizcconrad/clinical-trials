      The purpose of the studyï¼š length of operation time, postoperative intestinal function
      recovery time as the main index, application prospective clinical study to observe the
      differences were followed by two different laparoscopic biliary intestinal kiss the
      short-term and long-term effect of the treatment of congenital cystic dilatation of the bile
      duct, provide a higher level of evidence based medicine dilatation of patients for congenital
      bile duct cysts. The choice of second is based on the study, effective, objective evaluation
      of different laparoscopic biliary enteric reconstruction for the treatment of congenital
      cystic dilatation of the bile duct is feasible, clear surgical indications, contraindications
      and summarized the technical points, establish guidelines for clinical diagnosis and
      treatment of congenital cystic dilation of the bile duct disease.
