  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomised trial in which healthy volunteers, men and women aged 50-75 years from
      the general community are randomized into one of three arms: participants will be provided
      with 50 gm extra virgin coconut oil, or 50 grams butter or 50 extra virgin olive oil to be
      eaten daily for a month. The food will be provided in the form of processed cheese to mask
      participants. The key outcome is blood low density lipoprotein cholesterol concentrations and
      secondary outcomes blood lipid profile (total cholesterol, high density lipoprotein
      cholesterol, triglycerides) and anthropometric measures: weight and waist circumference. This
      trial is powered to detect a difference of 0.5 mmol/L LDL-cholesterol difference between the
      trial arms.

    <textblock>
      This is a randomized trial in which healthy volunteers from the general community are
      randomized into one of three arms: consumption of 50 gm of extra virgin coconut oil daily OR
      50gm of butter daily OR 50gm of extra virgin olive oil daily (50gm is about 2 ounces, or 2
      table spoons), to be consumed over a one month period. The food will be provided in the form
      of processed cheese to mask participants.

      After full informed consent, participants will attend an assessment visit and have a baseline
      measures of weight, height, waist circumference, blood pressure, a blood sample for
      assessment of blood lipids and other metabolic markers, and fill in a health questionnaire
      and dietary questionnaire. Participants will be randomly allocated to one of three arms:
      coconut oil, butter or olive oil and will be given supplies of these

      After one month, participants will return for follow up assessment which will include a
      repeat blood sample, anthropometric measures and blood pressure, and questionnaire.

      Blood samples collected by venipuncture will be stored at the University of Reading.

      At the end of the study, all participants will be given the individual participant results of
      the anthropometric measures and lipid profiles at baseline and follow up as well as the
      overall findings of the trial.
