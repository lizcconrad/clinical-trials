    <textblock>
      This is a Phase I, open label, dose escalation study designed to evaluate the
      pharmacokinetics, safety, and tolerability of single intramuscular injections of Letrozole
      ISM® at different strengths in voluntary healthy post menopausal women
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to assess the pharmacokinetic profile of a single ascending
      doses of Letrozole ISM® (Rovi), and secondly, to evaluate safety and tolerability of single
      ascending doses of Letrozole ISM, measure estrogen levels, and characterize oral letrozole
      pharmacokinetic profile to be used in subsequent comparison to Letrozole ISM.

      The study will be carried out in healthy post-menopausal women who satisfy inclusion and
      exclusion criteria. The study design includes a screening period and 2 treatment periods.
      Treatment Period 1 will comprise of 14 oral dose administrations of 2.5 mg Femara®. Treatment
      Period 2 will comprise of a single IM dose of 50, 100, 200 and 400 mg Letrozole ISM®. The
      total planned study duration is 50 weeks.

          2. Post-menopausal subjects should have absence of menses for 1 year, and oophorectomized
             subjects should have absence of menses for at least 6 weeks. For oophorectomized
             subjects and subjects who have had a hysterectomy, a surgical pathology report
             documenting the absence of malignant disease is required. In addition, for
             oophorectomized subjects an operative report documenting bilateral oophorectomy is
             required.

          3. Baseline follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and 17β-estradiol plasma levels should be
             consistent with the post-menopausal status of the subject (FSH ≥ 40 mIU/mL;

             test within the last 6 months (documentation required) must be willing to have one
             performed.

             prior to Screening.

          4. Subjects who have regularly taken foods or food supplements that contain high levels
             of Isoflavinoids, including soybean, soymilk, soynuts, chickpeas, alfalfa, fava beans,
             kudzu, miso and tofu in the 14 days prior to dosing (Treatment Period 1).

             4.1. The investigator and medical monitor will determine on a case-by-case basis if a

          6. Any prescribed preparations within 14 days prior to dosing (Treatment Period 1),
             unless in the opinion of the investigator (or designee) the medication will not
             interfere with the study procedures or compromise safety.

          7. Any non-prescribed systemic or topical medications within 7 days of dosing (Treatment
             Period 1) unless in the opinion of the investigator (or designee) the medication will

             screening DEXA for this study with a T score &lt; -2.5). Subjects with osteopenia (with
             the T-score between -1 and -2.5) will be allowed to participate in this study.

             8.1. Subjects who are not on a stable dose of long- or short-acting bisphosphonates
