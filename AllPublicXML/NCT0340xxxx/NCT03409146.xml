      The study is being done to test the performance of a Novii Wireless Patch System for
      following the baby's and mother's heart rates and uterine contractions during labor. We want
      to find out if the new monitor works as well as other types of monitors that are usually
      used: Doppler Fetal Heart Rate (FHR), Scalp FHR, Tocodynamometer (TOCO) and Intra Uterine
      Pressure Catheter (IUPC).

      80 patients will be monitored during the study.

    <description>PPA(%)=(a/(a+C))x100, where &quot;a&quot; represents the number of 2 second epochs when the Novii FHR is within +/-10% of the predicate device FHR for each 2 second epoch, and &quot;c&quot; are the number of 2 second epochs when the Novii FHR is not within +/- 10% of the predicate device FHR or is absent.</description>

    <description>The 2 second output FHR data when both the predicate and Novii devices are reporting a value will be considered. In this case for each 2 second epoch the FHR value from the Novii device is divided by the predicate device FHR value to create a &quot;FHR ratio&quot;.</description>

    <description>The Sensitivity of the Novii System against the predicate device is determined from the &quot;individual contraction &quot;detection as follows: Sensitivity(%)=(x/(x+z))x100
Where:
&quot;x&quot; is the total number of &quot;individual contractions&quot; detected by both the devices &quot;z&quot; is the total number of &quot;individual contractions&quot; detected by the predicate device only</description>

    <description>The positive percentage agreement (PPA) is determined from the interpretable and uninterpretable data as follows:
PPA(%)=(a/(a+c))x100
Where:
&quot;a&quot; is the number of minutes when both devices UA are &quot;interpretable&quot; at the same time &quot;c&quot; is the number of minutes when the predicate device UA is &quot;interpretable&quot; but the Novii system UA is &quot;un-interpretable&quot;.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

        A woman will be considered for inclusion in the study if she fulfills all of the following
        criteria:

          -  She has a term or near term (≥36 completed weeks) singleton gestation in a cephalic
             presentation and has been admitted to the Labor and Delivery Unit .

          -  She is in the latent phase of spontaneous labor, or has been admitted for induction of
             labor.

          -  She has given her informed consent to participate as a subject.

          -  She has none of the exclusion criteria.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Known major fetal malformation or chromosome abnormality.

          -  Multiple gestation

          -  A condition for which cesarean will likely be carried out shortly.

          -  Subject plans not to have electronic fetal monitoring.

          -  Involvement in another clinical trial currently or previously in this pregnancy that,
             in the investigator's opinion, would affect the conduct of this study.

          -  Medical or obstetric problem that would preclude the use of abdominal electrodes
             (e.g., skin eruptions, history of sensitivity to adhesives).

          -  Parturient is under age 18.

          -  Medical or obstetric problem that in investigator's opinion would make the patient
             incapable of taking part in the study.

          -  Inability to understand the consent information due to medical illness or diminished
             intellectual capacity, or insurmountable language barrier.

          -  Potential for coercion, e.g. Medical Center employees, prisoners.
