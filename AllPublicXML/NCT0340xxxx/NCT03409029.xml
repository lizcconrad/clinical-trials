  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The standard non-surgical treatment for muscle invasive bladder cancer is concurrent
      chemo-radiotherapy. This treatment is associated with long term side effects in around a
      third of patients with up to 12% suffering from grade 3-4 toxicity.

      Effective radiotherapy depends on delivering a curative dose to the target whilst minimising
      dose to surrounding tissues to reduce toxicities. As an organ that constantly varies in shape
      and position, achieving this in bladder irradiation is challenging. Cone beam Computed
      Tomography (CBCT) has allowed visualisation of soft tissue on treatment and hence
      image-guided treatment and improved accuracy, but the image quality of CBCT is suboptimal for
      distinguishing soft tissue boundaries. On the other hand, MRI scans produce superior soft
      tissue definition and visualisation of tumour bed. This would in turn allow for various ways
      of optimising treatment and potentially improving outcome.

      There have been a number of studies evaluating pelvic organ motion in bladder cancer as well
      as assessing different adaptive radiotherapy strategies. These have included individualized
      margins, plan of the day and adaptive techniques. Most of these studies have been carried out
      using CBCT imaging which is often poor quality with limited soft tissue contrast. MRI offers
      better visualization of the tumour bed and organs at risk (OARs). As a result, the
      utilisation of MRI in radiotherapy could allow for increased radiation dose to the tumour bed
      while maintaining minimal dose to surrounding soft tissue.

      This study will explore the role of MRI imaging in adaptive radiotherapy for bladder cancer
      with development of a number of theoretical treatment strategies.

      Patients will undergo standard treatment during the study with four weeks of external beam
      radiotherapy (20 fractions). They will be treated with weekly Gemcitabine (100mg/m2) or daily
      Nicotinamide (60mg/kg)/Carbogen (2% carbon dioxide, 98% oxygen at 15 litres per minute) if
      clinically appropriate.

      As part of standard treatment patients will have a staging CT scan at diagnosis and a
      radiotherapy planning CT. Cone beam imaging will also be performed. Response will be assessed
      as standard with cystoscopy at 3 months and CT scan at 12 months.

      As part of the study patients will undergo 4 additional MRI scans. These will take place in
      the 1st, 2nd, 3rd and 4th weeks of treatment. These MRI scans will include anatomical images
      - with full and empty bladder as well as cine data (with a scan every minute for 10 minutes)
      to assess intra fraction motion. They will also include a diffusion weighted imaging (DWI)
      sequence, which will be used to assess if early prediction of response is possible. The
      frequency of cone beam imaging will be increased from 6 scans (minimum) as standard of care
      to 20 scans to allow for daily imaging.

      The 1st MRI scan will be contoured to outline the tumour bed, clinical target volumes (CTVs)
      and OARs. A variety of planning strategies will be developed including standard planning
      target volume (PTV) margins, a plan of the day (POTD) approach, a POTD+ as well as an online
      adaptation model. These models will be used to assess coverage of CTV and PTV, and the
      feasibility of increasing radiation dose to the tumour bed, as well as dose to OARs using the
      scans obtained during the radiotherapy treatment. The practicality of each approach will also
      be assessed. Inter and intra fraction organ and tumour bed motion will also be analysed in
      order to develop patient specific models.
