  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to T to compare the effectiveness of producing a pelvic floor muscle
      contraction by different verbal instruction. Pelvic floor muscle contraction will be measured
      displacement of the pelvic floor when imaged on ultrasound.

      This study will examine pelvic floor muscle contraction following different verbal
      instructions. This is a cross-sectional exploratory study. Physical-therapy students will be
      recruited to complete a survey and non-invasive transabdominal ultrasound assessment.

      A bladder filling protocol will be implemented to ensure subjects will have sufficient fluid
      in their bladders to allow clear ultrasound imaging. This protocol involved subjects
      consuming 600-750 ml of water in a 1 hr. period. The participants will be tested in a
      crook-lying supine position with a pillow under their heads for comfort.

      The participants will be divided into 2 groups randomly. Both groups will be given three
      different verbal instructions to contract pelvic floor muscles. Each contraction will be
      performed 3 time with rests of 10 sec between contractions. While the first 2 contractions
      for each verbal instruction will be held for 3 sec. the last contraction will be held as long
      as the participant can conduct and the time of contraction will be measured as well. The
      pelvic floor contraction will be measured by assessing bladder displacement via diagnostic
      ultrasound.

      To image the pelvic floor a 5 MHz curved linear array transducer (Mindray M5) will be placed
      in the transverse plane immediately suprapubically over the lower abdomen angled at 15-30
      degrees from the vertical. An on screen caliper and measurement tool will be used to measure
      bladder displacement.
