  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There is a significant and growing interest in nutrition and health in the general population
      and there is also, paradoxically, an increasing problem with obesity and general debilitating
      conditions of affluence, such as type 2 diabetes mellitus. Igelösa Life Science AB has
      developed a modified Okinawan-based Nordic Diet (OBND) diet based on evidence primarily from
      the diet of the long-lived and healthy Okinawa population. The diet includes fish and whole
      grains, with a high level of vegetables, but is low in fat. In 2016, a clinical nutrition
      study was carried out at Kristianstad University with the intention to determine if the OBND
      resulted in reductions/changes in clinical and medical markers of importance for treatment of
      diabetes mellitus and gingivitis/periodontitis. The diet had a positive impact on the
      clinical progress of otherwise debilitating conditions such as diabetes and the health
      benefits on clinical parameters was extremely rapid, that is, within two weeks. Not only did
      the patients with type 2 diabetes receive the OBND, their partners were also offered the same
      option. This is a key innovation and the participants stated that it was a great support,
      which facilitated adherence and promotes the long-term impact on health. Ingrained habits
      such as poor diet, can only be defeated by a concerted team effort and our work to date
      provides a glimpse of the potential benefits to Sweden and the rest of the developed world
      through this shared approach.

      Initial studies have shown promising effects of the OBND on both diabetes and periodontal
      conditions. The objective of this study is to compare the OBND to the current recommended
      standard diet. Assuming the study provides positive evidence of health impact due to improved
      food quality, it will also be seen that the production and delivery of such 'healthy-living'
      meals will be of commercial interest for industry. The mission is to offer an evidence-based
      natural food alternative that both prevents disease and improves the health status of
      individuals with diabetes. The long-term goal is to design efficient and effective products
      that will protect against diabetes and other chronic diseases. The combination of scientific
      credibility and commercial interests may be a key factor to transfer the new knowledge about
      healthy dieting into actual improvements in public health.

      The project has one main goal: to perform a clinical trial to compare the OBND with standard
      of care diet. The outcome of the clinical trial will be analyzed in the areas:
      medicine/odontology, sensory science, nursing, public health and health economics.

      Study objectives:

        -  To assess if the consumption of the designated diet results in added medical/dental
           health outcome for the OBND in comparison to standard of care diet. The study is a
           randomized case control clinical trial.

        -  To perform cost-effectiveness analyses comparing costs and health benefits for the test
           and control diets with focus on individuals with type 2 diabetes mellitus and otherwise
           healthy individuals living in close relationship to those with diabetes.

        -  To assess consumer acceptance of the diet: (I) acceptance of the diets (questionnaire,
           focus groups and food diary), (II) acceptability of the diet in relation to taste of the
           diet, and the prospect of adopting the diet in everyday life, and (III) sensory analysis
           of identical dishes prepared according to the OBND and the standard of care diet.

      Study design The study design is a randomized double-blinded clinical trial with four
      subgroups including 20 individuals per study group.

      Test Group A: OBND, individuals diagnosed with type 2 diabetes (T2D) with a need for insulin
      intake

      Test Group B: OBND, relatives who do not have T2D

      Control Group C: Standard of care diet, individuals diagnosed with T2D with a need for
      insulin intake

      Control Group D: Standard of care diet, relatives who do not have T2D

      Based on the above reported studies and available data on blood sugar and lipid values, the
      investigators have identified that 18 individuals in each group will provide adequate
      statistical power (alpha=0.05, beta=0.85). While lost to follow up occurs, the investigators
      will enroll 20 individuals in each group. Thus, a total of 80 study individuals (test and
      control) will be enrolled. Data analyses will be performed according to per protocol as well
      as per intent to treat. Clinical examination procedures in medicine and dentistry will follow
      principles of good clinical practice. Study group assignment will be based on a randomization
      using the SPSS statistics package. A pre-baseline examination will be performed to ensure
      that all study individuals fulfill study requirements. The investigators will monitor that
      study individuals are compliant to protocol.

      Study time schedule The study design includes a pre-baseline study examination two weeks
      before study start to ensure that study individuals meet the criteria for study participation
      and to control for Hawthorne effects. Study individuals will be enrolled in groups of 8 to 10
      individuals and re-examined at baseline. The primary study endpoint is the third examination
      will be performed 4 weeks after baseline examination. A follow-up examination will occur
      after 6 months (plus/minus 14 days). All study enrollments will be completed within one
      month. Study individuals will receive phone calls during the study period to encourage
      compliance and respond to specific questions.
