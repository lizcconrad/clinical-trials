  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) leads to weight reduction but has also some unwanted side
      effects. A part of this population will develop postprandial reactive hypoglycemia (PPRH). At
      this moment no validated diagnostic tool exists for PPRH. The aim of this study is to prove
      an association between the Sigstad´s Score and the lowest postprandial glucose level in
      patients after RYGB surgery. This is investigated using a liquid mixed meal tolerance test
      (LMMTT). As a secondary hypothesis, associations between Edinburgh Hypoglycemia Scale (EHS)
      and postprandial glucose levels are investigated. Furthermore, changes of insulin and GLP-1
      levels during the test are analysed. Patient characteristics including co-morbidities are
      studied as possible influencing parameters. Moreover, a healthy control group is included to
      validate the results. Finally, a flowchart/diagnostic method will be proposed for diagnosing
      patients who had a RYBG surgery with symptoms suggestive of PPRH. Besides the LMMTT,
      participants at the Ghent University Hospital will undergo additional tests such as a solid
      mixed meal tolerance test (SMMTT) and continuous glucose monitoring (CGM). Associations
      between Sigstad Score, EHS and the lowest glucose measured during CGM and SMMTT will be
      investigated and compared to the results of the LMMTT.

        In total 100 GBS patients which will be recruited over multiple sites in Germany, Great
        Britain, Belgium and Denmark.

        Belgium will be the only site performing the solid mixed meal tolerance test and the
        continuous glucose monitoring additional to the liquid mixed meal tolerance test. All other
        sites will only do the liquid mixed meal tolerance test.

        In total 20 control patients (10 with a BMI 18-25 kg/m² and 10 with a BMI &gt; 30 kg/m²) will
        be recruited. These will be recruited in Belgium (Ghent University Hospital) and the
        patients will undergo a liquid mixed meal tolerance test, a solid mixed meal tolerance test
        and a continuous glucose monitoring
