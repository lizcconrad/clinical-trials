  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Initially, HCV Informatics (C-IT) will be used to filter the EMR data of the one million
      people who receive care at Mount Sinai and identify candidates for HCV testing (baby boomers,
      patients with HIV infection) and candidates for HCV treatment (patients with positive test
      results for HCV RNA and no record of treatment).once treatment candidates have been
      identified through this proactive approach, their providers will be directly notified. HCV
      champions and patient navigators will be used to further lower barriers to the delivery of
      HCV care. They will be co-located at non-hepatology care sites and will help deliver
      open-label HCV treatment as part of standard medical care to 500 HIV/HCV co-infected patients
      and 200 patients with type 2 diabetes.

      Blood (10 mL) will be collected from 100 HIV/HCV coinfected patients before and after HCV
      cure. sCD163 will be measured using the human CD163 Quantkine ELISA kit from R and D systems.
      Blood (10 mL) will also be collected from up to 50 patients who fail therapy or become
      reinfected with HCV. The HCV RNA quasispecies will be analyzed using the deep sequencing
      methods. Serum will be saved for HIV/HCV Co-infected.
