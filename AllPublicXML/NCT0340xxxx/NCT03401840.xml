    <textblock>
      The main objective of this national, open-label, non-randomized phase II trial is to evaluate
      severe late toxicity of postoperative hypofractionated stereotactic radiotherapy (SBRT) in
      the treatment of early stage oropharyngeal and oral cavity cancer with high risk margins.
