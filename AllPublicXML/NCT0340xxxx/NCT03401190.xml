  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This open-label, dose-response study will evaluate the safety and efficacy of CM4620-IE in
      patients with acute pancreatitis and accompanying SIRS. The study will consist of two phases.
      The first phase will consist of 2 cohorts that will be enrolled concurrently. Cohort 1 will
      consist of 4 female patients who will be randomized 3:1 to receive CM4620-IE plus supportive
      care versus supportive care alone. Cohort 2 will consist of 4 male patients who will be
      randomized 3:1 to receive CM4620-IE plus supportive care versus supportive care alone. The
      second phase will consist of 2 cohorts. Cohort 3 will consist of 8 female patients who will
      be randomized 3:1 to receive CM4620-IE plus supportive care versus supportive care alone.
      Cohort 4 will consist of 8 male patients who will be randomized 3:1 to receive CM4620-IE plus
      supportive care versus supportive care alone.

    <description>CTSI score measures abnormal pancreatic morphology and is the sum of two subscales. The Balthazar subscale rates pancreatic CT image findings on a scale of 0 (normal) to 4 (2 or more peri-pancreatic fluid collections. The Pancreatic Necrosis subscale rates pancreatic necrosis from 0 (none) to 6 (&gt;50%). The two subscales are summed for a CTSI score of 0-3 (mild AP), 4-6 (moderate AP), and 7-10 (severe AP).</description>
