  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Peroral endoscopic myotomy is a novel, promising endoscopic technique for achalasia
      considering its minimal invasive characteristics and comparable efficacy to Heller myotomy.
      Numerous studies have focused on the efficacy, safety as well as technical aspects of POEM.
      However, few efforts have been made to the issue of antimicrobial prophylaxis in POEM.
      Postoperative prophylactic antibiotics are universally initiated on call to the operating
      room or at the start of POEM and consist of second-generation cephalosporins. The mean
      duration of antibiotic regimen after POEM was 3 days ranging from 1 day to 7 days.

      Numerous studies have shown that a single dose of antibiotic prophylaxis in a variety of
      surgical procedures. Other studies have shown that prolonged administration of antibiotics
      for longer than 24 hours add no benefit in many surgeries. Prolonged use of antibiotics not
      only increases the costs and exposure to drug toxicity directly but also may be associated
      with an increased risk of acquired antibiotic resistance as well as infection with
      Clostridium difficile.

      Thus, investigators intend to perform a prospective randomized study to confirm the validity
      of single-dose antimicrobial prophylaxis for the prevention of infectious complications
      following peroral endoscopic myotomy.

      This prospective randomized trial is performed to confirm the noninferiority of single-dose
      versus multiple-dose antimicrobial prophylaxis in terms of the incidence of infectious
      complications associated with peroral endoscopic myotomy. Six hundred sixty-six patients
      undergoing POEM for achalasia will be randomized to receive only single-dose ceftazidime (2g)
      or an additional 2 doses every 12 hours postoperatively (multi-dose group). POEM associated
      infectious complications will be assessed and recorded as regional infections, remote
      infections and systemic infections. Infection rate, adverse events related to antibiotics and
      POEM, Clavien-Dindo classification of surgical complications, length of hospital stay and
      efficacy of POEM will be compared. Body fluid bacterial culture will be conducted in patients
      suspected of infectious complications.
