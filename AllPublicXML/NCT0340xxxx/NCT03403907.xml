      This study evaluates the effect of probiotic supplementation in patients with drug-resistant
      epilepsy. All the patients received the probiotic.

      Epilepsy is a neurological disease with a prevalence of 0.6%. Despite the high number of
      antiepileptic drugs available, 20-30% of patients fail to control their seizures even with a
      correct treatment, this is known as drug-resistant epilepsy. This type of epilepsy limits
      severely the quality of life in patients and increases their morbidity and mortality.

      There are different therapeutic strategies for the treatment of drug-resistant epilepsy such
      as the vagus nerve stimulation, which has an effectiveness of approximately 50% reduction of
      seizures in 50% of patients. Another one is epilepsy surgery, which can achieve up to 70% of
      crisis control with specifically selected surgery for certain patients. On the other hand,
      the ketogenic diet has nearly 30% effectiveness, which is defined as a seizure reduction of
      more than 50%. Despite all these treatments, there is still a group of patients that keeps
      showing epileptic seizures.

      The microbiota is a collective of microorganisms that live in a symbiotic relationship within
      our organism. Currently, it is known that there is a bidirectional relationship between
      microbiota-gut-brain. Probiotics are live microorganisms that can benefit the health of the
      host when administered in adequate doses.

      The purpose of the study is to prove the quality of life improvement in drug-resistant
      patients after the administration of a probiotic for 4 months in order to reduce the number
      of seizures. Additionally, the parameters of inflammatory cytokines will be evaluated as well
      as the probiotic medication safety will be assessed.
