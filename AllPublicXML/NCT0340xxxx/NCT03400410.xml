      Prospective randomized control trial of an educational electronic application on female
      hormonal contraception for adolescent males in the pediatric emergency department.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Unintended pregnancy among adolescents is a significant public health issue and U.S.
      adolescents have one of the highest unintended pregnancy rates among industrialized nations.
      An estimated 9% of male adolescents becoming fathers by the time they are 20 years old. Over
      14 million adolescents use emergency departments every year and many of the adolescent males
      that present to the ED are engaged in high risk sexual behaviors which puts them at high risk
      for unintended pregnancy. This presents an opportunity to educate males that are at high risk
      about pregnancy prevention.

      This study is a prospective randomized control trial of education about female hormonal
      contraception for these higher risk adolescent males, 15-21 years old, that present to the
      Saint Louis Children's Hospital pediatric emergency department. An electronic application
      will be used to take a sexual history and ask questions about patients' current attitudes and
      use of hormonal contraception with their partners. They will then be randomized to watch a
      video on female hormonal contraception (experimental group) or no video (control group). The
      video will be an overview with brief pros and cons of all available types of hormonal
      contraception. The app emphasizes importance of condom use as part of dual method protection
      throughout. All patients will be followed up in 3 months to complete a survey with similar
      questions on sexual history, discussions with partners, and current contraceptive practices.
      The hypothesis of the study is that this will lead to increased rates of discussion about
      hormonal contraception between male adolescents and their sexual partners. This may lead to
      increased contraceptive use rates and a decrease in unintended pregnancy.

    <description>This group will take a survey and be asked some sexual history questions including their contraceptive practices with their sexual partner(s). They will then watch the educational video on hormonal contraception and then be asked a few questions about the video. Then they will be asked for an email and phone number for follow up.
They will then be followed up 3 months from their visit through their contact option of choice (email, text, or call) to take an additional survey with similar sexual history questions and current contraceptive practices including if they have discussed hormonal contraception with their female partners, if their female partners are now using hormonal contraception, and impregnation rates of female partners.</description>
