      The purpose of this study is to find out if treatment with a study drug, durvalumab has
      beneficial effects in patients who have recurrent ovarian clear cell cancer and to determine
      what effects (both good and bad) it has on them and their cancer.

      In the recurrent ovarian clear cell cancer (OCCC) setting, responses to further lines of
      chemotherapy are uniformly low. Given the limited benefit observed from chemotherapy
      treatments, there is now great interest in the development of molecular targeted therapy for
      the treatment of OCCC, including immunotherapy.

      Researchers have found that sometimes the body's own immune system may be able to slow down
      or control cancer growth. Sometimes though, this natural immune system response stops, and
      the cancer cells are not killed by the immune system. Research has shown that in some
      patients, proteins on the surface of cancer cells and immune cells bind together and send
      signals that stop the immune cells from killing the cancer cells. One such protein is called
      Programmed Cell Death Ligand 1 or PD-L1 for short. New drugs like durvalumab work to block
      this signal and to increase the immune response against cancer cells. Durvalumab is an
      antibody to PDL1 (a protein that binds to PD1 and blocks the anti tumour activity of immune
      cells), and it is hoped that by blocking the interaction between PDL1 and PD1, the immune
      cells will once again be able to attack the cancer cells and thus prevent or slow down cancer
      growth.

      This will be the first study to evaluate the efficacy of durvalumab in patients with
      recurrent ovarian clear cell carcinomas.
