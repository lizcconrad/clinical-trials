  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      For patients having a bone or joint infections, with or without device, optimal surgical
      therapy could be sometimes non-feasible, especially in the elderly population. Therefore, a
      medical therapy with oral prolonged suppressive antibiotic therapy (PSAT) seems to be an
      option to prevent recurrence and prosthesis loosening.

      Subcutaneous (SC) administration of injectable intravenous antibiotics as prolonged
      suppressive antibiotic therapy could be a convenient way when oral treatment is not available
      to facilitate ambulatory care, this practice being considered as routine care.

      The aim of this study is to evaluate tolerance and efficacy of subcutaneous administration of
      antibiotics for prolonged suppressive antibiotic therapy in patients having this treatment as
      part of their routine care.

    <description>In case of PSAT (prolonged suppressive antibiotic therapy), the duration could be several years.
This outcome will focus on severe adverse events induced by this sub-cutaneous and prolonged antibiotic therapy.
Qualification of an adverse event is made using the CTCAE terminology: this terminology attributes a grade for every adverse event. There are 5 grades and a grade refers to the severity of the adverse event. A severe adverse event has a grade &gt;=3.</description>
