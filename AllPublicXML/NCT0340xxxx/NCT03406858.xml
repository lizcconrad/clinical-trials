  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well pembrolizumab and HER2Bi-armed activated T cells work in
      treating patients with castration resistant prostate cancer that has spread to other places
      in the body. Monoclonal antibodies, such as pembrolizumab, may interfere with the ability of
      tumor cells to grow and spread. HER2Bi-armed activated T cells are made using T cells and may
      target and kill cancer cells. Giving pembrolizumab and HER2Bi-armed activated T cells may
      work better in treating patients with castration resistant prostate cancer.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To estimate the clinical efficacy of 8 infusions of HER2 HER2Bi-armed activated T cells
      (BATs) (up to 10^10/infusion) twice per week for 4 weeks in combination with pembrolizumab
      once every 3 weeks starting with one dose 3 weeks before the 1st BATs infusion, by assessing
      the percentage of patients free of clinical progression at 6 months after registration.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Evaluate phenotype, cytokine profiles and IFN-gamma enzyme-linked immunosorbent spots
      (ELISpots), cytotoxicity and antibodies directed at laboratory prostate cancer cell lines for
      proof of principle of immune system activation and to correlate with clinical outcomes of
      response, progression free survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS).

      II. Evaluate the magnitude of change in tumor infiltrating T cells, PD-1 expression, and the
      Th1/Th2 ratio in prostate cancer tumor tissue before and after immunotherapy and correlate it
      with the clinical outcomes of response, PFS, and OS.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive pembrolizumab intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes every 3 weeks. Treatment
      repeats every 3 weeks for up to 6 months in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity. Beginning at least 1 week after pembrolizumab, patients receive
      HER2Bi-armed activated T cells IV over 5-15 minutes 2 times a week for 4 weeks in the absence
      of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months.
