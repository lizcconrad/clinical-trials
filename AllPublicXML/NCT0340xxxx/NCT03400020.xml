  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Postpolypectomy bleeding is the most common major complication following a colonoscopic
      polypectomy procedure. The incidence rate ranging from 0.3 to 6.1%. Several preventive
      methods such as detachable snare and adrenaline injection have been proposed in the
      management of postpolypectomy bleeding in large colonic polyps. It has been demonstrated that
      administration of ascorbic acid (vitamin C) in abdominal surgeries could reduce the blood
      loss during the procedure, operation time and days of hospitalization. So the investigators
      designed a prospective, randomized study to compares the efficacy of vitamin C administration
      with application of prophylactic clip and detachable snare in the prevention of
      postpolypectomy bleeding in large polyps.

      In this prospective, randomized clinical trial, patients diagnosed with colon polyps with a
      diameter &gt; 10 mm will randomized to receive either a 500 mg vitamin C in normal saline
      injection or a normal saline injection 2 hours before polypectomy. This administration will
      continued for 3 days after polypectomoy. Postpolypectomy bleeding is defined either as (1)
      early: occurring either during an endoscopic procedure or immediately after as hematochezia
      within 24 h or (2) delayed: any bleeding event that occurring between day 2 and day 30
      following the polypectomy procedure.
