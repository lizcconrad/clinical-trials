      To evaluate the efficacy and safety profile of endoscopic submucosal tunnel dissection for
      superficial esophageal squamous cell carcinoma.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This multicenter, prospective, randomized, controlled study aims to evaluate the efficacy and
      safety of the tunnel technique in ESD of superficial esophageal squamous cell carcinoma
      (ESCC). Specifically the tunnel technique would be compared to conventional method on the
      procedure time and the muscular layer injury rate in patients scheduled for ESD with
      indication of ESCC.

    <description>During the ESTD procedure,after marking and submucosal injection, incisions were made at both the anal and oral sides of the lesion, and the submucosa under the lesion was then dissected to create a tunnel between the distal and proximal incisions. When the endscope reached the lower incision, the distal end of the esophageal lumen could be visualized , then two lateral mucosal incisions were made, thus completing the ESD procedure.</description>
