  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The decline in physical function and strength was seen by the nature of aging. The older
      adults often complain of fatigue. For these reasons, proper rehabilitation approaches should
      be used to ensure healthy life and to keep the quality of life at the highest possible level
      by minimizing the decline seen with aging process. Exercise programs and Neuromuscular
      Electrical Stimulation (NMES) are applied in rehabilitation to restore muscular strength and
      improve physical performance. NMES is used to prevent the atrophy of nonuse, to increase
      joint range of motion, to re-educate muscle, to regulate spasticity, to replace orthosis, to
      improve motor involvement of muscle fibers. Despite the use of NMES for strengthening in the
      clinics, the application parameters and methods should be discussed. The frequency, the pulse
      duration, the on / off time, the amplitude, the waveform of the current and the application
      time vary between the studies. For geriatric populations, it is recommended that the highest
      intensity, biphasic symmetrical currents with a frequency in the range of 50-100 Hz, for
      100-400 μs, can be pulsed for ideal amplification. NMES is usually practiced by
      physiotherapists continuously for 20 minutes in to strengthen. However, in recent studies, it
      has been shown that continuous application of a single-session 100 Hz current for 20 minutes
      leads to intense fatigue and after a while the effect of the strengthening of the current has
      been removed. Therefore, intermittent applications have been proposed instead of continuous
      applications for 20 minutes. Considering the fragility and the presence of sarcopenia in the
      geriatric population, NMES applications should be preferred in which rest periods are given
      instead of continuous application for 20 minutes. In the literature, there is no study
      showing the effect of NMES on Quadriceps strength, fatigue and physical function by using
      quadriceps stimulation for 20 minutes using different stimulation periods.Therefore, in this
      study, will be investigated the possible effects of two different methods of NMES on
      Quadriceps strength, fatigue and physical function.

    <measure>Timed up and go test</measure>
    <time_frame>2 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>This test will be used to measure the progress of balance, sit to stand, and walking. The participants stands up upon therapist's command walks 3 meters, turns around, walks back to the chair and sits down.
The time stops when the patient is seated. Time will be recorded.</description>

    <measure>30-Second Chair Stand Test</measure>
    <time_frame>30 second</time_frame>
    <description>The 30CST is a measurement that assesses functional lower extremity strength in older adults. The participant is encouraged to complete as many full stands as possible within 30 seconds. The participant is instructed to fully sit between each stand.The score is the total number of stands within 30 seconds (more than halfway up at the end of 30 seconds counts as a full stand). Incorrectly executed stands are not counted.</description>

    <measure>6 minute walk test</measure>
    <time_frame>6 minute</time_frame>
    <description>The 6 Minute Walk Test is a sub-maximal exercise test used to assess aerobic capacity and endurance. The distance covered over a time of 6 minutes is used as the outcome by which to compare changes in performance capacity. The participant walk for 6 minutes on 30 meter long way. The total distance will be recorded at the end of the test.</description>

    <time_frame>5 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>The patient wiil squeeze the dynamometer as the arm is adjacent to the body, the elbow is at 90 ° flexion, the forearm is in the neutral position and the wrist is at 0-30 ° extension. After the test is repeated three times, the highest score will be recorded. The test will only be done for the dominant hand.</description>

    <measure>Berg Balance Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>10 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>The balance will be evaluated observational during 14 different balance activities. A five-point scale, ranging from 0-4. &quot;0&quot; indicates the lowest level of function and &quot;4&quot; the highest level of function. It's minimum and maximum scores ranged between 0 and 56.
Interpretation: 41-56 = low fall risk 21-40 = medium fall risk 0 -20 = high fall risk</description>

    <description>The 9-item scale which measures the severity of fatigue and its effect on a person's activities and lifestyle in patients with a variety of disorders. Each item is scored between1 and 7. A low value (e.g., 1) indicates strong disagreement with the statement, whereas a high value (e.g., 7) indicates strong agreement. A total score of 36 or more suggests that you may be suffering from the fatigue.</description>
