  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      As essential nutrients omega 3 fatty acids contribute to normal growth and development.
      Inadequate intake is linked to the development of chronic diseases such as coronary heart
      disease, high blood pressure, cancer, arthritis, psychological illnesses and allergies.
      Therefore, it is important to be able to reliably detect the intake of these fatty acids. Due
      to eating habits varying in different countries the questionnaire documenting dietary habits
      needs to be adapted to the situation in question. Based on a US version the investigators
      developed a questionnaire suitable for Switzerland and now wish to validate it by measuring
      the fatty acid composition of red blood cells, which will provide information on the intake
      of the various fatty acids.
