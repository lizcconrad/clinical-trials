    <textblock>
      The aim of this present study is to investigate the use of benralizumab as treatment for
      severe nasal polyposis. The effect of benralizumab on nasal polyps will be assessed over a 56
      weeks of treatment period in patients with severe bilateral nasal polyposis who are still
      symptomatic despite standard of care therapy, i.e current use of intranasal corticosteroids
      (INCS) and prior surgery and/or use of systemic corticosteroids. The first 200 patients that
      complete the 56-week treatment will have a 6 month follow-up (FU) period without dosing.

It is a quantitative test of olfactory function which uses microencapsulated odorants that are released by scratching standardized odor-impregnated test booklets. Four booklets each with 10 odorants each are used for the test. Patients are asked to identify the odor using multiple choice format which lists different possibilities. Scores are based on number of correctly identified odors (score range 0 to 40).</description>
