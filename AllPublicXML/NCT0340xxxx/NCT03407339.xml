  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background:

      Nationally and internationally, more people over the age of 65 and especially an increase of
      people over the age of 80 enter nursing homes with natural dentition and complex prostheses
      and bridges than previous generations. Furthermore, there is an increased incidence of dental
      diseases in the elderly. This is leading to increased and different oral care needs. There is
      a large discrepancy between the elderly who need help with oral hygiene and the elderly who
      actually receive help. In order to improve the oral hygiene competencies of healthcare
      professionals at nursing homes, it is necessary to increase their education and improve
      organizational strategies.

      Hypothesis:

      The Intervention Shared Oral Care improves the elderlys bleeding and plaque index after 6
      months.

      Study type:

      An intervention study.

      A cluster randomization of 14 nursing homes in Aalborg municipality is carried out.

      Outcome Measures:

      Change in mucosal-plaque score (MPS) index

      Change in Oral Related Quality of life

      Outcome Measure Time Frame:

      Change in mucosal-plaque score index measured at 0, 3 and 6 months.

      Change in Oral Related Quality of life measured at 0 and 6 months.

    <description>modified Oral Health Impact Profile (OHIP14)
The modified Oral Health Impact Profile:
Have you had painful aching in your mouth?
Do you have trouble biting or chewing any kinds of food, such as firm meat or apples?
Do you limit the kinds or amounts of food you eat because of problems with your dentures?
How often are your teeth or gums sensitive to hot, cold, or sweets?
Responses are made in a five point scale:
Very often = 4 Often = 3 Sometimes = 2 Seldom = 1 Never = 0 Do to cognitively impaired elderly the response &quot;I don't know&quot; is added to each question coded 9.</description>

    <description>One hour of teaching in oral hygiene and oral diseases to health care professionals at the intervention nursing homes.
The dentists will make an assessment of the elderly's oral hygiene at baseline, after three and six months using a mucosal and plaque score. During the six months, a dentist will be doing ward rounds at each nursing home in a specific time interval. In dialog with the resident and the healthcare professional, the dentist will present individual advice on how to perform oral care based on the resident's oral care routines, oral hygiene status, and the resident's physical and cognitive function level.</description>
