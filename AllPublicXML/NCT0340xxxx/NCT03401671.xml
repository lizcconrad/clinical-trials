Severity of an AE is determined by following definitions: Mild: An event that does not generally interfere with usual activities of daily living; Moderate: An event that interferes with usual activities of daily living, causing discomfort but poses no significant or permanent risk of harm to the research subject; Severe: An AE that interrupts usual activities of daily living, or significantly affects clinical status, or may require intensive therapeutic intervention.</description>
