  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main objective of the CIRCULATE project is to compare the clinical outcomes of CardioCell
      administration in treatment of ischemic damages of cardiovascular system with control group,
      who will be treated by the administration of placebo during the sham procedure.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      It is planned to enroll 105 patients into AMI trial with randomization into active
      (CardioCell) therapy and sham procedure/placebo administration with 2:1 ratio.

      Additional 5-10 subjects meeting inclusion/exclusion criteria will receive, in a non-blinded
      fashion, labelled CardioCell to determine the early uptake and retention of IMP in the target
      ischemic tissues.

      The primary research question of this project is to check if the administration of CardioCell
      could improve the clinical outcomes in patients with AMI. There are several secondary
      questions, defined by secondary endpoints, e.g.: if the investigated treatment is possible to
      administered, if the investigated treatment is safe and way of CardioCell administration, if
      it is possible to define any selected subgroup in which the treatment results are
      significantly different than in whole group.

    <masking_description>The Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) will be blinded at project start, but may request unblinding if necessary to accommodate effective review of data.
Other than the DSMB (if necessary), the only other &quot;un-blinded parties&quot;, meaning that they will have knowledge as to the patient's treatment assignment, will be the PBTiK UJ CM employee who participates in randomization utilizing randomization lists and investigational medication preparation.</masking_description>
