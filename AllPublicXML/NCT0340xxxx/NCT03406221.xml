  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed to evaluate the impact of use of mobile technology by community-based
      health workers on health-promoting behaviors among women related to reproductive, maternal,
      newborn and child health and nutrition in Bihar, India.

      The intervention was funded by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation (BMGF) and in
      collaboration with CARE was implemented from 2012 to 2014. Health sub-centers in the
      catchment areas of four blocks (sub-districts) of the district of Saharsa were randomly
      assigned to treatment or control arms (35 sub-centers were assigned to each). Data were
      collected in the Intervention and Control areas from mothers of infants 0-12 months at
      baseline and at 2-year follow-up, to assess the intervention's effects on quality and
      quantity of FLW home visits, postnatal health behaviors, and among older infants/toddlers,
      complementary feeding and vaccination. Difference in difference analyses were used to assess
      outcome effects in this quasi experimental study.

      The ICT-CCS intervention was implemented in areas where the BMGF-funded Ananya program
      (official title: Bihar Family Health Initiative) was also being implemented. Thus, the impact
      is of the [ICT-CCS intervention + Ananya] versus [Ananya alone]. The Ananya program was
      developed and implemented via a partnership of BMGF, CARE, and the Government of Bihar. The
      ultimate purpose of Ananya was to reduce maternal, newborn, and child mortality; fertility;
      and child undernutrition in Bihar, India. Ananya involved multi-level interventions designed
      to build front line health worker (FLW) capacities and reach to communities and households,
      as well as to strengthen public health facilities and quality of care to improve maternal and
      neonatal care and health behaviors, and thus survival. It was implemented from 2012 to 2014.
      Eight focal districts in western and central Bihar received Ananya, while 30 districts did
      not.
