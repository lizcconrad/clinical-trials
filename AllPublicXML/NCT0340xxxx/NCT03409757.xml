  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This pilot study will be carried out to determine if the regular intake of iron-based
      Velphoro® by hyperphosphatemia patients influences the microbiome in the oral cavity and/or
      the gut.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to investigate potential changes in the microbiome of the oral
      cavity and/or gut in patients with hyperphosphatemia following Velphoro® intake for one
      month. The principal intention of this study is to assess consequences of Velphoro®
      medication beyond phosphate control. Adherence to the drug might be compromised by e.g.
      staining of teeth and biofilm after chewing the product more than recommended. Most likely
      this is a cosmetic problem only and easy to solve by optimizing oral hygiene. The increased
      level of iron may have an effect on the gut microbiome which could lead to mild diarrhoea.
      However, the present study will assess, whether the microbiome both oral and gut changes
      significantly due to some iron bio-availability, although this is expected to be low with
      sucroferric oxyhydroxide.

      The ultimate goal is to improve patient adherence to the drug and to resolve potential safety
      concerns.
