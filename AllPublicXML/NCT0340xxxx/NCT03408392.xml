  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is open-label, randomized two-way cross-over study to determine if cefixime 200
      mg/5 mL powder for suspension (test formulation: SKF101804) is bioequivalent to cefixime 200
      mg/5 mL suspension reference formulation. Study will be conducted in 28 healthy adult
      subjects under fasting conditions. There will be two treatment periods and each subject will
      participate in both periods. The washout period between both treatment periods will be 7-14
      days. Subjects will be randomized to either of treatment sequences of reference followed by
      test or test followed by reference to receive a single dose of test or reference formulation
      on Day 1 in each treatment period. The study will last for 5 to 7 weeks.
