  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Twenty participants with severe arthritis will be enrolled. For the first week participants
      will either be injected with dextrose or just have fluid withdrawn for testing. The remaining
      participants will be given dextrose injection at the end of the week. After one week dextrose
      injections will be given at one, two, three, four, five, and six months. Fluid will be
      withdrawn from the knee at time zero, one week, and three months. The hypothesis is that
      dextrose injection will cause a change in proteins in the knee consistent with improved
      repair signals, along with improving knee pain and function. .

  <detailed_description>

      Participants with stage IV knee osteoarthritis will be evaluated for eligibility and
      randomized 1 to 1 using an Internet randomization method to ensure random allocation.

      At time zero all participants will receive aspiration of their knees from the suprapatellar
      pouch of 5.5 mL of synovial fluid for cytokine analysis. After that 10 of the participants
      will receive injection of 10 mL of 12.5% dextrose. The other 10 will receive no injection
      after aspiration. Pain levels will be measured at time zero, 15 minutes, two hours and 48
      hours after aspiration with or without injection to gather information about the time course
      of analgesia.

      At one week all participants will receive aspiration of 2.0 mL from the suprapatellar pouch
      for cytokine analysis, followed by injection of the remaining 10 participants with dextrose
      12.5%. Pain levels will be measured at the same time intervals to complete evaluation of
      dextrose analgesia.

      After two weeks injections will be open label with 10 mills of dextrose 12 and have percent
      injected at one, two, three, four, five, and six months. At the three month. Another 2 mL of
      synovial fluid will be sent to the laboratory for cytokine analysis.
