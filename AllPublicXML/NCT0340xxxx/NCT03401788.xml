  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed to investigate PT2977 as a treatment for VHL disease associated RCC.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This open-label Phase 2 study will evaluate the efficacy and safety of PT2977 in patients
      with VHL disease who have at least 1 measurable RCC tumor. PT2977 will be administered orally
      and treatment will be continuous. Patients will be evaluated radiologically approximately 12
      weeks after initiation of treatment and every 12 weeks thereafter while continuing in the
      study. Changes in VHL disease-associated non-RCC tumors will also be evaluated.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Has a diagnosis of von Hippel Lindau disease, based on a germline VHL alteration

          -  Has at least 1 measurable solid RCC tumor and no RCC tumor that requires immediate
             surgical intervention. The diagnosis of RCC can be radiologic (histologic diagnosis
             not required). Patients may have VHL disease-associated tumors in other organ systems

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Has received prior treatment with PT2977 or another HIF-2α inhibitor

          -  Has had any systemic anti-cancer therapy (includes anti-VEGF therapy or any systemic
             investigational anti-cancer agent)
