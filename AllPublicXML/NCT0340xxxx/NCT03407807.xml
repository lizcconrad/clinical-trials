      The aim of this study was to describe prevalence, radiologic and ultrasound evolution during
      pregnancy, postnatal evolution and treatment strategy in case of isolated fetal spelnic cyst.
      The investigators performed a retrospective study in the Montpellier Prenatal Diagnosis
      Centre between 2007 and 2017. All pregnant women referred to this unit after routine
      ultrasound examination with a suspected splenic cyst were included. Participant all benefit a
      reference ultrasound to perform a detailed morphological examination. In any doubt about
      diagnosis, a MRI exam wad proposed. Then patient were followed regularly. At birth, all
      newborn babys had medical examination to search early complication. Then, children had a
      surgical consultation and regular ultrasound examinations were performed.
