    <textblock>
      Recent studies have demonstrated that the balance of intestinal microbiota is affected in
      chronic kidney disease (CKD), leading to a condition known as intestinal dysbiosis. These
      changes were associated with metabolic complications, accumulation of uremic toxins,
      inflammation, progression of CKD and cardiovascular risk. Measures with the aim of restore
      the balance of intestinal flora are suggested, such as the intake of probiotics composed of
      beneficial bacteria, but few studies have discussed the effect of these supplements in CKD.
      The present study aims to evaluate the effect of consumption of probiotics in factors
      associates with progression of CKD and cardiovascular risk. To such will be conducted a
      double-blind, placebo-controlled, and randomized clinical trial with 30 patients with CKD in
      stages 3-5, treated in ambulatories of Nephrology of the Hospital de Clínicas de Porto
      Alegre, independently of etiology and with steady renal function. Patients will be excluded
      whether in substitutive renal therapy, kidney transplant, on antimicrobial therapy or
      immunosuppressive agents in the last three months or with acute clinical events. The
      assessment will include clinical and nutritional parameters, estimated glomerular filtration
      rate, proteinuria, serum lipids, inflammatory factors, and bowel habits. The study protocol
      includes the recruitment of patients who will undergo to 4-week washout period. After
      patients will be randomized and provided with probiotic therapy (intervention group) or
      placebo (maltodextrin; control group) for 24 weeks. All patients will be instructed to
      consume 2 sachets/day of probiotic or placebo and receive nutritional advice. All data will
      be analysed by the principal investigator with the support of a trained statistician and the
      chief investigator. The statistical programme SPSS will be used.
