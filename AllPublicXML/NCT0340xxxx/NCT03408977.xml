    <textblock>
      Aim: to determine the effect of gender on the responses to meal ingestion. Participants (10
      men and 10 women) will be instructed to eat a standard dinner the day before, to consume a
      standard breakfast at home after overnight fast, and to report to the laboratory, where the
      test meal will be administered 4 h after breakfast. Studies will be conducted in a quiet,
      isolated room with participants sitting on a chair. Participants will ingest a probe meal up
      to the level of maximal satiation. The probe meal will be served stepwise (150 Kcal every 5
      min). Perception of homeostatic (hunger/satiation, fullness) and hedonic (digestive
      well-being, mood) sensations will be measured at 5 min intervals 10 min before, during and 20
      min after ingestion at 10 min intervals.
