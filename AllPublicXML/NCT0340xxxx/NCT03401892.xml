  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Ischemic optic neuropathy is among the most common causes of serious impaired vision in the
      middle-aged and elderly population in the western world. The current study focuses on a
      subgroup of ischemic optic neuropathy, the so-called non-arteritic ischemic optic neuropathy
      (NAION). Although the exact pathogenesis of NAION has not been fully clarified it is known
      that patients with cardio-vascular risk factors such as hypertension, diabetes mellitus and
      dyslipidemia have also an increased risk to develop NAION. Along this line of thought it has
      been shown that patients with a history of NAION in one eye have an increased risk to develop
      NAION also on the contralateral eye. However, clinical studies investigating ocular perfusion
      abnormalities in patients with NAION are sparse and even contradicting. Thus, the current
      study seeks to measure ocular blood flow parameters in patients with a history of NAION and
      compare it to healthy age-matched subjects.
