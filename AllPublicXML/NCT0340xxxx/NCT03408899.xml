    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and pharmacokinetics of PC-1005 gel when
      used as a rectal microbicide in HIV-uninfected men and women (cis or transgender) with a
      history of consensual receptive anal intercourse.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      PC-1005 is a multipurpose prevention technology (MPT) microbicide in development that is
      active against HIV, HPV, and HSV-2. This study will evaluate the safety and pharmacokinetics
      of PC-1005 gel when administered rectally.

      The study will enroll HIV-uninfected men and women (cis or transgender) with a history of
      consensual receptive anal intercourse. All participants will receive 3 single escalating
      doses of rectally administered PC-1005: 4 mL, 16 mL and 32 mL.

      The study includes a total of 9 clinic visits and 1 follow-up contact by phone or in person.
      Participants will receive doses of PC-1005 at Visits 3, 5, and 7. A 2-to-6 week washout
      period will follow each dosing visit. If no adverse events that preclude continuation to the
      next dose are identified during this period, participants will receive the next scheduled
      dose of PC-1005. Participation in this study will last approximately 3 to 5 months.

      Study visits will include physical examinations, throat swabs, behavioral assessments and
      interviews, and collection of blood, urine, rectal tissue, and cervical, vaginal, and rectal
      fluid.

               -  Note: HSV-1 or HSV-2 seropositive diagnosis with no active lesions is permitted
                  since treatment is not required.

                  pregnant or begin breastfeeding during study participation. Note: A documented
                  negative pregnancy test performed by study staff is required for inclusion;
                  however, a self-reported pregnancy is adequate for exclusion from
                  screening/enrollment into the study.

               -  Last pregnancy outcome 90 days or less prior to Screening

          -  Has any other condition that, in the opinion of the IoR/designee, would preclude

             outcome data, or otherwise interfere with achieving study objectives.
