  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Multiple sclerosis (MS) affects approximately 2.3 million patients worldwide, with a global
      median prevalence of 33 per 100,000. MS is diagnosed at an average of 30 years and affects
      twice as many women as men. MS is traditionally diagnosed by the presentation of lesions of
      the central nervous system, disseminated in time and in space, proven by clinical examination
      and magnetic resonance imaging. Several anatomical parameters in the eye, both vascular and
      neural, have been found to be altered in MS patients.

      Because of its unique optical properties, the eye offers the possibility of the non-invasive
      assessment of both structural and functional alterations in neuronal tissue. As the
      neuro-retina is part of the brain, it does not come as a surprise that neuro-degenerative
      changes in the brain are accompanied by structural and possibly also functional changes in
      the neuro-retina and the ocular vasculature.

      The current study seeks to test the hypothesis that beside the known anatomical changes, also
      functional changes can be detected in the retina of patients with MS. For this purpose,
      flicker light induced hyperemia will be measured in the retina as a functional test to assess
      the coupling between neural activity and blood flow. Further, structural parameters such as
      retinal nerve fiber layer thickness and function parameters such as ocular blood flow and
      retinal oxygenation will be assessed and compared to age and sex matched controls.
