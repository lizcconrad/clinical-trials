  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, 2-cohort study to evaluate the absolute bioavailability, absorption,
      distribution, metabolism and excretion of TD-1473 in healthy male subjects. Subjects in
      cohort 1 will receive a single oral dose of TD-1473 and a single intravenous bolus dose of
      [14C]-TD-1473. Subjects in cohort 2 will receive a single oral dose of [14C]-TD-1473 only.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subject is a healthy, nonsmoking male, 19 to 55 years old, inclusive

          -  Subject has a body mass index (BMI) 19 to 32 kg/m2, inclusive, and weighs at least 50
             kg

          -  Subject is healthy as determined by the PI or designee based on medical history and
             physical examination performed at Screening and Day -1

          -  Additional inclusion criteria apply

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subject has any condition possibly affecting drug absorption (e.g., previous surgery
             on the gastrointestinal tract [including removal of parts of the stomach, bowel,
             liver, gall bladder, or pancreas])

          -  Subject has a known hypersensitivity towards medications similar to TD 1473 or
             excipients contained in TD 1473

          -  Subject regularly works with ionizing radiation or radioactive material

          -  Subject has been exposed to ionizing radiations, within 1 year prior to the start of
             the study, as external irradiation (i.e., radiological examination including CT scan,
             excluding dental radiography) or internal radiation (i.e., diagnostic nuclear medicine
             procedure) or have participated in a radiolabeled study in the last 12 months

          -  Subject, who, for any reason, is deemed by the PI or designee or Sponsor to be
             inappropriate for this study or have any condition which would confound or interfere
             with the evaluation of the safety, tolerability, and PK of the investigational drug or
             prevent compliance with the study protocol
