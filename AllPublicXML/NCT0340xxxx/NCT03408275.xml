  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      During pregnancy lead crosses the placenta freely and can have adverse effects on the fetus,
      with the potential for life-long impact on the child. Identification of dietary patterns and
      food groups in pregnancy in relation to measures of lead status could provide a more useful
      alternative to a nutrient-specific advice to minimise fetal exposure to lead during
      pregnancy. The aim is to evaluate whether dietary patterns and food groups are associated
      with blood lead concentrations in pregnancy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Whole blood samples were collected from pregnant women enrolled in the Avon Longitudinal
      Study of Parents and Children observational birth cohort study and were analysed for lead.
      Dietary pattern scores were derived from principal components analysis of a food frequency
      questionnaire. Associations of quartiles of dietary pattern scores, and of food groups
      categorised by frequency of consumption, with the likelihood of blood lead concentration
      (B-Pb) ≥5 µg/dl will be identified with adjusted logistic regression (n=2167).

        The sample for this analysis was derived from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and
        Children (ALSPAC), which is a UK-based birth cohort set up to investigate environmental and
        genetic influences on health and disease. ALSPAC recruited 14,541 pregnant women resident
        in Avon, UK with expected dates of delivery between 1st April 1991 and 31st December 1992.
