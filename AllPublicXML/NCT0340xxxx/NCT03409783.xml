  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Enso is a portable device for the treatment of chronic and acute types of musculoskeletal
      pain. This study is being designed as a single blind, sham-controlled randomized clinical
      trial.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Fifty subjects will be selected based on the inclusion criteria and then randomized to either
      the intervention group or the sham control group. Each subject will be randomly fitted with
      an Enso or a sham device and will be instructed to self-administer treatment daily for one
      hour or more per day for two weeks in both cohorts. Throughout the duration of the study,
      data will be recorded via a smartphone application regarding treatment usage and intensity,
      pain levels, the subject's impression of any changes in their functionality, and their opioid
      and non-opioid medication intake. Additional functional testing will be conducted at each
      study visit.

      At the 2 week visit, the study blind will be broken, and subjects who were randomized to the
      sham group will be given the opportunity to cross over for an additional 2 week period using
      the active device.
