  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Prenatal stress is associated with negative outcomes such as postpartum depression,
      prematurity or neurodevelopmental delays.

      The aim of this study is to implement a psychological therapy to reduce stress during
      pregnancy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Objective: To assess whether the group of pregnant women have lower levels of stress after
      attending the psychological therapy than the group attending parent craft classes.

      The cognitive-behavioural therapy to reduce stress will be held in 10 sessions (1 per week)
      as follows:

      First session: General information about pregnancy. Pregnant women will describe what can
      they do to reduce stress levels.

      Second session: Breathing techniques and talk about how last week went. Third session: Muscle
      relaxation and guided imagination techniques Fourth session: Cognitive restructuring. Being
      able to detect thoughts and feelings Fifth session: Detect cognitive distortions Sixth
      session: Cognitive restructuring Seventh session: Time management Eighth session: Problems
      solving Ninth session: Assertively and social skills Tenth session: How to ask for help when
      needed and learning to say &quot;No&quot;.

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Perceived Stress Scale (PSS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, and 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>The PSS provides information on the perception of general stress during the preceding month. It consists on 14 items scores on a 5-point Likert scale (0 = never, 1 = almost never, 2 = once in a while, 3 = often, 4 = very often). Scores range from 0-56 (higher scores represent higher levels of stress)</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Prenatal Distress Questionnaire (PDQ)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, and 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>It is a 12-item instrument scored on a 5-point Likert scale from 0 (none at all) to 4 (extremely) to assess specific worries and concerns pregnant women experience regarding medical problems, physical symptoms, body changes, labor, childbirth, relationships, and the baby's health. Scores range from 0-48 (higher scores represent higher levels of pregnancy specific-stress)</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Symptoms Checklist 90 Revised (SCL-90-R)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, and 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>This is a 90-item scale scored using a 5-point Likert scale from 0 (never) to 4 (extremely). This instrument is used to assess 9 dimensions: Somatization, Obsession-compulsion, Interpersonal sensitivity, Depression, Anxiety, Hostility, Phobic anxiety, Paranoid ideation, and Psychoticism. The scale also has 7 extra items distributed among 3 global indexes of distress: the GSI, which measures overall psychological distress; the PSDI, which is used to measure the intensity of symptoms; and Positive Symptom Total, used to measure the number of self-reported symptoms. Using the author´s instructions, the scores are transformed to percentiles (0-100). Percentiles ≥ 70 represent clinical symptoms in any of the subscale of this instrument.</description>

    <measure>Change in Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale (CD-RISC)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, and 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>It consists of 25 items evaluated on a 5-point Likert scale ranging from 0-4: not true at all (0), rarely true (1), sometimes true (2), often true (3), and true nearly all of the time (4) - these ratings result in a number between 0-100, and higher scores indicate higher resilience.</description>
