  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase 2b, double-blind, placebo controlled proof-of-concept study of a an oral
      small molecule selective inhibitor of p38 alpha kinase, neflamapimod, administered for 24
      weeks in subjects with mild Alzheimer's disease. The primary objective is to demonstrate
      significant improvement relative to placebo-treatment in episodic memory function, as
      assessed by the Hopkins Verbal Learning Test. Secondary endpoints include Clinical Dementia
      Rating scale (CDR), Wechsler Memory Scale (WMS), Mini-Mental-Status-Examination (MMSE) and
      Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers of AD disease activity and progression.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Men and women age 55 to 85 years, inclusive.

          2. Willing and able to provide informed consent.

          3. Must have mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or mild AD with evidence of progression
             (&quot;Mild-AD&quot;), as defined by the following:

               1. CDR-Global Score of 0.5 or 1.0, with CDR memory subscore of at least 0.5.

               2. MMSE score ranging from 20 to 28, inclusive.

               3. Positive biomarker for AD, as defined by a CSF Aβ1-42R below the threshold and
                  phospho-tau above the threshold for the assay utilized in the study and assessed
                  by the central laboratory.

          4. Computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings within 2 years
             of Screening that are compatible with AD and no other pathologic processes that might
             potentially account for the subject's cognitive impairment.

          5. If the subject is taking a single drug for AD (e.g., donepezil or other cholinesterase
             inhibitors or memantine; dual therapy is excluded), he/she has been on a stable dose
             for at least 2 months prior to baseline, and the dose must remain unchanged during the
             study unless required for management of adverse events (AEs).

          6. Adequate visual and auditory abilities to perform all aspects of the cognitive and
             functional assessments.

          7. Must have reliable informant or caregiver.

          1. Evidence that the primary basis for cognitive impairment is neurodegenerative disease
             other than AD, including, but not limited to, vascular dementia, dementia with Lewy
             bodies, and Parkinson's disease.

          2. Suicidality, defined as active suicidal thoughts within 6 months before Screening or
             at Baseline, defined as answering yes to items 4 or 5 on the Columbia-Suicide Severity
             Rating Scale (C-SSRS), or history of suicide attempt in previous 2 years, or, in the
             Investigator's opinion, at serious risk of suicide.

          3. History of major and active psychiatric disorder, moderate to severe depressive
             symptoms, and or other concurrent medical condition that, EIP-VX17-745-304, Version
             1.0, 17 November, 2017 Page 7 of 46 EIP Pharma, LLC Confidential in the opinion of the

          5. History of cancer within the last 5 years, except basal cell carcinoma, squamous skin
             carcinoma, prostate cancer or carcinoma in situ with no significant progression over
             the past 2 years.

             abnormality, electrolyte abnormality, or positive syphilis serology that have not been
             corrected and/or otherwise addressed.

          8. History of epilepsy or unexplained seizure within the past 5 years.

          9. Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) or alanine aminotransferase (ALT) &gt;3 × the upper
             limit of normal (ULN), total bilirubin &gt;2 × ULN, and/or International Normalized Ratio
             (INR) &gt;1.5

         10. Known human immunodeficiency virus, hepatitis B, or active hepatitis C virus
             infection.

         11. Subject participated in a study of an investigational drug less than 3 months or 5
