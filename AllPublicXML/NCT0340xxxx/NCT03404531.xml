  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This project has the potential to improve the implementation science of treatment as
      prevention and pre-exposure prophylaxis uptake as a public health strategy for reducing new
      HIV infections in the United States. The investigators will develop and pilot test an
      intervention that combines messages sent over social media plus a newly developed interactive
      website specifically developed by and for Black/African American and Hispanic/Latino MSM to
      encourage treatment as prevention and pre-exposure prophylaxis use. Findings from this
      research can guide policy guidelines and recommendations for treatment as prevention and
      pre-exposure prophylaxis uptake for high-risk groups.

    <textblock>
      For this Minority AIDS Research Project, the investigators will develop and pilot test an
      intervention to improve the science of treatment as prevention and pre-exposure prophylaxis
      uptake as a public health strategy to decrease new HIV infections among Black/African
      American and Hispanic/Latino men who have sex with men. This project uses a 3-phase study
      design to address the proposed Specific Aims. First, the investigators will use focus groups
      to gather feedback on our existing interactive Men2MenRI website that was developed for and
      by predominately White men who have sex with men in Rhode Island that includes information on
      treatment as prevention and pre-exposure prophylaxis, as well as other health and wellness
      topics to make it more culturally-tailored to Black/African American and Hispanic/Latino MSM.
      Second, the investigators will use cognitive interviewing techniques to develop and assess
      the acceptability of Information-Motivation-Behavioral/Social Cognitive Theory-grounded
      social media message content designed to motivate and encourage access to a newly developed
      and culturally-tailored interactive website. Third, the investigators will pilot test a
      two-arm trial comparing the combination of sending Information-Motivation-Behavioral/Social
      Cognitive Theory-guided messages plus the newly developed and culturally-tailored interactive
      website (active arm) to the website alone (control arm) to examine whether the combination
      approach will: 1) increase treatment as prevention and pre-exposure prophylaxis uptake
      (primary outcome); 2) increase knowledge of, more favorable attitudes toward, and increase
      behavioral intentions of treatment as prevention and pre-exposure prophylaxis use behaviors
      (exploratory outcome). This study is innovative in the use of a combination approach to
      treatment as prevention and pre-exposure prophylaxis uptake that leverages advances in social
      media as a platform for motivating behavior change.
