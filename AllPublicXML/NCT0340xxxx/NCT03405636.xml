          4. Right Ventricular to Pulmonary Artery mean gradient &gt; 35mm Hg or moderate or severe
             Pulmonary regurgitation (≥3+), or have both.

          5. The patient, and the patient's parent / legal representative where appropriate, has
             been informed of the nature of the study, agrees to its provisions and has provided
             written informed consent by signing the approved informed consent form.

          6. The patient, and the patient's parent / legal representative where appropriate, and
             the treating physician agree that the subject will return for all required
             post-procedure follow up visits and the subject will comply with clinical
             investigation plan required follow-up visits.
