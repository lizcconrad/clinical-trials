  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Many adults who are overweight have obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) which disrupts sleep and
      makes it difficult to breath during the night. OSA increases the risk for a person to become
      insulin resistant and diabetic. It is not known why OSA causes this problem, i.e., whether it
      is disrupted sleep or lack of oxygen., which can change how the body handles glucose in
      adipose tissue, muscle tissue and liver.

      The purpose of this research study is to determine the key issues and mechanisms responsible
      for dysregulated glucose metabolism in people with OSA. The investigators will do this by
      comparing glucose metabolism in people who have OSA, and those who do not, and by evaluating
      the effect of treating OSA by providing continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) or simply
      oxygen during the night.

      The proposed study will evaluate the primary causes(s) (hypoxia, sleep fragmentation, or
      both) and pathophysiological mechanisms responsible for the OSA-associated metabolic
      abnormalities. Knowing the primary cause of Obstructive Sleep Apnea and pathophysiological
      mechanisms responsible for the OSA-associated metabolic abnormalities could help develop
      potentially novel therapeutic strategies to provide treatment for adults in improving OSA and
      associated comorbidities.

    <description>The hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp technique combined with isotope-labelled tracer infusions will be used to assess insulin mediated glucose rate of disappearance, expressed as μmol/kg fat free mass/min, before and after treatment of OSA with three months of night-time supplemental oxygen, PAP, or sham.</description>

    <measure>β-cell function</measure>
    <time_frame>3 hours</time_frame>
    <description>β-cell responsivity to glucose and the disposition index will be determined to characterize the insulin secretory response to glucose infusion and the relationship between insulin secretion and insulin sensitivity. This outcome will be determined by using an insulin-modified intravenous glucose tolerance test in conjunction with mathematical modelling and insulin sensitivity data from the hyperinsulinemic clamp.</description>

    <description>A registered polysomnographic technologist will perform a titration starting at 4 cm water (H2O) and adjust this value as needed to identify the optimal pressure to achieve an Apnea Hypopnea Index (AHI) &lt;5 (including rapid eye movement sleep in the supine position). After PAP titration, subjects will be instructed to use the machine at the optimal pressure every night for 3 months. Compliance will be defined as: ≥4 hours use on 70% of nights and average use ≥6 hours per night.</description>

    <arm_group_label>Supplemental Oxygen (O2)</arm_group_label>
    <arm_group_type>Experimental</arm_group_type>
    <description>Subjects randomized to night-time supplemental oxygen will complete an overnight oxygen titration protocol in the clinical research unit. Initially, subjects will receive 0.5 liters oxygen (O2)/min; the delivery rate will then be increased by 0.5 l/min until oxygen saturation (SaO2) is ≥88%. The optimal O2 delivery rate determined during this study will be used for the intervention. The oxygen concentrators used at home will record cumulative hours of use to provide an objective measure of adherence (monitored weekly). Compliance will be defined as ≥6 h average use per night..</description>
