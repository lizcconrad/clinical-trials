  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cold laparoscopic cholecystectomy is the gold standard for the management of symptomatic
      vesicular stones. There is considerable controversy as to whether it should be practiced in
      outpatient surgery or as part of inpatient surgery, regarding to patient safety.

      &quot;Minor&quot; surgical procedures, such as anal surgery or simple inguinal hernia interventions,
      were initially considered eligible for an outpatient procedure. Advances in surgical
      techniques, anesthesia and early rehabilitation have also made it possible to consider more
      &quot;heavy&quot; interventions, such as cholecystectomy.

      The aim of this study is to identify eligible patients for laparoscopic cholecystectomy in
      outpatient surgery, taking surgical criteria into account.
