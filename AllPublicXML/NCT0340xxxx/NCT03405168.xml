Although a clear progression of &quot;non-target&quot; lesions only is exceptional, in such circumstances, the opinion of the Treating Physician should prevail, and the progression status should be confirmed at a later time by the review panel.the length of time during and after the treatment of a disease, such as cancer, that a patient lives with the disease but it does not get worse</description>

        progressing) according to RECIST criteria after standard anti-tumor treatment of advanced
        cancer.

        tumour at diagnosis/on biopsy of metastasis ECOG 0-2 with no deterioration over previous 2
        weeks Measurable disease Has an ECOG Performance Status (PS) 0-2 Normal organ function If
        fertile, patient (male or female) has agreed to use an acceptable method of birth control
        (eg, abstinence, intrauterine device, oral contraceptives, barrier device with spermicide
        or surgical sterilization) to avoid pregnancy for the duration of the study and for a

        therapy Spinal cord compression or brain/meningeal metastases unless asymptomatic, treated
        and stable and not requiring steroids for ≥ 4 weeks study treatment Major surgery
