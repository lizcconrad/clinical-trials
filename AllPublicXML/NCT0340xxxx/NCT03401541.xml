    <textblock>
      To evaluate the pharmacokinetic parameters of orally administered 25-hydroxyvitamin D3
      [25(OH)D3] and vitamin D3 from the corresponding serum concentration-time curves in healthy
      adults and adults with a history of intestinal malabsorption.

    <textblock>
      Patients with a history of intestinal malabsorption (n=10) and healthy volunteers (n=10); (of
      both sexes and all ethnicities) will be recruited in this randomized double-blind crossover
      study. All subjects will be prescreened for 25(OH)D levels to include subjects with
      25(OH)D&lt;30 ng/ml. The subjects will be randomized to receive a single oral dose of 900 µg of
      either vitamin D3 or 25(OH)D3. Blood samples will be taken at baseline and at 2,4,6,8,12
      hours and days 1,2,3, 7 and 14. After a washout period of at least 14 days (2 weeks) the
      subjects will receive in a double blinded manner a single oral dose of 900 µg of either
      25(OH)D3 or vitamin D3 (depending on which one they took in the randomization) any time after
      the washout. Blood samples will be taken at baseline and at 2,4,6,8,12 hours and days
      1,2,3,7, 14.

      Serum levels of calcium, phosphorus, albumin, creatinine, intact parathyroid hormone (iPTH)
      will be obtained at baseline and at day 14 (or within a reasonable time if unable to come in
      on the exact day). Vitamin D and 25(OH)D will be determined on all the blood samples
      collected at the various times.

             endpoints must be willing and able to discontinue use of these supplements for the
             duration of the study and allow for at least a 14-day washout prior to prescreening
             and enrollment.

          -  Women of child bearing potential must be on birth control and not pregnant based on a
             negative pregnancy test at baseline for each of the 2 pharmacokinetic studies.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Unwilling to discontinue use of supplemental dose of vitamin D2 (ergocalciferol) or
             vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol) daily equivalent (2,000 IU/50 μg) 1 week or less prior to
             randomization and during the study

          -  On medications that can affect vitamin D metabolism including steroids such as

             or during the entire study.

          -  Participation in the study or any reason which, in the opinion of the investigator
             makes adherence to a treatment or follow-up schedule unlikely

          -  History of elevated serum calcium

          -  Chronic hepatic or renal failure
