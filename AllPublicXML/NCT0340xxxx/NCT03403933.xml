  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Prospective, monocentric study in open, aimed at evaluating the effects of supplementation
      with calcifediol on left ventricular function parameters in cardiopathic subjects undergoing
      major orthopedic surgery.

      Population of the study: 49 cardiopathic patients in hypovitaminosis D supplemented with
      calcifediol to reach vitamin D levels&gt; 30 ng / ml within 6 months. The purpose of this study
      is to evaluate the improvement of the ejection fraction or GLS (global longitudinal strain)
      calculated by speckle tracking at 6 months in cardiopathic patients with Vitamin D deficiency
      during functional recovery after major orthopedic surgery

    <description>Didrogyl 10 ml: 10 drops a day to obtain levels of vitamin D &gt; 30 ng /ml. Once these values are obtained lower the dose to 4-5 drops a day, with the aim, however, of keeping the plasma values between 30 and 60 ng/ml during 6 months of the study</description>

    <description>Calcifediol will be administered at a dose of 10 drops per day (as indicated for use) for 6 months or until vitamin D levels&gt; 30 ng / ml are obtained.
Once these values have been obtained, the dosage can be reduced to a dosage of 4/5 drops of calcifediol (1 drop contains 5mcg of calcifediol) with the aim to maintain the plasma values of 25 (OH) D in a optimal range between 30-60 ng / ml during the 6 month of the duration of the study.</description>
