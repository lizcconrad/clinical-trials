    <description>ACR (American College of Rheumatology) 20 The percentage of patients who achieved ACR20 at Week 32 is the primary end point. Signs and symptoms are assessed with a composite rating scale of the ACR (American College of
Rheumatology) that includes 7 variables:
Tender Joints Count
Swollen Joints Count
Levels of an acute phase reactant (CRP level)
Patient's assessment of pain
Patient's global assessment of disease activity
Physician's global assessment of disease activity
Patient's assessment of physical function</description>

    <measure>Change in modified van der Heijde Sharp score</measure>
    <time_frame>20 and 72 Weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Sharp method is a composite X-ray scoring system used to assess structural (joint) disease progression in rheumatoid arthritis. The method evaluates both joint erosions (JE) and joint space narrowing (JSN) in bilateral hand and foot joints. The Sharp/van der Heijde method assesses erosions and joint space narrowing separately in the hands and feet, and has a range from 0 to 448. Thirty-two joints in the hands and 12 in the feet are scored for erosions, with a maximum score of five per joint in the hands and 10 per joint in the feet. Joint space narrowing is graded from 0 to 4 in 30 joints in the hands and in 12 joints in the feet.
The principal score used in the analyses is the total score, which is the sum of the erosion score and the joint space narrowing score.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Physical function</measure>
    <time_frame>20 and 72 Weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Improvement in physical function is assessed by change from baseline in HAQ (Health Assessment Questionnaire).The HAQ-DI (disability index) is composed of 8 categories as follows: dressing and grooming, arising, eating, walking, hygiene, reach, grip and activities, for which there are at least 2 questions by category. The patient will be asked to score how difficult he/she feels it is to perform such activities using a 0 to 3 scoring (0=without any difficulty,
1=with some difficulty, 2=with much difficulty and 3=unable to do). If the patient is using assistance for any of these activities, scoring may be adjusted. For each category, the highest score given for one of the question is attributed to the category. The total score is the sum of all categories' scores divided by the number of answered categories (at least 3 categories should be answered)</description>
