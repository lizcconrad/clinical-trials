  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this clinical equivalency trial, two foods will be compared for the treatment of SAM,
      testing the hypothesis that the difference in recovery rates and growth between the two test
      groups will be no greater than 5 percent.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This will be a randomised, double-blinded, controlled clinical equivalency trial assessing
      the treatment of SAM with one of two therapeutic foods until the child is recovered or for a
      period of up to 12 weeks.

      Subjects will be recruited from rural health clinics in the Western Rural Region of Sierra
      Leone, due to the limited accessibility of treatment programs in this area; investigators
      believe a clinical trial in this district will be beneficial.

      Sierra Leonean children aged 6-59 months with uncomplicated SAM (with WHZ &lt; -3, MUAC of &lt;11.5
      cm, or bipedal edema) will be recruited at health clinics in the Western Rural Region. A
      total of 1,300 children will be enrolled for a total sample size of 1,262 (631 per treatment)
      from 30 PHU centers, to detect a 5% difference in recovery rates between any two foods, with
      95% sensitivity and 80% power, assuming that the standard recovery rate is 85% and a binary
      non-inferiority test (Fisher's exact test).

      After screening and enrolment, each child's participation will last up to 12 weeks. If a
      child recovers before the end of the 12-week period, a child's WHZ reaches and stays above -2
      for two consecutive visits without edema, the child will graduate from the study. No study
      food products will be given to children after 12 weeks of participation; those who have not
      recovered will be taken for inpatient treatment. Children will enter the study on a rolling
      enrolment basis and will continue to be enrolled until 1,300 children complete the study.

      Randomization will be blocked for the entire study rather than at each study site. Allocation
      of food intervention will be conducted by nurses who will have the caregiver draw opaque
      envelopes containing one of 4 colours. Caretakers chose a sealed envelope that contains 1 of
      4 colours: 2 of these colours correspond to the control food and 2 to the experimental food.
      The colour will be recorded separately from the child's clinical measurements and researchers
      involved in the randomization process do not know which colour corresponds to which food
      corresponding to one of the therapeutic foods. The code will be accessible only to the food
      distribution personnel, who do not assess participant outcomes or eligibility. Investigators
      performing clinical assessments and caretakers will be blinded to the child's assigned food
      group.
