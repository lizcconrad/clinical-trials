  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of providing sensation of the
      missing limb by applying small electrical current directly to the remaining sensory nerves
      via implanted stimulating electrodes. These small electrical currents cause the nerves to
      generate signals that are then transferred to your brain just like the information about the
      foot and lower limb used to be transferred to your brain prior to the amputation.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Electrodes are surgically implanted on one to four nerves of the residual limb. An external
      stimulation device will send pulses to the electrodes. The participant will be asked what
      they feel, and to draw the location of any perceived sensation on schematic maps. A
      sensorized prosthesis will be worn and stimulation will be administered while the participant
      is engaging in various functional tasks, such as standing, walking or climbing stairs or with
      visual or mental distractions.
