    <textblock>
      The primary objective of the study is to evaluate the long-term safety and tolerability of
      evinacumab in patients with Homozygous Familial Hypercholesterolemia (HoFH). The secondary
      objectives of the study are to evaluate the effect of evinacumab on lipid parameters in
      patients with HoFH and to evaluate the potential development of anti-evinacumab antibodies.
