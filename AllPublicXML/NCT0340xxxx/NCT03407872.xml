  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The planned study is to determine the pharmacokinetic properties of Esketamine and safety
      assessment with inhaled Esketamine after different number of inhalations and different dosing
      sequences within three parts of the study.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is to be one-centre, single ascending dose and double-blind placebo controlled multiple
      dose three part study of Esketamine DPI (dry powder inhaler) in healthy volunteers.

      PART A is a single dose, open-label part with Esketamine DPI inhalations administered with
      dose escalation between cohorts.

      PART B is a single dose, open-label part with Esketamine DPI inhalations administered in
      different dosing sequences with dose escalation between cohorts.

      PART C is a multiple dose, double-blind, placebo-controlled part with Esketamine DPI
      inhalations administered in different cycles of treatment (with four dosing sequences within
      two weeks) with dose escalation between cohorts. Participants in this part will be randomized
      to receive Esketamine DPI or placebo in 3:1 ratio.

      Pharmacokinetic properties and safety of Esketamine DPI will be determined following
      different number of inhalations in PART A, different dosing sequences in PART B and different
      cycles of treatment in PART C.
