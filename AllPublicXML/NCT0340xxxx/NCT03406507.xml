        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients from birth up to &lt; 18 years of age and weighing ≥ 5 kg at the time of
             consent.

          2. PNH diagnosis confirmed by documented by high-sensitivity flow cytometry

          3. Presence of 1 or more of the following PNH-related signs or symptoms within 3 months
             of Screening: fatigue, hemoglobinuria, abdominal pain, shortness of breath (dyspnea),
             anemia, history of a major adverse vascular event (including thrombosis), dysphagia,
             or erectile dysfunction; or history of pRBC transfusion due to PNH.

          4. LDH level ≥ 1.5 × ULN for patients not being treated with eculizumab at screening and
             LDH level ≤ 1.5 × ULN for patients taking eculizumab.

          5. Documented meningococcal vaccination not more than 3 years prior to dosing, and
             vaccination against Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae

          6. Female patients of childbearing potential must use highly effective contraception
             starting at screening and continuing until at least 8 months after the last dose of
             ALXN1210

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. History of Bone Marrow transplantation

          2. History of or ongoing major cardiac, pulmonary, renal, endocrine, or hepatic disease
             that, in the opinion of the investigator or sponsor, would preclude participation.

          3. Unstable medical conditions (eg, myocardial ischemia, active gastrointestinal bleed,
             severe congestive heart failure, anticipated need for major surgery within 6 months of
             randomization, coexisting chronic anemia unrelated to PNH)

          4. Females who are pregnant, breastfeeding or who have a positive pregnancy test at
             screening or Day 1

          5. Participation in another interventional clinical study or use of any experimental
             therapy within 30 days before initiation of study drug on Day 1 in this study or
             within 5 half-lives of that investigational product, whichever is greater.
