  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized controlled trial. The present study involves an acute and chronic
      intervention, which is a water-based exercise (one session: to acute intervention; 12-weeks
      of aquatic exercise program: to chronic intervention). The sample will be composed by elderly
      enrolled in university extension program titled &quot;Hidroginastica na Terceira Idade&quot;
      (Hydrogymnastics in aging). It will be evaluated the effects of water-based exercise on
      hemodynamics, self-reported sleep quality, depressive symptoms, quality of life, body
      composition, level of physical activity and functional capacity. The investigators
      hypothesized that an acute water-based exercise under different intensities promotes
      hemodynamics changes in elderly. In addition, the investigators hypothesized that 12-weeks of
      aquatic exercise may lead improvements in self-reported sleep quality, depressive symptoms,
      quality of life, body composition, level of physical activity and functional capacity in
      elderly.

    <description>Quality of life will be assessed by the WHOQOL-OLD questionnaire and it consists of 24 items on the likert scale attributed to 6 facets: 1) Sensory functioning, 2) Autonomy, 3) Past, present and future activities, 4) Social participation, 5) Death and dying, and 6) Intimacy. Each facet is composed of 4 items, so for each facet the score can range from 4 to 20. For this evaluation, the higher the score, the higher the quality of life.</description>

    <measure>Level of physical activity (BAECKE modified to elderly)</measure>
    <time_frame>Approximately 5 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>The Habitual Physical Activity Questionnaire originated in 1982 by Baecke and colleagues (BAECKE; BUREMA, FRIJTERS, 1982) and was adapted for the elderly and validated later (VORORRIPS et al., 1991) and recently translated into Portuguese (SIMÕES, 2009). It is applied in the form of an interview, and has as reference the last 12 months being divided into 3 sections (1 - Domestic physical activities, 2 - Sporting activities and 3 - Activities in free time). From the scores attributed to each response provided by the elderly, scores equivalent to each section cited above are established. It is suggested that 3 cutoff points be created for the classification of the elderly regarding the level of physical activity (low, moderate and high) based on terciles.</description>
