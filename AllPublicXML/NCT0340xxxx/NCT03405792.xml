  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is the most common and deadliest primary malignant neoplasm of
      the central nervous system in adults. Despite an aggressive multimodality treatment approach
      including surgery, radiation therapy and chemotherapy, overall survival remains poor.
      Pembrolizumab has recently been approved in the United States for the treatment of patients
      with advanced and metastatic non-small cell lung cancer, recurrent or metastatic head and
      neck squamous cell carcinoma, locally advanced urothelial carcinoma, classical Hodgkin
      lymphoma, unresectable or metastatic melanoma

      This study is being performed to determine whether the triple combination of pembrolizumab
      when added to TTFields (Optune®) and adjuvant temozolomide increases progression-free
      survival (PFS) in patients with newly diagnosed GBM as compared to historical control data.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with newly-diagnosed GBM who undergo maximal safe resection (biopsy alone is
      eligible) followed by standard chemoradiation will be eligible for this trial.

      Four weeks after completing chemoradiation, patients will undergo baseline standard of care
      MRI. Four to six weeks after finishing chemoradiation, patients will start monthly cycles of
      adjuvant TMZ. A minimum of 6 and maximum of 12 cycles of adjuvant TMZ will be given.
      Treatment with Optune will start at approximately the same time as the first cycle of
      adjuvant TMZ and continue until second disease progression or a maximum of 2 years. Within
      one week after starting Cycle 2 of adjuvant TMZ and Optune therapy, patients will begin
      open-label treatment with pembrolizumab every 3 weeks until first disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicities or 2 years, whichever comes first.

      At first progression, patients will be allowed to continue with Optune therapy combined with
      any other therapy, which may include pembrolizumab, per standard of care at the discretion of
      the treating physician. Surgical resection or biopsy of first recurrent tumor for
      confirmation of recurrence is allowed within the protocol.

      All patients will be seen before Cycle 1 of TMZ, before cycle 2 of TMZ, before starting the
      second dose of pembrolizumab, and every 3 weeks before each subsequent pembrolizumab dose at
      an outpatient clinic until they complete all 12 cycles of adjuvant TMZ or discontinue TMZ due
      to toxicity or first progression.

      Medical follow-up will continue for 30 days after treatment termination. After this visit,
      mortality will be assessed based on telephone interviews with the patients or the patients'
      caregivers every 3 months.
