    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Subjects must have a documented diagnosis of Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD)
             confirmed by complete dystrophin deficiency (by immunofluorescence and/or immunoblot),
             or identifiable mutation in the DMD gene where reading frame can be predicated as &quot;out
             of frame,&quot; or complete dystrophin gene sequencing consistent with DMD; AND in the
             opinion of the Investigator, a typical clinical profile consistent with DMD.

          2. Subjects taking approved treatments for DMD (by a Health Authority) that target
             dystrophin gene mutations (eg, eteplirsen or ataluren) may be enrolled in the study if
             they have been on a stable dose for 30 days prior to the first dose of study drug, and
             plan to remain on that dose throughout the study

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Subject has had previous systemic treatment with corticosteroids. Transient previous
             use of corticosteroids will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis by the sponsor or
             designee. Inhaled corticosteroids will be permitted if given at a stable dose for the
             3 months prior to the first dose of study drug and the subject will remain on that
             dose throughout the study. The use of topical or intra-articular corticosteroids is
             permitted during the study.

          2. Subject has symptomatic cardiomyopathy in the opinion of the investigator.

          3. Subject is unable to complete the 10 meter Walk/Run test at the Screening and/or
             Baseline Visit.

          4. Subject has Type 1 or Type 2 diabetes mellitus.

          5. Subject has a history of chronic active hepatitis including acute or chronic hepatitis
             B, or acute or chronic hepatitis C.

          6. Subject has a history of tuberculosis (TB) infection, any signs/symptoms of TB, or any
             close contact with an individual with an active TB infection.

          7. Subject has known immune compromised status (not related to disease/condition under
             study), including but not limited to, individuals who have undergone organ
             transplantation or who are known to be positive for the human immunodeficiency virus.
