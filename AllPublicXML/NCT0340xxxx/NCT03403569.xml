    <textblock>
      The traditional Chinese herbal medicine Triptolide Wilfordii has displayed remarkable effect
      on the treatment of autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis. Now that
      immunosuppression therapy has recently become a new strategy for HIV infection, it's
      reasonable to expect the anti-inflammatory effect of Triptolide Wilfordii in HIV infected
      patients. So we designed a randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled study to explore
      the efficacy and safety of Triptolide Wilfordii in new-onset HIV infection.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Acquired immune deficiency syndrome(AIDS) is a severe fatal disease caused by HIV infection.
      Despite viral suppression achieved, antiretroviral therapy(ART) cannot ameliorate HIV-induced
      immune activation and the consequent non-AIDS complications including cardiovascular, renal,
      hepatic diseases. Recently, immunosuppression therapy has become the focus since it can
      suppress exorbitant immune activation and inflammation so as to reduce the risk of non-AIDS
      cardiovascular and central neural system complications. Triptolide Wilfordii is a traditional
      Chinese herbal remedy and has long been used in the treatment of autoimmune diseases such as
      rheumatoid arthritis. Moreover, a recent study has shown that Triptolide Wilfordii combined
      with ART is associated with increased CD4 T cell counts and reduced immune activation in
      immunological non-responders, who were defined as patients with CD4 cell counts＜350 cells/μl
      despite over 2 years of ART. Hence we expect Triptolide Wilfordii to bring up similar
      improvement in treatment naïve HIV infection. This randomized, double-blinded,
      placebo-controlled study is designed to investigate the safety and efficacy of Triptolide
      Wilfordii and hopefully provide evidence for a new treatment strategy.
