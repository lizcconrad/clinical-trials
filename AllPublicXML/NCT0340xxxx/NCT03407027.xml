    <textblock>
      This study has the primary goal of evaluating the efficacy of corticoid infiltration in the
      quadratus lumborum syndrome, aiming to determine if there are benefits with the use of
      corticosteroids and if they exist, if this improvement comes only from the systemic effects
      of corticosteroid administration.

      This study has the primary goal of evaluating triamcinolone`s efficacy on the ultrasound-
      guided infiltration in the quadratus lumborum syndrome, aiming to determine if there are
      benefits with the use of corticosteroids and if they exist, if this improvement comes only
      from the systemic effects of corticosteroid administration.

      It is an interventional study, double-blinded and randomized, in a sample of patients
      followed in the Chronic Pain Unit (Hospital of Braga, Portugal), proposed for ultrasound
      infiltration of the quadratus lumborum muscle.

      The selection of the patients will take into account the inclusion and exclusion criteria,
      until reach the required sample size (66 patients). The confirmation of the inclusion
      criteria will be done by a physiatrist blind to randomization.

      Different protocols will be randomly applied to patients after obtaining written informed
      consent.

      The techniques will be performed by two anesthetists. The data will be obtained through
      questionnaires filled out on the day of the technique and in the course of 1, 3 and 6 months
      in chronic pain consultation and by telephone call 72 hours after the procedure. It will be a
      psychologist, blind to randomization, to fill the questionnaires.

      Patients will be also evaluated in consultation, at the same time, the course of 1, 3 and 6
      months.

      After the data collection it will be performed a statistical analysis.

    <intervention_model_description>In this randomized, double-blind trial, patients will be randomized into one of three groups. First group, infiltration of the quadratus lumborum muscle and fascia (with 40mg of triamcinolone and 10ml of levobupivacaine 0,25%). Second group, gluteus maximus and fascia infiltration with 40mg of triamcinolone and 10ml of levobupivacaine 0,25%. The last group, namely the control group, infiltration of the quadratus lumborum muscle and fascia with 10ml of levobupivacaine 0,25%.</intervention_model_description>

    <description>The SF-36 consists of eight scaled scores, which are the weighted sums of the questions in their section. Each scale is directly transformed into a 0-100 scale on the assumption that each question carries equal weight. The lower the score the more disability.

The HADS anxiety and depression subscales each consist of 7 items, and each item is rated on a 4-point scale; potential scores for each subscale range from 0 to 21. Patients with scores â‰¥8 on each subscale are considered symptomatic with general anxiety or depressive symptoms.</description>
