      To evaluate the following items in patients with locally advanced and metastatic biliary
      tract cancer receiving SLOG or GC treatment, Primary objective: 6-month progression-free
      survival rate Secondary objectives: Objective response rate、Disease control rate (Objective
      response rate (ORR) + stable disease ≧ 12 weeks)、Progression-free Survival 、Overall survival
      、 Safety profile、Biomarker study This is a randomized, open-labeled, two-arm, multi-center,
      phase II clinical study.

      Arm 1: SLOG regimen: every 14 days as one cycle S-1 35 mg/m2/b.i.d., day 1 - 7 (maximum dose:
      120 mg/day) Leucovorin 30 mg/b.i.d., day 1-7; Oxaliplatin 85 mg/m2 in 250 mL of 5% Glucose,
      given as 2-hour intra- venous infusion, day 1; Gemcitabine 800 mg/m2 in 250 mL of normal
      saline, given as fixed dose-rate (FDR, 10 mg/m2/min) infusion, day 1; After the
      administration of gemcitabine, the infusion line should be flushed with 20 ml of normal
      saline and then 50 ml of 5% glucose solution before the administration of oxaliplatin.

      Arm2: GC regimen: every 21 days as one cycle Gemcitabine 1000 mg/m2 in 100 mL of normal
      saline, IV drip for 30 mins on D1 and D8 Cisplatin 25 mg/m2 in 250ml of normal saline, IV
      drip for 2 hours on D1 and D8

      Treatment will be stopped in case of progressive disease, unacceptable toxicity, patients'
      refusal or death.
