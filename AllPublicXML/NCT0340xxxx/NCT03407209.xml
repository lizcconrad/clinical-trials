  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Epidural analgesia is a significant feature of the everyday experience of the delivery room.
      Its benefits on the maternal experience and in terms of security has been widely
      demonstrated.

      However, some women under epidural analgesia have experienced motor block, which has been
      found to contribute in the lengthening of the duration of labor, dystocia and instrumental
      delivery. Therefore, in recent years, reducing these side effects by modifying local
      anesthetics, concentration of local anesthetic and injected volume has been a priority, with
      one aim: optimize analgesia without motor blockage.

      Although epidural analgesia was first provided by continuous epidural infusion, the efficacy
      of intermittent epidural bolus has been demonstrated. Small regularly spaced intermittent
      boluses lead to a more extensive and symmetrical spread of local anesthetic in the epidural
      space. These findings have led to a new kind of administration combining epidural
      intermittent boluses with patient-controlled boluses called PEIB (Patient Epidural
      Intermittent Bolus). On clinical grounds, PEIB is associated with reduced local anesthetic
      consumption and higher maternal satisfaction.

      While PEIB is experimentally and clinically approved, incidence of maternal motor block and
      instrumental vaginal delivery don't decrease significantly with this programming. We
      hypothesized that automatic intermittent boluses can lead to an accumulation of local
      anesthetic overlapping with patient bolus. This accumulation can be the source of motor
      block, dystocia and instrumental delivery. Therefore, we propose to lead a monocentric
      prospective randomized study upon 308 patients in order to compare PEIB to epidural analgesia
      totally controlled by the patient. We expect a lower consumption of local anesthetic and a
      lower incidence of motor block, dystocia and instrumental delivery with the free automatic
      bolus programming.
