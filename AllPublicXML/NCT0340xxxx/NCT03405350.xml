      Observation conducted during the 21 days of treatment in the health resort of Przerzeczyn
      Zdroj. In a treatment of applied therapy: redon-sulfide baths, partial mud baths,
      kinesitherapy, terrain therapy, dry massage, laser therapy, low-frequency magnetic field,
      ultrasonotherapy, cryotherapy, electrotherapy, light therapy. Study group with joint or back
      pain due to osteoarthritis or degenerative disc disease. The control group was selected by
      the spa workers, healthy individuals, nonsmokers, who did not drink alcohol. It was
      recommended to retain the previous lifestyle and use of resort's facilities was prohibited.
      In both of these groups, appropriate pre- and post-treatment studies were performed.

      The observation was conducted during 21 days of medicinal stays in the health resort of
      Przerzeczyn Zdroj. The treatment included a comprehensive therapy: redon-sulfide baths,
      partial mud baths, kinesitherapy, terrain therapy, dry massage, laser therapy, low-frequency
      magnetic field, ultrasonotherapy, cryotherapy, electrotherapy, light therapy.

      The study group consisted of patients with joint or back pain due to osteoarthritis or
      degenerative disc disease.participating in therapy. On the day of admission to the SPA the
      patients were subjected to subjective and objective examination. Laboratory tests (lipids
      profile, CRP, smear blood morphology, TAS- total antioxidative potential, the concentration
      of endorphins and serotonin, bilirubin, uric acid, albumin) were performed before treatment
      on day 5 and after 18 days. In addition, before and after treatment, standard scales were
      used to assess pain intensity VAS scale and anxiety and depression levels - HADS scale.

    <measure>Pain Index</measure>
    <time_frame>on day 5 and after 18 days</time_frame>
    <description>VAS scale (The visual analogue scale) It is a psychometric response scale which can be used in questionnaires. It is a measurement instrument for subjective characteristics or attitudes that cannot be directly measured. When responding to a VAS item, respondents specify their level of agreement to a statement by indicating a position along a continuous line between two end-points. This continuous (or &quot;analogue&quot;) aspect of the scale differentiates it from discrete scales such as the Likert scale. There is evidence showing that visual analogue scales have superior metrical characteristics than discrete scales, thus a wider range of statistical methods can be applied to the measurements.</description>

    <measure>Anxiety and Depression Index</measure>
    <time_frame>on day 5 and after 18 days</time_frame>
    <description>HADS scale (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale) It was originally developed by Zigmond and Snaith (1983)and is commonly used by doctors to determine the levels of anxiety and depression that a patient is experiencing. The HADS is a fourteen item scale that generates ordinal data. Seven of the items relate to anxiety and seven relate to depression. Zigmond and Snaith created this outcome measure specifically to avoid reliance on aspects of these conditions that are also common somatic symptoms of illness, for example fatigue and insomnia or hypersomnia. This, it was hoped, would create a tool for the detection of anxiety and depression in people with physical health problems.</description>
