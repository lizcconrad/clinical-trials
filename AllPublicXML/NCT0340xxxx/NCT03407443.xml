    <textblock>
      This pilot study seeks to determine if exposure to the Make the Connection campaign messages
      developed by the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) is associated with changes in
      mental-health related outcomes, specifically: (1) psychosocial determinants that drive help
      seeking behaviors (knowledge, attitudes and intentions); and (2) perceived barriers to
      seeking care. Participants are randomly assigned to message exposure or control (no exposure)
      conditions. Data from this project will inform mental health education and outreach efforts
      targeted towards Veterans experiencing mental health concerns.

    <description>The 6-item stigma Scale developed by Britt et al. (2000; 2008) to assess stigma of accessing treatment for psychological problems among military personnel is used w/a 5 point likert scale (1=strongly disagree to 5=strongly agree). Logistical barriers to care are also assessed using the 5-item Barriers to Care scale (Hoge et al. 2004) to assess barriers to accessing psychological treatment w/ a 5 point likert scale (1=strongly disagree; 5= strongly agree). Higher values represent a worse outcome (e.g., higher endorsement of stigma).</description>

  <other_outcome>
    <measure>change in social support</measure>
    <time_frame>change from baseline behavior at 16 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>self-report survey using the multidimensional scale of perceived social support (Zimmet et al. 1990). This is a 12-item scale of perceived social support from family and friends. Each item is scored 1-7 on a likert scale (1=very strongly disagree; 7=very strongly agree) and summed with a possible range of 7 to 84. Higher scores indicate higher awareness/belief of social support.</description>
