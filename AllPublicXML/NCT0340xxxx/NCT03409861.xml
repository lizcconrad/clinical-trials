  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A wristband device intended for use as a standalone device, designed for the measurement of
      intermittent blood pressure, as well as other physiological signals. The device is intended
      to be worn in day to day life by individuals suffering from hypertension or other conditions
      where monitoring of blood pressure is of importance.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The device is intended to be worn on the wrist for intermittent measurements of vital signs
      such as HR, blood pressure, Skin temperature and activity.

      The use does not require any special action from the user apart form wearing the band on
      either their left or right wrist. The device applies no inflatable mechanics or moving parts.
      The waistband is watertight and can be worn as any type of bracelet all the time of most of
      the time.

      The study will focus on patients in intensive care or any other cardiology unit who are under
      continuous oversight of existing Invasive (A-line Gold Standard monitors
