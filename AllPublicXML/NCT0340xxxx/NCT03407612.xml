  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to measure whether CPM (continuous passive motion) usage
      improves outcomes following arthroscopic hip surgery that includes labral repair.
      Investigators tested the hypothesis that CPM usage reduces pain levels and pain medication
      use and improves function in individuals who undergo hip arthroscopy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Subjects undergoing primary hip arthroscopy for acetabular labral repair were randomized to
      determine whether they would receive a CPM. Those subjects receiving a CPM were instructed to
      use it for 4-6 hours daily throughout the first two postoperative weeks. The total number of
      pain medications and average pain scores over the two weeks, as well as Hip Outcome Score
      Activity of Daily Living (HOS ADL) scores at standard time points were compared via a two
      sample t-test and intention-to-treat analysis.

    <description>These subjects received a continuous passive motion (CPM) device and were instructed to use it for 4-6 hours daily throughout the first two postoperative weeks following their arthroscopic labral repair. They were provided adequate education on how to operate the device. The subjects recorded their average usage of the CPM, as well as their personal perception of the CPM, at the postoperative 2 day, 7 day, and 14 day marks.</description>
