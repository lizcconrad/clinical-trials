    <measure>Neck disability index (NDI)</measure>
    <time_frame>2 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>10-item, 50-point index that assesses different aspects of daily functioning in patients with neck pain. It assesses four items regarding subjective symptoms (pain intensity, headache, concentration, sleeping), four items regarding activities of daily living (lifting, work, driving, recreation), and two items regarding discretionary activities of daily living (personal care, reading). Each item is scored 0 to 5, with the total reported as either a raw score (0-50) or as a percentage score. Higher values represent a worse outcome.</description>

    <measure>Shoulder pain disability index (SPADI)</measure>
    <time_frame>2 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Self-administered questionnaire, grouping 13 questions, 5 of which measure the severity of pain caused by various arm movements involving the shoulder, the pain being assessed on a numeric pain scale ranging from 0 to 10. Eight additional questions related to functional impairments of the shoulder are assessed with a numeric scale. Higher values represent a worse outcome.</description>
