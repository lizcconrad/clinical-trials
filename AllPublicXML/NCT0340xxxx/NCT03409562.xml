  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the present study is to evaluate whether the addition of two pain
      neurophysiology education sessions to motor control training may result in an improvement of
      the outcome measures of pain and disability, compared to motor control training alone.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Sixty-two subjects with unspecific low-back pain were randomly recruited for the present
      study. The subjects were randomly allocated to a control group (which received only motor
      control training) and an intervention group (which underwent two pain neurophysiology
      education sessions prior to motor control training). Primary outcome measures were pain
      (measured with the Visual Analogical Scale) and disability (measured with the Oswestry
      Disability Index). Secondary outcome measures are kinesiophobia (Tampa Scale for
      Kinesiophobia), the global perceived effect (Global Perceived Effect Scale) and quality of
      life (SF-12). These will be measured before the intervention, at the end of the intervention
      and 3 months after ending the intervention.
