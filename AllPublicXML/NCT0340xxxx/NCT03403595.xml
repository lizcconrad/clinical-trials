      This is an open-label, non-controlled, non-randomized study to assess the safety and measure
      image-based absorbed dose of 177Lu-EB-PSMA-617 in patients with metastatic
      castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) who will undergo radioliagnd therapy using
      177Lu-EB-PSMA-617. All patients underwent whole-body 68Ga-PSMA PET/CT for selection and
      accepted intravenous injection with single dose 0.80-1.1 GBq (21.5-30 mCi) of
      177Lu-EB-PSMA-617 within one week, then monitored at 2, 24, 72, 120 and 168 h after
      177Lu-EB-PSMA617 administration with serial whole body planar and SPECT/CT imaging.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Prostate cancer is the most frequent malignant tumor in men worldwide. Prostate-specific
      membrane antigen (PSMA), is a surface molecule specifically expressed by prostate tumors
      which was shown to be a valid target for radiotherapy. 177Lu-PSMA-617, a urea-based compound,
      provide an effective target for the treatment of metastatic castration-resistant prostate
      cancer. However, a major problem in the therapeutic use of 177Lu-PSMA-617 has been its short
      half-life and fast rate of clearance. This study was designed to investigate the safety,
      dosimetry and preliminary effects of 177Lu-EB-PSMA-617 in patients with metastatic
      castration-resistant prostate cancer.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  All the patients had progressive metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer that
             did not respond to androgen-suppression therapy and/or systemic chemotherapy. Distant
             metastases with high PSMA expression were confirmed on 68Ga-PSMA PET/CT within one
             week before the injection of 177Lu-EB-PSMA-617.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  The exclusion criteria were a serum creatinine level of more than 150 μmol per liter,
             a hemoglobin level of less than 10.0 g/dl, a white-cell count of less than 4.0× 109/L,
             a platelet count of less than 100 × 109/L, a total bilirubin level of more than 3
             times the upper limit of the normal range and a serum albumin level of more than 3.0 g
             per deciliter, cardiac insufficiency including carcinoid heart valve disease, a severe
             allergy or hypersensitivity to radiographic contrast material, claustrophobia, and
