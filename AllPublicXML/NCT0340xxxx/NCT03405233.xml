      this randomized controlled trial will compare the double vein cuffed synthetic arteriovenous
      graft to the single vein cuffed synthetic and the non cuffed synthetic as regard to long-term
      patency of each modality

      End-stage renal disease (ESRD) arises from many heterogeneous disease pathways that alter the
      function and structure of the kidney irreversibly, over months or years.End-stage renal
      disease (ESRD) arises from many heterogeneous disease pathways that alter the function and
      structure of the kidney irreversibly, over months or years. Haemodialysis (HD) is a lifeline
      therapy for patients with ESRD. A proportion of hemodialysis patients exhaust all options for
      permanent vascular access (fistula or graft) in both upper extremities.ePTFE grafts are
      easily subjected to graft outflow tract intimal hyperplasia, which may lead to graft outlet
      stenosis and graft thrombosis after a certain period of usage. The commonest cause of PTFE
      graft failure is intimal hyperplasia (IH) at the venous anastomoses. our study aims to
      evaluate the influence of double cuffed ePTFE grafts with autologous vein cuffs on the
      long-term patency of dialysis access, and compare the clinical patency and the complications
      occurring with the usage of the double cuffed graft to that with standard non cuffed grafts
      in chronic renal hemodialysis therapy.

      this randomized controlled trial will compare the double vein cuffed synthetic arteriovenous
      graft to the single vein cuffed synthetic and the non cuffed synthetic as regard to long term
      patency of each modality
