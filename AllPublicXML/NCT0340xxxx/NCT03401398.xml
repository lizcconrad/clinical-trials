      SHIPSS is a multi-institutional, prospective, controlled, randomized, double-blinded
      interventional trial that will examine the potential benefits and risks of adjunctive
      hydrocortisone prescribed for children with fluid and vasoactive-inotropic refractory septic
      shock.

      It is hypothesized that adjunctive hydrocortisone will significantly reduce the proportion of
      children with poor outcomes, defined as death or severely impaired health-related quality of
      life, as assessed at 28 days following admission to a pediatric intensive care unit for the
      sepsis event.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Sepsis represents the most common cause of childhood mortality worldwide. In the United
      States alone, 21,000-42,000 cases of pediatric sepsis occur annually, with an associated
      hospital mortality rate of 5-10% and health care expenditures now approaching $5 billion
      annually. Moreover, nearly 40% of children admitted to pediatric intensive care units (PICUs)
      for septic shock have not regained their baseline health-related quality of life one year
      following the sepsis event.

      During early resuscitation of the child with septic shock, in addition to antibiotics, volume
      replacement, and vasoactive-inotropic support, the most recent pediatric treatment guidelines
      advise the practitioner to consider adjunctive hydrocortisone therapy if the patient &quot;is at
      risk of absolute adrenal insufficiency or adrenal pituitary axis failure&quot;. However, the
      potential benefits and risks of this recommendation have not been rigorously examined. On the
      one hand, corticosteroids are inexpensive and have been frequently demonstrated to improve
      hemodynamic status in children and adults with sepsis. Conversely, this drug class is known
      to alter transcription of approximately 30% of the human genome. Notably, corticosteroids
      down regulate most aspects of the immune response, but particularly adaptive immunity.
      Moreover, recent data suggests that children with particular gene expression profiles in
      sepsis have increased likelihood of mortality when treated with corticosteroids.

      SHIPSS (Stress Hydrocortisone In Pediatric Septic Shock) is a prospective, randomized,
      double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial examining the potential benefits and risks of
      adjunctive hydrocortisone prescribed to critically ill children with fluid and
      vasoactive-inotropic refractory septic shock. Up to 1,032 children will be enrolled,
      randomized, and evaluated at baseline, PICU discharge, and 28 and 90 days following PICU
      admission for the septic shock event.

      The primary hypothesis is that hydrocortisone, compared to placebo, will decrease the
      proportion of subjects with poor outcomes, defined as death or severely impaired (≥25%
      decrease from baseline) health-related quality of life. The investigators will also follow
      subjects to detect side effects of the treatment. Finally, the investigators will test the
      hypothesis that biomarker-based prognostic and predictive enrichment strategies can improve
      our ability to identify which children with septic shock are more likely to benefit from
      adjunctive hydrocortisone, and which may be harmed. This RCT will have a significant impact
      on public health by providing the heretofore missing evidence to inform guidelines regarding
      therapy for septic shock in children.

    <ipd_description>Per NIH policy, the SHIPSS investigators will provide a de-identified dataset and all the data-related documentation necessary to utilize the study data (dictionary, calculated variables, and standard operating procedures) to the NIH no later than 3 years after the final 90-day assessment or 2 years after the primary paper has been published, whichever comes first. The investigators will submit this dataset to the NICHD data repository, Data and Specimen Hub (DASH). In addition, final datasets and statistical analyses will be archived.</ipd_description>
