  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study was to compare the temperature changes of the upper extremities
      when using local anesthetic of various volume (4ml, 6ml, 8ml) in the ultrasound guided
      stellate ganglion block.

      One pain physician performs all US-guided stellate ganglion block(SGB)s, who is not involved
      in evaluating study variables. Electrocardiography, noninvasive blood pressure, heart rate,
      and peripheral oxygen saturation were monitored for all patients before, while, and after
      conducting procedure.

      For US-guided SGB, patients are supine positioned, and skin preparation on injection site is
      done with chlorohexidine. Procedure is conducted under ultrasound guidance at C6 level. 4ml,
      6ml, and 8ml of 1% lidocaine is injected for the each group, respectively. Syringes are
      prepared by one nurse who do not involved in other steps of this study.

      Temperature measurement is conducted 4 times (before US-guided SGB and after 10, 20, and 30m
      from SGB) at both hands, face, axillar by one person who's not involved in other measuring in
      the study.

    <description>The pain NRS is a single 11-point numeric scale. An 11-point numeric scale (NRS 11) with 0 representing one pain extreme (e.g., &quot;no pain&quot;) and 10 representing the other pain extreme (e.g., &quot;pain as bad as you can imagine&quot; and &quot;worst pain imaginable&quot;). The NRS will be administered verbally or graphically for self-completion. The respondent is asked to indicate the numeric value on the segmented scale that best describes their pain intensity. The number that the respondent indicates on the scale to rate their pain intensity is recorded. Scores range from 0-10. Higher scores indicate greater pain intensity.</description>
