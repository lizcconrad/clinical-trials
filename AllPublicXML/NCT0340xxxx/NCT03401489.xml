    <textblock>
      Program to Avoid Cerebrovascular Events through Systematic Electronic Tracking and Tailoring
      of an Eminent Risk-factor (PACESETTER) aims to assess the incorporation of its stroke
      intervention into all 3 safety net/academic health sytems in a given US state especially
      burdened by stroke, thereby enhancing knowledge about the complexity of stroke interventions,
      and especially the nature of the challenges encountered in low resource settings and for
      populations traditionally underrepresented in research. Altogether, the intervention, if
      proven implementable and effective, may eventually be exported to other medically underserved
      populations in the US beyond SC as a feasible model of post-stroke management.

    <description>Patients will be given a Viaca electronic pill tray &amp; blue-toothed UA-767 Plus BT BP device and the PACESETTER app installed on their smart phone for automatic relay of BP data. The Vaica tray emits a blinking light for 30 minutes when it is time to take the meds. If the compartment is not opened and emptied, an intermittent chime ensues for 30 minutes. If the compartment is not opened and emptied, the subject /caregiver receives an automated SMS or email. PACESETTERs will be given a questionnaire. Responses will be used to generate personalized motivational &amp; reinforcement messages guided by self-determination theory constructs of competence &amp; autonomous regulation. In addition, PACESETTERs will receive 30-45 second auditory or text messages 2 times per week on HTN/stroke facts, importance of med adherence, tips on expressing questions/concerns with physician. We will calculate medication possession ratios, on all subjects' HTN medications at each evaluation.</description>
