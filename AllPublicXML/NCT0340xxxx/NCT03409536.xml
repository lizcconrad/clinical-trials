    <textblock>
      Brachial plexus block is a common regional anesthesia technique which is performed by
      anesthesiologists to anesthetize the arm for surgery. In this study, we are investigating the
      relationship between the nerve conduction (induced by brachial plexus block) and the
      patients' symptoms before and after the brachial plexus block. We will attach a nerve
      conduction device (SSEP device) to monitor the patients' arm conduction and we will assess
      the patients' symptoms simultaneously.

    <textblock>
      Perioperative peripheral nerve injury (PNI) is an under-recognized and under-investigated
      complication of general anesthesia and continues to impact postoperative recovery resulting
      in patient disability malpractice claims.(1-5) In the American Society of Anesthesiologists
      (ASA) Closed Claims Analysis (published in 1999), PNI was the second most common cause of
      claims other than death. (6-7) This claim pattern has remained essentially unchanged over the
      past 3 decades and the average settlement was $123,000 USD/claim (unpublished data from ASA
      closed claims analysis). The overall incidence of PNI varies across different surgical
      procedures, and it is significantly affected by the underlying patient comorbidities and
      pre-existing peripheral neuropathy. Despite considerable implications of PNI to both the
      patients and clinicians, little progress has been made in the past three decades in
      developing a reliable intraoperative monitoring technique for its early detection and
      prevention. SSEP monitoring has long been used in neurology as a means to diagnosis
      peripheral neuropathy, and has been used for the early detection of intraoperative PNI caused
      by improper patient positioning. A few retrospective studies have found that reversal of
      intraoperative SSEP signal changes (e.g. correct the patient's arm position in the event of a
      positioning related peripheral nerve compromise) prevented postoperative neuropathy,
      suggesting SSEP could be used to detect intraoperative PNI and that prompt intervention could
      reverse neurological injury (8-10). However, to date, there has not been a study that clearly
      defines how the magnitudes of SSEP changes relate to the severity of peripheral nerve
      dysfunction. Due to this lack of information, the current thresholds that are used for
      diagnosing PNI in a variety of surgical procedures are largely based on the results of SSEP
      monitoring in spinal cord injury. The traditional diagnostic criteria (used in spinal cord
      injury) might not be applicable for PNI. Fundamentally, there is also a lack of a clinical
      study that defines significant and non-significant changes for PNI. Most current available
      evidence regarding SSEP in PNI is retrospective and mainly derived from patients being
      monitored for spinal cord or cerebral injury during neurosurgical procedures. The lack of
      well-validated diagnostic criteria is one of the key issues in preventing the use of SSEP for
      monitoring peripheral nerves during surgery. A such, further studies are required to
      characterize the relationship between SSEP changes and peripheral nerve dysfunction, and
      re-define the threshold (or cut-off values) for significant SSEP change for PNI.

      This is a prospective cohort study to evaluate the relationship between the peripheral nerve
      dysfunction, and SSEP signal changes in patients who will receive a brachial plexus block for
      their surgical procedure. Brachial plexus block is a regional anesthesia technique routinely
      performed by anesthesiologists where the nerves in the arm are blocked with local anesthetics
      to prohibit movement and sensation. In LHSC, the average brachial plexus block performed is
      around 10-15 patients/day for various upper limb surgeries. In this study, the patients with
      brachial plexus block will be used as a model of brachial plexus injury to assess the
      relationship between intraoperative brachial plexus injury and the SSEP changes. Brachial
      plexus block in awake patients is an attractive model to study brachial plexus injury,
      because it provides transient and progressive de-afferentation state of brachial plexus
      dysfunction (mimicking brachial plexus injury), allows for real-time assessment of the
      relationship between clinical symptoms and SSEP changes (awake patients), and overcomes
      obvious practical limitations of investigating intraoperative PNI (small sample size of
      patients with intraoperative brachial plexus injury). In this study, 50 consecutive patients
      who required a brachial plexus block for their surgery, will be recruited. This study will be
      performed in the &quot;Block Room&quot; of either LHSC or SJHC. After obtaining informed consent, an
      independent assessor (hand specialist) will perform a baseline assessment of the sensory and
      motor function of the upper limb. Sensory function will be quantified by a two point
      discrimination test in each dermatome. Motor function will be quantified by motor score in
      each myotome. The patients will be attached to the automated SSEP monitor to obtain baseline
      upper limb SSEP signals. Median, ulnar and radial nerves will be monitored. After
      satisfactory baseline SSEP recordings have been obtained, a brachial plexus block will be
      performed in the usual fashion to achieve complete sensory and motor blockage (approx. 30
      min). This provides a unique experimental condition to assess the relationship between the
      brachial plexus dysfunction and the SSEP signal changes. An independent assessor (hand
      specialist) will re-assess the patients' sensory and motor function every 5 minutes (up to 30
      minutes during the onset of the block). SSEP recording will be concomitantly obtained. A
      total of 300 data pairs (6 data pairs for each patient) will be obtained for analysis. In
      this study, we will use the Evoked Potential Assessment Device (EPAD®, SafeOp Surgical, Hunt
      Valley, MD) SSEP machine. It is a novel, simplified, automated SSEP monitoring device (FDA
      approved), designed to detect intraoperative PNI. The key features of EPAD® are that only the
      surface adhesive electrodes (i.e. no subdermal needle electrodes) will be used, as well as
      there is newly artifact rejection and optimization alogrithm that permit SSEP recording in
      awake patients. We have previously assessed this device in a pilot study.

      Prior to performing the brachial plexus block in the &quot;Block room&quot;, a complete neurological
      examination will be performed including motor score and 2-point discrmination test. Eligible
      patients will be recruited after obtained informed consent. The baseline SSEP of the
      participants will be recorded using the EPAD@ device. After the participants received the
      brachial plexus block (as part of their standard of care), we will monitor the progressive
      changes of SSEP signals while the effect of brachial plexus block gradually onset (usually
      takes around 30 minutes). An independent assessor (hand specialist blinded to the SSEP
      results) will concomitantly re-assess the patients' sensory and motor function every 5
      minutes (up to 30 minutes during the onset of the block).

      The primary analysis will be on describing the relationship between severity of the
      neurological deficits (impaired sensory and/or motor function) and SSEP changes (amplitude
      and/or latency changes). Secondarily, an optimal cut-off limit using Youden index and/or
      logistic regression-derived likelihood ratio functions will be determined. A ROC curve for
      the new cut-off limits will be assessed. REDCapTM will be used for electronic data collection
      and STAT (version 14) will be used for statistical analysis in all the studies. We will
      compare these new cut-off limits in comparison with conventional criteria in our subsequent
      clinical studies.
