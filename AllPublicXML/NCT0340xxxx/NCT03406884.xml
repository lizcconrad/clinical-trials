  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Male or female neonates, &lt; 28 days (inclusive) diagnosed with hypoplastic left heart syndrome
      (HLHS) undergoing Stage I surgery. A total of 30 patients will be enrolled for this pilot
      study in a staged enrollment diagnosed with HLHS.All patients will be followed for 12 months
      post-treatment.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      All subjects with the diagnosis of hypoplastic left heart syndrome (HLHS) undergo a
      palliative reconstructive surgery performed in the first two weeks of life, termed the
      Norwood procedure. The second stage in the palliation of HLHS is a scheduled bidirectional
      cavopulmonary anastomosis (BDCPA) that occurs between 4 to 6 months of age. During this
      surgery when the patient is on cardiopulmonary bypass for the BDCPA, the study product will
      be given from the previously harvested, isolated, and expanded autologous c-kit+ cardiac stem
      cells into the aorta directly through the cardioplegia needle into the coronary circulation.

      In summary, the aim is to overlay a novel cell therapeutic strategy on the two-stage surgical
      procedures that HLHS patients typically undergo in the first year of life: Stage I Norwood
      operation in the neonatal period and Stage II BDPCA operation at approximately 4 months of
      age.
