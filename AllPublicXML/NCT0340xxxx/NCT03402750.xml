  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this investigation is to pilot test a medication in-hand intervention (Meds
      to Beds) compared to standard care for patients with heart failure (ICD-50[all numbers]). The
      study will evaluate if the intervention improves adherence and physical health, and reduces
      hospital re-admissions. The study will provide evidence for the feasibility and acceptability
      of the medication-in-hand intervention.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Adherence to Medication</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 30</time_frame>
    <description>Self-reported Adherence will be measured with the Adherence to Refills and Medications Scale (ARMS), a 12-item scale. Responses will be recorded on a four-point Likert scale: None of the time, Some of the time, Most of the time, or All of the time. Items on the ARMS scale are summed to a total score (12-48), with lower scores meaning better adherence (one item is reverse coded).</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Pharmacy refill Adherence to Medication</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 60</time_frame>
    <description>Medication Adherence using pharmacy refill will be calculated using the medication possession ratio method for 60 days after discharge. For each patient, refills will be tracked on prescribed medication, and the average adherence will be calculated. For members of the control group, two fills of 30-day medications will be expected (one initial fill and one refill); for those in the intervention group, one refill will be expected as they receive medications in-hand upon discharge. Data on pharmacy refill will be tracked up to 60 days post-discharge to ensure accuracy.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Health</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Day 30</time_frame>
    <description>Participants will complete the PROMIS 10, a 10-item measure of global health, in-person at baseline and over the phone approximately 30 days after discharge. Possible responses are recorded along a 5-point Likert scale of Excellent, Very Good, Good, Fair, or Poor. On the summed scale (range 10-50), higher scores mean better physical health.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Successful Medication Delivery</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 0</time_frame>
    <description>The program's feasibility will be evaluated by tracking whether medications can be successfully delivered (i.e., before discharge) to patients in the Meds to Beds condition. This measure will be evaluated as a proportion within the intervention condition.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Intervention Acceptance</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 30</time_frame>
    <description>All participants will be asked two questions about the acceptability of the program. Responses for acceptability items will be recorded on a 10-point scale (1, very unsatisfactory - 10, very satisfactory).</description>
