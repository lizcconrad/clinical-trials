  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The INTEGA study assesses therapy Options for advanced or metastatic esophagogastric
      Adenocarcinoma in patients overexpressing human epidermal receptor type 2 (HER2 positive
      patients). Current treatment options in this situation include chemotherapy based palliative
      treatment in combination withTrastuzumab.

      Recent studies have shown that immunotherapy with Nivolumab or Ipilimumab after previous
      chemotherapy can also improve survival in esophagogastric cancer.

      This study assesses the efficacy of two experimental first line treatment strategies: A)
      Chemo-free immunotherapy with Trastuzumab, Nivolumab and Ipilimumab and B) addition of
      Nivolumab to the standard regimen (FOLFOX chemotherapy and Trastuzumab).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Gastric cancer is the fifth most common cancer in the world, and the third leading cause of
      cancer death in both sexes worldwide.

      Surgical resection is currently the only curative treatment option for gastric cancer;
      however, ~50% of patients have metastatic disease at the time of diagnosis and chemotherapy
      is the mainstay of palliation in this setting.

      Trastuzumab, in combination with chemotherapy, significantly improved survival in patients
      with overexpression of HER2.

      In regard of the very limited therapeutic landscape of HER2 positive EGA, compared to breast
      cancer, further treatment options to relevantly improve the outcome is warranted. The
      integration of check-point inhibitors (e.g. Nivolumab, Ipilimumab) into the first line
      setting either within a chemotherapy-free combination arm or within an intensified standard
      arm of FOLFOX and trastuzumab with nivolumab may be able to improve the current limited
      survival of median 14 months.

The QLQ-C30 is composed of multi-item scales and single-item measures, including five functional scales, three symptom scales, a global health status / QoL scale, and six single items.
All of the scales and single-item measures have a score range from 0 to 100. A high score shows a high response level. A high score for a functional scale represents a high / healthy level of functioning, a high score for the global health status / QoL represents a high QoL, but a high score for a symptom scale / item represents a high level of symptomatology / problems</description>

The single-item subscales include questions related to four gastric cancer-specific symptoms: dry mouth, body image, hair loss, and problems with taste. Items are assessed on a 4-level numerical scale with 1= &quot;not at all&quot;, 2= &quot;a little&quot;, 3= &quot;quite a bit&quot;, and 4= &quot;very much&quot;. Scores are linearly converted and summated into a scaled score from 0 to 100, with a higher score representing a worse QOL.</description>

             carcinoma in situ of the cervix, basal or squamous cell skin cancer, localized
             prostate cancer treated surgically with curative intent, ductal carcinoma in situ
             treated surgically with curative intent)

          2. Subjects with untreated known CNS metastases. Subjects are eligible if CNS metastases
             are adequately treated and subjects are neurologically returned to baseline (except
             for residual signs or symptoms related to the CNS treatment) for at least 2 weeks

             and idarubicin &gt; 90 mg/m2, other (e.g., liposomal doxorubicin or other anthracycline
             greater than the equivalent of 360 mg/m2 of doxorubicin). If more than one
             anthracycline has been used, then the cumulative dose must not exceed the equivalent
             of 360 mg/m2 of doxorubicin

          4. Baseline LVEF value &lt; 55%, assessed by echocardiogram [ECHO], multigated acquisition

             alopecia) not requiring systemic treatment are permitted to enroll. For any cases of
             uncertainty, it is recommended that the medical monitor be consulted prior to signing
             informed consent.

          6. Subjects with a condition requiring systemic treatment with either corticosteroids (&gt;

             days of study drug administration. Inhaled or topical steroids, and adrenal
             replacement doses &gt; 10 mg daily prednisone equivalents are permitted in the absence of
             active autoimmune disease.

             risk based on investigator's judgment are acceptable.

          9. Any serious or uncontrolled medical disorder or active infection that, in the opinion
             of the investigator, may increase the risk associated with study participation, study
             drug administration, or would impair the ability of the subject to receive study drug.

         10. Significant acute or chronic infections including, among others:

               -  Any positive test for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) or known acquired
