  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sub arachnoid hemorrhage consecutive to intracranial aneurysm rupture is a devastating
      disease. Predictors of intracranial aneurysm rupture are limited and focus mainly on size and
      location. Platelet activation may have a deleterious role on aneurysm rupture. The assumption
      is that patients with ruptured intracranial aneurysm will present a higher rate of platelet
      activation compared to patients with non ruptured aneurysms.

    <description>In case of an endovascular treatment :
A blood sample (venous or arterial) of 10 ml will be taken at the beginning of the procedure, an intra aneurysmal blood sample (1mL) will be taken during the procedure and a blood sample (arterial) of 1 mL will be taken at the end of the procedure.
Iterative blood samples (arterial) of 10 mL will be taken at each follow up visit.
In case of a surgery treatment :
A blood sample (venous or arterial) of 10 ml will be taken at the beginning of the surgery.
A Tissue sample will be taken during the surgery
Iterative blood samples (arterial) of 10 mL will be taken at each follow up visit.</description>
