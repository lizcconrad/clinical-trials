  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a clinical trial of Microbiota Transplant Therapy (MTT) for adults with autism
      spectrum disorders (ASD) who have gastrointestinal problems.

      Previous research has shown that individuals with ASD have a low diversity of gut bacteria,
      and low diversity is generally associated with poor gastrointestinal (GI) health. We
      previously found that MTT therapy for children with ASD and GI symptoms was helpful in
      reducing their GI symptoms, reducing their ASD symptoms, and increasing their diversity of
      gut bacteria.

      This clinical trial will investigate the hypothesis that MTT therapy will be helpful for
      adults with ASD who have GI symptoms.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      For adults ages 18-60 years with ASD and gastrointestinal problems, the investigators propose
      a Phase 2 clinical trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of MTT. The study will also
      determine if longer treatment is beneficial, and to conduct a longer observation after
      treatment stops to determine long-term safety and efficacy. The three parts of this trial are
      described below.

      Part 1: Placebo-Controlled Treatment The trial will begin with a randomized, double-blind,
      placebo-controlled trial which will include a 2-week treatment with oral vancomycin (or
      placebo), then 1 day of Moviprep to cleanse the bowel of vancomycin and bacteria/feces (all
      participants, since its bowel-emptying effect cannot be blinded), followed by oral
      administration of Full Spectrum Microbiota (FSM) or placebo. An initial high dose of FSM (or
      placebo) for two days will be followed by a lower maintenance dose of FSM (or placebo) for 8
      weeks.

      Part 2 Extension and Cross-Over

        -  For the treatment group from Part 1, there will be an 8-week extension of the
           maintenance dose, to determine if longer treatment has additional benefits.

        -  For the placebo group from Part 1, they will receive MoviPrep, an initial high dose of
           FSM for 2 days, and then a lower dose of FSM for 8 weeks (similar to the treatment group
           in Part 1, but without the vancomycin). This will help us determine if pre-treatment
           with vancomycin is needed or not.

      Part 3: Follow-up There will be follow-up evaluations at 6, 12, and 18 months after treatment
      is stopped, to assess long-term efficacy and possible adverse effects.
