      This study will evaluate the safety of CssBA Â± dmLT given by intramuscular (IM) injection.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, Phase 1 clinical trial in which a total of 50 subjects will receive
      three injections of either CssBA alone, dmLT alone or CssBA + dmLT. The vaccine will be
      administered via IM injection to alternating deltoid regions on days 0, 21 and 42. Each
      subject will receive the same dose at each vaccination dependent upon group assignment. Group
      A is considered a pilot group in which all 3 doses will be administered and subjects
      monitored for safety 7 days after the third vaccination, prior to the enrollment of subjects
      in Group B.

          1. Healthy, adult, male or female, age 18 to 45 years (inclusive) at the time of
             enrollment.

          2. Completion and review of comprehension test (achieved &gt; 70% accuracy).

          3. Signed informed consent document.

          4. Available for the required follow-up period and scheduled clinic visits.

          5. Women: Negative pregnancy test with understanding (through informed consent process)
             to not become pregnant during the study or within three (3) months following last
             vaccination.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Health problems (for example, intercurrent febrile illness, chronic medical conditions
             such as psychiatric conditions, diabetes mellitus, hypertension or any other condition
             that might place the subject at increased risk of adverse events) - study clinicians,
             in consultation with the PI, will use clinical judgment on a case-by-case basis to
             assess safety risks under this criterion. The PI will consult with the Research
             Monitor as appropriate.

          2. Clinically significant abnormalities on physical examination.

          3. Immunosuppressive drugs (use of systemic corticosteroids or chemotherapeutics that may
             influence antibody development) or illness (including IgA deficiency, defined by serum

          7. Clinically significant abnormalities on basic laboratory screening.

          8. Exclusionary skin disease history/findings that would confound assessment or prevent
             appropriate local monitoring of AEs, or possibly increase the risk of a local AE

          9. History of chronic skin disease (clinician judgement)

         10. Acute skin infection/eruptions on the upper arms including fungal infections, severe
             acne or active contact dermatitis

         11. Allergies that may increase the risk of AEs

         12. Regular use (weekly or more often) of antidiarrheal, anti-constipation, or antacid
             therapy

         13. Abnormal stool pattern (fewer than 3 stools per week or more than 3 stools per day) on
             a regular basis; loose or liquid stools on other than an occasional basis

         14. History of microbiologically confirmed ETEC or cholera infection in the last 3 years

         15. Travel to countries where ETEC or V. cholerae or other enteric infections are endemic
             (most of the developing world) within 3 years prior to dosing (clinician judgement)

         16. Symptoms consistent with Travelers' Diarrhea or concurrent with travel to countries
             where ETEC infection is endemic (most of the developing world) within 3 years prior to
             dosing, OR planned travel to endemic countries during the length of the study

         17. Vaccination for or ingestion of ETEC, cholera, or E. coli heat labile toxin within 3
             years prior to dosing

         18. Occupation involving handling of ETEC or V. cholerae currently, or in the past 3 years
