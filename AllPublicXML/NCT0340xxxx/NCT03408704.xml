  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators have developed an antibiotic stewardship program (ASP) to increase
      adherence to the Swedish guidelines for managing patients with a sore throat. This is a
      randomized controlled trial where primary health care centers are randomised to get the ASP
      or not. The adherence to the Swedish guidelines are measured in all participating centers.

      The investigators have developed an antibiotic stewardship program (ASP) to increase
      adherence to the Swedish guidelines for managing patients with a sore throat. This is a
      randomized controlled trial where primary health care centers are randomised to get the ASP
      or not. The adherence to the Swedish guidelines are measured in all participating centers 6
      months before and after implementation of the ASP. The ASP consists of educational meetings
      at the clinic for medical practitioners and nurses being informed about current guidelines,
      seeing their clinics adherence to the guidelines as well as discussing cases.
