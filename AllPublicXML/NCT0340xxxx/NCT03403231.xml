    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate a VA MyHealtheVet Secure Messaging intervention that uses different
      intervention messaging strategies designed to increase engagement in behaviors to prevent
      type 2 diabetes.

      The investigators will enroll 144 eligible Veterans into a 12-week MyHealtheVet Secure
      Messaging intervention. Eligible Veterans include those who are currently using MyHealtheVet
      secure messaging, meet inclusion/exclusion criteria, and have received an HbA1c test within
      the last 6 months that meets the ADA/CDC classification for prediabetes. Study participants
      will be surveyed about their engagement in behaviors to prevent TDM2 and mediators of this
      engagement. After completing a baseline survey, participants will be randomly assigned to
      receive different novel presentations of information about ways to prevent T2DM through both
      Secure Messaging and US Mail. The investigators will test the 5 presentations that each: (1)
      represent an innovative approach from behavioral economics or health psychology with great
      promise to increase engagement in behaviors to prevent T2DM among patients with prediabetes;
      and (2) have not been tested in this setting.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There is tremendous national enthusiasm for translating and disseminating efficacious
      strategies to prevent type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Yet, little attention has been devoted
      to how the investigators can better leverage the processes through which patients receive
      information about prevention of T2DM to better engage them in such prevention. Further,
      despite efforts to disseminate structured programs, many patients at high risk for developing
      T2DM may still be unable or unwilling to access them. In these cases, increasing patient
      engagement in individually directed lifestyle change or pharmacotherapy is critical.
      Strategies developed in the fields of behavioral economics and health psychology hold
      significant promise for improving Veteran engagement in each of these approaches. To date,
      however, these strategies have rarely been translated into real-world settings where they
      could benefit Veterans. This novel work will address this critical gap and could transform
      communication with Veterans about prevention in ways that will improve their health outcomes.

      The following 5 strategies will be implemented in the weekly messages that study participants
      will receive: (1) tailoring to aspirations in life; (2) implementation intentions; (3)
      preference checklists; (4) urgency framing; (5) social norms. The investigators will
      implement these strategies alone and in combination in a 16-arm factorial design experiment.
