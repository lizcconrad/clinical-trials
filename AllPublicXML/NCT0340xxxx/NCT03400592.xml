      The trial aims to evaluate the efficacy and safety of adding nimotuzumab to irinotecan after
      failure of first-line treatment in recurrent or metastatic gastric adenocarcinoma with
      overexpression of EGFR, and search for the effective biomarkers for nimotuzumab efficacy in
      gastric cancer.

      The sample size was calculated using Simon's 2-stage design. The first stage require at least
      4 or more out of 19 patients to have a confirmed partial or complete response (assuming P1 =
      0.30, P0 = 0.10, with alpha = 0.05 and beta = 0.2) before proceeding to the second stage, in
      which additional 36 patients were needed. If a total of 15 or more patients achieve a
      confirmed objective response, then the primary end-point would have been met. The predicted
      response rate in this study is at least 30%. Blood and tissue samples are required to collect
      at baseline, response and disease progression.
