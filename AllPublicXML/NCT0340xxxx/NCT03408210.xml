      RATIONALE: Giving chemotherapy and total marrow and lymphoid irradiation before allogeneic
      hematopoietic cell transplant helps stop the growth of leukemia cells. It may also stop the
      patient's immune system from rejecting the donor's stem cells. When the healthy stem cells
      from a donor are infused into the patient they may achieve brand new hematopoietic recovery.
      Sometimes the transplanted cells from a donor can make an immune response against the body's
      normal cells, resulting in graft versus-host disease.

      PURPOSE: This study is to evaluate the toxicity and efficacy of total marrow and lymphoid
      irradiation conditioning when given together with combination chemotherapy and allogeneic
      peripheral blood stem cell transplant in treating patients with myelodysplastic syndrome or
      acute leukemia.

      Patient receives preparative therapy including cyclophosphamide and total body irradiation
      (TBI) of 10 Gy or total marrow and lymphoid irradiation (TMLI) of 12-20 Gy, and starts
      immunosuppressive therapy using cyclosporine or tacrolimus, methotrexate-based prophylaxes,
      followed by peripheral blood stem cell transplantation and granulocyte colony-stimulating
      factor administration.
