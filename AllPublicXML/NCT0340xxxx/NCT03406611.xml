  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cystathionine Beta-Synthase (CBS) Deficient Homocystinuria (CBSDH) is a rare
      autosomal-recessive metabolic condition characterized by an excess of homocysteine (Hcy) in
      the plasma, tissues and urine. It is due to reduced or absent activity of the Cystathionine
      Beta-Synthase (CBS) enzyme, and is also known as classical homocystinuria. The symptoms
      associated with CBSDH are variable in severity and time of onset across patients. Some
      affected individuals may have mild signs of the disorder; others may have multi-systemic
      involvement including potentially life-threatening complications. CBSDH can affect many
      different organ systems of the body; the four most commonly involved are the eyes, central
      nervous system, skeleton, and the vascular system.

      The current approaches to treatment of CBSDH patients include a highly restrictive diet and
      use of dietary supplements. Lifetime compliance with this diet is poor. OT-58 represents a
      novel therapeutic approach that incorporates the use of a modified version of the native,
      human CBS (hCBS) enzyme. The goal of treatment is to introduce the CBS enzyme into
      circulation, resulting in reduced Hcy levels, increased cystathionine levels and normalized
      cysteine (Cys) levels.
