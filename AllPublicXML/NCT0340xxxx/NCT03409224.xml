  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare changes in the body's self-defense (immune response)
      after two different treatments for small kidney tumors: 1) Cryoablation (freezing) therapy in
      which the tumor and a margin of normal kidney tissue are frozen and thawed twice with a
      needle probe and 2) radiofrequency ablation (RFA) in which radiofrequency energy delivered
      through a needle probe is used to heat tissue and thereby destroy a tumor.
