      The MARIEplus study is a prospective cohort of breast cancer patients recruited into the
      MARIE (Mamma Carcinoma Risk factor InvEstigation) study, a population-based case-control
      study of breast cancer conducted in two German study regions, Hansestadt Hamburg and
      Rhine-Neckar-Karlsruhe (RNK) region. Participants were identified through participating
      clinics and the Hamburg cancer registry between January 1st, 2001 and September 30th, 2005 in
      Hamburg and between August 1st, 2002 and July 31st, 2005 in the RNK study region. Patients
      were aged 50-74 years at histologically confirmed primary invasive (stages I to IV) or in
      situ breast tumor (stage 0). Comprehensive information on demographic, socio-economic, and
      lifestyle factors was collected at multiple time points: at recruitment by a standardized
      face-to-face interview and at follow-up median 6 years as well as 11 years later using
      computer assisted telephone interview.

      Vital status was assessed in 2009 and again in 2015 via the population registries and causes
      of death were obtained from death certificates and coded according to the 10th revision of
      the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems
      (ICD-10).

      Information on the clinical course was abstracted from medical records to verify clinical
      events either self-reported in follow-up interviews or reported by treating physicians.

      The studies were approved by the ethics committee of the University of Heidelberg and the
      University of Hamburg and conducted in agreement with the Helsinki Declaration. Written
      informed consent was provided by all participants at baseline and during follow-up.

      The primary objectives of this study are

        -  To assess the association of modifiable lifestyle factors and personal factors,
           including BMI, diet, physical activity, tobacco and alcohol use, menopausal hormone
           therapy, socioeconomic status, with breast cancer survival, overall and according to
           tumor type, after accounting for established prognostic factors.

        -  To examine the influence of genetic variants on breast cancer relapse and survival

        -  To assess the association of lifestyle factors and their changes in the course of
           survivorship on subsequent breast cancer prognosis.

        -  To assess the individual and combined association of inflammation/metabolic biomarkers
           as well as changes in their serum levels with subsequent breast cancer prognosis overall
           and according to tumor type.

        -  To assess whether and to what extent the associations between breast cancer prognosis
           and lifestyle factors and/or their changes are mediated by circulating biomarker levels.
