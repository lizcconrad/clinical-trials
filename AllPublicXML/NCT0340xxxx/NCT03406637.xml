  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients who received a total knee endoprosthesis BPK-S Integration between 2011 and 2013
      will be invited to participate in this PMCF study provided sufficient source data
      documentation is available regarding preoperative, intraoperative and early postoperative
      follow-up assessments.

      Only patients providing written informed consent prior to any study data collection can take
      part in the study.

      Preoperative, intraoperative and early postoperative data (3 months, 1 year and 2 years after
      implantation) will be collected retrospectively. Additional long-term follow-up of one visit
      (year 7 after implantation) will be documented prospectively.

      Only parameters assessed in clinical standard care for follow-up (implant control) visits
      will be collected for this PMCF study.

      Radiological assessment of the implanted prosthesis will only be conducted if medically
      indicated according to the investigator. No additional study related assessment will be
      performed.

      Only anonymized data will be used in this observational study to protect patient privacy. No
      personally identifiable information will be collected.
