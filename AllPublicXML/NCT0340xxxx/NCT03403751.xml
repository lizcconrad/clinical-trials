  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Phase 2 multicenter study to be conducted in up to 50 qualified participating sites in the
      United States to assess the efficacy and safety of Reltecimod vs placebo in patients with
      abdominal sepsis-associated Stage 2/3 AKI.

    <textblock>
      Phase 2 randomized, placebo controlled study assessing the efficacy (complete recovery from
      AKI) and safety of Reltecimod in patients with suspected or confirmed abdominal sepsis
      (planned or completed surgical (laparotomy or laparoscopy) or interventional radiologic
      procedures for control of underlying abdominal infection within 12 hours of evaluation by
      medical personnel), requiring intensive care unit (ICU) admission and in whom the diagnosis
      of Stage 2/3 acute kidney injury (AKI; as defined by Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes
      (KDIGO) criteria) is established at initial presentation for medical evaluation or up to 48
      hours from the suspected diagnosis of abdominal sepsis.

             medical personnel.

          2. Initial diagnosis of AKI Stage 2 or 3 according to KDIGO AKI criteria established
             either upon presentation to medical care in those patients with suspected abdominal
             sepsis or in those patients in whom the initial diagnosis of AKI is established during
             the 48 hour period from the suspected diagnosis of abdominal sepsis.

          3. Study medication must be administered within 6 hours of confirmation of onset of AKI

             diagnosis of AKI

          4. Previously diagnosed with documented AKI in the last 30 days

             time of AKI diagnosis

          6. Patient is not expected to survive throughout 28 days of study due to significant
             underlying medical condition

          7. Pregnant or lactating women
