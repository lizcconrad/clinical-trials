  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Analysis of spontaneous movements in young infants from video recordings is recommended as an
      early medical assessment tool for prediction of cerebral palsy in high-risk infants. Such
      video recording have previously been performed in follow-up programs at hospitals using semi
      standardized video set-ups. The research group behind this study develops a smart-phone
      application that makes it possible for parents to video film their infant spontaneous
      movements at home, upload and send the video for analysis at the hospital provided by
      experts. The objectives of the study are to assess the feasibility of the In-Motion app for
      video recording of infant spontaneous movements, upload and send the video to St. Olavs
      Hospital in Trondheim, Norway, for assessment, and how parents experience this. 90-120
      high-risk infants from Norway, Denmark, Belgium, USA, Great Britain and India will
      participate. Parents will record their infant spontaneous movements and answer
      questionnaires. Video quality will be evaluated by experts within the field and their use for
      computer-based assessment will be evaluated.

    <description>SUS is a 10 item questionnaire with 5 response options between 'strongly disagree' and 'strongly agree'. All values are scaled from 0 to 4 (with four being the most positive response). The range of possible values is converted from 0 to 100. A SUS score above a 68 would be considered above average.

    <description>Participants will be recruited from infants referred to the high-risk follow-up clinic at the hospital. These at-risk children are included in the regular clinical follow-up program comprising a standard examination at 3 months corrected age (fidgety general movements period). Infant/families from St. Olavs Hospital (n= 15), in Norway, Lurie Children's Hospital (n=15), Chicago, USA, Christian Medical College (n=15), Vellore, India, University of Ghent (n=15), Belgium, and Hillerød Hospital (n=30), Copenhagen, Denmark will be invited to participate.</description>
