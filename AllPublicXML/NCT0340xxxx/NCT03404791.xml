    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if TAR-200, an investigational drug-delivery
      system, is safe and tolerable in patients with muscle-invasive bladder cancer (MIBC) who are
      unfit for radical cystectomy (RC) during an 84-day induction period comprised of four
      consecutive 21-day dosing cycles.

          5. Subject must refuse or not be eligible for radiotherapy.

          6. Life expectancy of at least 4 months.

          7. Adequate bone marrow, liver, and renal function.

          8. Subjects must be willing to undergo a cystoscopy.

          9. Subjects must be willing to undergo a biopsy for assessment of clinical response.

             consent is signed until 4 weeks after treatment discontinuation. Subject's partner
             must also use barrier protection while subject is on study until 4 weeks after
             treatment discontinuation.

             seminal transfer (barrier method or abstinence) from the time consent is signed until
             4 weeks after treatment discontinuation. Subject's partner must also use barrier
             protection while subject is on study until 4 weeks after treatment discontinuation.

         14. Females of childbearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test within 21 days
             prior to Study Day 0.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Other active malignancies.

          2. Presence of any bladder or urethral anatomic feature that in the opinion of the

             tube is allowed).

          4. Evidence of bladder perforation during diagnostic cystoscopy.

             Investigator.

          7. Known hypersensitivity to gemcitabine (or other drug excipients) or chemically related
             drugs.

          8. Known hypersensitivity to the device constituent or TARIS Inserter materials.

          9. Use of an investigational product within 30 days or 5 half-lives, whichever is longer,
             preceding Study Day 0.

         10. Female subject who is lactating/breastfeeding.

         11. Difficulty providing blood samples.

         12. Unwilling or unable to provide informed consent or comply with the requirements of
