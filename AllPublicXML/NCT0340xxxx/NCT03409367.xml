  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Atopic dermatitis (AD) affects over 9 million children in the U.S. and often heralds the
      development of asthma, food allergy, skin infections and neurodevelopmental disorders. Recent
      advances identify skin barrier dysfunction to be the key initiator of AD and possibly
      allergic sensitization.

      Our central hypothesis is that daily emollient use from birth can prevent the development of
      AD in a community setting and into newborns unselected for risk. The results of a
      community-based clinical trial utilizing a pragmatic trial design will be immediately
      applicable to the population at large and will establish a new standard of care for all
      newborns.

    <textblock>
      AD affects over 9 million children in the U.S. and ranks first among all skin conditions in
      global disability burden. AD often heralds the development of several comorbidities including
      asthma, food allergy, skin infections and neurodevelopmental disorders. Because of the
      significant socioeconomic impact of atopic dermatitis and its effect on the quality of life
      of children and families, there have been decades of research focused on prevention with
      limited success. Recent advances in cutaneous biology identify epidermal defects and skin
      barrier dysfunction to be the key initiators of atopic dermatitis and possibly allergic
      sensitization. Our central hypothesis is that emollient therapy from birth can prevent the
      development of AD. The findings of this trial will support the development of evidence-based
      skin care clinical guidelines for infants that currently do not exist. Recently, our
      international multi-centered clinical trial found enhancing early skin barrier function with
      daily emollient use from birth significantly reduces the risk of AD development in high-risk
      populations by 50%. With CASCADE, we extend this work into the community setting and into
      newborns unselected for risk, so results will be immediately applicable to the population at
      large and will establish a new standard of care for all newborns.

      The specific aims are as follows:

        1. Perform a community-based pragmatic randomized controlled trial investigating whether
           daily full-body emollient application starting in the first 2 months of life prevents
           atopic dermatitis in a real-world setting. The population for this trial consists of
           newborns between 0-2monthsof age, not selected for risk. Recruitment of families will
           occur during the course of routine care within primary care offices that are members of
           practice-based research networks(PBRNs).The intervention includes general skin care
           recommendations plus full-body daily lipid-rich emollient use. The control population
           will receive general skin care advice only and refrain from daily emollient use. The
           primary outcome will be the cumulative incidence of atopic dermatitis at age 24 months
           as determined by blinded clinicians trained in the diagnosis of AD. Key secondary
           clinical outcomes include time to disease onset and incidence of self-reported food
           allergy and wheeze using parental questionnaires.

        2. As an exploratory aim, determine whether a family history of allergic disease and key
           early life exposures such as pet ownership modify the preventive effect of emollient
           therapy on atopic dermatitis. While the primary objective of this clinical trial is to
           determine the effectiveness of an emollient intervention in a real-world setting, data
           will be gathered on allergy history in the family and pet ownership-variables that may
           modify the effect of emollient therapy. Future implementation studies may target
           subpopulations found most likely to benefit from emollient intervention.

      Twenty-five primary care clinics that participate in PBRNs from Oregon, Colorado, Wisconsin
      and North Carolina are the setting for the study protocol. The expected results from this
      project would represent a major public health breakthrough with the potential for reducing
      the atopic disease burden on a global scale.

    <intervention_model_description>This is a pragmatic, multi-site, randomized community-based trial in which dyads of a parent or legal guardian (&quot;parent&quot;) and an infant age 0 to 2 months are enrolled. Participating dyads are randomly assigned to receive lipid-rich emollient with web-based instructions for daily use to infants plus routine skin care instructions (every day moisturizer group) or routine skin care instructions alone (natural skin group). Both groups will receive e-mail and text message reminders to follow protocol instructions based on their group allocation until the infant reaches 24 months old.</intervention_model_description>
    <primary_purpose>Prevention</primary_purpose>
    <masking>Triple (Care Provider, Investigator, Outcomes Assessor)</masking>
    <masking_description>Due to the nature of the intervention, it is not possible blind dyads to the intervention. Administering a placebo emollient is impossible as there are no active ingredients in the emollient and using an emollient that has no barrier improvement properties may irritate the skin. The clinician completing the final assessment will be a blinded assessor.
Clinic staff will not be informed of participant enrollment or study arm. Parents will be instructed not to disclose their treatment group to clinic staff. Clinicians and clinic staff will direct participants to follow skin care recommendations as described by the study materials.
Blinded researchers will be responsible for health record review to collect the primary outcome. At completion of health record review, researchers will complete a form measuring whether the assessor became unblinded while reviewing the record.</masking_description>
