    <textblock>
      At present, Watson for Oncology has been applied in 14 countries worldwide, including China,
      the United States, Holland, Thailand, India, Korea, Poland, Slovakia and Bangladesh. In a
      double-blind study involving 362 patients in India, treatment recommendations from Watson for
      Oncology (WFO) performed a high degree of consistency with their multidisciplinary tumor
      board. The investigators would recruit cancer patients diagnosed as lung cancer, breast
      cancer, gastric cancer, colon cancer， rectal cancer，cervical cancer or ovarian cancer
      according to the criteria of Watson for Oncology ，using the updated version of Watson for
      Oncology to explore the concordance of therapeutic regimen between WFO and physicians in the
      Affiliated Hospital of Qingdao University.

      This study was approved by the Affiliated Hospital of Qingdao University ethics committee.The
      investigators would randomly selected cancer patients, including lung cancer, breast cancer,
      gastric cancer, colon cancer，rectal cancer，cervical cancer and ovarian cancer patients, from
      the Affiliated Hospital of Qingdao University database according to the criteria of Watson
      for Oncology(supplementary materials). Case data would be extracted and input into the Watson
      system. WFO provided therapeutic recommendations in three categories: recommended, for
      consideration, and not recommended. Data would be analyzed retrospectively to compare the
      WFO's recommendations and actual therapeutic regimen in the hospital. Some actual regimen
      applications that were not available in WFO will be defined as &quot;physician's choice&quot;. Overall,
      physician's recommendations would be defined as concordant with WFO if they corresponded to
      the recommended or consideration categories and as non-concordant if they corresponded to the
      not recommended or not available categories.
