    <textblock>
      Patient's pain level and narcotic requirements will be evaluated after routine outpatient
      Otolaryngology procedures. This will be done by having study participants record their pain
      level and medication usage from home.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      It is routine practice to give narcotic medication after surgery for pain control however the
      abuse of prescription medications has become the fastest growing drug problem in the United
      States. Research has shown that post operative pain for some common Ear, Nose, and Throat
      (ENT) procedures are not severe but there is limited data looking at patient narcotic needs
      and their usage pattern to help inform physicians on how much to prescribe.

      The objective of this study is to evaluate patient pain level in the immediate post-operative
      period and quantify pain medication usage in patients who undergo outpatient ENT surgeries.

      Patients who undergo the following procedures will be invited to participate: thyroidectomy,
      parathyroidectomy, parotidectomy, tympanoplasty, mastoidectomy, endoscopic sinus surgery, and
      septoplasty. All patients will receive Hydrocodone/acetaminophen and Ibuprofen in standard
      dosage and assigned to one of two groups before surgery. Group 1 will use the narcotic
      medication for pain control and ibuprofen for breakthrough pain. Group 2 will use ibuprofen
      for pain control and the narcotic medication for breakthrough. Patients will fill out a data
      sheet for 7 days recording their pain level three times per day as well as pain medication
      usage for each day. This will be collected on their first clinic visit after surgery at which
      point the patient's involvement is completed.
