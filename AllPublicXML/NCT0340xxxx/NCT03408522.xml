  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Major adverse cardiac events (MACE) are a leading cause of mortality in patients undergoing
      noncardiac surgery. Patients with perioperative myocardial injury (PMI), defined as either
      myocardial infarction and lower elevations in cardiac troponin, are also at substantially
      increased risk of additional cardiac and noncardiac complications. Accordingly, it is
      plausible to assume that PMI negatively affects quality of life in terms of disability. The
      aim of this study is to investigate and compare the independent prognostic effects of the
      different PMI phenotypes (myocardial infarction and non-infarct troponin elevations) and
      noncardiac complications on disability in patients undergoing elective noncardiac surgery.

    <description>Disability is expressed by the World Health Organization Disability Assessment Score 2.0 (WHODAS 2.0), which is based on difficulties experienced by the respondent in different functional domains including, cognition, mobility, self-care, getting along, life activities and participation during the previous 30 days. Disability is defined as a decrement in each functioning domain corresponding to score between 0% and 100%, in which no disability stands for a score of 0% and full disability represents a score of 100%, including death.</description>
