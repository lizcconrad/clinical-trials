      Primary Objective:

      To evaluate the efficacy of switching treatment from twice-daily basal insulin to once-daily
      insulin glargine (U300) as part of basal bolus regime in terms of glycated hemoglobin
      improvement (reduction by at least 0.3%), in uncontrolled type 1 diabetes mellitus patients.

      Secondary Objectives:

        -  To evaluate other efficacy parameters in terms of glycemic control as well as safety
           including hypoglycemia events, weight changes, and adverse events.

        -  To evaluate the effect of insulin glargine (U300) on diabetes treatment satisfaction and
           fear of hypoglycemia as well as patient's satisfaction regarding the number of daily
           injections.
