    <textblock>
      Pleural effusions occur commonly in patients recovering from cardiac surgery, however, the
      impact on outcomes is not well characterized. The purpose of this study is to characterize
      the outcomes and costs of cardiac surgery patients with pleural effusions All patients
      undergoing cardiac surgery between 2006 and 2013 were included in this observational,
      cross-sectional analysis using propensity matching

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Pleural effusions are common in patients recovering from cardiac surgery. Symptomatic
      patients with pleural effusions complain of shortness of breath, cough, chest pain and are
      more hypoxic and tachypneic. Clinically significant effusions can slow recovery in the
      hospital and beyond, and are a critical source of hospital readmissions after discharge. It
      is not well characterized how this impacts hospital outcomes and costs. Further it is unknown
      if the effusions themselves are associated with impaired outcomes, or if pleural effusions
      simply arise in more complicated, older patients, thus suggesting the impaired outcomes are
      the result of coexisting morbidities. To better understand the impact of this complication
      and to address the question mentioned before, this study was carried out to determine the
      clinical and economic outcomes of pleural effusions in propensity-matched patients during
      early recovery from cardiac surgery. To compare patient groups with and without pleural
      effusion the following baseline characteristics were used: age, sex, body-mass-index,
      priority of surgery, type of surgery, duration of surgery, APACHE II Score of patients on
      admission on the ICU and preoperative ACEF Score of patients undergoing surgery.
