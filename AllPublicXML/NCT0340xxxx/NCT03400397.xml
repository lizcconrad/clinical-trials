  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the present study is to investigate the effectiveness of the Cool Kids programme
      after implementation in two outpatient psychiatric clinics for children in Southern Jutland,
      Denmark. The Cool Kids programme is a manualised cognitive behavioural treatment programme
      for children aged 6 to 12 years with anxiety disorders. Previous efficacy studies have found
      that 60-80% of all children who complete the program show marked improvement. However, only
      one previous effectiveness study has ever been conducted. It is therefore relevant to examine
      whether the previously mentioned effect is maintained when the programme is implemented in a
      healthcare setting rather than a research setting.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study was conducted at two outpatient psychiatric clinics for children in Southern
      Jutland, Denmark.

      Data was gathered from 55 patients who completed the Cool Kids programme as a treatment for
      anxiety disorder(s) from autumn 2013 to spring 2016. During the course of treatment both
      children and parents completed the Child Anxiety Life Interference Scale (CALIS) at baseline,
      post-treatment and at a 3-months follow-up booster-session. This data was originally gathered
      for internal quality assessment at the clinics. As the data was utilized for the present
      study in 2017, it has not been possible to control for confounding factors or influence the
      data-collection process.

      All questionnaires were anonymised previous to being manually scored and keyed for secured
      electronic storage. Participants were excluded from the data analysis if they had one or more
      incomplete or missing CALIS. All statistical analysis was carried out in IBM SPSS 24
      Statistical Software and consists of linear mixed effect models and one-way repeated measures
      ANOVAs.

    <measure>Change in quality of life and level of functioning measured by Child Anxiety Life Interference Scale (CALIS)</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, ended treatment (approx. 16-weeks) and 3-months follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>Child Anxiety Life Interference Scale (CALIS) is a questionnaire that measures the degree of interference in level of functioning and quality of life caused by anxiety symptoms in 6- to 17-year-olds and their parents. CALIS is a scale for tracking treatment change.
There are two versions of CALIS: a self-report questionnaire, and a parent-report questionnaire.
All questions are answered on a 5-point Likert-scale with the choices: (0) Not at all, (1) Only a little, (2) Sometimes, (3) Quite a lot, and (4) A great deal. CALIS consists of 9 items in the self-report version and 16 items in the parent-report version split with respectively 9 and 7 items for interference in the child's and the parents' life. The self-report and parent-report scales for interference in the child's life is divided into two subscales: Outside Home (5 items) and At Home (4 items). The higher the score, the greater interference caused by anxiety symptoms.</description>
