      The Patient are divided into 3 groups group 1 included 50 cases using misoprostol only. group
      2 included also 50 cases in which using misoprostol with letrozole. Group3 included also 50
      cases in which using misoprostol with Foleys catheter for termination of second trimesteric
      abortion between 14 and 24 weeks

      Pregnant women were randomized into three equal groups: Group allocation was blindly
      randomized concealed by placement in numbered opaque sealed envelopes. These envelopes were
      kept in the labor ward and drawn in consecutive order:

      Group 'A&quot; (misoprostol only group): Pharmacological method for termination of second
      trimester missed abortion was done by given 200 microgram misoprostol (Misotac 200 microgram
      tablet, Sigma Pharmaceuticals, Egypt), in sublingual every four hours for a maximum of five
      doses.

      Group 'B'(misoprostol with letrozole group): The anti-estrogen action of letrozole has been
      show to be useful in pretreatment for termination of pregnancy ,in combination with
      misoprostol,women in the letrozole group received 15mg( letrozole2.5mg) on three successive
      day patient take doses of letrozole for daily oral three successive day at home by herself
      and forth day admitted to our hospital followed by sublingual misoprostol 200 microgram
      misoprostol (Misotac 200 microgram tablet, Sigma Pharmaceuticals, Egypt), every four hours
      for a maximum of five doses.

      Group 'C' (misoprotol with Foley's catheter group): Mechanical method for termination of
      second trimester missed abortion was done using the transcervical 16F Foley's catheter with
      30 ml balloon capacity (Euromed for Medical Industries, Cairo, Egypt, under license of
      Kanglite, USA), inserted under aseptic conditions withsublingual misoprostol 200 microgram
      misoprostol (Misotac 200 microgram tablet, Sigma Pharmaceuticals, Egypt), every four hours
      for a maximum of five doses.
