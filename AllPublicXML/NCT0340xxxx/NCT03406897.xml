  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigator propose to test the safety and efficacy of a regimen that combines Omega-3
      Fatty Acids and Vitamin D in a design that considers timing and duration of administration in
      relation to their effects and predicted synergies.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      These agents may afford promote sustained immune regulation, reduce inflammation, and provide
      support for the residual beta cell mass. This integrated therapeutic regimen addresses major
      pathogenic mechanisms in T1D (Type 1 Diabetes) and thus represents a rational and well
      supported approach to preserve insulin secretion in T1D (Type 1 Diabetes). This approach
      could halt the disease progress, preserve β-cell function and hopefully reduce dose of
      insulin required to manage T1D (Type 1 Diabetes). The investigator hypothesizes that Omega-3
      Fatty Acids and Vitamin D, administered to patients with newly or established T1D (Type 1
      Diabetes) and residual stimulated C-peptide secretion will be safe and may preserve insulin
      secretion.

    <intervention_model_description>The study is a two-arm, open label, randomized trial. All four groups will receive standard intensive diabetes treatment with insulin and dietary management.
Group I: Fourteen (14) adults (18-65 years) of established T1D &gt; 6 months (&gt;180 days) and up to 10 years of T1D duration Group II: Fourteen (14) adults (18-65 years) of new-onset T1D diagnosed within last 6 months (≤ 180 days) Group III: Fourteen (14) children (6-17 years) of established T1D &gt; 6 months (&gt;180 days) and up to 10 years of T1D duration Group IV: Fourteen (14) children (6-17 years) of new-onset T1D diagnosed within last 6 months (≤ 180 days)
Participants in each group will be randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive either one year of high dose Omega-3 fatty acids and Vitamin D combination (Arm A) or Vitamin D alone (Arm B). Both arms will receive Vitamin D supplementation.</intervention_model_description>

             evidence about whether omega-3 fatty acids found in seafood and fish oil might
             increase the risk of prostate cancer. Until additional research on the association of

         21. Past or current medical problems, or findings from physical examination, or laboratory
             testing, that are not listed above which, in the opinion of the investigator, may pose
             additional risks from participation in the study, may interfere with the participant's
             ability to comply with study requirements or that may impact the quality or
             interpretation of the data obtained.

         22. All patients who have coagulation, bleeding, or blood disorders will be excluded due
             to the effect of high dose of Omega 3 Fatty Acids on coagulation and bleeding process.
