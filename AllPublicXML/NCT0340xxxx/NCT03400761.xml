  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Several studies performed in elite endurance athletes have shown that running performance may
      be determined by a low fat mass in the overall population.

      The &quot;Course de l'Escalade&quot; occurs yearly during the first week-end of December. This race
      takes place in the city of Geneva. The distance of this race is 7.3 km for all men and elite
      women, and 4.8 km for non-elite women. During this race, measurement of body composition by
      biolelectrical impedance analyses (BIA) were performed in volunteer, between December 1999
      and 2017.

      Hypothesis :

      We hypothesize that:

        1. A low fat mass is associated with a slower running time, when adjusting for age, body
           weight, and habitual physical exercise.

        2. An increase in fat mass over time increases running time over the years

      Objectives :

        1. To evaluate whether total and regional body composition is associated with running time
           at the &quot;Course de l'Escalade&quot;.

        2. To determine whether changes in body composition with progressive aging lead to changes
           in running time.

        This is a historical cohort study of prospectively collected measurements of body
        composition performed by bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) at the &quot;Course de
        l'Escalade&quot;, between 1999 and 2017. The &quot;Course de l'Escalade&quot; is a fun race occurring
        yearly in Geneva, between December 1999 and 2017. The distance of this race is 7.3 km for
        all men and elite women, and 4.8 km for non-elite women.
