      The study was to evaluate the safety, PFS and ORR of icotinib/dihydroaremisinin (DHA)-based
      combination therapy in EGFR-mutated, advanced NSCLC patients who have gradually progressed
      disease after first-line icotinib treatment.

    <description>Icotinib should be taken by the patients continuously until disease progressed or intolerable toxicity. On day 1-3, oral dihydroaremisinin was given at 20mg per day, the dose of dihydroaremisinin is increased to 40mg daily on day 4 to 6, and 80mg twice daily until disease progressed or intolerable toxicity.</description>
