    <textblock>
      Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) delivered face-to-face is an empirically supported
      intervention for the management of chronic pain (CP). However, increasing demands for cost
      reduction in healthcare services in addition to obstacles regarding physical access to
      treatment, highlight the need for innovative, cost-reducing, digital self-management
      interventions. Poor user engagement nonetheless, is a significant challenge often faced in
      digital interventions, which often results in poor adherence or even non-completion in
      treatment. In addition, very few digital trials appear to plan for adherence a-priori, when
      designing an intervention. To date there are only two ACT-based digital interventions for CP
      demonstrating significant improvements in pain-related disability and increased functioning,
      yet with small to medium effect sizes and poor adherence rates. However, several limitations
      of the studies such as the absence of a-priori adherence planning and lack of investigation
      of underlying mechanisms, makes it difficult to draw clear conclusions on the effectiveness
      of this new treatment modality for chronic pain and warrants further research. This study
      seeks to: a) explore how a brief adherence-planned digital ACT-based intervention for CP
      management, compared to an active control group and a wait-list control group improves
      targeted study outcomes such as functioning and quality of life, and b) investigate which
      processes of change mediate the targeted study outcomes. It is hypothesized that the brief
      ACT-based digital intervention in comparison to the active control group and wait-list will
      result in increased functioning, improved quality of life and reduced pain intensity. The
      results of the study are expected to shed more light on the utility of planning for adherence
      in digital interventions and effectiveness of ACT-based digital interventions and their
      underlying mechanisms in the management of CP.

    <textblock>
      A growing body of evidence demonstrates that clinic-based interventions can be effectively
      used to treat pain-related interference in the daily life of chronic pain sufferers.
      Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) delivered face-to-face is an empirically supported
      intervention for the management of chronic pain (CP). The increasing demands for cost
      reduction for services in the healthcare system and obstacles regarding physical access to
      treatment highlight the need for innovative, cost-reducing, self-management interventions. In
      addition, the idea of home-based self-management support seems appealing to a significant
      number of sufferers of chronic conditions such as chronic pain. Digital interventions might
      present with feasible means to overcome many barriers such as physical access to treatment or
      financial obstacles while helping improve health care for persons with chronic pain in the
      convenience of their space and time.

      A considerable number of studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of psychological
      digitalised interventions (the majority cognitive and behavioural based) in improving chronic
      pain management, reducing pain intensity, catastrophizing and improving functioning. However,
      support for the effectiveness of digital interventions is tempered by a plethora of
      evaluations that report users often fail to adhere to online interventions. Almost twice as
      many users appear to dropout from internet-based interventions compared to the traditional
      face-to-face interventions suggesting that users become disengaged and unmotivated early on
      in these interventions. A-priori planning for maximised user engagement and consequently
      adherence, using a theoretical framework such as persuasive technology, is desirable in
      digital interventions that aim to combat the problem of low adherence.

      To date, there are only two studies that have examined the effectiveness of ACT-based digital
      interventions (iACT) for chronic pain management, demonstrating significant improvements in
      pain-related disability and increased functioning. Despite these encouraging findings, to our
      knowledge, no iACT study has appropriately addressed the problem of low adherence, which has
      resulted in low adherence and high attrition rates in both of the ACT trials. Also, none of
      the two studies has investigated the impact of adherence on treatment outcomes or
      investigated the underlying ACT mechanisms of change on treatment outcomes within a digital
      tested framework. Furthermore, there have been very few attempts to examine the effectiveness
      of brief (&lt; 6 sessions) interventions in the field of ACT and CP, yet none exists in the
      field of iACT and CP.

      The present study seeks to: a) design an innovative Avatar-led digitalised brief intervention
      based on a culturally sensitive ACT face-to-face protocol developed in a previous project, b)
      recruit and offer online treatment to community-based chronic pain sufferers, c) explore how
      a brief iACT intervention for CP management, compared to a waitlist control group (medical
      treatment as usual) and an active control group (limited access to pain-related
      psycho-educational information) improves targeted study outcomes (e.g., functioning and
      quality of life etc.), d) investigate which processes of change mediate the targeted study
      outcomes and e) investigate the relationship between adherence to the intervention and
      treatment outcomes. Assessments of chronic pain users' daily functioning (primary outcome),
      quality of life, affective components, pain intensity (secondary outcomes), therapeutic
      process measures (e.g., psychological flexibility, acceptance, defusion), will be assessed
      before and following treatment completion, and after 3, 6 and 12 months. In addition, user
      satisfaction and web-metrics (number of logins/modules/activities completed, time spent
      online etc.) will be assessed to examine the relationship between adherence and treatment
      outcomes.

      It is hypothesised that the brief iACT in comparison with the two control groups will result
      in increased functioning, improved quality of life and reduced pain intensity mediated by the
      mechanisms of change of psychological flexibility, acceptance and defusion. In addition, it
      is hypothesized that users with increased adherence will result in significantly improved
      treatment outcomes as compared to users with poor adherence. The results of this study are
      expected to revolutionize the implementation and treatment effectiveness of brief iACT
      interventions in the field of chronic pain management. Furthermore, the investigators attempt
      to contribute to the literature concerning the improvement of designing and planning for
      digital interventions that target improved user engagement and adherence to treatment.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes in daily functioning assessed with the Greek Brief Pain Inventory: Interference sub-scale (G-BPI; Mystakidou, Mendoza, Tsilika, Befon, Parpa et al., 2001; Original: Cleeland &amp; Ryan; 1994)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change in levels of daily functioning from baseline through study completion (approximately 2 months) and at 6 and 12 months post completion. Data will be reported for study completion (approximately 2 months), 6 months and 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>This is a subscale of the Greek-Brief Pain Inventory which is a pain assessment tool developed to assess pain severity and interference which has been previously translated and validated in a Greek chronic pain sample. Pain severity is of secondary focus within the study and will be assessed by a numerical rating scale as described later. The interference subscale will only be used to assess how pain interferes in several areas of daily functioning of chronic pain sufferers. It contains 7-items rated on a Likert-type scale from 0=&quot;does not interfere&quot; to 10=&quot;completely interferes&quot;. The G-BPI presents with good internal consistency (α=.85 for interference) and sufficient validity with theoretically-consistent instruments.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes in the quality of life assessed by the World Health Organisation Quality of Life-BREF Questionnaire (WHOQOL-BREF; The WHOQOL Group, 1998)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change in levels of quality of life from baseline through study completion (approximately 2 months) and at 6 and 12 months post completion. Data will be reported for study completion (approximately 2 months), 6 months and 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>The WHOQOL assesses an individual's quality of life (QoL). The instrument is a self-report 26-item inventory of generic QoL and is divided into four subscales: physical health, mental health, social relationships, and social environment. Higher scores indicate better QoL. WHOQOL-BREF has been previously translated and validated in Greek (Ginieri-Coccossis, Triantafillou, Tomaras, Soldatos, Mavreas, &amp; Christodoulou, 2012) with satisfactory internal consistency between the domains ranging from (Cronbach's α=.66 - .80) and overall QoL (α= .87) and seems to function well for assessing QoL in clinical and general populations.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes in the levels of psychological distress assessed by the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS; Zigmond &amp; Snaith, 1983)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change in levels of depression and anxiety symptoms from baseline through study completion (approximately 2 months) and at 6 and 12 months post completion. Data will be reported for study completion (approximately 2 months), 6 months and 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>HADS is a 14-item questionnaire assessing levels of depression and anxiety symptomatology, considered unbiased by coexisting medical conditions (Snaith, 1987). Each subscale consists of 7 items rated on a 4-point scale (0-3). Higher scores indicate greater anxiety and depression. The Greek version presents with high internal consistency (α=.88) and validity (Michopoulos, et al., 2008).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Changes in avoidance of pain levels as assessed by the Greek Psychological Inflexibility in Pain Scale (G-PIPS-II; Vasiliou et al., under submission; Original: Wicksell et al., 2010)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change in levels of psychological flexibility from baseline through study completion (approximately 2 months) and at 6 and 12 months post completion. Data will be reported for study completion (approximately 2 months), 6 months and 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>G-PIPS-II contains 12 items assessing psychological inflexibility and is comprised of two subscales: a) avoidance of pain (8 items), examines behaviors that lead to avoidance of pain and related distress; and b) cognitive fusion (4 items), assesses how CP sufferers' thoughts about an event can lead to avoidance of pain or distress. Items are rated on a 7-point Likert-type scale, with 1=&quot;never true&quot; and 7=&quot;always true&quot;. The scale demonstrates good psychometric properties (Wicksell et al., 2010) and high internal consistency (α = .88) and validity with associated constructs in its Greek version.</description>
  </other_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Changes in the levels of pain acceptance as assessed via the Greek Chronic Pain Acceptance Questionnaire (G-CPAQ; Vasiliou et al., under review; Original: McCracken et al., 2004)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change in levels of pain acceptance from baseline through study completion (approximately 2 months) and at 6 and 12 months post completion. Data will be reported for study completion (approximately 2 months), 6 months and 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>assesses pain acceptance in two sub-factors: activity engagement (4 items) and pain willingness (4 items). Activity engagement, examines the degree to which participants engage in meaningful activity even in the presence of pain. Pain willingness, assesses the degree to which individuals allow pain to occur without trying to change, control, or struggle with it. The G-CPAQ is rated on a 7-point Likert scale (0=never true to 6=always true) and yields a total sum with a range of 0-48. Higher total score suggests greater pain acceptance, whereas higher subscale scores denote greater activity engagement and pain willingness (McCracken et al., 2014). The G-CPAQ presents with high reliability (Cronbach's a=.80) and sufficient construct validity with theoretically-related constructs.</description>
  </other_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Changes in the levels of defusion with pain-related thoughts as assessed via Cognitive Defusion Stamp (Karekla &amp; Nicolaou, 2011)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change in levels of defusion at 4 points from baseline through completion (approximately once every week, prior to each session). Data will be reported once when study is completed (approximately 2 months after baseline)</time_frame>
    <description>): This is a figurative measure developed and used previously in several studies (e.g., Savvide &amp; Karekla, 2015) to assess weekly changes in participants' cognitive defusion related to sabotaging thoughts. It was found to be sensitive to session-to-session changes and correlated significantly with other cognitive defusion measures. In this study the Cognitive Defusion Stamp will be used to assess how fused participants are with thoughts related to pain. CP sufferers will use a circular electronic stamp to show where they consider themselves to be in relation to an existing stamp, which represents pain related thoughts (i.e. &quot;How fused is the participant today with their pain related thoughts?&quot;). The mean distance in mm between the centers of the 2 circles are measured. The longer the distance between the two centers the more defusion from thoughts.</description>
  </other_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Changes in the levels of satisfaction with treatment as assessed by the Greek Client Satisfaction Questionnaire (CSQ-8; Flora &amp; Stalikas; 2012; Larsen, Attkinson, Hargreaves &amp; Nguyen, 1979)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change in levels of satisfaction from baseline through study completion (approximately 2 months). Data will be reported once when study is completed (approximately 2 months after baseline)</time_frame>
    <description>G-CSQ-8 will be used to assess participants' evaluation of the intervention and satisfaction. The scale demonstrated high internal consistency (α= .83). Items are rated on a 4-point Likert-type scale, where higher scores indicate greater satisfaction with services received.</description>
  </other_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Perceived general improvement by the intervention as assessed by the Patient Global Impression of Change scale (PGIC; Guy, 1976)</measure>
    <time_frame>This single item is only delivered through study completion (approximately 2 months after baseline). Data will be reported once when study is completed (approximately 2 months after baseline)</time_frame>
    <description>Following the IMMPACT (Initiative on Methods, Measurement, and Pain Assessment in Clinical Trials) recommendations, the PGIC will be used to assess the participants' global perceived improvement following treatment. This is a one-item 7-point scale ranging from &quot;very much improved&quot; to &quot;very much worse&quot;, with &quot;no change&quot; as the mid-point.</description>
  </other_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Within-treatment diary</measure>
    <time_frame>Change in levels of processes at 4 points from baseline through study completion (approximately once every week, prior to each session). Data will be reported once when study is completed (approximately 2 months after baseline)</time_frame>
    <description>At the beginning of each session participants will complete an 8-item diary: 1 item to assess each process of the psychological flexibility hexaflex (willingness, cognitive defusion, contact with present moment, values, committed action and self as context) including an item for pain struggle and pain intensity. Each item is rated on a numerical rating scale of a 1-5 with a specified time-frame (of previous week).</description>

    <description>The intervention builds on a previously unpublished face-to-face protocol for greek-speaking chronic pain sufferers (developed by Karekla &amp; Vasiliou, 2013) and has been simplified and modified to produce a self-help digital internet-based modality, namely the ALGEApp. ALGEApp consists of a total of 4 approximately one-hour sessions, which are structured to be completed by the users in sequence within a time frame of 2-8 weeks (depending on the rate of completion by each user). The intervention is guided, which implies that an animated character (an Avatar) guides the user throughout the whole duration of the intervention. ALGEApp contains experiential and audiovisual psycho-educational material based on ACT, adopted for the Greek-Cypriot culture.</description>
