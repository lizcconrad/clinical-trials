  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Surgery performed with nerve blocks and sedation may be safer and provide better pain control
      compared to general anesthesia and opioid therapy in high-risk patient populations such as
      elderly and troubled with peripheral vascular disease, diabetes, hypertension, coronary
      artery disease, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Avoidance of general anesthesia in certain high-risk patient populations may have additional
      benefits beyond improved postoperative pain scores and analgesic consumption. The primary
      objective of this research will be to evaluate the ability of the femoral, sciatic, lateral
      femoral cutaneous nerve (LFCN), and obturator blocks to provide surgical anesthesia.

Patients will be called or visited 24-48 hours post procedure to inquire about patient satisfaction. Differences in study participant pain scores will be examined through t-tests.

All enrollees will be administered Intravenous sedatives using propofol or dexmedetomidine and have ultrasound-guided femoral and sciatic nerve blocks placed per current practice at research site. Single-injection obturator nerve blocks and lateral femoral cutaneous nerve blocks will also be performed.</description>
