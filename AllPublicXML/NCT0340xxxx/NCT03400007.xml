  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pelvic organ prolapsed, associated with defecation disorders and urinary tracts symptoms are
      common and affect up to 25% of the population, mostly parous women. The pelvic floor must be
      seen as one entity, with multiple anatomical and physiological interactions between the
      various compartments (rectum, vagina, uterus and bladder) which are embedded in the same
      anatomical region. The often complex pathologies of this region should therefore be treated
      in a multidisciplinary setting.

      Besides clinical evaluation, functional dynamic imaging of anorectal and pelvic floor
      disfunctions has an important role in the diagnosis and management of these disorders.
      Although the colpocystodefecography is still considered to be the golden standard in imaging
      this complex anatomical region, there is clearly a need for more precise imaging of the
      structural details, preferentially without any irradiation. Transperineal ultrasound is an
      option but the investigators have chosen to evaluate the use of dynamic magnetic resonance
      imaging. In contrast to colpocystodefecography, dynamic pelvic floor magnetic resonance
      imaging is an evolving technology and its precise role in functional imaging of the pelvic
      floor still remains to be determined.

      Prolapse surgery is commonly performed and therefore it is important to assess the efficacy
      of the operations in correcting the anatomical defects and the symptoms associated without
      creating new, pelvic floor related symptoms. Few studies exist today allowing the assessment
      of the anatomical changes and symptoms after surgery, through abdominal or perineal approach.

      This study will evaluate the reliability of the dynamic pelvic floor imaging, done in a
      sitting position, compared to colpocystodefecography, done in a sitting position. It will
      also compare clinical objective and subjective results related to pelvic floor abnormalities
      with imaging. Finally, it will evaluate the anatomical changes in correlation with the
      clinical results, organ position and inter-compartments relationships after surgery.

      This study will allow to understand and explain some relapses and failures and could lead to
      an improvement of the indications for surgery and surgical techniques used.

    <measure>Fecal Incontinence Severity Index (FISI)</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months post surgery</time_frame>
    <description>This is a health tool that describes the severity of different types of incontinence for bowel contents.There are 4 items in the FISI scale with 6 answer choices. Points are awarded according to the gravity of the symptoms. The higher the FISI index (which ranges from 0 to 61), the higher the severity of the fecal incontinence.</description>

    <description>Validated questionnaire covering nine domains: general health (1 item), prolapse impact (1 item), role (2 items), physical (2 items) and social limitations (3 items), personal relationships (2 items), emotions (3 items), sleep/energy (2 items), and severity measurement (4 items). The answers are categorized using a fourpoint Likert scale: &quot;none/not at all,&quot; &quot;slightly/a little,&quot; &quot;moderately,&quot; and &quot;a lot.&quot; A score is calculated for each domain ranging from 0 to 100. A higher score indicates a greater impairment of quality of life.</description>

    <description>Validated questionnaire. The PISQ-12 measures three domains: behavioral-emotive (items 1 - 4), physical (items 5 - 9) and partner-related (items 10 - 12). It is a self-administered questionnaire, and responses are graded on a five-point Likert scale ranging from 0 (always) to 4 (never). Items 1 - 4 are reversely scored and a total of 48 is the maximum score. Higher scores indicate better sexual function.</description>
