  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to assess the relationship between overall satisfaction with treatment in a
      group of randomized patients undergoing elective hand surgery using either absorbable (4-0
      Chromic) or non-absorbable (5-0 Nylon) sutures. The investigators will also assess factors
      associated with wound concerns, pain intensity, magnitude of limitations, and physical
      function within one month of surgery.

Standardized wound care instructions will be given to all patients. Those who received absorbable Chromic sutures are treated recording to the standard protocol and they are advised that they can start to gently rub the scab and suture line to encourage the sutures to fall off starting 10-14 days postoperatively.</description>
