  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Acute coronary syndrome (ACS) is a group of clinical syndromes characterized by rupture or
      erosion of coronary atherosclerotic plaques secondary to complete or incomplete thrombus
      formation.

      With the development of antithrombotic drugs and percutaneous coronary interventional
      therapy, bleeding has become one of the major complications for ACS patients after
      PCI.Moreover,Bleeding after PCI therapy significantly increased short-term and long-term risk
      of death.

      However, there is a lack of data on the risk of bleeding in ACS patients treated with PCI in
      the clinical reality world of china.

      Therefore,the present study was designed to observe the incidence of bleeding events and
      characteristics of bleeding and exploratively analyse bleeding related biomarkers and gene
      polymorphisms in ACS patients undergoing PCI.

      The present study was designed to observe the incidence of bleeding events and
      characteristics of bleeding and exploratively analyse bleeding related biomarkers and gene
      polymorphisms in ACS patients undergoing PCI.

      This study will provide sufficient and reliable evidence for the risk of bleeding and the
      choice of antithrombotic drugs in ACS patients undergoing PCI in China, and provide a
      reference for individual antithrombotic therapy after PCI.
