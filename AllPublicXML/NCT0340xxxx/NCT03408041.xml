  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The early diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease is essential to enable patients to have access to
      the available treatments. However, there is a delay between the diagnosis and the onset of
      symptoms, which can range from 1 year to more than 5 years. In clinical practice, the
      hippocampal volume, measured by the Scheltens index, is currently used as a marker of the
      progression of the disease.

      The purpose of this study is to determine whether the patient's sex, age and ethnicity can
      influence the delay in the expression of cognitive troubles reported by the family at the
      first medical consultation, as well as to determine if there is a correlation between the
      delay reported by the family and the Scheltens index.
