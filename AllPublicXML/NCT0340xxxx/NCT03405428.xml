  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study, the investigators will investigate how patients' radial artery diameters
      change according to sex, age, height, weight and body mass index by measuring radial artery
      diameter using ultrasonography. The correlation of Allen test with doppler ultrasonography
      will also be evaluated.

    <textblock>
      Arterial catheterization for continuous hemodynamic monitoring or frequent blood sampling is
      a common procedure in anesthesia and critical care setting. The most commonly used site for
      arterial catheterization is the radial artery because of its superficial course, alternate
      blood supply to hand via ulnar artery and a low rate of complications. Allen test is a
      simple, but not reliable, method for assessing the safety of radial artery catheterization.
      Intraarterial catheterization has some complications such as hematoma, vasospasm, arterial
      thrombosis, necrosis of skin overlying. Using larger size cannula from radial artery
      diameter, increase rate of complications. The purpose of this study is to investigate the
      corelation of radial artery diameter with sex, age, height, weight and body mass index for
      determination of proper cannula size and investigation of correlation between Allen test and
      doppler ultrasonography.

    <description>Ultrasonography measurements will be performed with a linear probe. The non-dominant hand of the patient will be fixed in the anatomical position on the arm chair. The wrist joint of patient will be extended to 30 degree with a wrist pad. The Ultrasonography probe will be transversally placed 2 cm proximal to the styloid process and the short axes of the radial artery will be scanned. The diameter of the radial artery will be measured and recorded.</description>

    <time_frame>5 minutes prior to anesthesia induction</time_frame>
    <description>Before induction, with firm occlusive pressure held on both the radial and ulnar arteries, the patient is asked to clench his or her fist several seconds until the palmar skin is blanched. The patient is then instructed to unclench the fist, and then ulnar artery pressure is released while maintaining occlusion of the radial artery. The time required for palmar capillary refill is noted. An abnormal Allen test result was defined as a recovery time of more than 10 seconds. Ultrasonography measurements will be performed with a linear probe. The non-dominant hand of the patient will be fixed in the anatomical position on the arm chair. The wrist joint of patient will be extended to 30 degree with a wrist pad. The USG probe will be transversally placed 2 cm proximal to the styloid process and the short axes of the ulnar artery will be scanned. The blood fow of ulnar artery will be measured and recorded.</description>

The patient is then instructed to unclench the fist, and then ulnar artery pressure is released while maintaining occlusion of the radial artery. Overextension of the hand and wide spreading of the fingers should be avoided because it can lead to falsely abnormal results. The time required for palmar capillary refill is noted. An abnormal Allen test result was defined as a recovery time of more than 10 seconds.</description>
