  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this clinical research study is to learn if venetoclax in combination with
      decitabine can help to control acute myeloid leukemia (AML) or high-risk myelodysplastic
      syndrome (HR-MDS) in newly diagnosed elderly patients or in patient with disease that has
      relapsed (come back after treatment). The safety of this drug combination will also be
      studied.

      This is an investigational study. Venetoclax and decitabine are FDA approved and commercially
      available. Venetoclax is FDA approved and commercially available for the treatment of chronic
      lymphocytic leukemia. Decitabine is FDA approved and commercially available for the treatment
      of MDS. It is considered investigational to use venetoclax in combination with decitabine to
      treat AML or HR-MDS.

      The study doctor can explain how the study drugs are designed to work.

      Up to 160 participants will be enrolled in this study. All will take part at MD Anderson.

      Study Drug Administration:

      If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, you will receive decitabine by
      vein over about 1 hour on Days 1-10 of each 28-day study cycle. Note that the start of future
      cycles may be delayed if you have side effects to the study drug.

      You will take venetoclax by mouth on Days 1-28 of the first cycle and Days 1-21 of all other
      cycles. Each dose should be taken within 30 minutes after eating a meal (preferably
      breakfast) with about a cup (8 ounces) of water. If the study doctor thinks it is needed
      based on any side effects you may be having (such as low blood cell counts and/or
      infections), your dose(s) of venetoclax may be delayed until it is thought to be safe for you
      to receive it.

      If venetoclax is not available at the start of treatment for any reason (insurance,
      financial, transportation, and so on), you can begin receiving decitabine and venetoclax can
      be added when it is available.

      During Cycle 1, you will be admitted into the hospital as an inpatient for at least the first
      3 days of combination therapy. During this time, you will also be given drugs to prevent
      tumor lysis syndrome (TLS). TLS happens when breakdown products of the cancer cells entering
      the blood stream, causing possible weakness, low blood pressure, muscle cramps, kidney
      damage, and/or other organ damage. You may be given fluids (either by mouth or by vein) and
      treatment with allopurinol or rasburicase. After Day 3, if there is If no evidence of TLS,
      you may be discharged. You will then receive the rest of the study drug doses as an
      outpatient.

      If the study doctor thinks it is in your best interest, you may be able to also receive
      standard of care therapies (such as sorafenib, midostaurin, imatinib, dasatinib, ponatinib,
      and so on) while you are on study. The study doctor will discuss these treatments with you,
      as well as their risks and benefits.

      If the study doctor thinks it is needed for your safety, you may also receive cytarabine to
      help prevent central nervous system side effects. Cytarabine will be given intrathecally
      (through a spinal tap) on either Day 21 of Cycle 1 or Day 14 of Cycle 2.

      Length of Study:

      You may continue taking the study drugs for as long as the doctor thinks it is in your best
      interest. You will no longer be able to take the study drug if the disease gets worse, if
      intolerable side effects occur, or if you are unable to follow study directions.

      Your participation on the study will be over after the follow-up visits.

      Study Visits:

      On Day 1 of each cycle (+/- 4 days), you will have a physical exam.

      One (1) time every week during Cycles 1, 2 and 3, and then on Day 1 of each cycle after that
      (+/- 4 days):

        -  Blood (about 1 tablespoon) will be drawn for routine tests.

        -  You will have a bone marrow biopsy and aspirate to check the status of the disease, and
           for biomarker and cytogenetic testing (Day 21 [+/- 3 days]). If the study doctor thinks
           it is needed, this will be repeated on Day 28. Additionally, you will have a bone marrow
           biopsy and aspirate to check the status of the disease, for biomarker and for
           cytogenetic testing at the end of Cycles 2 and 4, then every 1-3 cycles after that, then
           at any time that the disease appears to get worse.

      Additional Research Tests:

      Blood (about 3 tablespoons) will be drawn for biomarker testing at the following time points
      (within 24 hours). Biomarkers, which may include genetic biomarkers, are found in the blood
      and tissue and may be related to your reaction to the study drug:

        -  Baseline (before the first decitabine dose), and between days 21 to 28 of Cycle 1

        -  At the end of Cycles 2 and 4

        -  At any point that the disease appears to get worse

      You will have a &quot;cheek scrape&quot; at the end of Cycle 1. These cells will be used to compare to
      cancer cells to look for effects of the study drug. For this test, a small sample of cells
      from the inside of your mouth will be collected by scraping a special brush against the
      inside of your cheek a few times, until enough cells are collected.

      End-of-Study Visit:

      Within 30 days after your last dose of study drug(s):

        -  You will have a physical exam.

        -  Blood (about 1 tablespoon) will be drawn for routine tests.

        -  You will have a bone marrow aspirate/biopsy to check the status of the disease and for
           biomarker and cytogenetic testing.

      Follow-up:

      If the disease responded to the study treatment, you will then be called every 3 to 6 months
      for up to 5 years and asked about how you are doing. Each call should last about 15-30
      minutes.
