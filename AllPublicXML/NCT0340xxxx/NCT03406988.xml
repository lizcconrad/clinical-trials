    <textblock>
      A randomized controlled trial will be performed to confirm preliminary uncontrolled data
      indicating that regional adipose tissue grafting is effective in inducing digital ulcer
      healing in patients with systemic sclerosis.

      Systemic Sclerosis patients with digital ulcers will be randomized to be blindly treated with
      adipose tissue implantation or a sham procedure. Adipose tissue grafting will consist of
      injection at the base of the finger with digital ulcer of 0.5-1 ml of adipose tissue after
      centrifugation of fat aspirate. Sharm procedure will consist of false liposuction and local
      injection of saline solution.

      The primary end-point will be to compare the cumulative prevalence of healed digital ulcers
      in the two groups within the following 8 weeks.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Systemic sclerosis (SSc) is an autoimmune disease characterized by a multifactorial
      pathological process where a central role is played by the progressive loss of the
      microvascular bed, with the consequent fibrotic changes in the involved organs and tissues.

      The most advanced stages of capillary loss may induce the formation of digital ulcers (DUs)
      on the fingertips.The healing of DUs is often a lengthy process requiring accurate and
      intensive topical and systemic treatment. Nevertheless, in a significant number of cases this
      therapeutic approach is ineffective and distal necrosis with subsequent tissue loss or
      phalangeal amputation may eventually occur.

      In a recent open pilot study performed by Del Papa et al., it has been demonstrated that
      autologous adipose tissue grafting (AT-G), which is known to contain both adipose-derived
      stem cells and a stromal/vascular fraction, was effective in inducing prompt healing of long
      lasting DUs localized in the fingertips of a small number of patients with SSc. The DU
      healing was accompanied by the rapid disappearance of local ischemic pain and evidence of a
      partial restoration of the capillary bed in the digits when assessed by nailfold
      videocapillaroscopy (NVC).

      With the purpose of confirming these preliminary results, the investigators have designed a
      monocentric randomized controlled study. In accordance with the study protocol, patients with
      a typical SSc-related DU on the fingertip will be randomized to undergo a regional AT-G with
      autologous fat as active therapy or a 'sham' procedure (SP) - that simulates the active
      treatment - as placebo treatment. All of the patients with SSc enrolled in both arms will be
      blind regarding the treatment received. Furthermore, during the study period all of the
      enrolled patients will receive the same systemic vasoactive and topical therapy.

    <intervention_model_description>Candidate SSc patients will have only one active DU of at least 6 mm in diameter, lasting for at least 6 weeks, despite conventional vascular therapy. Patients with severe visceral manifestations, diabetes and treated with immune-suppressors and endothelin inhibitors will be excluded. Active therapy: implantation of 0.5-1 ml of autologous AT at the base of the finger with DU. Autologous AT will be obtained by liposuction from abdominal fat.
SP will be blindly performed in the control group to simulate the AT-G. A false liposuction will be performed followed by the injection of 0.5-1 ml of 0.9% saline solution at the base of the affected finger. Basal therapy: weekly iloprost infusion (0.5-2 ng/Kg/min), and calcium-channel blockers (oral nifedipine 20 mg daily) will be continued during the entire observation time in all of the patients recruited in both arms of the study. The administration of analgesics to alleviate the DU-related pain will be also allowed for each patient.</intervention_model_description>

    <time_frame>This evaluation will be done at baseline and at the 2nd, 4th, 6th, 8th week after interventions (either autologus fat grafting or sham procedure).</time_frame>
    <description>The pain VAS is a continuous scale comprised of a horizontal line of 10 centimeters (100 mm) in length, ranging from 0 (minimum= no pain) to 100 (worst imaginable pain). The respondents will be asked to place a line perpendicular to the VAS line at the point that represents their pain intensity. Using a ruler, the score is determined by measuring the distance (mm) on the 10-cm line between the &quot;no pain&quot; anchor and the patient's mark, providing a range of scores from 0-100.
In this study VAS score will be used to measure the decrease (or resolution) of pain with respect to baseline value in patients who will undergo treatment with autologous fat grafting (active arm) in comparison with patients of the placebo group.</description>
