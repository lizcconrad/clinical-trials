      This is a mixed methods process evaluation of a programmatic intervention to integrate family
      planning and immunization services at health facilities and through outreach services in Dowa
      and Ntchisi districts of Malawi. The study involved qualitative methods (in depth interviews
      and focus group discussions with service providers, mothers and fathers of infants &lt;1 year,
      and supervisors and program managers) as well as secondary analysis of service statistics for
      family planning and immunization services and of supervision reports.

    <description>The approach involved integration of services through health surveillance assistant (HSA) outreach as well as through the health facility platform. The HSAs provided door to door FP services in their designated communities as well as provided integrated FP and Immunisation services at village clinics and outreach sessions. At outreach sessions, mothers were offered both routine infant immunization and family planning services (pills, condoms, injectables plus referrals for other methods). At health facilities, mothers who sought routine infant immunization services were offered same-day family planning services and those who seek family planning services are also screened for infant immunization schedule completion / need for infant immunization services. HSAs and health facility providers were trained on FP-immunization service integration and were monitored through regular supportive supervision visits.</description>
