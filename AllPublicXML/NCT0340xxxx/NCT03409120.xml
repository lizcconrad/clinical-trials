  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study occurs during five visits that are already scheduled as part of &quot;Biomarkers to
      Guide Directional DBS for Parkinson's Disease&quot; (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT03353688).
      If participants have dystonia associated with Parkinson's disease, the investigators will
      consent and administer one additional rating scale (Burke-Fahn-Marsden Dystonia Rating Scale)
      to assess the severity of dystonia.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      To measure the effects of DBS on dystonia, the investigators will measure the change in the
      Burke-Fahn-Marsden Dystonia Rating Scale at 2, 4, 6, and 12 months after surgery versus
      preoperative baseline. This will allow them to contrast the effects of omnidirectional versus
      directional STN DBS on dystonia symptoms in patients with PD.

    <masking_description>This study will run in conjunction with &quot;Biomarkers to Guide Directional DBS for Parkinson's Disease&quot; (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT03353688). It is a double blinded study investigating the effectiveness of directional DBS leads in which participants and some investigators will have no knowledge of the DBS settings participants experience.</masking_description>

    <description>Evaluation of degree of dystonia related symptoms. Domains evaluated include eyes, mouth, speech/swallowing, neck, arms, trunk, and legs. Each domain is scored on degree of provoking factor (0= no dystonia at rest or with action; 4 = dystonia present at rest) and severity factor (0 = no dystonia; 4 = extreme/severe dystonia). Scores are then weighted yielding a total score between 0 and 120.</description>
