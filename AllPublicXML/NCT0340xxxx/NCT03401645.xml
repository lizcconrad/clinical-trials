    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to find out whether the Home-based Arm and Hand Exercise (HAHE)
      program improves functions of the upper limb that is affected after traumatic brain injury.
      HAHE is made up of exercises that simulate real-life tasks.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Arm and hand dysfunction, although not widely recognized, is a common and devastating
      consequence of traumatic brain injury (TBI). Recommendations have been published that
      encourage clinicians to include upper extremity retraining within the TBI population;
      however, very little research exists that will help inform treatments for this population.
      There is urgency to broaden the scientific evidence critical to informing upper limb
      rehabilitation for TBI survivors. The proposed study will do just that by using a
      task-specific visuomotor exercise protocol that emphasizes upper limb movements which can be
      practiced by patients in their homes. This new home-based arm and hand exercise (HAHE)
      protocol is expected to improve functional recovery and quality of life among individuals
      with chronic upper limb impairment after moderate-to-severe TBI.

    <description>Participants will be wearing the wrist device with an alarm timer that sends out signals every 5 minutes. The alarm is a buzzing noise and a vibration. Participants must turn off the alarm then perform a series of visuomotor tasks. This will be done for one hour, twice a day for two weeks.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Time post injury: &gt;12 Months

          -  Moderate to severe TBI, with one of the following (as confirmed by medical records):

               1. Post-traumatic amnesia for over 24 hours

               2. Trauma-related intracranial neuroimaging abnormalities (based on radiology
                  reports of the head CT scan acquired acutely)

               3. Loss of consciousness for over 30 minutes

               4. Score of over 13 on the Glasgow Coma Scale (recorded in emergency dept, but not
                  valid if patient was intubated, sedated or intoxicated)

          -  Has emerged from post-traumatic amnesia (as indicated by review of medical history
             documents)

          -  Cognitively oriented (score above 23 on the Mini Mental State Examination)

          -  One upper limb is more affected than the other, and participant reports impaired upper
             limb function because of the more affected limb

          -  The more affected limb is at Stage 3, 4 or 5 of Arm Recovery

          -  Be able to complete the sequence of the HAHE protocol independently, safely and
             accurately by the end of the therapist-guided training

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  &lt; 18 years old at the time of injury

          -  A history of previous neurological disorder such as stroke, seizure, multiple
             sclerosis, spinal cord injury, cerebral palsy, Parkinson's disease, or Alzheimer's
             disease. This is to assure that participants' deficits are secondary to TBI only.

          -  A history of significant psychiatric disorder such as schizophrenia, bipolar disorder,
             or obsessive-compulsive disorder. There may be potential cognitive changes due to such
             history, which may affect the ability in following the treatment protocol.

          -  A history of substance abuse requiring inpatient treatment. There may be potential
             cognitive changes due to such history, which may affect the ability in following the
             treatment protocol.

          -  The more affected limb is at the Stage 1, 2, 6, or 7 of Arm Recovery (Figure 2).

          -  Pain in the upper extremity during the upper limb function screening

          -  Active subluxation of the shoulders (i.e., the glenohumeral joint)

          -  Undergoing treatment for spasticity in the upper limb (e.g. botulinum toxin injection)
