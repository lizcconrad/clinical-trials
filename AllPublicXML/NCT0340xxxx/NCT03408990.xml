  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the association of signals recorded and analysed
      with VenticaÂ® Lung Function Testing System (LFTS) in infants and pre-schoolers during the
      whole night sleep with the gold standard for sleep recording events, polysomnography, in
      order to better understand the confounding factors for momentary changes in the impedance
      pneumography-derived tidal breathing flow-volume (TBFV) curves.
