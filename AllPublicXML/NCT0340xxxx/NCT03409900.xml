  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Total hip arthroplasty (THA) is one of the most successful orthopedic procedures to
      effectively relieve pain and restore function in patients with end stage osteoarthritis. In
      an attempt to accelerate recovery many orthopedic surgeons have opted to utilize a direct
      anterior approach (DAA) as opposed to the more traditional posterolateral approach (PLA). The
      literature supports that DAA is superior to PLA with regard to lower blood loss, less pain,
      shorter hospital stay, and faster rehabilitation. Traditionally the study team has performed
      Lumbar Plexus blocks (LPB) to provide post-operative analgesia for total hip arthroplasty.
      The quadratus lumborum block (QLB) is a newer regional analgesic technique that may be as
      effective as LPB at providing pain control following DAA hip arthroplasty. This study is
      designed to compare the efficacy, with regards to post-operative pain management, between LPB
      and QLB following a DAA total hip arthroplasty.

      In an attempt to accelerate recovery many orthopedic surgeons have opted to utilize a direct
      anterior approach (DAA) as opposed to the more traditional posterolateral approach (PLA) in
      regards to total hip arthroplasty (THA). The DAA technique involves dissection of muscular
      planes for insertion of components resulting in less tissue damage as compared to PLA.
      Traditionally the study team has performed Lumbar Plexus blocks (LPB) to provide
      post-operative analgesia for total hip arthroplasty. This technique works well for the
      traditionally performed PLA in that the hip joint and incision site are within the analgesic
      distribution of the LPB. Conversely, the DAA utilizes an anterior incision that overlies the
      L1 and L2 dermatomes as opposed to the lower lumbar dermatomes of the PLA incision. When
      performing LPB it has been the study team's clinical experience that it is rare to achieve
      analgesia in the proximal distribution of the lumbar plexus resulting in apparent sparing of
      the L1 and L2 nerve root distributions. The quadratus lumborum block (QLB) is a newer
      regional analgesic technique that may be as effective as LPB at providing pain control
      following DAA hip arthroplasty. The QLB is thought to provide analgesia by blocking both the
      lateral and anterior cutaneous branches of T7 through L4. This degree of dermatomal coverage
      suggests that QLB could be an efficacious alternative to LPB for DAA hip arthroplasty. It is
      hypothesized that the QLB will provide equivalent analgesia when compared to the LPB as
      determined by a comparison of verbal reported pain scores.

    <description>Patients will be randomized to receive either a LPB or QLB for post-operative analgesia. Randomization to either LPB or QLB will occur via block randomization using sealed sequentially numbered opaque envelopes that will correspond to the order with which patients are enrolled. Patients and research assistants will be blinded to their randomization by administration of intravenous sedation (titrated to patient comfort), utilization of ultrasonography to visualize pertinent structures for both blocks, and by the nature of the block technique themselves both being in close proximity on the posterior lower back.</description>
