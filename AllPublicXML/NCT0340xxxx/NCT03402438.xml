          -  Men or confirmed postmenopausal women (by medical report verification and defined as
             exhibiting natural amenorrhea for at least 12 months before screening or as exhibiting
             natural amenorrhea for at least 6 months before screening with documented serum
             follicle-stimulating hormone levels &gt;40 mIU/mL, provided that no prior hormonal
             treatment has taken place) or women without childbearing potential based on surgical
             treatment at least 6 weeks before screening such as bilateral tubal ligation,
             bilateral oophorectomy or hysterectomy (documented by medical report verification).

          -  Subjects with renal impairment:

        eGFR &lt;90 mL/min/1.73 m*2 determined from serum creatinine 2 -10 days prior to dosing.

        Stable renal disease, i.e. a serum creatinine value determined at least 3 months before the
        pre-study visit (e.g. during routine diagnostics) should not vary by more than 20% from the
        serum creatinine value determined at the pre-study visit

        - Healthy subjects eGFR ≥90 mL/min/1.73 m*2 determined from serum creatinine 2 -10 days
        prior to dosing.

        Needs to be within the required age and body weight range of Group 1 (which should not vary
        by more than+- 10 years and +-10 kg to Groups 2-4).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Clinically relevant findings(e.g. blood pressure, electrocardiogram, ECG; physical
             examination,laboratory examination)

          -  Relevant impairment in liver function.

          -  Pre-existing diseases (including impairment of liver function) for which it can be
             assumed that the absorption, distribution, metabolism, elimination and effects of the
             study drugs will not be normal.

          -  Any organ transplant &lt; 1 year before participation in this study.

          -  Subject under dialysis or planned to start dialysis during participation in the study.

          -  Failure of any other major organ system other than the kidney.
