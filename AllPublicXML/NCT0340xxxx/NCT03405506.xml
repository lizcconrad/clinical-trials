  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Quantitative Flow Ratio (QFR) is a novel method for evaluating the functional significance of
      coronary stenosis. Virtual stent implantation technique combined with QFR was recently
      developed to predict the functional significance of coronary stenosis as if the stenosis was
      revascularized.

      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of QFR in in tandem lesions
      with fractional flow reserve (FFR) as the reference standard. The secondary purpose is to
      evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of QFR-based virtual stent technique in predicting the FFR
      values after revascularizing the culprit lesion.

    <textblock>
      QFR is a novel method for evaluating the functional significance of coronary stenosis by
      calculation of the pressure drop in the vessel. 3D coronary models can be reconstructed based
      on two angiographic projections to obtain the geometric parameters, including vascular
      diameter or cross-sectional area. According to the lesion stenosis, vessel curvature, conical
      geometry and reference lumen characteristics, pressure drop can be calculated in real time
      based on its relationship with blood flow. There is no need for pressure wire and adenosine /
      ATP induced maximum hyperemia compared with FFR.

      The FAVOR Pilot Study and FAVOR II China Study showed promising results for diagnostic
      accuracy in consecutive patients. However, the diagnostic accuracy of QFR in specific tandem
      lesions needs further investigation. Furthermore, using the virtual stent technology to
      accurately assess the culprit lesion and choose the optimal treatment is significant in
      precisely guiding PCI surgery.
