  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Picky eating behaviour in young children is a very common concern for parents. The aim of the
      study is to investigate factors during early life which are associated with a child becoming
      a picky eater.

      Singleton children from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children will be studied
      prospectively (n=5758-6608). Parental-completion questionnaires will be used to define 'picky
      eating' status at age 3 years, and child and parental feeding behaviours and practices
      throughout the first 2 years of the child's life. Multinomial logistic regression models with
      3 levels of picky eating status (not, somewhat and very picky) as the dependant variables
      will be used to test associations with antecedent variables, first assessing variables from
      pregnancy, and the first and second year of life, separately, then combining all significant
      variables in a final model.

        All pregnant women in the former Avon Health Authority with an expected delivery date
        between April 1991 and December 1992 were eligible for the study; 14,541 pregnant women
        were initially enrolled, resulting in a cohort of 14,062 live births with 13,988 alive at 1
        year of age. Parents/caregivers were sent a questionnaire when the child was 3 years old
        that included a question on picky eating behaviour. Singleton children whose
        parents/caregivers answered this question were included in the study.
