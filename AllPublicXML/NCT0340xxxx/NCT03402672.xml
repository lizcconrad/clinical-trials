  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to:

        1. assess how participants like the AWAITS e-health application as measured by their
           feedback on the intervention

        2. test the impact of AWAITS on knowledge about opioid overdose and risk-reduction
           strategies.

        3. assess the proportion of participants who accept a list of local treatment providers

        4. test the impact of AWAITS on interest in being tested for HCV/HIV.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The pre-post study of AWAITS will: 1) assess the acceptability of AWAITS as measured by
      participant feedback about the intervention; 2) test the impact of AWAITS on knowledge about
      opioid overdose, as measured by the OOTAS; 3) assess the proportion of participants who
      accept a list of local MAT treatment providers; and 4) test the impact of AWAITS on interest
      in being tested for HCV/HIV.

      The acceptability of AWAITS will be assessed with a feedback form which includes questions
      about how helpful the intervention was (scale of 1-4), what the patient liked most and least
      about the intervention, and any suggestions for improving it. The average (and standard
      deviation) for the rated helpfulness of the intervention will be derived and the qualitative
      data about what they liked most and least about the intervention and suggestions for
      improvement will be tabulated. Pre-/post-changes in the percent of correct knowledge
      assessment items (i.e., about overdose and MAT) and interest in HCV/HIV testing will be
      analyzed using a Wilcoxon signed-rank test. The proportion of participants accepting a list
      of local MAT treatment providers will be calculated.

    <intervention_name>self-administered, e-health application</intervention_name>
    <description>AWAITS is a self-administered, e-health application and includes short videos in which patients who are successfully engaged in MAT discuss what they wish they had known about MAT when they were actively using. The intervention is designed to maximize &quot;scalability&quot; - the administration would entail handing an electronic device (e.g., tablet, laptop, etc.) to an individual who would then self-administer the intervention.</description>
