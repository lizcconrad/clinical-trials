      Although neurorehabilitation is the most promising clinical strategy for motor recovery in
      patients with multiple sclerosis (MS), treatment responsiveness and outcomes are mixed.
      Neurorehabilitation drives neuroplasticity, i.e., the brain's ability to form and reorganize
      synaptic connections, and involves learning new motor skills, such as standing or walking.
      Initial stages of learning motor skills often require explicit concentration on the details
      of the movement. As one becomes more proficient in the motor skill, it becomes less
      attention-demanding and more automatic. Among healthy adults, the cerebellum mediates the
      shift from early to automatic stages of learning, while animal work shows that brain
      myelination is essential for learning new motor skills and a recent human trial shows that
      task-specific motor training can improve myelin integrity. MS leads to demyelination that can
      affect both the cognitive domains required for this learning process as well as parts of the
      brain that may be required for the automatic execution of motor skills. Although individuals
      with MS are capable of learning new motor skills, not all individuals with MS achieve the
      automatic stage of learning, which is critical for successful rehabilitation. Thus, there is
      a critical need to identify both clinical and structural brain factors predictive of a shift
      from early to automatic learning in persons with MS.

      Specific Aims:

      Therefore, the aims of this study are to:

        1. Identify relationships among brain structures and motor skill acquisition.

        2. Identify relationships among clinical markers and motor skill acquisition.

      To achieve these aims, 72 ambulatory persons with MS will participate in a baseline 3T MRI as
      well as clinical testing of cognitive processing speed. All participants will be trained for
      4 days on a challenging balance program (i.e., motor skill learning) that mimics dynamic
      postural training performed during neurorehabilitation to target high-level balance in
      individuals with neurologic disorders. Briefly, participants will shift their weight to move
      a cursor on a screen to a target. Throughout the training blocks, individuals will receive
      online cursor feedback and will be guarded by a trained study team member to ensure safety.
      To examine the shift from cognitive to automatic learning, participants will be evaluated
      before and after training on their ability to perform a cognitive working memory task while
      performing the dynamic balance shifting (i.e., dual-task performance). The diminishing cost
      of dual-task performance can be used as an index for automaticity and will serve as the
      primary outcome measure for this study.

      Secondary outcomes include changes in clinical balance performance on the Berg Balance Scale
      and changes in single-task performance (i.e., ability to perform the dynamic balance shifting
      task alone or the working memory cognitive task alone).

      At the completion of the proposed research, our expected outcomes are to have identified key
      predictors of motor in persons with MS that influence neurorehabilitation responders (i.e.,
      those who reach the automatic stage of learning) and non-responders to a challenging
      balance-training program. We anticipate that a) brain myelin of the corticospinal tract and
      axonal integrity of the superior cerebellar peduncles will mediate motor skill acquisition
      leading to a shift from early cognitive learning to automatic learning; and b) higher
      cognitive processing speed, which is impacted by demyelination, mediates motor skill
      acquisition, leading to improved task automaticity.

      The objective of this work is to understand factors, both clinical and neuroimaging measures,
      that may influence motor skill acquisition and therefore success with rehabilitation.

        Inclusion Criteria: (1) Diagnosis of MS, (2) Patient Determined Disease Steps (PDDS) &lt;6.5,
        indicating ability to ambulate with or without an assistive device (Hohol, 1999; Learmonth,
        2013) (3) between the ages of 18 and 65; (4) stable medication regime for 3 months prior to
        enrollment, and (5) able to follow study-related commands with a Mini-Mental State
        Examination (MMSE) score of &gt;24 (Folstein, 1975).

        Exclusion Criteria: (1) history of neurological conditions such as stroke, (2) acute
        orthopedic conditions that prevent participation in the training, (3) steroid use &lt;30 days
        prior to enrollment; and (4) history of alcohol abuse. With regard to medications, it is
        likely that many participants will be taking a disease modifying therapy and at least 1
        other medication. Results from previous balance training programs in MS have not indicated
        any systemic effects of medication; as such, participants will not be excluded on the basis
        of medications. However, medication name and dosage as well as any changes over the course
        of the study will be documented. Participants will be required to have a stable medication
        regime of at least 3 months prior to start of the trial.
