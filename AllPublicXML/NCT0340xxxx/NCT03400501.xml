  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a pilot study to examine and compare the efficacy of supervised injections of long
      acting insulins degludec and glargine to protect youth with poorly controlled type 1 diabetes
      (T1D) from development of ketones.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will compare the proportion of days with fasting β-hydroxybutyrate levels ≥0.6
      mmol/L at the start of the school week following weekend/holiday breaks in subjects who have
      been randomized to receive daily injections of I-deg or I-glar. Hypothesis: β-hydroxybutyrate
      levels will be lower in the morning of the first day of the school week in subjects receiving
      I-deg than in subjects receiving I-glar, since the long half-life of I-deg will compensate
      for missed insulin doses over the weekend/holidays. To remove variability due to potential
      non-compliance during the school week, this study will utilize our routine clinical practice
      of supervised insulin administration and monitoring of blood glucose and ketones during the
      school day.
