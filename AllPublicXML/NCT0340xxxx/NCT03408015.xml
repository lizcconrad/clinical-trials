  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Every night during sleep, there is an accumulation of white blood cells in the closed eye.
      The closed eye white blood cells are predominantly neutrophils, but there is a small
      population (3%) of T cells. The effects of these closed eye white blood cells on dry eye
      disease pathogenesis have yet to be fully elucidated, but preliminary evidence suggests that
      closed eye neutrophils may have an associated hyperactivity and increased degranulation in
      dry eye disease that could contribute to epithelial instability. As an anti-T cell therapy,
      Xiidra offers an opportunity to better understand how the closed eye white blood cells are
      recruited and activated. This study also seeks to verify the proposed mechanism of action.

          -  Able and willing to follow protocol instructions

          -  Capable of performing at-home eye wash

          -  Must be willing to drop off samples and comply with study visit procedures

          -  For contact lens wearers, must wear lenses at least four hours per day, four days per
             week

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Current cigarette smokers

             to participate in another investigational drug or device study, they will be
             discontinued from this study protocol.

          -  Current pregnancy or nursing as indicated by self-report. While not a safety issue,
             pregnancy or nursing influences the biochemical composition of the tear film.

          -  A history of ocular surgery within the past 12 months

          -  Any present use of Accutane or ocular medications

          -  Any history of significant adverse reaction to lifitegrast or other components of the

          -  For normal and dry eye subjects, any history of contact lens wear within the past

          -  For contact lens wearers, any change of soft contact lens brand or care solutions
             within 30 days prior to screening or any anticipation of changing current type/brand
             of contact lenses or care solutions throughout the 84 day study

          -  Any condition, which in the examiner's opinion, may put the subject at significant
             risk, confound study results, or interfere with their participation in the study.
