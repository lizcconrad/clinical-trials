  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is, first, to describe the evolution of the caloric compensation
      ability in infants from 3 to 15 months old and, secondly, to assess the links between changes
      in the caloric compensation ability and the individual characteristics (adiposity, age,
      gender, infant's eating behavior) and maternal feeding practices.

      Three series of measurements of caloric compensation abitlity were conducted: at 3-4 months
      old, at 10.5 months old and at 14.5 months old in the laboratory.

      In this study, a preload paradigm usually employed in children and adults to measure the
      caloric compensation ability was adapted to infants below 15 months old. The maternal eating
      behavior and their feeding practices were measured by questionnaires. The infants' height and
      weight were measured at the laboratory by trained experimenters.

    <description>Based on intake data, Energy Intakes (EI) were calculated according to caloric composition of the offered foods from the manufacturers. From the EI data, a COMPX score was calculated at each studied age by dividing the difference in EI from meals by the difference in EI from preloads (presented as a percentage). A COMPX score of 100% reflects a perfect caloric compensation.</description>

    <description>The investigators have adapted an established within-subject preload paradigm to assess infant's short term caloric compensation. At each studied age, the measure of caloric compensation required two visits at the laboratory on two non-consecutive days. On the first visit, the infants received a fixed amount of a food preload either low or high in energy density. The order of the two preloads was counterbalanced. After a delay (ranging from several hours in the 3-4 months old infants to 25 min in 10.5- and 14.5-month-old infants), the infants were served an ad libitum meal. Weight intakes (g) were assessed by weighing each bottle/bowl before and after consumption.</description>
