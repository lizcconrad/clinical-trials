  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if a 10 week exercise rehabilitation program
      decreases anterior knee oain (PFPS) and improves function in patients with patellofemoral
      pain syndrome (PFPS). Individuals (age 18-50) with PFPS will be recruited to participate in
      this study to see if a 10 week exercise program focusing in core and hip strengthening, lower
      extremity strengthening foot intrinsic strengthening can decrease pain and increase function.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patellofemoral pain syndrome (PFPS) is a very prevalent condition that presents in great
      number to patients in physician's offices and has a high recurrence rate. Physical therapy
      and exercise therapy to strengthen the quadriceps is often prescribed, however recurrence is
      common. It is hypothesized that PFPS patients have core weakness, hip strength abnormalities
      and neuromuscular control deficits.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Individuals wishing to participate in study voluntarily

          -  Subjects diagnosed with patella-femoral syndrome. We will ascertain this by asking a
             few questions, which will not be recorded as they have not been enrolled in the study
             yet.

          -  Capable of following and completing a 10 week home exercise program

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Individuals with prior knee surgery, tibial plateau fractures, known diagnosis of knee
             injuries such as meniscus or ligaments tears.

          -  Individuals unable to participate, i.e. cognitive deficits, weakness or functional
             deficits to upper extremities.

          -  Individuals unable to tolerate exercise program
