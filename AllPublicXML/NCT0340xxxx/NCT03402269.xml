  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Clavicle fractures in children are common. Typical treatment includes nonoperative treatment
      with a sling. Operative treatment is usually limited to open, unstable, fractures with either
      epidermal risks or neurovascular compromise. Orthopaedic literature has many studies that
      report the need for additional research for this prevalent fracture. This is an observational
      study evaluating the functional and patient reported outcomes of displaced clavicle fractures
      in adolescents. The results from this study will help the orthopedist understand the expected
      outcomes for a given pediatric patient with a clavicle fracture.
