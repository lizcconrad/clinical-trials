    <description>Three visits are needed in this therapy method. Visits schedule:( 1st visit - Day 1st , 2nd visit- 7 days after the 1st, 3rd visit- 7 days after the 2nd) Equipment: acupuncture needle 0,6*13 e.g. Dragon Medical Device, solution for skin disinfection, sterile gauze.

Nimesulide 2*100 mg/ 24 h- twice a day one pill of the 100 mg Nimesulide during 14 days</description>

    <arm_group_type>Active Comparator</arm_group_type>
    <description>Splint therapy is an useful treatment method for several group of patients e.g TMD patients, patients with retrodiscitis, patients with muscle pain disorders like local muscle soreness or chronic myalgia.
The patients have been instructed to use the appliance during nighttime. After 7 days the patient had to came back for a control visit.</description>

    <intervention_name>NSAID</intervention_name>
    <description>Nimesulide has anti-inflammatory and analgesic properties. Like other NSAIDs it inhibits the action of COX . If prostaglandins can not be further synthesized, so there is no factor able to excite local nociceptors. According to t must be taken regularly for a minimum 2 weeks to achieve appropriate blood concentration.</description>

    <description>The stabilization appliance used in this study was a removable device for maxillary arch, made of hard acrylic. Appliance was fitted over occlusal and incisal surfaces of the teeth and precisely contacted with the teeth of opposing arch. It provided canine disocclusion of the posterior teeth during eccentric movements.</description>
