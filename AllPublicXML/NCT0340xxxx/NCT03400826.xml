  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study is a phase II double blinded clinical trial to determine feasibility, safety and
      preliminary clinical efficacy of simvastatin to reduce leiomyoma size. Women with symptomatic
      fibroids planned to undergo surgical management for fibroids such as hysterectomy or
      myomectomy will be screened for participation. The eligible women will undergo pre-study
      evaluation to ascertain study eligibility.The study will enroll 60 participants in total,
      half will receive simvastatin and the other half will receive a placebo. The study drug and
      placebo will be an add on to the participants ongoing medical management of fibroids until
      surgery. The participants will be monitored at intervals for the effect of the drug on
      fibroid size and symptoms using ultrasound and quality of life questionnaires.

    <description>The questionnaire used is the Uterine Fibroid Symptom and Health Related Quality of Life Questionnaire. This questionnaire is an effective and validated tool for detecting differences in symptom severity and health-related quality of life among patients with uterine fibroids. The scale for this questionnaire denotes symptom severity with lowest and highest possible scores of 8 and 40 respectively. Higher scores indicate greater severity of symptoms.</description>
