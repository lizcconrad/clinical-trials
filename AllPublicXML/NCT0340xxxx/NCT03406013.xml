    <textblock>
      This pilot clinical trial studies how well the True NTH Community of Wellness internet-based
      exercise and diet support works in improving diet and exercise habits in prostate cancer
      survivors. Internet-based exercise and diet support may help better control treatment-related
      side effects and symptoms, better overall quality of life, and lower risk factors associated
      with cancer progression.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the feasibility and acceptability of the Community of Wellness web portal
      among prostate cancer survivors by conducting a randomized controlled study comparing four
      levels of web-based content and interaction with participants.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To compare efficacy of four levels of web-based content in the Community of Wellness web
      portal in a pilot randomized controlled trial on exercise and dietary habits, self-efficacy
      for behavior change, motivation for exercise, and changes in treatment-related side effects.

      OUTLINE: Patients are assigned to 1 of 4 groups.

      GROUP I: Patients receive &quot;Written Information&quot; which includes access to the TrueNTH open
      access portal that provides basic written information about exercise and diet.

      GROUP II: Patients receive access to &quot;Written Information + Prescription&quot;, including written
      information plus additional an exercise prescription and tailored diet recommendations.

      GROUP III: Patients receive access to &quot;Written Information + Prescription + Technology&quot;,
      including written information, exercise prescription + diet recommendation and additional
      technology components. Patients complete diet and exercise behavior logs and receive
      educational and motivational text messages about healthy diet and exercise habits.

      GROUP IV: Patients receive access to &quot;Written Information + Prescription + Technology +
      Coaching&quot; and receive written information, exercise prescription + diet recommendation,
      technology support and a 30-minute (each) diet and exercise consultation plus the ability to
      receive ongoing advice from coaches via the web portal.

      After completion of intervention, patients are followed up at 3 months.
