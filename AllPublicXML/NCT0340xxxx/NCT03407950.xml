  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Schizophrenia is a chronic disease with deficit in social interaction and lost of autonomy in
      daily life. Negative symptoms as blunted affect, avolition, social deficit and anhedonia and
      cognition were prognosis and functioning key's factors. Psychotropic medications have shown
      only poor effect to improve negative symptoms and cognition as attention, memory and
      cognitive flexibility. So, cognitive remediation programs were developped to focus cognitive
      disorders. The IPT (Integrated Psychological Treatment) is one of the most complete program
      with modules on cognitive and social abilities. The aim of this study is to evaluate the
      efficacy of IPT+ program to improve autonomy capacities of long stay inpatients suffering
      from schizophrenia 6 at the end of the program With IPT+ this study will improve autonomy
      capacities for patients suffering from deficit schizophrenia and allowed patients to go out
      hospital earlier than before.

      autonomy 6 months after the program, to evaluate the efficacy of the program on negative
      symptoms, quality of life, cognitive functions, social cognition and duration of
      hospitalisation.

      This study propose a randomised controlled study with 2 arms, with blind evaluation to
      compare the IPT+ versus treatment as usual (TAU). The follow up will be 6 month for the With
      IPT+ this study will improve autonomy capacities for patients suffering from deficit
      schizophrenia and allowed patients to go out hospital earlier than before.
