  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, randomized, single blinded trial involving human subjects. The goal of
      this study is to determine an optimal location (proximal or distal) for the nerve block and
      whether it will make a difference in how much opioid the patient will receive during and
      after surgery. Ultrasound will identify the adductor canal and the proximal end of the
      adductor canal/apex of the femoral triangle to determine the location of the blocks.

      Their will be two randomized groups: 1. ACB within true AC with bupivacaine 0.5% 20cc2. ACB
      proximal to true AC with bupivacaine 0.5% 20cc
