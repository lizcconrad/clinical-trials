  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this clinical research study is to find out if ultrasound scans using a contrast
      agent called Lumason (sulfur hexafluoride lipid-type A microspheres) can help doctors more
      easily find liver lesions (including hepatocellular carcinoma [HCC]), compared to ultrasounds
      without contrast agent. Contrast agents are drugs that are injected into a vein in order to
      help certain organs and tissues show up more clearly on scans.

      Researchers will also compare the effectiveness of liver ultrasounds using Lumason versus
      standard MRI imaging, in patients with cirrhosis of the liver.

      This is an investigational study. Ultrasound and MRI scans on this study are performed using
      FDA-approved and commercially available methods.

      Up to 150 patients will be enrolled on this research study. All will take part at MD
      Anderson.

      If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, within 2 weeks after your routine
      care MRI scan, you will have a standard ultrasound performed on your abdomen without using a
      contrast agent. This involves placing some ultrasound gel directly on the skin and moving a
      transducer (probe) over the surface of your abdomen, as you lie (usually face-up) on an
      examination table.

      You will then have another ultrasound performed in the same way. However, before this
      ultrasound, the contrast agent Lumason will be injected into your vein in your arm. The 2
      ultrasounds will take about an hour to complete.

      As part of this study, some of the information from your medical record will also be
      collected as needed.

      The information from your medical record and the images from the 3 scans (the routine MRI and
      the 2 ultrasounds) will be stored in a research database indefinitely. Your data will be
      given a code number. No identifying information will be directly linked to your data. Only
      the researchers in charge of the database will have access to the code numbers and be able to
      link the data to you. This is to allow medical data related to the data to be updated as
      needed.

      Length of Study:

      Your participation on this study will be over after the 2 ultrasounds. Your primary care team
      will follow up with you, according to standard care.
