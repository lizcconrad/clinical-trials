  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The present study examines the effectiveness of the rehabilitation program in the framework
      of the &quot;Ezra LeMarpeh&quot; project for Parkinson's patients. The Ezra LeMarpeh Association,
      founded by Rabbi A. E. Firer, provides assistance to the sick and needy. The site features a
      wide range of advanced, high quality rehabilitation devices, a unique hydrotherapy pool and
      associated accessories that enable the staff to provide the finest quality and most
      professional treatment. Before entering a rehabilitative program, each participant will
      arrive independently at the Ezra LeMarpeh Center for evaluation tests and will undergo
      comprehensive evaluation tests by the center's physiotherapist, including walking tests,
      balance tests, filling out questionnaires to assess Quality of life and disease severity. At
      the end of the program, the participants will be asked to repeat evaluation tests.

      Before entering a rehabilitation program, each participant will arrive independently at the
      &quot;Ezra LeMarpeh&quot; Center, at 24 Chida St., Bnei Brak. After a detailed explanation of the
      nature of the study, the participants will sign an informed consent form. The center's
      physiotherapists will test walking abilities, motor functioning and abilities in activities
      of daily living (ADL).

      Walking tests can include walking at a comfortable pace, walking while counting (dual
      tasking), walking at different speeds and more. The balance tests include standing on a small
      base, standing on one leg, standing with eyes closed, and more. During the tests participants
      will wear small, non-invasive sensors at the wrists, ankles, and lower back. These sensors
      include an accelerometers and a gyroscopes that can be used to quantify gait measures, such
      as gait velocity, step length and variability. Lower back sensors can be answered
      continuously for up to a week for everyday activity.

      At the end of the program, the participants will be asked to repeat evaluation tests.
