  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-arm, open-label phase II clinical trial in which approximately 55 patients
      with newly diagnosed glioblastoma (GBM) will be enrolled with the intent to receive an
      autologous dendritic cell vaccine consisting of autologous dendritic cells loaded with
      autologous tumor-associated antigens (AV-GBM-1).

      This is a single-arm, open-label phase II clinical trial in which approximately 55 patients
      will be enrolled with the intent to receive AV-GBM-1. Patients eligible for treatment will be
      those (1) who have recovered from surgery such that they are about to begin concurrent
      chemotherapy and radiation therapy (CT/RT), (2) for whom an autologous tumor cell line has
      been established, (3) have a KPS of &gt; 70, and (4) have undergone successful leukapheresis
      from which peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) were obtained that can be used to
      generate dendritic cells (DC).

      The primary endpoint of this trial is overall survival (OS), death from any cause measured
      from the date of study enrollment for treatment with AV-GBM-1. Secondary endpoints will
      include (1) PFS measured from date of enrollment, (2) OS/PFS measured from date of diagnosis
      and (3) OS/PFS from date of enrollment based on KPS, age, and extent of surgical resection.
      Tertiary endpoints will include (1) OS/PFS from date of first injection and (2) OS/PFS from
      date of first injection in patients who completed concurrent CT/RT and had not progressed.

      Patient Population: Patients 18 years or older with newly diagnosed glioblastoma [World
      Health Organization (WHO) Grade IV glioma, Grade IV anaplastic astrocytoma, glioblastoma or
      gliosarcoma, glioblastoma multiforme (GBM)] who have recovered from surgery, for whom an
      autologous tumor cell culture and leukapheresis product are available, who have a KPS of &gt;
      70, and who are about to begin concurrent CT/RT.
