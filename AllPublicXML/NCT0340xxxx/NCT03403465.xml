  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study expands on protocol (NCT01908504&quot;PET adaptive RT&quot;) designed to evaluate the
      utility of adaptive PET-CT planning for radiation therapy (RT). Radiation therapy is used in
      many malignant diseases as a curative treatment modality. However, critical normal tissue is
      often in close approximation to disease, and portions of such tissue must receive high doses
      of radiation for appropriate treatment.

      Positron Emission Tomography (PET) adapted radiation therapy, as defined in the current
      protocol, may allow for a means of determining the eventual response to therapy, at a time
      point when adaptation of treatment plan may be possible to improve outcomes. This protocol
      will build upon the findings the previous protocol (NCT01908504 &quot;PET adaptive RT&quot;) that
      evaluated the utility of intra-treatment PET imaging in multiple types of cancers. The
      current focus will be more specific to certain types of gastrointestinal and gynecologic
      cancers treated with RT, identified from the prior study to warrant further research.

    <textblock>
      Intra-treatment PETs have only recently been studied in small pilot series. In rectal cancer,
      a prospective trial from MSKCC demonstrated that a PET-CT obtained in the second week of
      neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy was able to discriminate sub-optimal responders with a
      sensitivity of 94% and an accuracy of 78%, though the most useful metric was a novel &quot;visual
      response score&quot; based on interpreting radiologists scoring rather than more established
      objective data available from PET, like SUV. A study from China in non-small cell lung cancer
      found that decreases in SUV and MTV on intra-treatment PET-CTs after 40Gy of chemoradiation
      therapy were significantly greater in patients responding to treatment by post-treatment
      RECIST criteria. For head and neck cancers, a Belgian study found that intra-treatment SUVmax
      at 47Gy was associated with significant differences in overall survival. Therefore, there is
      emerging evidence that an intra-treatment PET may also be of significant prognostic utility,
      at an early enough time point to potentially alter treatment accordingly.

      All participants will be required to complete two research PET scans in addition to standard
      of care planning CT's for radiation therapy. For all subjects with cancer of the cervix and
      vulva an intra-treatment PET-CT will be obtained and used to develop a volume adaptive
      treatment plan for the remainder of the course. Subjects with esophageal and anal canal
      cancer will have an adapted plan if the treating radiation oncologist determines an adapted
      plan is clinically relevant.

    <description>At radiation planning subjects will have a PET-CT. The CT scan — also called computerized tomography or just CT — combines a series of X-ray views taken from many different angles to produce cross-sectional images of the bones and soft tissues inside the body. CT scans in planning radiation therapy are standard of care. A PET is a highly specialized imaging technique that uses short-lived radioactive substances (such as FDG a simple sugar labeled with a radioactive atom) to produce three-dimensional colored images of those substances functioning within the body. These images are called PET scans and the technique is termed PET scanning. PET scanning provides information about the body's chemistry not available through other procedures. Unlike CT or MRI (magnetic resonance imaging), techniques that look at anatomy or body form, PET studies metabolic activity or body function.</description>
