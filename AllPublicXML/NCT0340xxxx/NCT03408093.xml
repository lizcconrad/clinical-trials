  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of the study is to evaluate the adherence to the treatment with
      interferon beta-1b, in patients diagnosed with isolated syndrome (CIS), relapsing-remitting
      multiple sclerosis (RRMS), or secondary progressive multiple sclerosis (SPMS) who had more
      than 6 months in treatment.
