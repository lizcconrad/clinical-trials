    <textblock>
      Laparoscopic distal gastrectomy (LDG) is a common surgery in the surgical trainees. However,
      there is no assessment system to measuring the surgical skill of surgical trainees. The novel
      surgical assessment system, which called Global Operative Assessment of Laparoscopic
      Skills-Distal Gastrectomy (GOALS-DG) by the task analysis and the Delphi method have been
      developed. This study describes assessing the development of surgical skill by GOALS-DG in
      the initial experience of LDG.

    <time_frame>Participants will be followed for the duration of the educational study for 3 years.</time_frame>
    <description>The surgical skill and performance of LDG was scored using GOALS-DG by a trainee and an instructor. The difference in mean surgical performance score of GOALS-DG was evaluated in tree phase. The score about GOALS-DG is evaluated on a three or two level scale ( 28items in B-1 reconstruction or 31items in R-Y reconstruction). Maximum of total score is 46 in B-1 reconstruction or 52 in R-Y reconstruction. High score is good surgical skill. Low score is poor surgical skill.</description>

    <description>Operation time, bleeding , Postoperative complications are compared with average of total score of GOALS-DG. The score about GOALS-DG is evaluated on a three or two level scale ( 28items in B-1 reconstruction or 31items in R-Y reconstruction). Maximum of total score is 46 in B-1 reconstruction or 52 in R-Y reconstruction. High score is good surgical skill. Low score is poor surgical skill.</description>

    <description>Procedures` time in each items of LDG was evaluated for difficulty of surgical technics. The scoring rates in each items of LDG are compared with Procedures` time. The average of score about GOALS-DG is evaluated on a three or two level scale ( 28items in B-1 reconstruction or 31items in R-Y reconstruction). High score is good surgical skill. Low score is poor surgical skill.</description>
