  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The long-term goal is to understand the mechanisms of intestinal nutrient sensing and signal
      relays to insulin sensitive tissues (adipose, skeletal muscle, liver) in humans. The
      investigators hypothesize that human tissue biopsies (from obese surgery and non-surgery
      subjects as well as lean controls) can be used to understand the molecular mechanisms
      underlying intestinal nutrient sensing and signal relay in humans. The investigator will
      obtain tissue specimens from obese patients during scheduled upper endoscopies, colonoscopies
      and scheduled metabolic and bariatric surgeries. The investigator will obtain tissue
      specimens from lean patients during scheduled endoscopies and colonoscopies. A blood sample
      (4mL) will be obtained concurrent with these procedures. From metabolic and bariatric surgery
      subjects blood and tissues (liver, adipose, small intestine, omentum, skeletal muscle) will
      be collected at the time of surgery. Stool will be obtained preoperatively and at various
      time points after surgery.

      Upper endoscopy (subset)

        -  Intestinal biopsies will be obtained during scheduled upper endoscopy from the
           mid-duodenum and/or proximal jejunum. In the case that a patient requires an upper
           endoscopy after metabolic and bariatric surgery, biopsies will be obtained from the
           mid-jejunum.

        -  Blood will be collected from an IV placed in the arm used for administering anesthesia
           required for the indicated procedure.

      Colonoscopy (subset)

        -  Biopsies of the colon will be obtained during scheduled colonoscopy.

        -  Blood will be collected from an IV placed in the arm used for administering anesthesia
           required for the indicated procedure.

      Metabolic and bariatric surgery (subset)

        -  During the metabolic and bariatric surgical procedures, biopsy of the jejunum, liver and
           omentum (visceral adipose) may be obtained. Biopsies of skeletal muscle and subcutaneous
           adipose will be taken at the sites of trocar placement for laparotomy.

        -  Blood will be collected from an IV placed in the arm used for administering anesthesia
           required for the indicated procedure.

        -  Feces will be self-collected by the patient using a provided culture swab specimen
           container or FOB card.
