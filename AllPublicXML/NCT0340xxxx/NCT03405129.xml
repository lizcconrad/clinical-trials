  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Smoking is the leading preventable cause of death and disease in the United States. Although
      most smokers report that they would like to quit smoking at some point in the future, only
      20% are ready to quit within the next 30 days. Importantly, studies have indicated that
      interventions can increase motivation and/or readiness for cessation among smokers who are
      not yet ready to quit and these types of intervention can increase smoking cessation
      attempts. Smartphone apps that offer daily information about the benefits of quitting and
      motivational/supportive messages that aim to increase cessation self-efficacy may increase
      the likelihood of initiating a smoking cessation attempt. Previous research has indicated
      that smoking cessation smartphone applications are feasible and well-liked by smokers who are
      already committed to quitting smoking. However, there are no empirically supported smartphone
      apps that provide dynamic smoking cessation content that is automatically matched to a
      smoker's current readiness to quit. This type of dynamically tailored intervention could
      overcome many of the barriers that have hampered the widespread use of traditional
      empirically supported smoking cessation treatments. The current pilot study (N=150) is a
      3-armed randomized controlled smoking cessation induction trial that will determine the
      initial utility of a novel smartphone based intervention compared with an attention control
      group among smokers who are not yet ready to quit. The two intervention groups (Group 1:
      Phoenix App Only; Group 2: Phoenix App + Nicotine Replacement Therapy [NRT]) will receive
      targeted smoking cessation messaging that is matched to a participant's readiness to quit,
      while the attention control group (i.e., Factoid) will receive messages that are not related
      to smoking cessation.

      Description of Study Visit and Follow-Up:

      Screening and Baseline Assessment Visit. Individuals who complete the online screener (i.e.,
      REDCap) and meet initial study inclusion criteria will be invited to complete the in person
      screener and baseline visit at the Tobacco Treatment Research Program (TTRP). Potential
      participants will be provided with detailed information about the study and given the
      opportunity to have their questions answered within a private room to ensure confidentiality.
      Study staff will review the consent form with interested participants, who will be screened
      for eligibility on-site in a private room in the clinic. Participant eligibility for the
      current study will not influence eligibility for treatment at the TTRP. The Rapid Estimate of
      Adult Literacy in Medicine-Short Form (REALM45) will be administered to ensure that all
      participants are able to read at &gt; sixth grade level (i.e., required to complete EMA and
      self-report questionnaires). Participants will also be asked to read aloud from the Informed
      Consent form. Expired carbon monoxide (CO) will be measured with a Vitalograph BreathCO
      carbon monoxide monitor and a Bedfont iCO carbon monoxide monitor. The purpose of using both
      monitors is to validate the Bedfont iCO device. Participants will be questioned in person to
      verify the information they provided during the REDCap screening process. Race/ethnicity,
      sex, cigarettes smoked per day, education, and readiness to quit smoking will be used to
      randomize participants to the Phoenix, Phoenix + NRT, or Factoid groups using adaptive
      randomization software. Participants will complete the assessment portion of the baseline
      visit on a laptop/tablet computer; and weight, and height will be measured in a private room
      to ensure confidentiality.

      Participants will be instructed that the app will prompt and deliver two messages per day and
      that they should click the &quot;Set New Quit Date&quot; button when/if they want to set a smoking
      cessation quit date. They will be informed that the app will offer smoking cessation
      resources after they set a quit date.

      Week 26 Follow-Up Phone Call. All participants will be asked to complete a brief 10-15 minute
      follow-up interview over the phone. Participants will be asked about their current smoking
      status, their opinions about the smartphone app, and how the app could be improved for future
      studies.
