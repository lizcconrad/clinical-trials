      This study is a retrieval of database information regarding survivorship of the Comprehensive
      Shoulder System family of products. The primary objective of the retrieval is to collect data
      that will contribute to the post market surveillance requirements for this product and will
      provide feedback to design engineers, support marketing efforts and publications, and answer
      potential questions form reimbursement agencies.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The Comprehensive Shoulder System has been cleared by the FDA via premarket notifications. No
      experimental or investigational surgical techniques or devices will be used in this study.
      All devices and products will be used in accordance with their instructions for use and/or
      approved labeling. The aim of the Comprehensive Shoulder System is to improve shoulder
      function and reduce pain.

      One site will be used for this database retrieval. The number of patients involved will
      depend upon the size of the Comprehensive database available at Acromion, LLC.
