  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In Toronto Ontario, the Parkdale Community Health Centre operates a community outreach
      program entitled Parkdale Parents' Primary Prevention Project (5P's). The 5P's provides
      weekly pre- and post-natal support and education programs for clients. This includes an
      infant feeding program for mothers with infants 0-6 months (Feeding Tiny Souls). The 5P's has
      a diverse client-base; the program is aimed at women who are in challenging life
      circumstances, therefore, clients may include low-income or single mothers and newcomers to
      Canada.

      The aim of this project is to investigate the incidence, duration and exclusivity of
      breastfeeding and timely complementary feeding based on level of maternal participation in
      components of a pre and postnatal community outreach program. Exploring infant feeding
      practices is an evaluation component that will not only characterize infant feeding practices
      within a vulnerable population, but will elucidate whether there are areas of concern that
      need to be expanded upon within pre or postnatal programming. A prospective infant feeding
      questionnaire will be administered to participants at 2 weeks and at 2, 4 and 6 months
      postpartum. The study population will consist of women who enrolled in 5P's prenatally. The
      hypothesis is that exclusive breastfeeding rates will be low, but higher breastfeeding rates
      will be observed among women who utilize provided postnatal services more readily.
