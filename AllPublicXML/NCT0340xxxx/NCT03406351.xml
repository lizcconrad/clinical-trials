  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Societies become increasingly urban - more than half the world's population now lives in
      cities. Urbanization elevates anthropogenic (man-made) exposure to air pollutants. A clear
      association exists between exposure to air pollutants and exacerbations (worsening) of
      pre-existing asthma, incidence of nighttime asthma, difficulties with asthma control and
      increased disease risk. In 2012, the Public Health Management Corporation's Community Health
      Data Base estimated that 19.4% of adults in Philadelphia had asthma compared to a national
      prevalence of 7%.

      Asthma has a clear temporal signal. A majority of asthma patients, up to 75%, reports
      nighttime awakenings due to worsened cough, wheeze and dyspnea. This time-of-day-dependent
      exacerbation of symptoms, coined nocturnal asthma, is associated with poorer disease control,
      more frequent medication, and higher asthma-related morbidity and mortality. Consequently,
      several pathophysiological mechanisms proposed for nocturnal asthma relate to circadian clock
      biology.

      Lung function oscillates over the course of 24 hours, peaking around noon and reaching its
      nadir during early morning hours. Concentrations of air pollutants show oscillating patterns
      in urban settings.

      In this clinical research study, the investigators start to address how spatiotemporal
      fluctuations in air pollutants relate to asthma. Mechanistically, the investigators wish to
      address the hypothesis that microRNAs (miRs) act as interface between asthma phenotypes,
      circadian clocks and environmental exposure.
