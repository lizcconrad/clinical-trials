    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to evaluate the safety and essential performance of the
      Connected Catheter System in males with neurogenic lower urinary tract dysfunction (NLUTD),
      both in an acute clinical setting, and during and extended period (up to 29 days) of home
      use.

      The Connected Catheter is a replaceable urinary prosthesis that is intended for use in male
      patients 18 years of age or older who have impaired bladder emptying due to neurogenic lower
      urinary tract dysfunction, and who are capable of operating the device in accordance with the
      provided instructions for use, or who have trained caregivers capable of doing the same. The
      device must be replaced every 29 days (or less).

    <description>The Connected Catheter is a fully internal, urethral-indwelling urinary prosthesis designed for improved bladder management in males with urinary retention disorders requiring catheterization, including neurogenic lower urinary tract dysfunction (NLUTD - e.g. due to spinal cord injury). The CoCath is a sterile, single-extended-use device that resides fully internally to the male lower urinary tract (urethra + bladder neck) for an intended service life of up to 29 days per Catheter.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Males age â‰¥ 18 with clinical diagnosis of neurogenic lower urinary tract dysfunction
             (NLUTD)

          -  Must be clinically suitable and capable of safely managing bladder using an
             intermittent voiding strategy Must have stable urinary management history with clean
             intermittent catheterization: no significant changes in bladder management regimen
             within past 12 months

        OR:

        Must have urodynamic profile suitable for CIC, as assessed via urodynamics study within
        past 12 months (including bladder capacity &gt; 200mL without uninhibited bladder
        contractions)

          -  Subject's lower urinary tract anatomy (lengths of proximal and distal urethral must
             fall within the ranges serviceable by the Connected Catheter device, as specified in
             the investigational device instructions for use.

          -  For cases of NLUTD due to spinal cord injury, the subject must be in medically stable
             condition (i.e. post-spinal shock phase)

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Active symptomatic urinary tract infection, as defined in this protocol (subjects may
             receive the CoCath Device after UTI has been treated)

          -  Significant risk profile or recent history of urethral stricture (e.g. stricture
             within past 90 days)

          -  Significant risk profile or recent history of clinically significant autonomic
             dysreflexia (e.g. History of hospitalization due to AD within past 12 months)

          -  Significant intermittent urinary incontinence (between catheterizations)

          -  Uninhibited bladder contractions and/or vesico-ureteral reflux that is not reliably
             controlled with medication or alternate therapy (e.g. botox injections)

          -  Pre-existing urinary pathologies and/or morphological abnormalities of the lower
             urinary tract or bladder (assessed during in-depth medical screening, including
             cystoscopy, urine analysis, and blood labs)

          -  Urinary tract inflammation or neoplasm

          -  Urinary fistula

          -  Bladder diverticulum (outpouching) &gt; 5cm in size

          -  Chronic pyelonephritis (secondary to upper urinary tract infection(s) within past 6
             months)

          -  Impaired kidney function or renal failure (assessed via blood creatinine levels &gt; 2
             mg/dL)

          -  Active gross hematuria

          -  Active urethritis

          -  Bladder stones

          -  Dependence on an electro-magnetic medical implant (e.g. cardiac pacemaker or implanted
             drug pump) or external device

          -  Individuals allergic or otherwise unable to take oral antibiotics

          -  Any physical or cognitive impairments that diminish the subject's ability to follow
             directions or otherwise safely use the CoCath System
