  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Researchers are trying to find out more about the side effects of topical (applied to the
      skin) Pentamidine, to determine if it is safe for use in people. They also want to find out
      if topical use of Pentamidine can help treat hypertrophic scars.

      Pentamidine is a medicine that is currently used to treat certain kinds of infection. It is
      most often given by intravenous (into a vein) or inhalation (through a breathing device).
      This medication is approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for use in these
      forms.

      Everyone in this study will receive topical Pentamidine (TP) in a silicone based gel (PCCA
      Pracasil Plus). Topical treatment of Pentamidine is still experimental and has not been
      formally tested for safety or effectiveness in a randomized control trial within the United
      States. The FDA has allowed the use of topical Pentamidine in this research study.

      This study will investigate Pentamidine isethionate, compounded in a silicone-containing
      base, as adjuvant therapy to surgical scar excision to prevent adverse scarring and enhance
      skin rejuvenation.

    <intervention_model_description>All participants will receive two treatments: drug and vehicle. Drug will be applied to one of two treatment sites. Vehicle will be applied to the other site. Treatment sites are distal and proximal end of the incision. Drug will be randomized to treatment site &quot;distal&quot; or &quot;proximal&quot; and masking will be as indicated. A 1-2 cm border zone will remain untreated in the middle of the scar.</intervention_model_description>

    <measure>Serious and non-serious adverse events</measure>
    <time_frame>4 weeks post-operatively</time_frame>
    <description>Adverse events include skin infection, skin irritation and wound dehiscence. Skin irritation is scored by local skin reaction (LSR) grading scale. Wound infection is defined by skin that is red, swollen, hot and painful (&quot;calor, dolor, rubor, tumor&quot;) [by clinical exam] with or without discharge. Wound dehiscence is defined as a measurable breaking open of the surgical incision along the suture. Serious adverse events are defined as death [due to treatment] or life threatening adverse experience [due to treatment], hospitalization [due to treatment], persistent or significant disability or incapacity [due to treatment], birth defect/anomalies [due to treatment] and tissue necrosis [due to treatment].</description>

    <time_frame>US will be done at baseline (pre-operatively) and at postop week 2 and 4.</time_frame>

    <time_frame>Skin punch biopsy will be done at baseline (preoperatively) and again at postop week 2 and 4.</time_frame>
    <description>Semi-quantitative assessment of skin fibrosis will be done using the following variables and semi-quantitative scoring: Epidermal hyperplasia/hyperkeratosis, presence of hair follicles, presence of apocrine glands, presence of smooth muscles, presence of fibroplasia, presence of vascular proliferation (each 0,1), collagen orientation (0-3).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Vancouver Scar Scale (VSS)</measure>
    <time_frame>VSS will be completed by the patient and care provider at baseline (preoperatively) and at weeks 2and 4.</time_frame>
    <description>The VSS assesses 4 variables: vascularity, height/thickness, pliability, and pigmentation. Scale ranges are as follows. Pigmentation (0=normal, 1=hypopigmentation, 2=hyperpigmentation). Height (0=flat, 1=less than 2 mm, 2=2 to 5 mm, 3=greater than 5 mm). Vascularity (0=normal, 1=pink, 2=red, 3=purple). Pliability (0=normal, 1=supple, 2=yielding, 3=firm, 4=banding,5=contracture). Total score can range from 0 to 13, with 0=normal skin, and 13=severe scarring.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Patient and Observer Scar Assessment Scale (abbreviated: POSAS)</measure>
    <time_frame>POSAS will be completed by the patient and care provider at baseline (preoperatively) and at weeks 2 and 4.</time_frame>
    <description>POSAS consists of 2 scales: the observer scale assesses vascularity, pigmentation, thickness, relief, pliability, and surface area; the patient scale assesses pain, itching, color, stiffness, thickness, and irregularity. The scales rate each variable on a scale from 1 (normal skin) to 10 (worst scar imaginable), with a total possible score ranging from 1 (normal) to 120 (worst scar imaginable).</description>
