      The purpose of the Surveillance is to know the frequency and status of adverse device effects
      and adverse events in order to assure the safety of the new medical device, and to collect
      efficacy and safety information for evaluating clinical use results.

      The surveillance consists of two phases as detailed below. All patients will be continuously
      registered in each phases.

      Phase 1 (All- patients): Includes 250 patients (approximately 45 sites)

      Main Purpose: To confirm the efficacy of physician training and to establish optimal training
      for increasing medical institutions participating in post-marketing evaluation. Procedural
      results will be evaluated sequentially for early feedback to the sites. Therefore, there will
      be no quantitative goal established to move to Phase 2. However, recommended procedure may be
      updated as required in order to achieve optimal acute result.

      Phase 2 (All- patients): Until 2000 patients are registered (up to 200 sites) Main Purpose:
      To confirm safety.

      Target sample size of the Surveillance is approximately 2,000 patients. Commercial sale of
      Absorb GT1 beyond the purpose of the Surveillance will be started if the scaffold thrombosis
      (ST) rate in the 2,000 patients at 3 month is 0.9% or lower (ST rates for patients with
      Absorb GT1).

      In the ABSORB III (NCT01751906) clinical trial, 19 events of definite/probable ST reported
      through 1 year, and 18 of them except 1 occurred within 3 months (maximum of 78 days)
      post-procedure. Therefore, it is appropriate to perform interim analysis for the safety using
      ST rate through 3 months. The event occurred after 3 months was reported 362 days after the
      procedure, and the patient stopped treatment with thienopyridine antiplatelet agent on Day
      356.

      Both in the AVJ-301 (NCT01844284) and the ABSORB III clinical trials, ST rate through 1 year
      was 1.5%. In the ABSORB III clinical trial, ST rate in target lesion with RVD ≥ 2.25 mm was
      0.9%. As explained above, ST rates at 3 months and 1 year are almost similar. The half widths
      of the 95% confidence intervals (CI) to different sample sizes are presented in the table
      2.3-1. The half width of 95% CI decreases from 0.6% to 0.4% when a sample size is increased
      from 1,000 to 2,000. However, further increase in the sample size does not result in
      significant decrease in the half width of 95% CI. Therefore, the sample size of the
      Surveillance was established as 2,000 patients.
