        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Participant has provided written consent

          -  In the Investigator's opinion, the participant is able to understand and comply with

             a medical evaluation including medical history, physical examination, laboratory
             tests, and electrocardiogram (ECG). In case of an out-of-range clinical laboratory
             test, vital sign, or ECG value that will determine a participant's eligibility, a
             retest can be done. Results of this retest must be available prior to the first
             administration of the study drugs (Parts 1-3) or prior to inoculation (Part 4). The
             result of the retest will be considered for participant eligibility

          -  Body mass index (BMI) of 18 to 30 kilogram per meter square (kg/m^2) (inclusive),

             12 months of spontaneous amenorrhea and follicle-stimulating hormone level within the
             laboratory's reference range for postmenopausal females. A postmenopausal female who
             is receiving hormone replacement therapy and who is willing to discontinue hormone
             therapy from 28 days before study drug dosing or before inoculation (Part 4), and for
             the entire duration of the study, may be eligible for study participation. A male
             participant is eligible to participate in this study if (i) he is either surgically
             sterile or, (ii) in case of having a female partner of childbearing potential, the
             male participant and partner are practicing and willing to continue to practice highly
             effective forms of birth control until 90 days after the end of the study.
             Irrespective of the partner's form of birth control, a male participant must wear a
             condom when engaging in any activity that allows for passage of ejaculate to another
             person

          -  Drug allergy such as, but not limited to, allergy to penicillins, including allergies
             experienced in previous studies with experimental drugs

          -  Any condition that, in the opinion of the Investigator, would compromise the study or
             the well-being of the participant or prevent the participant from meeting the study
             requirements
