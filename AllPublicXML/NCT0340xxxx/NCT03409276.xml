      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of env
      (A,B,C,A/E)/gag (C) DNA and gp120 (A,B,C,A/E) protein/GLA-SE HIV-1 vaccines (PDPHV-201401) as
      a prime-boost regimen or co-administered in repeated doses, in healthy, HIV-1-uninfected
      adults.

      This study will evaluate the safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of env (A,B,C,A/E)/gag
      (C) DNA and gp120 (A,B,C,A/E) protein/GLA-SE HIV-1 vaccines (PDPHV-201401) as a prime-boost
      regimen or co-administered in repeated doses, in healthy, HIV-1-uninfected adults.

      The study will be conducted in two parts (Part A and Part B).

      Participants in Part A will be randomly assigned to either Group 1 (Treatment) or Group 1
      (Control). Participants in Group 1 (Treatment) will receive the gp120 (A,B,C,A/E) protein
      vaccine admixed with GLA-SE adjuvant on Day 0 and Month 2. Participants in Group 1 (Control)
      will receive placebo on Day 0 and Month 2.

      Researchers will evaluate study data from Part A before enrolling participants in Part B.

      Participants in Part B will be enrolled in either Groups 2 or 3. Within Group 2, participants
      will be randomly assigned to either Group 2 (Treatment) or Group 2 (Control). Participants in
      Group 2 (Treatment) will receive the env (A,B,C,A/E)/gag (C) DNA vaccine and placebo on Day 0
      and Months 1 and 3. At Months 6 and 8, participants will receive the gp120 (A,B,C,A/E)
      protein vaccine admixed with GLA-SE adjuvant and a placebo vaccine. Participants in Group 2
      (Control) will receive placebo on Day 0 and Months 1, 3, 6, and 8.

      Participants in Group 3 will be randomly assigned to either Group 3 (Treatment) or Group 3
      (Control). Participants in Group 3 (Treatment) will receive the env (A,B,C,A/E)/gag (C) DNA
      vaccine and the gp120 (A,B,C,A/E) protein vaccine admixed with GLA-SE adjuvant on Day 0 and
      Months 1, 3, 6, and 8. Participants in Group 3 (Control) will receive placebo on Day 0 and
      Months 1, 3, 6, and 8.

      Study visits for participants in Part A will occur on Day 0, Week 2, and Months 2, 2.5, 5,
      and 8. Study visits for participants in Part B will occur on Day 0, Week 2, and Months 1,
      1.5, 3, 3.5, 6, 6.5, 8, 8 + 1 Week, 8.5, 11, and 14. Visits may include physical
      examinations, blood and urine collection, HIV testing, risk reduction counseling, and
      questionnaires. Participants in Part B may also have optional saliva, semen, cervical fluid,
      rectal fluid, and stool sample collection.

      Study staff will contact all participants 12 months after the last vaccination for follow-up
      health monitoring.

             significant abnormal laboratory results, or past medical history with clinically
             significant implications for current health. A clinically significant condition or
             process includes but is not limited to:

               -  A process that would affect the immune response,

               -  A process that would require medication that affects the immune response,

               -  Any contraindication to repeated injections or blood draws,

               -  A condition that requires active medical intervention or monitoring to avert
                  grave danger to the volunteer's health or well-being during the study period,

               -  A condition or process for which signs or symptoms could be confused with
                  reactions to vaccine, or

               -  Any condition specifically listed among the exclusion criteria below.

          -  Any medical, psychiatric, occupational, or other condition that, in the judgment of
             the investigator, would interfere with, or serve as a contraindication to, protocol
             adherence, assessment of safety or reactogenicity, or a volunteer's ability to give
             informed consent

          -  Psychiatric condition that precludes compliance with the protocol. Specifically
             excluded are persons with psychoses within the past 3 years, ongoing risk for suicide,
             or history of suicide attempt or gesture within the past 3 years.

          -  Current anti-tuberculosis (TB) prophylaxis or therapy

          -  Asthma exclusion criteria: Asthma other than mild, well-controlled asthma. (Symptoms
             of asthma severity as defined in the most recent National Asthma Education and
             Prevention Program (NAEPP) Expert Panel report). Exclude a volunteer who:

               -  Uses a short-acting rescue inhaler (typically a beta 2 agonist) daily, or

               -  Uses moderate/high dose inhaled corticosteroids, or

               -  In the past year has either of the following:

               -  Greater than 1 exacerbation of symptoms treated with oral/parenteral
                  corticosteroids;

               -  Needed emergency care, urgent care, hospitalization, or intubation for asthma.

          -  Diabetes mellitus type 1 or type 2, including cases controlled with diet alone. (Not
             excluded: history of isolated gestational diabetes.)

          -  Thyroidectomy, or thyroid disease requiring medication during the last 12 months

          -  Hypertension:

               -  If a person has been found to have elevated blood pressure or hypertension during
                  screening or previously, exclude for blood pressure that is not well controlled.
                  Well-controlled blood pressure is defined as consistently less than or equal to
                  140 mm Hg systolic and less than or equal to 90 mm Hg diastolic, with or without
                  medication, with only isolated, brief instances of higher readings, which must be
                  less than or equal to 150 mm Hg systolic and less than or equal to 100 mm Hg
                  diastolic. For these volunteers, blood pressure must be less than or equal to 140
                  mm Hg systolic and less than or equal to 90 mm Hg diastolic at enrollment.

               -  If a person has NOT been found to have elevated blood pressure or hypertension
                  during screening or previously, exclude for systolic blood pressure greater than
                  or equal to 150 mm Hg at enrollment or diastolic blood pressure greater than or
                  equal to 100 mm Hg at enrollment.

          -  Bleeding disorder diagnosed by a doctor (eg, factor deficiency, coagulopathy, or
             platelet disorder requiring special precautions)

          -  Malignancy (Not excluded from participation: Volunteer who has had malignancy excised
             surgically and who, in the investigator's estimation, has a reasonable assurance of
             sustained cure, or who is unlikely to experience recurrence of malignancy during the
             period of the study)

          -  Seizure disorder: History of seizure(s) within past three years. Also exclude if
             volunteer has used medications in order to prevent or treat seizure(s) at any time
             within the past 3 years.

          -  Asplenia: any condition resulting in the absence of a functional spleen

          -  History of hereditary angioedema, acquired angioedema, or idiopathic angioedema.
