  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The consortium aims to commercialise the MMpredictor as a personalised medicine tool that
      predicts the most effective treatment strategy for individual Multiple Myeloma (MM) patients.
      MM is the second most common form of blood cancer contributing to 15% of all blood cancers
      and ~1,5% and 2% of all cancer deaths annually in the EU and US, respectively.

      Patients show a large variability in treatment response and side effects due to tumour
      heterogeneity and the patient's intrinsic characteristics. Therefore, not every treatment
      will be suitable for each patient, and treatment strategies are often based on
      trial-and-error. The availability of multiple (&gt;20) treatment options complicates treatment
      decision-making even more. With the current development of many more promising treatments,
      there is an urgent unmet clinical need for a diagnostic assay that supports personalised
      cancer treatment in order to improve patient health outcomes, prevent side effects and reduce
      healthcare costs.

      SkylineDx has previously developed the MMprofiler, a microarray-based diagnostic test that
      can subtype MM patients and reliably predict MM patient survival (prognosis). In this
      project, the test's clinical value will be expanded to include the prediction of treatment
      effectiveness in individual patients based on Gene Expression Profiling. An addendum for new
      intended use will be filed to the current in vitro diagnostic (IVD) registration, while
      renaming the test to MMpredictor. The project will also focus on positioning the test as a
      cost-effective IVD test for personalised medicine, that will increase health outcome and
      quality of life of patients and reduce healthcare costs.

      The consortium consists of a life science SME specialised in molecular diagnostics, clinical
      centres with world renowned KOLs, a leading health economic institute, and a European MM
      patient advocacy organisation combining all the required complementary expertise to
      successfully bring the MMpredictor to market.

    <study_pop>

        MM patients enrolled in clinical trials that have been conducted over the past 5 years.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  The bio-banked MM patient samples and clinical data will be obtained from previous
             European clinical trials that have been conducted over the past 5 years within the
             participating clinical centres and other clinical centers. The samples were not
             collected for the purposes of this project. The subjects from which the data was
             initially taken cannot be identified from the data/records. However, the patients from
             the above mentioned trial have explicitly consented for the use of their samples for
             other (future) clinical research purposes.
