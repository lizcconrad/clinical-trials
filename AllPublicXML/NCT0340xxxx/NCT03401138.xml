  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background: Fracture of the hip is a potentially fatal event in an elderly, frail, highly
      comorbid patient group suffering from dehydration and hypovolemia, and it carries a risk that
      equals major trauma in young patients in regard of physiological insult and severity, yet no
      preoperative resuscitation and transfusion strategy is available. An important goal of
      hemodynamic monitoring and resuscitation is early detection of insufficient tissue perfusion
      and oxygenation. The peripheral perfusion index reflects changes in peripheral perfusion and
      blood volume and a decreased peripheral perfusion index predicts surgical complications and
      morbidity in acute surgical and septic shock patients. The research group hypothesize that
      elderly frail patients with a fracture of the hip suffer from hypovolemia and peripheral
      hypoperfusion of varying degrees and accordingly respond to controlled fluid resuscitation
      and that the non-invasive peripheral perfusion index will serve as an early predictor of a
      deteriorated circulation in reflection of stroke volume.

      Methods: The main objective of this prospective observational study is to assess to what
      extend patients with fracture of the hip suffer from hypovolemia and respond to a fluid
      challenge. The secondary objectives are to evaluate correlation between the
      minimally-invasive measurements of stroke volume and blood volume and the non-invasive
      measurement of peripheral perfusion index and near-infrared spectroscopy, as well as
      prevalence of postoperative complications and mortality. Fifty consecutive patients over the
      age of 65 years, presenting with a hip fracture, treated in a multimodal fast-track regimen,
      will be included when written informed consent is available. All patients will receive
      epidural analgesia and preoperative stroke volume-guided hemodynamic optimization. Blood
      volume measurements are performed and all patients are monitored with peripheral perfusion
      index and near-infrared spectroscopy.

      Discussion: This is likely the first study to address clinically applicable hemodynamic
      monitoring and resuscitation in patients with fracture of the hip where adequate
      resuscitation is easily missed. The study group aim to evaluate the feasibility of
      preoperative stroke volume-guided hemodynamic optimization in the context of minimally- and
      non-invasive monitoring of peripheral perfusion and blood volume measurements.

    <description>Preoperative SV-guided hemodynamic optimization will be commenced with patients receiving 250ml fluid challenges over five minutes aiming to maximize SV. Maximal SV is defined as absence of a sustained rise in SV by at least 10% in response to a fluid challenge.
PPI will be obtained from the Masimo Radical 7 (Masimo, Irvine, CA, USA) and NIRS from Invos 5100C (Medtronic, Minneapolis, MN, USA).
BV measurements will use pulse dye densitometry (PDD) with Indocyanine Green (ICG). We will use the Dye Densitogram 3300 analyser Nihon Kohden (Tokyo, Japan) for registration of the spectrophotometrical absorption of ICG and calculation of BV.</description>

        Patients presenting a primary acute HF within the study period will be screened for
        participation by the attending anesthesiologist at the post-anesthesia care unit. The study
        manager will verify the inclusion and exclusion criteria and inform patients (verbally and
        in writing) and confirm their agreement to participate by asking them to sign the informed
        consent document. Assessment of electronic patient records, monitoring and resuscitation
        treatment and recording of data will be by the study manager.
