  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Our primary objective is to demonstrate the feasibility of utilizing a novel penicillin
      allergy questionnaire in the PED to identify a low-risk group of patients who will complete
      an oral challenge in the PED to test for an IgE-mediated allergic reaction. This project will
      begin as a single site feasibility study, however including up to 2 other collaborative sites
      for enrollment has been favorably discussed. We do not anticipate this to be a single IRB
      scenario and will submit a timely comprehensive amendment if plans become concrete and the
      initial data here proves reliable.

      Our secondary objective is to examine whether health care outcomes and prescription-related
      costs are comparable between children who are de-labeled as penicillin allergic after an oral
      challenge compared to a standard of care group who are not challenged in the PED.

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Children aged 3-16 with a parent/guardian (hereafter termed parent) reported history
             of allergy to a penicillin antibiotic in which the reported allergic reaction occurred
             at least six months prior to the current PED visit.

          -  Only children well enough to be discharged to home at the conclusion of the PED visit
             are eligible.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Children will be excluded if they have a history of developmental delay or inability
             to communicate the effects of an allergic reaction (non-verbal).

          -  Any contraindication to allergy testing will also result in exclusion

          -  (i.e. history of a severe allergic reaction to skin tests,,

          -  anaphylaxis in the past six weeks,

          -  pregnancy,

          -  child took any antihistamine in the past three days [including diphenhydramine
             (Benadryl®), cetirizine (Zyrtec®), loratadine (Claritin®), fexofenadine (Allegra®),
             levocetirizine (Xyzal®), and desloratadine (Clarinex®)] or

          -  child has a history of a condition that requires a beta blocker medicine for cardiac
             conditions, high blood pressure, migraine headaches, or eye drops for glaucoma (e.g.
             propranolol, metoprolol, atenolol and Timoptic®, or Betoptic® eye drops).

          -  Children who present to the PED with a rash, vomiting or current asthma symptoms
             including coughing, wheezing or breathing problems will also be excluded to ensure
             these do not mask reactions to an oral challenge.

          -  Patients being admitted to the hospital or those who are deemed too acutely ill for
             participation (triage level 1 or 2 or as determined by the ED patient care team) will
             be excluded from the study.

          -  During this pilot study, we will exclude non-English speaking families. However, in
             subsequent studies we will include the non-English speaking population.

          -  Children who are wards of the state, in foster care or police custody or detention
             will be excluded.

          -  Children with any basal condition (trauma, infection, minor accidents, etc..) will be
             able to participate in the study provided they and their family are willing and do not
             meet the above-mentioned exclusion criteria.
