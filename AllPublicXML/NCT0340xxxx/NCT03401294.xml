  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Most patients with mCRC are treated with palliative chemotherapy and only a small number of
      patients with limited metastatic disease achieve long-term remission following
      metastasectomy. There is a growing need for more effective treatment in patients with
      liver-only mCRC to improve the rate of curative resection without compromising QOL.The
      current study is informed by our patient's needs. It aims to evaluate the rate of conversion
      therapy in patients with unresectable liver-only mCRC using the combination of FOLFOXIRI and
      bevacizumab and to assess the association between an early FDG-PT/CT response and other
      clinical and pathological biomarkers and hepatic metastasectomy.

    <textblock>
      Colorectal cancer is the second leading cause of cancer-related death in North America.
      Patients with metastatic colorectal cancer generally have limited life expectancy, however, a
      small number of patients with liver-only metastases could potentially be cured following
      surgical resection of metastases. Patients and their family strongly feel that there is an
      unmet need for a more effective treatment in metastatic colorectal cancer to improve disease
      response rate and thereby curative surgery. Recent evidence suggest that a triplet
      chemotherapy regimen, FOLFOXIRI plus bevacizumab has been associated with higher response
      rates. The CONVERSION trial will evaluate the rate of conversion from unresectable to
      resectable liver metastases in patients with liver-only metastatic colorectal cancer treated
      with FOLFOXIRI-bevacizumab. Furthermore, this study will assess disease control rate,
      survival, quality of life and association between various biomarkers including an early
      FDG-PET/CT response and curative surgery. Thirty-two eligible patients will be recruited at
      the two major cancer centers in Saskatchewan. Patients will receive FOLFOXIRI-bevacizumab
      every two weeks for a total of 12 cycles and will undergo periodic imaging studies. The
      resectability of liver metastases will be assessed by a multidisciplinary team comprised of
      surgeons, radiologists, and oncologists. This study will be helpful to establish a standard
      chemotherapy regimen for patients with liver-only metastatic colorectal cancer and to
      determine the role of FDG-PET/CT scan and other biomarkers in predicting curative surgery.
      Complete resection of metastases will allow such patients to discontinue chemotherapy and
      live a normal life.
