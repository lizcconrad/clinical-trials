    <textblock>
      The aim of these studies is to adapt the self-affirmation kindness questionnaire for use in a
      mobile application. Two studies will be conducted to test hypotheses that simplifying and
      shortening the original questionnaire in systematic ways will result in comparable
      effectiveness (compared to the original version) in promoting reduced defensive avoidance,
      less reactance, greater yielding, and higher intentions to quit smoking among a sample of
      smokers.

      Research has shown that self-affirmation interventions, in which people are instructed to
      focus on their strengths and values, can offset self-threats and promote healthier behaviors,
      such as smoking cessation. A commonly used self-affirmation intervention is known as the
      &quot;kindness quiz.&quot; The original kindness questionnaire (Reed &amp; Aspinwall, 1998) consists of 10
      yes/no questions, and participants are asked to think about and write down an example of
      each. For example, one item is &quot;Have you ever been considerate of another person's feelings?
      ____ YES ____NO; IF YES, WRITE ABOUT A SPECIFIC EXAMPLE.&quot; The items were written so that all
      participants should be able to say &quot;yes&quot; in response to each question, which will affirm a
      positive view of themselves.

      The purpose of these studies are to test shorter and simpler versions of this kindness
      questionnaire so that it can be implemented on mobile phones. In Study 1, we will test
      whether written examples are necessary for the effectiveness of the self-affirmation
      intervention (compared to no examples or imagined examples) compared to a control. In Study
      2, we will again test whether written examples are necessary, as well as whether shorter
      questionnaires (i.e., 5 items or 3 items) are as effective as the original 10 item
      questionnaire.

    <intervention_model_description>Study 1 will use a 2 (self-affirmation: self-affirmation, control) X 3 (Mode of example: none, write, imagine) experimental design. In the self-affirmation condition, participants will complete the self-affirmation kindness quiz (10 questions) and in the control condition they will complete a personal opinion survey (10 questions). Depending on the mode of example condition, participants will not be asked to provide examples, asked to write examples for each of the 10 questions, or asked to imagine examples for each of the 10 questions.
Based on examination of data from Study 1 (i.e., which items receive more &quot;yes&quot; responses and for which items examples are provided), in Study 2 we will test whether using fewer self-affirmation items influences dependent variables. Study 2 will use a 3 (Number of questions: 10, 5, 3) X 3 (Mode of example: none, write, imagine) experimental design.</intervention_model_description>
