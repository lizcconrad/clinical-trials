        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Subjects â‰¥18 years of age

          2. Patients with suspected HCC scheduled for partial hepatic resection.

          3. Presenting with 1 to a maximum of 5 hepatic nodule(s) of equal or more than 1 cm (long
             axis) previously identified and characterized through multi-phase contrast enhanced
             CT.

          4. Subjects or their partners must use a highly effective method of contraception
             starting from at least one menstrual cycle prior to starting study drug and till 30
             days after the last dose of study drug.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Subjects who received any previous treatment for HCC.

          2. Subjects with a serious allergic history or known allergy of other contrast agent.

          3. Subjects with a positive HIV test.

          4. Subjects with severe renal insufficiency

          5. Subjects with severe liver disease[HCV].

          6. Subjects with active systemic infections, active and clinically significant cardiac
             diseases, active gastrointestinal ulcers, or medical conditions that may significantly
             affect action, adequate absorption, and elimination of investigational contrast agent.

          7. Subject with mechanically, electrically or magnetically-activated implanted device or
             any metal in their body which cannot be removed.

          8. Subjects who have participated in other investigational trials within 30 days prior to
             study enrollment.

          9. Female subjects who are pregnant or breastfeeding.

         10. Subjects who are clinically unstable and whose clinical course during the screening
             period is unpredictable.
