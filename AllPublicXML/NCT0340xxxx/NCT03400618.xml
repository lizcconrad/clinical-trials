  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to analyse the effect of a diet with a moderate amount of
      carbohydrates and compare it with a traditional diabetic diet with a higher content of
      carbohydrates on mean glucose level, high and low glucose levels, and the risk of
      ketoacidosis in patients with type 1 diabetes. The glucose levels will be measured by blinded
      continuous glucose monitoring (CGM).

      The trial has a cross-over design and 12 weeks in duration, where patients will be randomized
      to; 1) a diet with moderate carbohydrate content for 4 weeks and 2) a traditional diabetes
      diet for 4 weeks and with a wash-out period between for 4 weeks. The two diets will both be
      healthy and planned by a dietitian. There will be 50 subjects included in the study.
