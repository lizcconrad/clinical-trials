  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic migraine is a disabling type of migraine and is often resistant to treatment.
      Non-pharmacological interventions have been investigated as potential treatment although,
      unfortunately, the literature on their efficacy is poor and showed mixed results. Well-Being
      Therapy (WBT) is a brief psychotherapy which has shown efficacy in decreasing the relapse
      rates of depression in adults, in generalized anxiety disorder and in cyclothymia. It can be
      implemented to empower psychological well-being. The aim of the present study is to test the
      efficacy of WBT in a sample of patients with chronic migraine to verify if it reduces the
      disability due to migraine and distress, it increases the psychological well-being as well as
      the level of euthymia.

      Chronic migraine is a disabling type of migraine and is often resistant to treatment.
      Non-pharmacological interventions have been investigated as potential treatment although,
      unfortunately, the literature on their efficacy is poor and showed mixed results. The
      psychological interventions tested up to now are the Acceptance and Commitment Therapy and
      the Mindfulness. Well-Being Therapy (WBT) is a brief psychotherapy which has been manualized
      in 2016 and has shown efficacy in randomized clinical trials. It showed to be effective in
      decreasing the relapse rates of depression in adults, it showed to be effective in
      generalized anxiety disorder and in cyclothymia. Thus, psychological well-being can be
      implemented and empowered via a specific psychotherapy and this implementation might produce
      a protecting effect, thus favoring prevention. The aim of the present study is to test the
      efficacy of WBT in a sample of patients with chronic migraine. First the efficacy of WBT will
      be verified in terms of disability due to migraine. Then, the efficacy of WBT will be
      measured in terms of psychological well-being, euthymia, and distress. For this purpose, 30
      chromic migraine outpatients will be enrolled in a randomized, controlled, open clinical
      study.

    <intervention_model_description>This is a pilot study, designed as a randomized (1:1) controlled trial, comparing WBT vs a control condition. The patients will receive a baseline assessment to confirm the diagnosis of chronic migraine, then socio-demographic information, information on pharmacological/non-pharmacological treatments, on the history of medical diseases and on the psychological status will be collected as well as the number of migraine attacks per month, the duration of migraine attacks, the occurrence of migraine exclusively with menses, and the level of disability related to migraine. Thereafter, the subjects will be randomly assigned to WBT or to a control condition. The subjects will be re-assessed at the end of session 4, 8 of treatment, at 3-month and 6-month follow-ups.</intervention_model_description>

    <description>WBT will be used as the only non-pharmacological therapeutic strategy and 8 sessions will be delivered every other week with a duration of 60 minutes each. The manualized WBT will be used (Fava, 2016). Thus, the initial phase will be concerned with self-observation of psychological well-being. Once the instances of well-being will be properly recognized, the patient will be encouraged to identify thoughts, beliefs, and behaviors leading to premature interruption of well-being (intermediate phase). The final part will involve cognitive restructuring of dysfunctional dimensions of psychological well-being and meeting the challenge that optimal experiences may entail.</description>

These sessions will inform participants about well-being and which lifestyles can influence it.</description>
