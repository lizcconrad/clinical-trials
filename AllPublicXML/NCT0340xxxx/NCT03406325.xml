  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Activation of mast cells in the immune system is known to cause allergic reactions sometimes
      with severe systemic symptoms. The investigators have recently developed a blood-based mast
      cell activation diagnostic test in which levels of functional activation in-vitro in primary
      cultured mast cells generated from the peripheral blood of single individuals can be
      assessed. It is the hypothesis that the test can be used to predict the potential state of
      in-vivo mast cell activation in any individual based on the functional activation profiles
      exhibited by their cultured mast cells. The investigators now wish to translate their
      in-vitro findings in a pilot study to disease groups where mast cell activation is expected
      to be high. These include highly allergic individuals; those with chronic idiopathic
      urticaria; those with mastocytosis; and those with the mast cell activation syndrome.
      Furthermore, they will use the functional genomics approach to identify gene expression
      biomarkers that are correlated with such diseases. The results will be compared with data
      that have been collected from a cohort of healthy control blood donors.

      The objective of this study is to assess whether patients with severe allergic diseases
      exhibit high levels of mast cell activation as determined by the mast cell activation
      diagnostic test the investigators have developed. They anticipate that patients with history
      of severe allergic reactions will show up as high responders in the blood-based mast cell
      activation diagnostic test. Moreover, using microarray analysis as the approach for gene
      expression studies, they anticipate further that genomics biomarkers that are correlated with
      the high functional activation of the in-vitro mast cells derived from these patients can be
      readily identified.

      About 100 ml of peripheral venous blood from individual patients will be drawn into
      heparinized syringes and collected in a blood-collecting bag/tube containing silica. The
      bag/tube will be promptly processed for the generation of primary human mast cell cultures
      using the protocol that has previously been developed [Inflammation Research 66: 25 (2017).
      After culturing for 9 weeks, the resulting human mast cells will be analyzed for both their
      functional activity in terms of histamine release in response to the activation of
      high-affinity IgE receptors in these cells and their gene expression profiles using
      microarray analysis. The in-vitro functional and genomics data will be correlated with
      specific diagnoses and measurements of blood prostaglandin D2 (PGD2), PGD2 metabolites,
      tryptase and histamine levels in blood. For mediator assays, plasma from each subject will be
      collected after the cluster of differentiation 34 positive (CD34+) isolation step and the
      samples will be aliquoted and frozen at -80 degrees centigrade for subsequent analysis.
