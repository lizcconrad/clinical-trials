  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A proof of concept randomized controlled trial (RCT) only evaluated the National University
      of Singapore's (NUS) T-Rehab tele-rehabilitation (TR) system at a home setting where
      rehabilitation was provided on an individual level. The previous RCT was also limited to
      stroke patients. In addition to stroke, there are many other conditions (such as fractures,
      lower limb joint replacement, musculoskeletal conditions) require and benefit from
      rehabilitation. The primary aims of the pilot evaluation study are: (i) To document patient
      adherence to TR, compared to usual care (ii) To estimate the extent to which TR improves
      functional status, compared to usual care and (iii) To estimate the cost effectiveness of TR,
      compared to usual care in eight different health conditions in Singapore.

    <description>There are five different categories of exercise in the rehabilitation program, which combines both physiotherapy (Category 1 to 4) and occupational therapy components (Category 5). Each tele-therapy session could cover all five categories of exercises. Progression of levels within each exercise within each category should be determined by the tele-therapist and in consultation with the participant.</description>
