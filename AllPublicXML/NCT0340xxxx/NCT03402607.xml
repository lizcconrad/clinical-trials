      This phase II, randomized trial will compare Quality of Life for patients with Hepatocellular
      Carcinoma (HCC) who are not surgical candidates or decline surgery and are treated with
      Percutaneous Local Ablation (PLA) or Hypofractionated Image-Guided Radiation Therapy (HIGRT).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Primary liver cancer is the world's third most common cause of cancer death. In the United
      States, unlike other malignancies such as breast, prostate and lung cancer, the incidence of
      hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is increasing. The present gold standard for HCC patients who
      are medically fit is HCC resection or liver transplant. Surgery is a treatment option for
      just one third of patients with HCC. For the patients who are not fit for surgery either due
      to underlying liver disease with associated liver dysfunction or other co-morbidity, a number
      of non-operative treatments are available for treatment including percutaneous tumor ablation
      (PLA) or the emerging option of external beam radiotherapy techniques, such as
      hypo-fractionated image guided radiation therapy (HIGRT) -also known as stereotactic body
      radiotherapy (SBRT).

      Percutaneous local ablation (PLA) selectively targets the tumor with an additional
      intentional margin of 0.5-1cm of non-cancerous liver tissue and induces tumor cell death,
      most often via coagulative necrosis. Local application of chemical agents or
      microwave/radiofrequency waves does not induce systemic effects and is typically performed
      under real-time ultrasound guidance using local anesthesia and conscious sedation.

      Worldwide, RFA is the most commonly used ablation technique. In the US, MWA is quickly
      becoming the preferred modality of PLA. MWA induces thermal injury through the delivery of
      electromagnetic energy and the application of rapidly alternating microwave frequency current
      leads to coagulative necrosis of tissue. Compared with RFA, MWA appears to be more effective
      for lesions in close proximity to the portal or hepatic veins; heat sink is less of an issue
      given increased speed with which therapy can be delivered. Additionally, tumor sizes &gt;3cm
      sometimes can be effectively treated with MWA. A recent meta-analysis comparing RFA to MWA
      for primary HCC showed they had similar efficacy, although MWA appeared to have improved
      local tumor control over RFA in the treatment larger tumors.

      Advances in radiotherapy simulation, treatment planning and delivery integrated together
      collectively termed HIGRT or SBRT, have facilitated safe dose escalation to HCC. A number of
      small, single institutional prospective studies have evaluated the use of HIGRT for treatment
      of HCC. These experiences suggest that HIGRT is well tolerated and yields excellent local
      control rates, however, follow up is short and thus many institutions and consensus
      guidelines favor ablation for early stage HCC patients who are not surgical candidates. The
      benefits of HIGRT are that it is a non-invasive, outpatient procedure typically delivered in
      3-10 fractions. Although no randomized studies have compared HIGRT with other local
      therapies, in retrospective analysis outcomes appear comparable , warranting further
      evaluation.

      Health-related quality of life (QOL) for patients with HCC is important. QOL targets are
      important post-treatment metrics; previous studies have shown that both pre-treatment QOL and
      post-treatment QOL have been associated with overall survival in various cancers. While both
      PLA and SBRT can ablate tumors, they do have known impacts on patients' QOL. QOL has recently
      been reported as a clinically important target in patients treated with HIGRT for HCC.

      Patients who are potentially eligible for study enrollment will be identified by their
      treating physician. Ninety patients will be randomized with equal allocation to the two arms.
      . Randomization will be stratified by whether the baseline QOL score is &lt; 60 or ≥ 60, where
      QOL is measured by the QLQ-C30 scale. The primary outcome is the change in QOL from baseline
      to 1 month. The investigators anticipate that approximately 10% of the accrued patients will
      withdraw before 1 month, leaving 80 evaluable patients to be used in the statistical
      analyses.

      The general linear model will be used to test for an arm effect (in patients receiving PLA vs
      HIGRT) by regressing change across time in QOL on arm, controlling for the baseline value of
      QOL and the Child Pugh score. To calculate the power of the arm effect (in patients receiving
      PLA vs HIGRT) on change in QOL, the investigators first note that the standard deviation of a
      normally distributed change score (SDC) depends upon the SD of the pre-score, the SD of the
      post-score, and the Pearson correlation (ρ) between the two scores. If the SD's of the
      pre-score and the post-score are assumed equal and the correlation between them is 0.50, then
      SDC = SD. For purposes of the power calculation the investigators assume that SD=10 and ρ =
      0.5; therefore SDC= 10. Assuming 40 evaluable patients per arm, the two-sample t-test
      (1-sided alpha = 0.10) of an arm difference in change across time in QoL has power 0.82 when
      the true arm difference in change score is 5 (i.e., 50% of SDC). An arm difference of 50% of
      a standard deviation of an outcome variable is generally considered to be a &quot;medium&quot;-sized
      effect. In order to have 80 evaluable patients, 90 patients will be accrued (assuming drop
      out prior to the 1 month EOTRC QOL-C30 questionnaire).

      Patients will be on study therapy for approximately 6 months. The end of study participation
      will be at the completion of the 6 month survey, approximately 180 days post treatment (+/-
      30 days). Thereafter patients will continue to be followed by the treating physician as per
      standard of care for follow up care and long-term follow up information will continue to be
      collected.

    <description>A PLA procedure uses high-energy radio waves to treat liver tumors. Using CT and ultrasound guidance the doctor inserts a thin, needle-like probe into the liver tumor A high-frequency current is then passed through the tip of the probe, which heats the tumor with the goal to destroy the cancer cells. This may be done as an outpatient procedure or a short (1-2 day) hospital stay. PLA is the standard treatment for patients with liver cancer who cannot undergo liver surgery.</description>

    <description>HIGRT is an emerging treatment option for patients with HCC; it utilizes external radiation where multiple beams enter the body from multiple angles to treat the liver cancer over typically 5-10 treatments while minimizing radiation to normal tissues. You will receive between 5-10 fractions (treatments) of radiation. Fraction size will be either 5 or 10 Gy (pronounced Gray, a standard unit of radiation measurement) depending on your tumor size and location or underlying liver function. The total dose of radiation is 50 Gy.</description>

    <description>Microwave Ablation (MWA) is a form of percutaneous localized ablation using thermal ablation techniques to treat cancer via direct coagulative necrosis. Microwaves can generate high temperatures in a short period of time; MWA has the potential to improve treatment efficacy over radiofrequency ablation as it can be used to treat larger lesions and has less susceptibility to heat-sink due to vessel proximity. MWA uses electromagnetic waves (300 MHz to 300 GHz) to produce oscillation of polar molecules within tissue; this generates tissue necrosis through frictional heating. For HCC, one or more microwave antennae are inserted into the liver, usually under the guidance of ultrasonography or computed tomography (CT). Frequency and length of treatment is determined on a case by case basis depending on tumor size and proximity to vessels or other organs at risk.</description>

    <description>HIGRT represents the only non-invasive curative modality in the management of HCC. HCC patients typically have a host of other medical comorbidities complicated by underlying liver dysfunction that makes the implementation of liver-directed therapy challenging. Presently HIGRT is typically offered only after alternative surgical (transplantation/hepatectomy) and non-operative approaches (PLA/embolization) have been exhausted.</description>
