  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Introduction. Functional dyspepsia (FD) is a common chronic gastrointestinal disorder with a
      high socio-economic impact. Acotiamide, a new prokinetic agent, was shown to be efficacious
      in the treatment of FD, especially in the postprandial distress syndrome subgroup. To date,
      the exact mechanism of action of acotiamide is incompletely elucidated.

      The aim of this study was to examine the effect of acotiamide on gastric motility, gastric
      emptying rate and gastrointestinal symptom perception in healthy participants in a
      randomized, placebo-controlled, cross-over study design. Participants were treated with
      acotiamide (100 mg t.i.d.) and placebo for 3 weeks, separated by a one-week wash-out period.
      At the end of each treatment period, gastric emptying and motility were assessed on two
      consecutive study days. During gastric motility assessment, epigastric symptom scores were
      collected at multiple time points.
