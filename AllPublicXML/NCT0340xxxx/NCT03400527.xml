  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the effects of self directed exercise on pain and
      function reported in patients with Fibromyalgia both in the short term and long term.
      Previous studies have shown that patients with fibromyalgia respond better to a single
      session of self directed exercise compared to prescriptive exercise. To the investigator's
      knowledge, no studies have examined the impact on pain and function after multiple sessions
      of self directed exercise in this patient population.

      This study hoes to be a case series exploring the effects of self directed exercise on
      participants with fibromyalgia. Participants will be encouraged to exercise 8-12 times in a 4
      week time frame at a self selected pace and intensity on a stationary bicycle. Outcome
      measures such as the Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire, SF-36 and Numeric Pain Rating Scale
      will be used prior to study participation as well as 4 and 8 weeks following the start of
      participation.

             for a maximum of 2 times per week for the 4 months prior to study entry.

          -  signed release from their physician stating that they are able to participate in the
             study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  presence of an acute or chronic medical condition such as cancer

          -  infection, cardiovascular or respiratory disease (that would limit their exercise
             participation), metabolic or musculoskeletal or neurologic condition (systemic lupus
             or rheumatoid arthritis, or other pain disorders)

          -  already participating or plan on participating in a regular aerobic exercise program 6
             months prior to the study

          -  ongoing or planned Physical Therapy treatment
