    <textblock>
      This study is being done to find out if Spectrum Near-Infrared (NIR) imaging with Indocyanine
      Green (ICG) dye can help measure blood flow around an incision before and after the surgeon
      closes the incision with staples or sutures.

      The Spectrum NIR imaging system uses a handheld camera that produces a special type of light
      that can help surgeons see things during surgery that are difficult to see with the naked
      eye, for example, cancer tissue versus healthy tissue. Spectrum NIR imaging has been approved
      by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as a tool that is widely used during surgery.

      ICG dye is a sterile solution that can be seen with Spectrum NIR imaging. This dye, used with
      Spectrum NIR imaging, allows surgeons to see blood flow to parts of the body during and after
      surgery. Making sure that there is enough blood flow to the surgical site helps to promote a
      less complicated recovery.

    <description>The first 10 patients enrolled will undergo skin closure with staples. The next 10 patients enrolled will undergo skin closure with a running subcuticular suture.to evaluate skin perfusion using the Spectrum NIR imaging system following intravenous injection of ICG in all patients. Patients will be assigned skin closure with either running subcuticular suture or skin staples in a sequential, nonrandomized fashion before the procedure. After the planned surgical procedure is complete, ICG will be injected intravenously. Video of the incision will be recorded. After skin closure is complete, a second intravenous bolus of ICG (same dose as previously injected) will be given. Video of the incision will again be recorded. Measurement of perfusion will subsequently be performed by video analysis at the previously described three predefined points along the incision after surgery is complete and again after skin closure.</description>
