  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Excess weight is a major risk factor underlying leading causes of death globally, including
      cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, and some cancers. Among participants assigned to the
      same lifestyle intervention arms in prior weight loss randomized controlled trials, large
      inter-individual differences in weight loss success have been observed, ranging from &gt;50lbs
      of weight loss to &gt;10lbs of weight gain. Both genetic and non-genetic factors underlying
      differential adherence and weight loss success are poorly understood.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      23andMe aims to recruit 91,227 adults to participate in a web-based weight loss intervention.
      Primary aims include: a.) to confirm whether AG/GG individuals at MTIF3 rs1885988 lose more
      weight on lifestyle interventions; and b.) to test the performance of a randomized controlled
      trial vs. self-selection study design in terms of weight loss, drop-outs, and adherence.
      Secondary (exploratory) analyses will focus on discovery of genetic and non-genetic
      predictors of weight loss success overall, and examination of potential interactions by
      intervention type. Web-administered intervention content, videos, and forums will be surfaced
      to participants every two weeks, and self-reported surveys will be surfaced weekly for the
      active intervention duration.
