  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      By detecting platelet antibodies of participants and then further to identify their genotype
      and analyzing laboratory examination, the investigators will obtain positive frequency of HPA
      antibodies, the distribution of HPA antigen and antibodies, effect of matching platelet
      transfusion, all of which in favor of draw a conclusion that it is very important to carry
      out HPA antibody detection and matching transfusion in early phase.

      1. The investigators will detect platelet antibodies of participants who are according with
           the inclusive criteria.

        2. For participants with platelet antibodies, the investigators should screen out cases
           owning HPA antibodies and further to identify their genotype.

        3. Platelet infusion of same type will be applied to half of participants with HPA
           antibodies as experimental group, and the another half of participants with hematopathy
           will be infused ordinary platelets as control. The investigators will estimate the
           effect of matching transfusion through laboratory examination such as platelet count 1
           hour and 24 hours after transfusion and clinical feature comparing to control group.

        4. Finally, the investigators will obtain several conclusions includes positive frequency
           of HPA antibodies, the distribution of HPA antigen and antibodies, effect of matching
           platelet transfusion by analyzing a bunch of relevant information. So, strong evidence
           will be provide to decide if it is very important to carry out HPA antibody detection
           and matching transfusion in early phase.

    <time_frame>From one participant first enrolled in this study to the moment of HPA antibodies could be detected or death, up to 6 months. The investigators will calculate the percentages after all participants are done with trace.</time_frame>
    <description>The investigators will recruit about 25000 participants in total (anticipated) of different hospitals spread over the whole country and divide them into two categories, patients with and patients without platelet antibodies, by detecting antibodies through solid-phase agglutination (qualitative analysis). The investigators screen out the positive ones and then distinguish participants with antibodies against human platelet antigens (HPA) from those with antibodies against human leukocyte antigens (HLA) by using LIFECODES PAKPLUS (qualitative analysis). At the same time, subtype of anti-HPA antibodies (such as anti-HPA-1a antibodies) are detected. The analyzation of large sample data will present investigators the most important findings, the percentages (%, the primary outcome measure) of hematopoietic patients with anti-HPA antibodies (include the total and the various subtypes) among all investigated hematopoietic patients who need long-term infusion of platelets.</description>
