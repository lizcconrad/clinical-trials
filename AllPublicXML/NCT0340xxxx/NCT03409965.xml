  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, multi-site, non-randomized study evaluating the safety and
      effectiveness of the Infini and LaseMD Systems for combination treatment in wrinkles,
      texture, and pigmentation of the face and/or neck.
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Enrolled subjects will receive three (3) face and/or neck treatments provided 30 days apart.
      During each treatment subjects will receive both Infini and LaseMD treatments. Treatments
      will be provided according to a protocol-specific treatment protocol in which an Infini
      treatment will be provided first, followed by a LaseMD treatment. A telephone contact will be
      completed at 3 days following each treatment to assess for adverse events. One follow-up
      visit will be conducted at 90 days following the last study treatment. Outcome measures
      include clinician grading and subject satisfaction post-treatment. Pre-treatment study
      photographs and D90 study photographs will be obtained.

    <description>An assessment of paired pre- and post-treatment photographs will be conducted by blinded assessors. Each blinded assessor will be given an identical set of baseline (pre-treatment) and Day 90 follow-up photos to be assessed. Each photo's visit interval, i.e., pre-treatment and follow-up, will NOT be marked. Each blinded assessor will conduct their assessment independently, comparing the Left and Right photos for improvement in the face and/or neck using the following definition:
Change: An improvement that is:
Striking, substantial and immediately noticeable, or
Readily apparent but modest in nature
Slight and subtle in nature, may require close examination
The assessor chooses the photo they believe to be the post-treatment photo, i.e., Left photo or Right photo.</description>

    <description>Overall aesthetic improvement based on completion of the Clinician Global Aesthetic Improvement Scale, a scale that rates global aesthetic improvement from the pretreatment appearance using the following definitions:
= Improved: Improvement in appearance from initial condition
= No Change: The appearance is essentially the same as the original condition
= Worse: The appearance is worse than the original condition The scale will be administered based on a live assessment of the subject while referring to the subject's pre-treatment photographs, and based on a comparison of the subject's pre-treatment photographs to the Day 90 follow-up photographs.</description>

    <description>Overall aesthetic improvement based on completion of the Subject Global Aesthetic Improvement Scale, a scale that rates global aesthetic improvement from the pretreatment appearance using the following definitions:
= Improved: Improvement in appearance from initial condition
= No Change: The appearance is essentially the same as the original condition

    <measure>Patient Satisfaction</measure>
    <time_frame>90 days following study treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Patient satisfaction will be evaluated based on subjects' completion of a patient satisfaction questionnaire while referring to a hand mirror and their pre-treatment photographs and their Day 90 follow-up photographs. Subjects will be asked to document Yes/No as to whether they notice any improvement in how their treated skin areas look; specify any changes they see in the treated areas, e.g., skin texture improvement, skin tone improvement, skin pigmentation improvement, etc.; characterize their level of satisfaction with study treatment based on 5 levels of satisfaction: Very satisfied, Satisfied, Slightly Satisfied, Neither Satisfied or Dissatisfied, Dissatisfied; document Yes/No if they would recommend the treatment to friends and family members.</description>

    <description>During study treatments, subjects' pain levels will be monitored using a validated Numeric Rating Scale (0-10), with 0 being 'No Pain' and 10 being the 'Worst Possible Pain'.</description>
