      This project will evaluate 3 approaches of implementation support for university peer leaders
      who will deliver a prevention program with a particularly strong evidence-base compared to
      changes observed in outcomes in response to usual care at the universities before
      implementation. This study aims to advance knowledge of this innovative and economical way to
      provide college prevention programs to reduce the burden of mental illness in the college
      student population.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Several interventions for mental health problems are efficacious and effective, but few are
      routinely offered to college students, who represent 59% of young adults. This is regrettable
      because college students are at high risk for mental health problems (e.g., depression,
      substance abuse, eating disorders), and college counseling centers lack sufficient clinicians
      to offer individual therapy to all afflicted students and are not well positioned to deliver
      prevention programs. One solution for this service shortfall is to have peer educators
      deliver scripted group-based prevention programs, which can more efficiently reduce the
      burden of mental illness than individual therapy. Targeting college students is a
      cost-effective tactic for delivering prevention programs and has vast potential reach because
      85% of colleges have peer educator programs. Peer educators have effectively delivered
      several prevention programs, sometimes producing larger effects than clinicians. This study
      will investigate 3 levels of implementation support (training, training with technical
      assistance, and training with technical assistance and quality assurance) and the impacts of
      differing levels of implementation support on program outcomes across 57 college campuses
      nationwide. Specifically we have five aims for this study:

      Aim 1: Test whether greater implementation support is associated with graded increases in
      fidelity and competence in delivering the scripted prevention program. This will be assessed
      by an established procedure for reliably rating fidelity and competence of audio-recorded
      intervention sessions.

      Aim 2: Test whether greater implementation support, which should increase fidelity and
      competence of intervention delivery, is associated with graded increases in student
      attendance of intervention sessions (recorded by the peer educators) and effectiveness of the
      prevention program (measured by pre-to-post changes in core outcomes assessed with anonymous
      surveys completed by group participants) and compared to parallel pre-to-post change data
      collected from students at the colleges before implementation is initiated.

      Aim 3: Test whether greater implementation support is associated with graded increases in
      program reach (% of female students at each college who complete the prevention program
      during the 1-year implementation period) and sustainability (% of female students at each
      college who complete the prevention program during the subsequent 2-year sustainability
      monitoring period).

      Aim 4: Test whether Consolidated Framework for Implementation of Research (CFIR) indices of
      perceived intervention factors, outer and inner setting factors, peer educator attributes,
      and process factors after the initial training correlate with fidelity, competence,
      attendance, effectiveness, and reach over the 1-year implementation period and with
      sustainability. We will test whether at the end of the initial implementation period the 3
      conditions differ on relevant CFIR indices and on the progress and speed of implementation.

      Aim 5: Compare the prevention program delivery cost in the 3 implementation conditions, and
      the relative cost-effectiveness of each condition in terms of attaining fidelity, competence,
      attendance, and effectiveness, reach, and sustainability, plus cost-savings from and
      reductions in waitlists and eating disorder prevalence at clinics.

    <description>Peer educators' adherence to scripted intervention manual and accuracy of script delivery as coded through evaluation of audio-recorded sessions by two clinicians independently coding a random selection of sessions using the Session Adherence Scale. Coders will indicate the extent to which peer leaders adhere to the 25 total total necessary components of the 4-session intervention script using a scoring guide ranging from 10 (indicating no adherence) to 100 (indicating perfect adherence) with a possible total score range of 250 to 2500. Inter-rater agreement for Session Adherence Scale has been found to be .92 (Stice et al., 2013a).</description>

    <description>Peer educators' competence with intervention delivery as assessed by 12-item Group Leader Competence Scale measuring various indicators of a competent group facilitator (e.g. leaders allot equal speaking time for all members.) Coders will indicate the extent to which peer leaders show competence in their delivery of the scripted intervention across 12 items using a scoring guide ranging from 10 (indicating poor competence) to 100 (indicating superior competence) with a possible total score range of 120 to 1200.

Respondents will indicate the extent to which they agree with each item on a 5-point Likert scale ranging from 0 (Not at all) to 4 (Very great extent).
