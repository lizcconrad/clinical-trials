  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, and parallel study. The study is
      comprised of three main phases: a single-blind placebo run-in qualifying phase lasting about
      14 days, a double-blind treatment phase of 12 weeks, and a 2-week follow-up phase.
      Approximately 18 patients will be enrolled and randomly assigned to receive placebo or 1,000
      mg of extended-release Ranolazine twice-daily for 12 weeks to reach 14 evaluable patients at
      the end of the study.

      Patients with chronic angina pectoris will be screened for eligibility after providing
      informed consent. Patients present with the symptoms of stable angina after withdrawn from
      other antianginal agents and given the required background therapy for at least 5 days will
      be qualified for entering this study and performing 1st ETT qualifying test.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Male or female patients aged ≥ 20 years old.

          2. A minimum 3-month history of stable angina.

          3. Patients with diagnosis of coronary artery disease (CAD) via at least one of the
             following criteria:

               -  Angiographic evidence of ≥ 50% stenosis of ≥ 1 major coronary artery;

               -  CT angiographic evidence of ≥ 50% stenosis of ≥ 1 major coronary artery;

               -  History of previous myocardial infarction (MI)*;

                  *Previous MI history of patients has to be occurred and diagnosed at least 2
                  months prior entering this study.

               -  A stress-induced reversible perfusion defect identified by radionuclide or
                  echocardiographic imaging.

          4. Patients present with the symptoms of stable angina after withdrawn from other
             antianginal drugs and given the required background therapy for at least 5 days will
             be qualified for entering this study and performing 1st ETT qualifying test.

          5. Patients developed exercise-induced ECG ischemia during two qualifying exercise
             treadmill tests. The difference between twotests should be ≤ 20% of the longer test or
             ≤ 1 minute.

          6. Willing and able to provide a written informed consent.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Factors that might compromise ECG or ETT interpretation.

          3. Patients with congenital heart disease.

          4. Patients with uncorrected valvular heart disease.

          5. Patients with unstable angina, or MI, or coronary revascularization procedure ≤ 2

             hysterectomy or bilateral oophorectomy or bilateral salpingectomy; tubal ligation
             alone is not considered sufficient) or one year post-menopausal.

          7. Patients are under any one of the following conditions:

               -  New York Heart Association (NYHA) Class III or Class IV congestive heart failure

               -  QTc &gt; 450 msec at screening;

               -  Active myocarditis, pericarditis, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy;

               -  Uncontrolled hypertension (defined as SBP &gt; 180 mmHg). Voltage criteria for left
                  ventricular hypertrophy in the absence of repolarization abnormalities will not
                  be exclusion criteria.

          8. Use of any investigational product ≤ 4 weeks prior to screening.

          9. Patients with severe hepatic disease (e.g., liver cirrhosis).
