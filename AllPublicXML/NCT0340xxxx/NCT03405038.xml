  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Catheter colonization, catheter-associated infection and catheter-associated bacteremia are a
      major challenge for resuscitation unit. This study wishes to explore the impact of the
      central venous catheter colonization on the ARDS patient with and without prone position.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Catheter-associated infection prevention is achieved by identification of the population at
      risk. Patients receiving prone position Under acute respiratory distress syndrome appear to
      be particularly vulnerable. This retrospective study is designed to compare the risk of
      catheter colonization that could be induced or worsened by prone position. Knowing that,
      prone position is increased into the care acute respiratory distress syndrome since few
      years. Unfortunately, no study has examined the prone position impact on catheter-association
      infection in these population.
