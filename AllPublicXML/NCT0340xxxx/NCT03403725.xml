  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this clinical trial is to identify the highest dose of MEN1309 drug with
      acceptable safety profile and that can be used in patients affected by CD205-positive solid
      tumors and Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This clinical trial will investigate the safety and activity of MEN1309 in patients with
      CD205-positive metastatic solid tumors and Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma who have tried other types of
      treatment for cancer without adequate response (or the cancer came back). CD205 is a protein
      present in certain types of cancer.

      This is a Phase I study, which means that it is designed to look at several dose levels of a
      study drug in small groups of patients to find the dose that is well-tolerated and suitable
      to be administered in subsequent clinical trials in patients. The clinical trial is also
      looking at the effectiveness of the study drug. This is the first time the study drug will be
      given in humans.

      The clinical trial consists of two sequential parts:

        -  Part 1 involves patients with CD205-positive metastatic solid tumors and the main
           purpose of this part of the clinical trial is to determine the highest dose of the study
           drug that can be used safely in these type of cancers.

        -  Part 2 involves patients with CD205-positive Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma and will test doses of
           MEN1309 which have demonstrated to be adequately tolerated in patients with solid
           tumors.

      Patients participating to the clinical trial will take the study drug as intravenous infusion
      once every 3 weeks. The clinical trial includes four periods: a pre-screening period (to
      check if tumor is positive for CD205), a screening period (to check whether the participation
      to the clinical trial is right for patient), a treatment period (when patient receives the
      study drug), and a follow-up period (to check the health status of the patient after stopping
      study treatment).
