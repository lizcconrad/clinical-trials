      To assess the relationship between serum endostatin (ES) and Coronary artery calcification
      (CAC) in type 2 diabetic (T2DM) patients.

  <detailed_description>

      elevated serum endostatin levels were independently associated with increased risk, severity
      and progression of coronary artery calcification independent of traditional cardiovascular
      disease risk factors in T2DM subjects with known coronary artery disease. So, Measurement of
      serum ES levels can improve the diagnosis of coronary artery calcification and could be
      useful as a high sensitive marker for the presence and progression of atherosclerosis in T2DM
      patients.

    <description>An oral (metoprolol 20 mg) was given to the patients with heart rates &gt; 60 beats/minute and had no contraindications to beta-blockers, one hour before the scan. Sublingual nitroglycerin was given to all patients before CT examination. A 64-slice CT scanner (Sensation 64; Siemens Medical System, Germany) was used for imaging all subjects. All CT examinations were done during inspiratory breath holding.
Endostatin levels were measured using a sandwich ELISA kit according to the manufacturer's instructions endostatin ELISA kit (R&amp;D Systems, Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA</description>
