    <textblock>
      A newly developed intervention, Mindfulness Based Practices for Health Care Professionals in
      Training: Clinical Applications, will be piloted to determine the feasibility and
      accessibility within this population. The purpose of the proposed study is to assess the
      change in perceived stress at work/school and psychological symptomology; i.e., depression,
      stress, emotion regulation, and dispositional mindfulness, from pre to post intervention in
      health care professional students and when compared to a matched control group.

      The proposed study aims to investigate an 8-week intervention: Mindfulness Based Practices
      for Health Care Professionals in Training: Clinical Applications. During the intervention,
      participants will engage in didactic education, experiential mindfulness practices, including
      gentle yoga, and group dialogue. The aim of the study is to investigate the feasibility of
      this intervention in producing measurable differences between the participants and matched
      controls on their perception of their well-being and clinical work.
