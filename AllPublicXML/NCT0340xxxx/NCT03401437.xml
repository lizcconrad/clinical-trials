      Tubal sterilization is a widely used method of contraception. The hysteroscopic method of
      sterilization (Essure®; Bayer, Germany) was approved in 2007 in France. Increasing patients
      reports of complications, such as pain bleeding allergies fatigue or articular pain have
      raised concerns about the device's safety. Women suffering of alleged complications of the
      Essure® device ask for surgical removal. But, only few studies have assessed Essure® removal
      in terms of quality of life. This prospective observational study will be conducted at two
      academic tertiary care center (Montpellier - Marseille).

      Patients : Women requesting surgical management for removal of Essure® for alleged adverse
      effects.

      Assessment tools :

      Quality of life (pre-operatively and at 1 and 3 months) Anxiety and depression HAD
      questionnaire (pre-operatively and 3 months)

      Preoperative imaging, procedure characteristics, including the Essure® removal method,
      operative findings, perioperative complications, histopathologic report, and length of
      hospital stay will be collected.
