  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pancreatic cancer represents the most lethal of the common malignancies with a 5-year
      survival rate of less than 5%. For patients who are eligible for potentially curative
      resection, despite mortality and morbidity rates after surgery have improved, the recurrence
      rate is up to 85% within 2 years. FOLFIRINOX (fluoropyrimidine/leucovorin plus irinotecan and
      oxaliplatin) has been proved to significantly improve the prognosis and is recommended as
      first line treatment in patients with advanced pancreatic cancer. However, the regimen is
      limited due to the severe adverse effects. Thus, the investigators replaced 5-FU and
      leucovorin in the FOLFIRINOX regimen with oral S-1, a new oral ﬂuoropyrimidine derivative
      which was proved to be the well-tolerated and effectively in large III phase randomized
      clinical trial, to form the SIRIOX regimen. A phase I clinical trial from Japan found that
      SOXIRI (S-1, oxaliplatin and irinotecan) works in patients with advanced pancreatic cancer.
      In this study, the researchers intend to investigate the activity and safety of the
      combination of this regimen in patients with advanced pancreatic cancer.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Pancreatic cancer (mainly pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma, PDAC) is a disease with extremely
      poor prognosis, and is often fatal. Surgical resection is the only potentially curative
      technique for management of PDAC, but only approximately 15% to 20% of patients are
      candidates for pancreatectomy at the time of diagnosis Gemcitabine (Gem) is widely used as a
      standard chemotherapeutic agent for advanced pancreatic cancer. FOLFIRINOX
      (fluoropyrimidine/leucovorin plus irinotecan and oxaliplatin), compared with Gem, has been
      proved to significantly improve the objective response rate (31.6% VS. 9.4%, P &lt; 0.001) and
      prolong the median survival time (11.1 months VS. 6.8 months, P &lt; 0.001) for patients with
      metastatic pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma(PDAC), who had a performance status of ECOG 0-1
      score. However, it is undeniable that the adverse effects of FOLFIRINOX are severe. For
      example, the incidence of 3/4 grade neutrophil decrease in patients receiving FOLFIRINOX is
      significantly higher than those with Gem (45.7% VS. 21%, P &lt; 0.001). Thus, it is difficult
      for many patients to receive standard FOLFIRINOX and benefit from the protocol. Therefore,
      the investigators aim to explore an improvement program of FOLFIRINOX, hoping to better
      benefit patients.

      S-1 is a new oral fluoropyrimidine derivative in which tegafur is combined with two
      5-chloro-2, 4-dihydroxypyridine modulators and oteracil potassium, a potentiator of
      5-ﬂuorouracil's (5-FU's) antitumor activity that also decreases gastrointestinal toxicity.
      Combination chemotherapy with Gem and S-1 is reportedly well tolerated and benefits patients
      with advanced PDAC. Based on the results of the GEST study, S-1 is found to be non-inferior
      to Gem in patients' survival.

      Therefore, in this study, the investigators replaced 5-FU and leucovorin in the FOLFIRINOX
      regimen with oral S-1, forming a SIRIOX regimen to treat patients with advanced pancreatic
      cancer.
