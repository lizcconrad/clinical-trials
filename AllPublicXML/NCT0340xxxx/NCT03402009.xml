  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine what tools best assist university students develop
      a personal meditation practice to self-manage stress. The two treatment conditions are 1)
      independent meditation using web-based tools and apps, and 2) independent meditation using
      web-based tools, apps and EEG-based neurofeedback. Outcomes of interest include
      acceptability, adherence, changes in mental health (i.e., anxiety, stress), physical health
      (i.e., sleep, inflammation), resilience, and level of commitment to further practice. Factors
      related to self-regulation (i.e., interoceptive awareness, self-esteem) will also be assessed
      as potential outcome moderators.

      Investigators will conduct a randomized controlled trial to evaluate strategies for assisting
      students develop a personal meditation practice. All participants will attend a mindfulness
      orientation, then begin the four-week intervention. During the intervention period, the
      treatment group will practice EEG-neurofeedback-assisted meditation using the Muse device
      (Interaxon) at least eight times over the four-week intervention period, and also practice
      mindfulness meditation on their own using their choice of tools (e.g., apps, weblinks,
      breath). The active control group will mirror the treatment group but will not have access to
      the EEG-neurofeedback device.

      After a sufficient number of students register for the study who meet eligibility
      requirements, they will be provided with an option to enroll online in the first wave of the
      study, if their schedule allows, or be placed on a waitlist. Subsequent waves will take place
      throughout the semester(s) to accommodate additional participants. Enrolled participants will
      be asked to complete the pre-workshop questionnaire packet online, and attend an orientation
      session. During the orientation session, participants will first sign a consent form, provide
      a baseline saliva sample, then learn the basic technique of mindfulness meditation with an
      experienced meditation instructor. The orientation will also briefly explain the potential
      benefits of meditation from a scientific perspective, and emphasize the importance of
      establishing a daily practice, with the mindset that even one minute counts. Participants
      will then be asked to meditate for 3 minutes wearing the EEG device in order to get a
      baseline EEG reading. Following the orientation workshop, participants will be randomly
      assigned and notified via email into either the active control or treatment group along with
      group-specific instructions, and the 4-week intervention period will commence. Upon
      completion of the 4-week intervention, participants will be asked to complete
      post-intervention questionnaires online, then provide post-test measures of saliva, EEG
      reading during a 3 minute meditation. Participants will be debriefed, and those in the active
      control group will be given the option to use the EEG-neurofeedback. Follow-up surveys will
      be emailed to participants at 3, 6 and 12 months to examine if participants continue their
      meditation practice.

    <measure>Change in Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scales-21</measure>
    <time_frame>5 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>(DASS-21; Lovibond &amp; Lovibond, 1995): an abbreviated, 21-item, Likert-style scale to assess levels of distress on three subscales: depression, anxiety and stress, based on how one felt over the past week. The DASS-21 has been used in prior studies assessing the benefits of mindfulness in undergraduate students (Gallego et al., 2014). It consists of 21 items with seven items per subscale, scored on a four-point scale ranging from 0 = did not apply to me at all to 3 = applied to me very much or most of the time. The total score sums all items. Higher scores indicate higher levels of distress.</description>

    <measure>Big Five personality</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 5 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Big Five personality traits (Costa &amp; McCrae, 1992), which are openness, conscientiousness, extraversion, agreeableness, and neuroticism. These factors have been used to understand the relationship between personality and various academic behaviors. Respondents rate each item on a five-point scale from &quot;strongly disagree&quot; to &quot;strongly agree.&quot; This scale been used extensively in psychology research and has demonstrated good internal consistency, test-retest reliability, and validity (Costa &amp; McCrae, 1992).</description>

    <measure>Self-Regulation of Eating Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 5 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Self-Regulation of Eating Behavior Questionnaire (SREBQ) is a short, Likert format questionnaire comprising of two dichotomous screener questions, one directional question to bring tempting foods to mind, and five Likert-format items assessing respondents' self-regulation of eating. The five Likert-format items span a five-point scale from 'Never' to 'Always'. The SREBQ has been shown to be reliable and valid (Kliemann et al., 2016).</description>

    <measure>Multidimensional Assessment of Interoceptive Awareness (MAIA)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 5 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Interoceptive self-awareness. Interoception refers to the signaling and perception of internal bodily sensations, which we will assess using the validated Multidimensional Assessment of Interoceptive Awareness (MAIA) (Mehling et. al., 2009 and 2012). The MAIA is a relatively new scale, with good validity and reliability in studies to date (Mehling et. al., 2009 and 2012; Bornemann et. Al., 2014).</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Emotion Regulation Questionnaire (ERQ)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 5 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>) (Gross &amp; John, 2003). The ERQ assesses two specific emotion regulation strategies, suppression and reappraisal. The ERQ comprises 10 items (5 for suppression and 5 for reappraisal) rated from 1 (never do this) to 7 (always do this). The ERQ has demonstrated strong psychometric properties (Spaapen et al., 2014).</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Rosenberg (1965) self-esteem scale (RSES)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 5 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>a self-esteem measure widely used in social-science research, with a scale of 0 (low) to 30 (high). It is a ten-item Likert-type scale with items answered on a four-point scaleâ€”from strongly agree to strongly disagree. It has been used extensively in research and has demonstrated good internal consistency, test-retest reliability, and validity.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Inflammatory cytokines (i.e., C-reactive protein, IL-6, and TNF-Î±)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 5 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Saliva samples will be obtained in-person, during pre- and post- assessments. Saliva samples will be stored for analysis to be performed at a later date, pending funding. Future analysis on saliva will be limited to assays on stress and health-related biomarkers and inflammatory cytokines (i.e., C-reactive protein, IL-6, and TNF-Î±). The &quot;passive drool&quot; method will be used to collect saliva samples, as described in Walsh et al., 2016.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale (CD-RISC; Connor &amp; Davidson, 2003)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 5 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The CD-RISC is a 25-item scale that measures the ability to cope with stress and adversity. Items include: &quot;I am able to adapt when changes occur,&quot; &quot;I tend to bounce back after illness, injury, or other hardships,&quot; and &quot;I am able to handle unpleasant or painful feelings like sadness, fear, and anger.&quot; Respondents rate items on a scale from 0 (&quot;not true at all&quot;) to 4 (&quot;true nearly all the time&quot;). A preliminary study of the psychometric properties of the CD-RISC in general population and patient samples showed it to have adequate internal consistency, test-retest reliability, and convergent and divergent validity (Connor &amp; Davidson, 2003). This measure has been used in studies that assess resilience across the lifespan (Campbell-Sills et al., 2006).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Perceived Stress Scale-4 (PSS4)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 5 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>(PSS4) is an abbreviated, 4-item Likert format scale designed to measure the degree to which situations in one's life are appraised as stressful (Cohen et al., 1983). The PSS is a validated, publicly available, and widely used psychological instrument for measuring stress. Each item asks the participant to appraise his or her feelings and thoughts using a 5-point Likert scale (0 = never, 4 = very often)</description>

  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Long-term Follow-up Survey</measure>
    <time_frame>1, 6, and 12 months following completion of the satisfaction follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>Simple 2 question survey will ask participants if they are still meditating, and if so, what tools they are using for assistance.</description>
  </other_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Satisfaction with Mindfulness Tools</measure>
    <time_frame>5 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>After the completion of the 4-week trial, an 18-item instrument will be used to solicit participants' satisfaction with the meditation tools, as well as their feelings toward their meditation practice as a result of the intervention (i.e.,. confidence in ability, motivation to continue, and perceived benefits). The instrument was developed for this study and asks questions about perceived benefits of mindfulness meditation and intentions to continue practicing in the future.</description>
