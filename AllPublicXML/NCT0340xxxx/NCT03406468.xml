  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Radiotherapy in combination with different forms of immune therapy improved consistently
      local tumor control and very interestingly, lead to better systemic tumor control and the
      induction of specific anti-cancer immunity with a memory effect. In small series, it has been
      shown that a new long-lasting remission can be induced by irradiating one tumor site in
      patients who showed cancer progression after an initial response to immune therapy. In these
      series, the original immune therapy was continued and the treatment was very well tolerated.
      In this study the progression-free survival after radiotherapy to a single lesion will be
      investigated in patients with stage IV non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), who have at least
      achieved stable disease with immune therapy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Radiation has consistently been shown to activate key elements of the immune system.
      Radiotherapy in combination with different forms of immune therapy such as anti-PD-(L)1,
      anti-CTLA4,immunocytokines, dendritic cell vaccination and Toll-like receptor agonists
      improved consistently local tumor control and very interestingly, lead to better systemic
      tumor control (the &quot;abscopal&quot; effect) and the induction of specific anti-cancer immunity with
      a memory effect. Moreover, as PD1/PD-L1 is upregulated by radiation and radiation can
      overcome resistance for PD-(L)1 blockage, their combination is logical.

      In small series, it has been shown that a new long-lasting remission can be induced by
      irradiating one tumor site in patients who showed cancer progression after an initial
      response to immune therapy. In these series, the original immune therapy was continued and
      the treatment was very well tolerated. In this study the progression-free survival after
      radiotherapy to a single lesion will be investigatedin patients with stage IV non-small cell
      lung cancer (NSCLC), who have at least achieved stable disease with immune therapy.

    <description>Patients continue the same immune therapy they already received and get radiotherapy to one lesion. The lesion may or may not be symptomatic. The preferred radiotherapy dose is 24 Gy in 3 fractions (dosage on the 10 Gy isodose is allowed), but other fractionation schedules (e.g. 30 Gy/ 10 fractions, 20 Gy/ 5 fractions, 20-24 Gy / 1 fraction for SRS (stereotactic radiosurgery)) are allowed if these are standard for a certain location or palliative indication in the body.</description>
