  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Spatial neglect may occur in patients who have had a stroke. People with spatial neglect
      often pay much more attention to one side of the body while ignoring the other side, even
      though they have no difficulty seeing. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the impact on
      stroke recovery, including spatial neglect, of the Family-Clinician Collaboration program,
      where a family member of a stroke survivor actively interacts with clinical staff members
      providing inpatient rehabilitation services to the stroke survivor.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Spatial neglect (SN) frequently occurs in patients who have had a stroke. The problems caused
      by SN result in patients failing to attend to the space contralateral to the side of the
      stroke. This failure to attend to half of the patient's field may result in problems with
      perception, memory, action planning and navigation. These deficits hurt both the patients and
      their caregivers, and make it difficult for them to resume daily activities as they were
      before the stroke. More than half of the patients who had SN at admission still had it when
      discharged from an inpatient rehabilitation facility.

      This study examines a new behavioral treatment, where the clinician and the caregiver work
      together to provide better treatment. The family members will engage in frequent meetings
      with clinicians, set goals, learn about SN and coping strategies and have the patient to
      perform easy, safe treatment exercises. The study will compare this Family-Clinician
      Collaboration with the inpatient treatment control. This study will compare the groups in
      measures of spatial neglect and independence in the patients and measures of caretaker burden
      and mental health in family members. Participants will also report on their overall opinions
      of the new treatment condition.
