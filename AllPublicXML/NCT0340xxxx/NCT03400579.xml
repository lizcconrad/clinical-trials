      Prospective, single center, single arm pilot study evaluating the feasibility of delivering
      remote ischemic conditioning (RIC) by emergency medical services (EMS) in the prehospital
      setting. Eligible patients will have chest pain or anginal equivalent symptoms and require
      ground ambulance transport to the hospital. All subjects will undergo the standard RIC
      procedure (i.e., up to four cycles of alternating 5-min inflation and 5-min deflation) with
      the autoRIC® device (CellAegis Devices, Inc., Toronto, Ontario). The primary objective is to
      evaluate the number of cycles of RIC completed in patients having the procedure initiated by
      EMS in the prehospital setting.

    <textblock>
      This single-arm, open-label pilot study will evaluate the feasibility of delivering remote
      ischemic conditioning (RIC) by emergency medical services (EMS) in the prehospital setting.
      Eligible patients will be at least 18 years of age, experiencing chest pain or anginal
      equivalent symptom, present within 12 hours of symptom onset, and require ground ambulance
      transport to the hospital. Patients suspected of ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI)
      based on the prehospital electrocardiogram and thus requiring urgent intervention in the
      cardiac catheterization lab will be excluded.

      All subjects will undergo the standard RIC procedure (i.e., up to four cycles of alternating
      5-min inflation and 5-min deflation) with the autoRIC® device (CellAegis Devices, Inc.). The
      automated procedure will be initiated by paramedics during ambulance transport, and the RIC
      cycles will continue through emergency department (ED) arrival and stay for a total of 40
      minutes.

      The primary objective of this pilot study is to examine the duration of RIC administered in
      patients having the procedure initiated in the prehospital setting. The investigators
      hypothesize four cycles of RIC will be completed in at least 80% of patients having the
      procedure initiated. Secondary objectives are to assess enrollment rates and protocol
      implementation; paramedic acceptability of protocol; and patient tolerability of RIC.
