      The aims of this pilot randomized controlled trial are to compare the effect of a manualized
      skills-building program against usual care in preventing the development of chronic pain and
      disability following acute musculoskeletal injury in at-risk patients, and to test the
      feasibility and acceptability for delivery through live videoconferencing.

    <measure>Change in Pain Intensity</measure>
    <time_frame>0 Weeks, 4 Weeks, 3 Months</time_frame>
    <description>Numerical Rating Scale (NRS) for Pain Intensity; two-item survey asking for a rating of pain intensity at rest and with activity involving injured limb/body part; each item response is considered its own score; response options range from 0-10 with higher scores indicating greater pain intensity</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Disability</measure>
    <time_frame>0 Weeks, 4 Weeks, 3 Months</time_frame>
    <description>Short Musculoskeletal Function Assessment (SMFA); two scores are generated by summing items 1-34 for Function Index and 35-46 for Bothersome Index; Function Index scores range from 34-170, with higher scores indicating poorer functioning; Bothersome index scores range from 12-60, with higher scores indicating being more greatly bothered</description>

    <measure>Pain Catastrophizing</measure>
    <time_frame>0 Weeks, 4 Weeks, 3 Months</time_frame>
    <description>Pain Catastrophizing Scale (PCS); items are summed to generate a total score; scores range from 0 to 52; higher scores indicate greater pain catastrophizing</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Pain Anxiety</measure>
    <time_frame>0 Weeks, 4 Weeks, 3 Months</time_frame>
    <description>Pain Anxiety Symptom Scale (PASS); items are summed to generate a total score; scores range from 0-100; higher sores indicate greater pain anxiety</description>

    <measure>Depression</measure>
    <time_frame>0 Weeks, 4 Weeks, 3 Months</time_frame>
    <description>Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CESD); items are summed to generate a total score; scores range from 0 to 60; higher scores indicate greater depressive symptomatology</description>

    <measure>Post Traumatic Stress Disorder</measure>
    <time_frame>0 Weeks, 4 Weeks, 3 Months</time_frame>
    <description>Post Traumatic Stress Disorder Checklist (PCL); items are summed to generate a total score; scores range from 17 to 85; higher scores indicate greater post traumatic stress</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Acceptability</measure>
    <time_frame>0 Weeks, 4 Weeks, 3 Months</time_frame>
    <description>Retention Rate; calculated by dividing the number of participants enrolled by the number of participants that are not lost to follow up, multiplied by 100; expressed as a percentage</description>
