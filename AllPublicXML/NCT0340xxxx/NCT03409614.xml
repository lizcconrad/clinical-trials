  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective is to compare the progression-free survival (PFS) of REGN2810 plus
      platinum-based doublet chemotherapy combination therapy (REGN2810/chemo) and REGN2810 plus
      platinum-based doublet chemotherapy plus ipilimumab combination therapy (REGN2810/chemo/ipi)
      with standard-of-care platinum-based doublet chemotherapy in the first-line treatment of
      patients with advanced squamous or non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) in the
      subgroup of patients whose tumors express programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1) in 1% to
      &lt;50% of tumor cells and in the overall population of study patients whose tumors express
      PD-L1 in &lt;50% of tumor cells. The key secondary objectives are to compare the OS of
      REGN2810/chemo and REGN2810/chemo/ipi versus standard-of-care platinum-based doublet
      chemotherapy in the first-line treatment of patients with advanced squamous or non-squamous
      NSCLC in the subgroup of patients whose tumors express PD-L1 in 1% to &lt;50% of tumor cells and
      in the overall population of study patients whose tumors express PD-L1 in &lt;50% of tumor
      cells, to compare the ORR of REGN2810/chemo and REGN2810/chemo/ipi versus standard-of-care
      platinum-based doublet chemotherapy in the first-line treatment of patients with advanced
      squamous or non-squamous NSCLC in the subgroup of patients whose tumors express PD-L1 in 1%
      to &lt;50% of tumor cells and in the overall population of study patients whose tumors express
      PD-L1 in &lt;50% of tumor cells, and to evaluate the safety and tolerability of REGN2810/chemo
      and REGN2810/chemo/ipi compared to standard-of-care platinum-based doublet chemotherapy

          1. Patients with histologically or cytologically documented squamous or non-squamous
             NSCLC with stage IIIB or stage IV disease, who received no prior systemic treatment
             for recurrent or metastatic NSCLC

          2. Availability of an archival (≤5 months) or on-study obtained formalin-fixed,
             paraffin-embedded tumor tissue sample from a metastatic/recurrent site, which has not
             previously been irradiated

          3. Expression of PD-L1 in &lt;50% of tumor cells determined by the commercially available
             assay performed by the central laboratory

          4. At least 1 radiographically measureable lesion by computed tomography (CT) or magnetic
             resonance imaging (MRI) per RECIST 1.1 criteria. Target lesions may be located in a
             previously irradiated field if there is documented (radiographic) disease progression
             in that site

          5. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of ≤1

          6. Anticipated life expectancy of at least 3 months

        Key Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients who have never smoked, defined as smoking ≤100 cigarettes in a lifetime

          2. Active or untreated brain metastases or spinal cord compression

          3. Patients with tumors tested positive for Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) gene
             mutations, Anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) gene translocations, or C-ros oncogene
             receptor tyrosine kinase(ROS1) fusions

          4. Encephalitis, meningitis, or uncontrolled seizures in the year prior to informed
             consent

          5. History of interstitial lung disease (eg, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis or organizing
             pneumonia), of active, noninfectious pneumonitis that required immune-suppressive
             doses of glucocorticoids to assist with management, or of pneumonitis within the last
             5 years

          6. Ongoing or recent evidence of significant autoimmune disease that required treatment
             with systemic immunosuppressive treatments, which may suggest risk of immune-related
             treatment-emergent adverse events (irTEAEs)

          7. Previous treatment with idelalisib at any time (ZYDELIG®)

          8. Patients with a condition requiring corticosteroid therapy (&gt;10 mg prednisone/day or
             equivalent) within 14 days of randomization
