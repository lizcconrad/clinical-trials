  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to find out what effects (good and bad) immunotherapy treatment
      using the p53 vaccine (Ad.p53-DC) in combination with Nivolumab and Ipilimumab has on small
      cell lung cancer. Immunotherapy is a cancer therapy that uses the body's immune system to
      fight cancer cells.

      This study can be divided into three different phases: initial Induction Immunotherapy,
      Maintenance Immunotherapy and Retreatment.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      During the Induction Immunotherapy phase (4 x 21 day cycles) of the study, participants will
      receive Ipilimumab and Nivolumab on Day 1 of each cycle for 4 cycles. Participants will
      receive the p53 vaccine on Days 1 and 15 of cycle 1 and then again on Day 8 of Cycle 2.

      Beginning on Day 1 of Cycle 5 participants will start Maintenance Immunotherapy. During this
      phase of the study, participants will receive Nivolumab only on Day 1 of every 4 week period.
      Participants will also receive the p53 vaccine three additional times (every 4 weeks over a
      12 week period). During Maintenance Immunotherapy you will continue to receive Nivolumab only
      on Day 1 of each additional 4 week period that you take part until your disease progresses.

      The Retreatment phase of the study may be available to participants whose doctor feels they
      would benefit from retreatment and if they qualify for this retreatment. During retreatment,
      participants would receive the combination of Ipilimumab and Nivolumab or Nivolumab alone
      every three weeks for a maximum of one additional year.

      P53 Vaccine production

      The p53 vaccine will be made by inserting the p53 gene (a gene is a hereditary unit of all
      living organism within a cell) into a subset of the participant's own white blood cells. The
      insertion of the gene into their white blood cells will occur in the laboratory, after their
      cells have been extracted from their body through a procedure called leukopheresis (similar
      to dialysis).

             containing doublet used is etoposide-carboplatin. However, etoposide-cisplatin and
             irinotecan or topotecan combined with either carboplatin or cisplatin are platinum
             doublet regimens that can sometimes be used and thus would be allowed for the purposes
             of trial enrollment and eligibility.

          -  Excluded are patients who upon relapse may be still considered for a salvage
             concurrent chemo-radiation approach.

          -  Has had a prior anti-cancer monoclonal antibody (mAb) within 4 weeks prior to study
             Day 1 or who has not recovered (i.e., ≤ Grade 1 or at baseline) from adverse events

             Exceptions include basal cell carcinoma of the skin or squamous cell carcinoma of the
             skin that has undergone potentially curative therapy or in situ cervical cancer. Other
             malignancies that remain without evidence of disease or recurrence, 2 years or more
             after curative therapy are also considered part of this exception.

             to the first dose of trial treatment and any neurologic symptoms have returned to
             baseline), have no evidence of new or enlarging brain metastases, and are not using
             steroids for at least 7 days prior to trial treatment. This exception does not include

             the opinion of the treating investigator.
