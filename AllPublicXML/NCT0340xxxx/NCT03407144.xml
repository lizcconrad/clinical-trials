  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will examine the safety and efficacy of pembrolizumab (MK-3475) in combination
      with chemotherapy in children and young adults with newly diagnosed classical Hodgkin
      Lymphoma (cHL) who are slow early responders (SERs) to frontline chemotherapy.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Group 1 will consist of low-risk participants with cHL Stages IA, IB and IIA without bulky
      disease. Group 2 will consist of high-risk participants with cHL Stages IIEB, IIIEA, IIIEB,
      IIIB, IVA and IVB.

    <measure>Objective Response Rate (ORR) According to International Working Group (IWG) Criteria as Assessed by Blinded Independent Central Review (BICR)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 5 years</time_frame>
    <description>ORR is defined as the percentage of SER participants who have a Complete Response ([CR], disappearance of all evidence of disease) or Partial Response ([PR], regression of measurable disease and no new sites) using IWG revised response criteria and determined by BICR. The ORR will be estimated by risk group in SER participants.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Rate of Positron Emission Tomography (PET) Scan Negativity</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 5 years</time_frame>
    <description>The rate of PET negativity is the percentage of participants with PET negativity, which is defined as Deauville score 1, 2 or 3, after 2 cycles of AVD or 2 or 4 cycles of COPDAC-28, in combination with pembrolizumab. The Deauville 5-point scoring system is an internationally accepted and utilized five-point scoring system for the Fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) avidity of a Hodgkin's lymphoma or Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma tumor mass as seen on FDG PET scan: Score 1= No uptake above the background, Score 2= Uptake ≤ mediastinum, Score 3= Uptake &gt; mediastinum but ≤ liver, Score 4= Uptake moderately increased compared to the liver at any site, Score 5= Uptake markedly increased compared to the liver at any site, Score X= New areas of uptake unlikely to be related to lymphoma. In the present study, scores of 1 and 2 are considered to be negative and scores of 3, 4, and 5 are considered to be positive.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Event-Free Survival (EFS) According to IWG Criteria as Assessed by BICR in SER Participants</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 5 years</time_frame>
    <description>EFS is defined as the time from study enrollment to the first documented progressive disease (PD) according to IWG or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first. Progression/disease recurrence will be determined by BICR using IWG criteria. EFS rate will be estimated from time of initial diagnosis in SER participants.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Overall Survival (OS) in SER Participants</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 5 years</time_frame>
    <description>OS is defined as the time from study enrollment to death due to any cause. The OS rate will be estimated from the start of initial diagnosis in SER participants. Participants without documented death will be censored at the date of the last follow-up.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Frequency of Radiotherapy (RT)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 5 years</time_frame>
    <description>The frequency of RT received by eligible participants (positive PET response, i.e. Deauville score of 4 or 5) will be reported.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Adverse Events (AE)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 5 years</time_frame>
    <description>The number of participants who experience an AE will be reported for each arm. An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a participant that is temporally associated with the use of study treatment, whether or not considered related to the study treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease (new or exacerbated) temporally associated with the use of a study treatment.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Treatment Discontinuations Due to AEs</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 5 years</time_frame>
    <description>The number of participants who discontinue study treatment due to an AE will be reported for each arm. An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a participant that is temporally associated with the use of study treatment, whether or not considered related to the study treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease (new or exacerbated) temporally associated with the use of a study treatment.</description>
