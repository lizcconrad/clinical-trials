  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      HITC001 is a single institution study to evaluate the efficacy of using a standardized
      protocol of surgery and radiation for patients with brain metastases in relapsed
      neuroblastoma.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This clinical trial aims to establish a standardized protocol consisting of surgery and
      radiation for patients with brain metastases in relapsed neuroblastoma. This will be an
      adjunct study to NMTRC009 onto which patients will be enrolled to for treatment with
      precision therapy. This study will follow the efficacy, safety, and CNS progression-free
      survival of surgery and radiation.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Age: ≤ 21 years at the time of study entry.

          -  Diagnosis: Histologic verification at either the time of original diagnosis or relapse
             of neuroblastoma.

          -  Disease Status: Patients must have ONE of the following along with disease in the CNS:

               1. Any episode of recurrent disease following completion of aggressive multi-drug
                  frontline therapy.

               2. Any episode of progressive disease during aggressive multi-drug frontline
                  therapy.

               3. Primary resistant/refractory disease detected at the conclusion of at least 4
                  cycles of aggressive multidrug induction chemotherapy on or according to a
                  high-risk neuroblastoma protocols.

          -  Measurable or evaluable disease by Brain MRI.

          -  Current disease state must be one for which there is currently no known curative
             therapy.

          -  Meet all inclusion criteria for study NMTRC009

          -  Informed Consent: All subjects and/or legal guardians must sign informed written
             consent. Assent, when appropriate, will be obtained according to institutional
             guidelines

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Meets all exclusion criteria for study NMTRC009

          -  Subjects who, in the opinion of the investigator, may not be able to comply with the
             safety monitoring requirements of the study, or in whom compliance is likely to be
             suboptimal, should be excluded.
