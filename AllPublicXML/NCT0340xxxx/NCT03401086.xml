  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Breast cancer is a standout amongst the most widely recognized cancer among women. It is
      observed that upper extremity lymphedema is one of the most dangerous and prevalent
      complication following breast cancer surgery which prompts functional impairment,
      psychological disaster and social problems

      This study aimed to compare the effects of Kinesio taping and the pressure garment
      application on secondary lymphedema of the upper extremity and quality of life following
      mastectomy after breast cancer.

      Material and Methods: In this experimental study with pre and post-tests, 66 women with
      lymphedema following mastectomy were randomly allocated to Kinesio taping (KT) group (n=33)
      and pressure garment (PG) group (n=33). The KT group received Kinesio taping application,
      while the PG group received pressure garment (40-60 mmHg) for at least 15-18 hours per day
      through the study. All patients were evaluated to record the changes of the limb
      circumference, Shoulder Pain and Disability Index (SPADI), hand grip strength and quality of
      life at baseline and end of intervention.

    <textblock>
      66 women with unilateral breast cancer related to lymphedema (stage II and III) for at least
      for 6 months were invited to participate in the study. Lymphoma was more than 2 cm in arm
      circumference or less than 8 cm in comparison with the other side. The participants were
      randomly assigned to 2 groups. Kinesio taping group included 33 patients receiving Kinesio
      taping (KT) and pressure garment (PG) included 33 patients.

      The exclusion criteria were any active disease which leads to swelling, medications,
      especially diuretics, allergy, infection, pregnancy, heart and kidney diseases, bilateral
      lymphedema and cellulitis.

      All patients were evaluated to record the changes of the limb circumference, Shoulder Pain
      and Disability Index (SPADI), hand grip strength and quality of life

    <time_frame>1 month</time_frame>
    <description>Hand grip strength was evaluated by Dynamometer (78010, Lafayette Instrument Company, Loughboroug, Leics, United Kingdom). The grip strength was measured while the patient was in a standing position with adducted shoulder, flexed elbow 90 degrees and forearm in mid position.</description>
