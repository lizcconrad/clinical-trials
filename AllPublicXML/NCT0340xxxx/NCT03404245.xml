    <textblock>
      Self-management is a key component of successful chronic disease management and patients can
      benefit from learning about how daily activities and treatments relate to their symptoms and
      health status on an ongoing basis. The primary goal of this randomized controlled trial is to
      assess the efficacy of an e-health intervention, OPERAS, which includes two components: 1)
      the use of a newly developed web app to self-monitor symptoms/disease activity and treatment
      use, and help patients identify when a medical visit or treatment change is needed; 2) remote
      activity counselling provided by a physiotherapist, with the use of a wearable device
      (Fitbit) and the app to provide activity level feedback. The app component of OPERAS is
      hosted by the secure network of Arthritis Research Canada.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Self-management is a fundamental component in arthritis care, however, it is often neglected
      as most models of arthritis care focus on early access to medical consultation and surgical
      interventions. Patient self-management refers to the active participation of patients in a
      variety of activities that contribute to lessening the physical and emotional impact of
      illnesses. There are several factors attributing to a lack of self-management practice, such
      as frustration from managing health on a trial-and-error basis, a lack of knowledge to
      effectively monitor symptoms and disease, and being unsure about how to manage physical
      activities without aggravating symptoms. The variety of risk factors highlight the need for a
      multifaceted approach that provides support in terms of knowledge, skill development and
      timely advice from health professionals, as well as motivational support for patients to be
      engaged in their care and to stay physically active.

      Our primary objective is to assess the efficacy of an e-health intervention, OPERAS, which
      integrates the Arthritis Health Journal and a Physical Activity Counselling program, to
      improve self-management ability. Our secondary objectives are to explore the effect of the
      intervention on disease status and physical activity levels and to assess barriers to
      implementation and sustainability of the e-health intervention in RA management.

      The investigators will use a mixed-methods approach, involving a RCT and in-depth interviews.
      The proof-of-concept study will employ a stepped wedge RCT design, whereby the intervention
      will be sequentially rolled out to participants over a number of time periods. The order in
      which individuals receive the intervention will be determined at random. The strength of this
      design is that it can properly address the efficacy question, while avoiding the dilemma of
      withholding the intervention to some participants, as in a parallel group design.

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Disease status</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline in disease status at 6 months and 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>We will assess disease status through the RA Disease Activity Index (RADAI), which consists of: 1) global disease activity; 2) joint tenderness/swelling; 3) pain; 4) morning stiffness; 5) number/severity of painful joints</description>

    <measure>Physical Activity &amp; Sedentary Time</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline in physical activity and sedentary time at 6 months and 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>We will also measure physical activity and sedentary time with a SenseWear Mini sensor, in which participants will wear for 7 days at baseline and at the end of Month 6 and 12. We will calculate the average daily MVPA accumulated in bouts per day. A bout is defined as greater than or equal to 10 consecutive minutes at the level of 3 or higher METs, with allowance for interruption of up to 2 minutes below the threshold. We will calculate the average daily time spent with an energy expenditure of 1.5 METs or lower, occurring in bouts of &gt; 20 minutes during waking hours</description>

    <description>Education, Fitbit/self-management web app, physiotherapist counselling. These 3 components will be delivered to the participants in Months 1 and 2. The session will include a short presentation about physical activity in everyday life, an individual goal-setting session with a registered PT, and an orientation to the Fitbit device and the web app. Participants will be provided access to a Fitbit and an app account. The PT will review physical activity goals with participants via bi-weekly phone calls and progressively modify their activities. In Month 3-6, participants will continue using Fitbit and the app and have access to a PT via email as needed, but no phone call. In Months 7-12, participants may keep their Fitbit and app account, but will not have access to a PT.</description>
