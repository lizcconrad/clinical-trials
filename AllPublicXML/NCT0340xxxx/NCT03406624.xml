  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In the present study the investigators aim to examine the presence of bacteria in the disc
      and Modic Changes (bone) as well as characterize gene expression patterns and related markers
      to gain insight into molecular mechanisms that may be important for low back pain (LBP) and
      the development of Modic Changes (MCs). A case-control study with 1-year follow-up of two
      patient populations undergoing elective spinal surgery (spinal fusion or disc herniation
      surgery) will be conducted. 60 patients with MC (cases) and 40 without MC (controls) in each
      of the two patient populations undergoing either elective lumbar fusion surgery or disc
      herniation surgery will be included. The inclusion of control cultures from control patients
      is crucial since this may assist in determining whether a potential identification of low
      virulent bacteria in patients with MCs is due to true infection or contamination.

    <description>The Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) provides the level of self-reported impairment of activity of daily living due to low back pain. There are 10 items in the ODI, each rated on a Likert scale from 0-5. The total range of possible scores is from 0 -50, which is converted to a percentage ranging from 0-100. The percentage of self-reported disability ranges from 0='no impairment' to 100='complete impairment'.</description>

There are 24 items in the RMQ, each answered yes/no on a dichotomous questionnaire. All items answered with &quot;yes&quot; are summarized into a scale ranging from 0='no impairment' to 24='complete impairment'.</description>
