    <textblock>
      The goal of this research study is to create a bank of research samples and a database of
      clinical and risk information from women undergoing routine screening mammograms, for use in
      future research related to breast cancer, other cancers, and women's health. This research
      study will collect mammogram images, blood samples, and clinical information.

      This project aims to enroll 10,000 women presenting for breast cancer screening to the
      University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center (UT MDACC) Breast Imaging Center to establish a
      resource composed of biological specimens and a database of clinical and risk factor
      information that will be used to identify early detection biomarkers in breast cancer.
      Investigators propose the following primary specific aims:

        1. To establish a longitudinal cohort (n=10,000) of women who undergo mammography screening
           at the MDACC with follow-up for at least five years for each study participant or until
           breast cancer diagnosis.

        2. To create a repository of blood specimens from the cohort to use for biomarker discovery
           and validation.

        3. To create a comprehensive integrated database of imaging, clinical data, health
           measurements, and questionnaire data on the study participants.
