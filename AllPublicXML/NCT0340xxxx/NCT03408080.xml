  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      24 adults, between the ages of 18 and 75 years, with cerebellar ataxia will be enrolled in a
      12 week trial of BHV-4157 for treatment of ataxia. BHV-4157 is a pro-drug of riluzole (which
      is currently FDA-approved for ALS, Lou Gehrig's disease). There will be 5 visits to UCLA
      required--Screening when general and neurological examination, blood and urine testing, ECG,
      and questionnaires will be administered; Baseline when general and neurological examination
      and questionnaires will be administered and study drug dispensed; Week 4 and Week 12 when
      general and neurological examination, blood and urine testing, ECG, and questionnaires will
      be administered; 2 weeks after finishing study drug when general examination and blood
      testing will be completed. There is an option for a 36 week extension of the study drug
      trial.

    <measure>Scale for the Assessment and Rating of Ataxia</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>The total score on the Scale for the Assessment and Rating of Ataxia (SARA)
The SARA is a tool for assessing ataxia. It has eight categories with an accumulative score ranging from 0 (no ataxia) to 40 (most severe ataxia). When completing the outcome measure each category is assessed and scored accordingly. Scores for the eight items range as follows:
Gait (0-8 points), Stance (0-6 points), Sitting (0-4 points) Speech disturbance (0-6 points) Finger chase (0-4 points) Nose-finger test (0-4 points) Fast alternating hand movement (0-4 points) Heel-shin slide (0-4 points) Once each of the 8 categories have been assessed, the total is calculated to determine the severity of ataxia.
For motor activities of the four extremities (items 5-8), assessments are performed bilaterally, and the mean values are used to obtain the total score.
A higher score would indicate a worsening in ataxia. A lowered score may indicate the ataxia is improving.</description>

    <measure>Sheehan Suicidality Tracking Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>The Sheehan Suicidality Tracking Scale is a prospective, patient self-reported or clinician administered rating scale that contains 16 questions to track both treatment-emergent suicidal ideation and behaviors.
At screening:
Anyone with a score of 3 or 4 on question 2 or 13 should be exluded. Anyone with a score of 2 or higher on questions: 1a,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,or 14 should be excluded.
During the study:
Professional assistance should be sought out if a subject's score is 3 or 4 on question 2 or 13 as well as id a score is 2 or higher on questions: 1a,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,or 14.
Clinical judgment should be used in all situations to determine whether or not a subject is suicidal.
A normal score would be a score of 0. A worsened score would indicate that there are suicidal thoughts present and professional assistance should be sought.</description>

    <measure>Beck Depression Inventory</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>The Beck Depression Inventory is a patient reported or clinician administered rating scale that is used to measure the severity of a subject's depression
It is a 21-question multiple choice inventory. The assessment is scored as follows:
0-13: minimal depression 14-19: mild depression 20-28: moderate depression 29-63: severe depression.
A lower value is considered in the normal range, and an increase in the value would be considered a worse outcome. A decrease in the total value would be considered a better outcome.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Informed Consent a. Subjects (or legally acceptable representative as required by the
             IRB/IEC) must provide a written signed informed consent form/forms (IRB/EC specific)
             prior to the initiation of any protocol required procedures.

          2. Age and Sex a. Male and female outpatient subjects between the ages of 18 - 75,
             inclusive

          3. Target Populations

             a. Subjects with (1) a known or suspected diagnosis of a specific hereditary ataxia:
             SCA3/dizziness-predominant or SCA1, SCA2, SCA3, SCA6, already taking Riluzole for more
             than 8 weeks; (2) non-genetic pure cerebellar ataxia; (3) MSA-C: i. SCA subjects
             should have confirmed genotypic diagnosis from a CLIA-certified lab or a family member
             that has had such testing.

             ii. Alternatively, subjects must be willing to undergo genetic testing from a
             CLIA-certified lab if testing has not been previously done on the study subject and a
             copy of results is not available for verification.

             b. Ability to ambulate 8 meters without assistance (canes and other devices allowed);
             c. Determined by the investigator to be medically stable at Baseline as assessed by
             medical history, physical examination, laboratory test results available in medical
             record, and electrocardiogram testing available in medical record. Subjects must be
             physically able and expected to complete the trial as designed; d. Minimum of 6 years
             of education; e. Subjects must have adequate hearing, vision, and language skills to
             perform interviews as specified in the protocol; f. Subjects must be able to
             understand and agree to comply with the prescribed dosage regimens and procedures;
             report for regularly scheduled office visits; and reliably communicate with study
             personnel about adverse events and concomitant medications; g. Women of childbearing
             potential (WOCBP) and men must be using an acceptable method of contraception to avoid
             pregnancy throughout the study and for up to 30 day after the last dose of
             investigational product in such a manner that risk of pregnancy is minimized. The
             requisite drug interaction studies to determine the interaction of BHV-4157 with oral
             contraceptives have not been performed to date. It is therefore not possible to
             determine the efficacy of oral contraceptives as an effective method of contraception
             for WOCBP who participation this study. Oral estrogen and progestin hormonal
             contraceptives as a sole method of contraception are therefore prohibited. It is
             required that all WOCBP use two methods of contraception for the duration of the study
             (i.e. beginning at first treatment to 30 days after the last dose of study drug).The
             two methods should include one barrier method (ex. condom with spermicidal gel,
             intrauterine devices, cervical cap etc.) and one other method. The other method could
             include oral contraceptives or another barrier method.

             h. Women of childbearing potential must have a negative serum pregnancy test at
             screening and a negative urine pregnancy test within 72 hours of dosing.

             i. SCA subjects (SCA3/dizziness predominant; SCA1, 2, 3, 6 on Riluzole for more than 8
             weeks) will not be limited to Inclusion Criteria of Screening SARA score ≥8 or Score
             of ≥ 2 on gait subsection of the SARA.

             j. Non-genetic pure cerebellar and MSA-C subjects will be limited to Inclusion
             Criteria of Screening SARA score ≥8 or Score of ≥ 2 on gait subsection of the SARA.

             Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Target Disease Exceptions

             inclusion criteria that could predominantly explain or contribute significantly to the
             subjects' symptoms of ataxia (for example, alcoholism, vitamin deficiencies, multiple
             sclerosis, vascular disease, tumors, paraneoplastic disease, head injury, idiopathic
             late onset ataxia, multisystem atrophy) or that can confound assessment of ataxia
             symptoms (for example, stroke, arthritis); b. MMSE score &lt; 24; c. Subjects with
             prominent spasticity or dystonia that meet either of the following criteria: i. In the

             assess underlying ataxia severity; or, ii. Are associated on the INAS instrument at
             screening with moderate or severe scores on dystonia (at least 3 of 5 items) or
             spasticity (at least 2 of 3 items) or rigidity (at least 2 of 3 items) d. SARA total
             score of &gt; 30 points at screening; e. Subjects may not have started physical or
             occupational therapy within one month of screening and are not expected to start such
             therapy during the initial 12 week treatment phase. Subjects with ongoing occupational
             or physical therapy may be allowed to continue as long as the intensity remains

             enrolled in the study as long as they are cancer free prior to randomization. Subjects
             with other localized cancers (without metastatic spread) who have previously completed
             their course of treatment more than 2 years prior to baseline, are not currently
             receiving treatment and have been in remission may be enrolled only if, in the opinion
             of the investigator, there is no expectation for recurrence or further cancer
             treatment during the study period. Antihormonal therapy (e.g., tamoxifen) is allowed
             if the subject's cancer is in remission and the subject is on maintenance therapy to
             reduce their risk of recurrence; g. Any unstable cardiovascular (includes uncontrolled
             hypertension), pulmonary, gastrointestinal, or hepatic disease 30 days prior to

             maintenance dose of a non- tricyclic, non-monoamine oxidase inhibitor (MAOI)
             antidepressant medication (e.g., serotonin reuptake inhibitor, bupropion) with
             symptoms in remission may be eligible; k. History of neurosyphilis (as indicated by a
             positive rapid plasma reagin [RPR] test and a positive confirmatory test); l. History
             of drug or alcohol abuse within 12 months as defined by DSM-IV-TR-TR criteria; m.
             History or evidence of any medical, neurological or psychological condition that would
             expose the subject to an undue risk of a significant adverse event or interfere with
             assessments of safety and efficacy during the course of the trial as determined by the
             clinical judgment of the investigator; n. History of chronic pulmonary disease or
             chronic pulmonary symptoms

          3. Physical and Laboratory Test Findings
