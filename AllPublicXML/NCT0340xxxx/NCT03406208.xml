      The aims of this study are to compare the effect of two stress and symptom management
      programs tailored for patients with neurofibromatosis on quality of life and psychosocial
      functioning. We will also examine the degree to which treatment-dependent improvements in
      quality of life are mediated by improvements in depression, anxiety, distress, mindfulness,
      gratitude, social support, empathy, optimism, coping, pain intensity and pain interference.
