  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      is to compare introduction of two different NCPAP methods in terms of mechanical ventilation
      (MV) need (non-invasive respiratory support failure) and surfactant need within the first 72
      hours of life in preterm infants with Respiratory Distress Syndrome (RDS) at 26-30 weeks of
      gestation.

      Study Design NCPAP support was provided with continuous positive airway pressure, which was
      generated by a neonatal ventilator (SLE; Infant Flow System, Viasys Corp., USA) and infant
      flow-driver device (SLE; The respiratory parameter settings were a PEEP of 5-8 cmH2O. CPAP
      was stopped when PEEP 5 cmH2O and infants showed no signs of RDS with FiO2 &lt;0.30.

      Under non-invasive respiratory support, in case of FiO2 is ≥ 0.40, surfactant will be given
      as early rescue therapy by means of non-invasive method (by using a thin catheter - take care
      method- while spontaneous breathing continues) in order to keep target oxygen saturation
      between 90-95 %. The second dose of surfactant will be given 6 hours after the first dose by
      means on non-invasive method in order to keep target oxygen saturation between 90-95 % in
      case of FiO2 need is ≥ 0.30.

      Non-invasive respiratory support failure is set as follows:

        -  FiO2 of ≥ 0.50 in order to keep oxygen saturation measured by pulse oximetry above 90 %
           and higher,

        -  Apnea requiring more than 6 alerts in a 24 -hour period in 6 consecutive hours or more
           than 1 apnea requiring positive pressure ventilation,

        -  Persistent acidosis; presence of pH &lt; 7.20 and PCO2 &gt; 65 mmHg in two different blood
           gases drawn with an interval of at least 30 minutes or treatment-resistant metabolic
           acidosis,

        -  Severe respiratory distress,

        -  Pulmonary haemorrhage and cardiopulmonary arrest.
