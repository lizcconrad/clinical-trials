  <brief_summary>

      To investigate the safety and tolerance after allogeneic infusion of WJMSCs intravenously in
      adult patients diagnosed with type 1 diabetes.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a combined phase I and phase II study, where the first part is an open, dose
      escalating study consisting of 6 male patients, 18-40 years of age. The second part is a
      randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled, phase I/II study in parallel design comparing
      allogeneic WJMSC treatment to placebo in adult patients diagnosed with type 1 diabetes.
      Besides safety, preservation of endogenous insulin production (measured as C-peptide
      concentrations) together with metabolic control, diabetes treatment satisfaction and
      immunological profile will be assessed.

      A total number of 24 patients will be enrolled in the study and followed for one year after
      WJMSC/placebo treatment. Patients 18-40 years of age, both male and female, diagnosed for
      type 1 diabetes will be eligible. Providing informed consent and fulfillment of inclusion
      criteria and no exclusion criteria, they will within two years of diagnosis be randomized.
