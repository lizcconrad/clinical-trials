      This randomized controlled trial will compare the outcome of surgery (fasciectomy) with that
      of local injection of Collagenase Clostridium Histolyticum in patients with recurrent finger
      joint contracture after previous treatment with either surgery or collagenase injection. Half
      of the participants will be treated with surgery while the other half will receive
      collagenase injection.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      No definitive cure for Dupuytren disease (DD) currently exists and recurrence of finger
      contractures after treatment is common. Surgical fasciectomy is considered the standard
      treatment method for patients with recurrence. However, the procedure is associated with a
      high incidence of complications. Injection of Collagenase Clostridium Histolyticum into
      Dypuytren cords causing the contracture is a non-surgical treatment for DD and has been shown
      to be a safe and effective method. Most studies regarding collagenase injection have involved
      first-time treatment. Efficacy of collagenase injection in patients with recurrent DD, beyond
      the immediate effect, has not yet been determined. This randomized trial will compare the
      outcome of surgical fasciectomy and collagenase injection in treating patients with finger
      joints contracture due to recurrent DD. The study is a single-center randomized controlled
      trial. Patients referred to an orthopedic department are screened for eligibility. The
      inclusion criteria are recurrence of DD in one or more fingers after previous treatment with
      fasciectomy or collagenase injection, a passive extension deficit ≥30 degrees in the
      metacarpophalangeal (MCP) and/or proximal interphalangeal (PIP) joint in a previously treated
      finger, and a palpable cord believed to cause the recurrent contracture. A total of 56
      patients will be randomized (computer-generated randomization list, stratified according to
      type of previous treatment and affected finger), to either surgical fasciectomy or
      collagenase injection. A blinded hand therapist will measure range of motion (including
      active and passive extension deficit) at baseline and 3 months, 12 months, 24 months and 60
      months after treatment. The primary outcomes are the total active extension deficit (MCP plus
      PIP) at 3 months and the proportion of patients with contracture worsening ≥20 degrees in the
      treated finger joint at 2 years compared to 3 months. The secondary outcomes include total
      passive extension deficit, the 11-item disabilities of the arm, shoulder and hand (QuickDASH)
      score, EuroQol 5-dimensions (EQ-5D) index, cold intolerance symptom severity score, palmar
      pain score, pain visual analog scale (VAS) score, satisfaction VAS score, adverse events and
      costs.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Seeking treatment for recurrence of Dupuytren´s contracture in at least one finger.

          -  Passive extension deficit of 30 degrees or greater in the metacarpophalangeal and/or
             proximal interphalangeal joint in a finger previously treated with surgical
             fasciectomy or collagenase injections.

          -  Palpable cord in the palm and/or affected finger causing the recurrent contracture.

          -  No surgery or collagenase in the finger with recurrent contracture in the past 12
             months.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Medical comorbidities that constitute a contraindication for surgical fasciectomy or
             collagenase injection.

          -  Signs of nerve or vascular injury in the affected finger.

          -  Osteoarthritis in the metacarpophalangeal and/or proximal interphalangeal joint joint
             in the affected finger

          -  Complications after the previous treatment, such as infection or complex regional pain
             syndrome (CRPS).

          -  Previous trauma or other surgery involving the affected finger.

          -  More than 2 previous surgeries or collagenase treatments in the affected finger.

          -  Previous treatment with both fasciectomy and collagenase in the affected finger.

          -  Examining surgeon deems further fasciectomy inappropriate or potentially associated
             with very high complication risk, for example in severe contracture and/or severe
             scarring after the previous surgeries and considers salvage procedures (such as
             amputation) as the more appropriate treatment.
