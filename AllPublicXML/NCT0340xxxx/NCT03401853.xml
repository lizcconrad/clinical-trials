  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well rituximab and pembrolizumab work in treating patients
      with follicular lymphoma or diffuse large B cell lymphoma that has come back or does not
      respond to treatment. Monoclonal antibodies, such as pembrolizumab and rituximab, may
      interfere with the ability of cancer cells to grow and spread.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Overall response rate (ORR) of rituximab and pembrolizumab in relapsed/refractory
      follicular lymphoma (FL).

      II. Overall response rate (ORR) of rituximab and pembrolizumab in relapsed/refractory diffuse
      large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the safety and tolerability of the combination of rituximab and pembrolizumab,
      and of extended pembrolizumab administered for up to 1 year.

      II. To evaluate progression-free survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS) with this
      combination, in relapsed/refractory FL, and relapsed/refractory DLBCL.

      III. To explore treatment outcomes with this combination in patients with rituximab
      refractory FL.

      OUTLINE:

      INDUCTION: Patients receive pembrolizumab intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on day 1.
      Patients also receive rituximab IV on days 1, 8, and 15 of course 1 and on day 1 of course 2.
      Courses repeat every 3 weeks for 4 courses in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      EXTENDED THERAPY: Patients with at least a partial response receive pembrolizumab IV over 30
      minutes on day 1. Courses repeat every 3 weeks for up to 2 years (35 doses) in the absence of
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 90 days.
