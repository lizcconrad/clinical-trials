      This prospective observational study examines the associations of presence, duration, type,
      number and location of surgical drains with the risk of surgical site infections in a
      contemporary and multicentric cohort of general, orthopedic trauma and vascular surgery
      procedures.

    <textblock>
      Surgical site infections (SSI) represent the most common type of nosocomial infection amongst
      surgical patients. They cause morbidity and mortality.

      Surgical Drains are commonly inserted at the end of many surgical procedures. In contrast to
      potential benefits, drains are also thought to potentially serve as a conduit of bacteria
      into the wound and hence may increase the risk of SSI. Patterns of use of drains vary widely
      across surgical disciplines and individual practices. There are no uniform guidelines and
      standards are often rather based on tradition than on evidence. The aim of this large
      prospective study was to examine the association of presence, duration, type, number and
      location of drains with the risk of SSI in a contemporary and multicentric cohort of general,
      orthopedic trauma and vascular surgery procedures.

        This observational study is nested in a multicenter randomized controlled trial that was
        designed to evaluate the optimal timing of surgical antimicrobial prophylaxis in a general,
        orthopedic trauma and vascular surgery population. The term &quot;general surgery&quot; refers to
        gastrointestinal, oncologic breast, endocrine and hernia surgery. The study centers are two
        tertiarry referral hospitals in Switzerland. All patients included in the randomized
        controlled trial are included in this observational study as well.
