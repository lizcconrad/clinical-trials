  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a novel preliminary study of biomarkers of pathologic pre-operative pulmonary
      vascular development, elevated pre-operative Pulmonary Vascular Resistance Index (PVRi), and
      complications associated with decreased post-operative pulmonary blood flow in single
      ventricle patients undergoing superior cavo-pulmonary anastomosis (SCPA). The study will
      utilize a combined targeted and untargeted approach to both optimize translation of a
      promising existing biomarker and efficiently identify novel biomarkers and potential
      therapeutic targets in this population.

      Overall Hypothesis: Endothelin-1 (ET1) and associated dysregulation of key metabolic pathways
      decrease pre-operative pulmonary blood vessel development and increase post-operative
      pulmonary blood vessel resistance leading to decreased pulmonary blood flow in patients
      undergoing SCPA.

      For enrolled patients, collected data will include:

        -  3 mL blood sample (x2) at pre-SCPA catheterization.

        -  3 mL blood samples at 2, 24, and 48 hours post-operative.

        -  Urine sample pre-operatively and post-operatively

        -  Collection of otherwise-discarded operative tissue sample from the pulmonary artery.

        -  Collection of clinical data, demographic data, and results of routine, post-operative
           hemodynamic monitoring.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Congenital heart disease patients undergoing catheterization for pre-SPCA evaluation
             or undergoing SCPA without plans for cardiac catheterization (utilizing data from a
             previously performed clinical catheterization).

          -  All patients will have age from 31 days to 2 years.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients who will remain post-op with a pulsatile source of pulmonary blood flow in
             addition to the cavo-pulmonary anastomosis (so called &quot;1.5 ventricle&quot; repair) will be
             excluded.

          -  Due to limitations in acceptable sample blood volumes for research, patients with
             weight &lt;4kg will be excluded.

          -  Patients will not be excluded on the basis of gender, ethnicity, genetic diagnosis,
             gestational age at birth, non-cardiac comorbidity, or pre-operative medication
             regimen.
