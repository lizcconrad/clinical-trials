    <description>During this study, the prescribed dose shall be administered according to the dose escalation shown in the table, starting with dose level 1. The carbon ion dose shall be gradually escalated while gradually reducing the dose of photons until eventually administering a full dose of 56 GyE/14 Fx carbon ions (fractional dose of 4 GyE). Dose escalation will be performed in parallel for two patient groups: patients whose pancreatic tumors are greater than 5 mm from the duodenum (Group A) and those whose tumors are within 5 mm of the duodenum (Group B). Enrolled patients will be monitored for 90 days after radiotherapy starts for any acute toxic reaction and to explore the maximum tolerated dose, in addition to being observed for any related long-term toxic reactions in accordance with the protocol.</description>
