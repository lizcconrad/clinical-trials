  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Children with Cerebral Palsy (CP) present limited performance of functional activities and
      activities of daily life. Kinesio taping has been definied as a promising technique for
      children with CP ans has been extensively used in clinical practice. However, several studies
      have found a low level of evidence of its effectiveness in healthy individuals. We aim to
      evaluate the effects of the immediate application of Kinesio taping on the activation of the
      rectus femoris and anterior tibialis muscles and on the duration of sit-to-stand movement in
      children with CP.

    <description>An electromyography analysis was performed to evaluate the rectus femoris and tibialis anterior activity during the sit-to-stand movement and the five time sit-to-stand test. Electrodes were placed in both lower limbs. Mean root mean square (mRMS) values were used for statistical analysis. Mean root mean square values were normalized by the maximum value of each trial and individual.</description>

    <time_frame>on the day of evaluation</time_frame>
    <description>Children were seated with hip, knee and ankle flexed at 90°. Both feet were symmetrically positioned shoulder width apart and arms were crossed over the chest. Children should get up from the seat after the verbal command of the evaluator. Children performed the sit-to-stand movement at a speed that simulated the one usually adopted in daily routine</description>

    <measure>Time to perform five time sit-to-stand test</measure>
    <time_frame>on the day of evaluation</time_frame>
    <description>Children had to get up and sit down five times as fast as possible. The instructions before starting the test were: &quot;Stand up and sit down as quickly as possible for 5 times. The test will be finished when you return to the seated position the 5th time. Continue the sit-to-stand movement until I ask you to stop. If you try but cannot stand up, just let me know. Ready? go!&quot;</description>

    <description>An experienced physiotherapist placed the base of the Kinesio taping strip, over rectus femoris muscle, 3cm bellow the anterior iliac spine, without tension. From this point, the Kinesio taping was placed up to the upper edge of the patella and stretched to 100% tension. It was, then, bi-sectioned, circled the patella and ended in the tuberosity of the femur, without tension. In order to avoid interference in the electromyography signals, a section was held at Kinesio taping at the point where the electrode was placed.</description>
