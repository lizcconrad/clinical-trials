  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The mechanisms behind heart failure are largely unknown. Despite an increasing arsenal of
      pharmacological therapies, cardiovascular disease is still the most common cause of death in
      the western world, which demonstrates a pronounced need for more patient-related mechanistic
      research. Cachexia and limited exercise capacity are the symptoms that best match prediction
      of heart failure, both of which are symptoms involving a dysfunctional skeletal muscle. An
      increased understanding of the mechanisms and signaling pathways connects the failure heart
      with skeletal muscle dysfunction is likely to lead both to discoveries of prognostic factors
      and possible therapeutic options.

      The study is a prospective, non-blinded, study. The study will consist of the assignment of
      patients with heart failure, New York Heart Association (NYHA) III-IV, 60-80 years old. One
      hundred (100) patients will be enrolled in this study.

      The primary objective is to investigate how changes in the skeletal muscle coincide with
      changes in physical performance, cardiac function, and prognosis in patients with heart
      failure, and changes over time. Therefore, the investigators will investigate patients with
      severe heart failure at 'baseline' and on a second follow-up occasion after 24 months.

      The secondary and tertiary objective is to investigate how changes in the metabolic signature
      of blood and satellite cells coincide with changes in physical performance, cardiac function,
      and prognosis in patients with heart failure, and changes over time. Patient recruitment is
      expected to occur over 36 months.

      The study will be conducted in Sweden at Karolinska University Hospital, Huddinge.
