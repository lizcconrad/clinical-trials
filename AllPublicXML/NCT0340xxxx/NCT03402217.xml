      This study will evaluate a smart phone-based application (&quot;app&quot;) designed to inform pregnant
      women ages 15-25 about their contraception options. The goal of this research will be to
      evaluate the usability, feasibility and acceptability of this app. Participants will be asked
      to complete a survey after informed consent and before using the app. After using the app,
      participants will complete a second survey. This second survey will ask questions about the
      app including the following topics: Usability, user-friendliness, navigation, user interface,
      time spent, organization readability; Feasibility, informative, helpful, comprehensible,
      quality of art, interface, sound; and Acceptability breadth of content, depth of content,
      engaging and motivating, Innovative utility and value. Women will also rate the degree to
      which they promote use of the product: would use the app if available, believe the app will
      support contraceptive use and would recommend the app to peers. Study participation will end
      once participants are done with the second survey.
