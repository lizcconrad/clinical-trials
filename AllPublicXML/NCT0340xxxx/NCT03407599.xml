  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is done to compare how faster aspart is taken up, broken down and removed from the
      body between different age groups (children [6-11 years], adolescents [12-17 years] and
      adults [18-64 years]) who have diabetes. The blood sugar (glucose) lowering effect of faster
      aspart will also be investigated after consuming a meal replacement drink. The effects of
      faster aspart will be compared to the effects of NovoRapid®.
