  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      As a subtype of major depressive disorder, seasonal affective disorder (SAD) or winter
      depression causes severe reductions in both quality of life and productivity and results in
      high morbidity and frequent sick leave (1). SAD is a prevalent disorder with rates as high as
      3-5% in central European countries and 8-10% in Scandinavian countries. In our recent
      screening survey among persons with severe visual impairment or blindness (visual acuity &lt;
      6/60), we found a strikingly high prevalence of SAD of 17 % compared to 8% in the fully
      sighted control group. Persons with maintained light perception had a highly increased SAD
      prevalence of 18 % whereas no light perception (NLP) respondents had an SAD prevalence of 13
      %. Light is unquestionably of great importance in the development and treatment of SAD. It is
      suggested that a reduced retinal sensitivity to light leads to sub-threshold light input to
      the brain and consequently to the development of SAD. The novel retinal non-visual
      photoreceptors, the intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells (ipRGCs), are
      involved in the regulation of circadian rhythm and mood and their function are in part
      independent of the function of the classical rod and cone photoreceptors which form the basis
      of conscious visual perception. Function of the ipRGCs can be assessed by chromatic
      pupillometry where the sustained pupillary contractions following blue light stimulation
      (PIPR) is the main outcome. In persons with SAD without eye disorder the function of the
      ipRGCs is reduced. We here wish to investigate associations between ipRGC function and SAD
      symptoms, circadian profile and treatment response to light therapy in persons with visual
      impairment.

      Persons with visual impairment (SAD and non-SAD) are assessed for ipRGC function with
      chromatic pupillometry, for seasonal mood variation by interview and questionnaire and for
      diurnal melatonin secretion by saliva analysis summer and winter. In winter SAD participants
      are treated with daily morning bright light for 6 weeks. Reduction in depression scores and
      tolerability is recorded.
