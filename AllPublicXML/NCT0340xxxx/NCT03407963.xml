    <textblock>
      The authors hypothesize that, in patients with low volume tumors identified according to
      anatomo-pathological criteria and imaging, and under active surveillance focal, therapy by
      unilateral embolization of prostatic arteries will provide local control of the tumor via
      selective ischemia

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  The patient must have given their free and informed consent and signed the consent
             form

          -  The patient must be a member or beneficiary of a health insurance plan

          -  The patient is between 18 and 80 years old

          -  Patient has unilateral prostate cancer, stage TNM&lt;T2b with an MRI PiRAds target ≥ 3 in
             concordance with biopsy result

          -  Biopsy gives a Gleason score ≤ 6 with more than 3 positive biopsies per lob and at
             least 50% the length of the positive biopsy; patients over 70 years old with a Gleason
             score = 7 (3+4) can be included

          -  Patient has a life expectancy of over 10 years

          -  PSA &lt;10ng/ml; patients with a large prostatic volume and PSA ≥ 10ng/ml can be included
             according to doctor discretion.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  The subject is participating in an interventional study, or is in a period of
             exclusion determined by a previous study

          -  The subject refuses to sign the consent

          -  It is impossible to give the subject informed information

          -  The patient is under safeguard of justice or state guardianship

          -  Patient unresponsive to active surveillance

          -  Patient refusing active surveillance

          -  Patients in a state unfit to express personal consent cannot be solicited (eg patients
             undergoing psychiatric treatment with mental difficulties rendering consent
             impossible)

          -  Contraindication for MRI (pacemaker incompatible with MRI, claustrophobia, metal
             device, prosthetic hip replacement)

          -  Patient with hemostasis disorder.

          -  Cancer in both prostate lobes
