  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to demonstrate efficacy and safety of self-titration algorithm with
      Gla-300 using the INSIGHT algorithm (once daily by 1 unit) and the EDITION algorithm (once
      weekly by 3 units) in Korean patients with T2D.

    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to obtain efficacy and safety descriptive data on two
      different titration algorithms: the INSIGHT titration algorithm (self-titration of 1
      unit/day) and the EDITION trial algorithm with insulin glargine 300 units/mL (GLA-300) when
      given as basal insulin in uncontrolled T2DM patients on basal insulin with or without
      non-insulin anti-hyperglycemic agent (NIAHA) or in insulin naïve patients.

      In a Korean, single-center, type 2 diabetes patients with basal insulin therapy will be
      enrolled. They will be randomly assigned to either titration algorithm for GLA-300. After 12
      weeks, the glycemic control, patients' satisfaction to the titration methods and healthcare
      providers' satisfaction to titration methods will be assessed.

    <description>In group 1, the dose of Gla-300 will be titrated by the patients by 1 unit per day until achieving a fasting SMPG in the target range of 4.4 to 5.6 mmol/L (INSIGHT algorithm).
Titration algorithms:
Patients will be instructed to daily adjust their dose of Gla-300 based on fasting SMPG values. Fasting SMPG will be measured daily by the patient before breakfast and any intake of antihyperglycemic agents.
Fasting SMPG in the range of
≥ 5.6 mmol/L, increase 1 unit of Gla-300 dose
&gt; 4.4 and ≤ 5.6 mmol/L, no change
&lt; 4.4 mmol/L, reduce 1 unit of Gla-300 dose</description>

    <description>In group 2, the dose of Gla-300 will be titrated by the patients based on the SMPG values of the last 3 days at least weekly, but no more often than every 3 days to achieve a fasting SMPG in the target range of 4.4 to 5.6 mmol/L (EDITION algorithm).
Fasting SMPG (median of the last 3 days including current day) in the range of
≥ 7.8 mmol/L, increase 6 units of Gla-300 dose
&gt; 5.6 and &lt; 7.8 mmol/L, increase 3 units of Gla-300 dose

&lt; 3.3 mmol/L or occurrence of ≥ 2 symptomatic or 1 severe hypoglycemic episode in the preceding week, reduce 3 units of Gla-300 dose or at the discretion of the investigator</description>
