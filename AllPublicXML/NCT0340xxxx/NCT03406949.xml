  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK)
      pharmacodynamics and preliminary antitumor activity of MGD009 administered in combination
      with MGA012 in patients with B7-H3- expressing tumors.

      This study is a Phase 1, open-label, dose escalation, and cohort expansion study designed to
      characterize the safety, tolerability, PK, pharmacodynamics, immunogenicity, and preliminary
      antitumor activity of the combination of MGD009 and MGA012, each of which is administered by
      IV infusion.The study consists of a Dose Escalation Phase to determine the Maximum Tolerated
      Dose (MTD) or Maximum Administered Dose (MAD) (if no MTD is defined) of the combination,
      followed by a Cohort Expansion Phase to further define the safety and initial antitumor
      activity of the combination with the doses established in the Dose Escalation Phase. Patients
      with B7-H3-expressing unresectable, locally advanced, or metastatic solid tumors of any
      histology will be enrolled in the Dose Escalation Phase. Following the establishment of an
      MTD, additional patients with specific tumor types will enroll in the Cohort Expansion Phase.

          -  Histologically-proven, unresectable locally advanced or metastatic solid tumors of any
             histology that test positive for B7-H3 expression on tumor cells or vasculature for
             whom no approved therapy with demonstrated clinical benefit is available. For all
             tumor types, the requirement for previous systemic therapy may be waived if a patient
             was intolerant of or refused standard first-line therapy

          -  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 or 1

          -  Life expectancy ≥ 12 weeks

          -  Measurable disease, with the exception of prostate cancer

          -  Tissue specimen available for B7-H3 and PD-L1 expression testing

             PD-L1, anti-PD-1, anti-CTLA-4) prior to enrollment must have toxicities related to the
             checkpoint inhibitor resolved to ≤ Grade 1 or baseline (prior to the checkpoint
             inhibitor) to be eligible for enrollment. Patients who experienced previous
             hypothyroidism toxicity on a checkpoint inhibitor are eligible to enter study
             regardless of Grade resolution as long as the patient is well controlled on thyroid
             replacement hormones.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with history of prior central nervous system (CNS) metastasis must have been
             treated, must be asymptomatic, and must not have any of the following at the time of
             enrollment:

               1. No concurrent treatment for the CNS disease (e.g. surgery, radiation,
                  corticosteroids &gt;10 mg prednisone/day or equivalent)

               2. No progression of CNS metastases on MRI or CT for at least 14 days after last day
                  of prior therapy for the CNS metastases

               3. No concurrent leptomeningeal disease or cord compression

          -  Patients with any history of known or suspected autoimmune disease with the specific
             exceptions of vitiligo, resolved childhood atopic dermatitis, psoriasis not requiring
             systemic treatment (within the past 2 years), and patients with a history of Grave's
             disease that are now euthyroid clinically and by laboratory testing

          -  Treatment with any, investigational therapy within the 4 weeks prior to the initiation
             of study drug administration

          -  Treatment with any systemic chemotherapy within 3 weeks

          -  Treatment with radiation therapy within 2 weeks

          -  Treatment with systemic corticosteroids (&gt; 10 mg per day prednisone or equivalent) or
             other immune suppressive drugs within 2 weeks

          -  Clinically significant cardiovascular or pulmonary disease

          -  Evidence of active viral, bacterial, or systemic fungal infection requiring parenteral
             treatment within 7 days prior to the initiation of study drug. Patients requiring any
             systemic antiviral, antifungal, or antibacterial therapy for active infection must
             have completed treatment no less than one week prior to the initiation of study drug.

          -  Known history of positive testing for human immunodeficiency virus or history of
             acquired immune deficiency syndrome

          -  Known history of hepatitis B or hepatitis C infection or known positive test for
             hepatitis B surface antigen, hepatitis B core antigen, or hepatitis C polymerase chain
             reaction
