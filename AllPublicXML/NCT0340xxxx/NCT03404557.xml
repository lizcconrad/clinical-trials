  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The M2iSH laboratory showed with two previous clinical trials that Crohn's Disease (CD)
      macrophages present i) a defect to control Adherent-Invasive Escherichia coli (AIEC)
      infection related to polymorphisms associated with CD; ii) a CD - specific cytokine secretion
      profile after an AIEC infection and intestinal inflammation dependent; iii) a modification of
      the response of CD macrophages at a basal state and after the AIEC infection. These results
      consolidate the hypothesis of a defect specific to CD macrophages.

      That's why, the primary purpose of this study is to realize a proteomic analysis of
      macrophages of CD patients infected or not with AIEC and to compare them to Ulcerative
      Colitis (UC) patients and healthy volunteers.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The macrophages characterization will be realized at a basal state and in response or not to
      AIEC.

      Investigator aimed to 1) better understand the differences between macrophages of CD
      patients, UC patients and healthy volunteers but also the impact of AIEC infection on these
      macrophages to provide key informations to detect and characterize the defect of these
      macrophages; 2) highlight one or several protein in CD macrophages that could represent, in a
      long term, a potential therapeutic target of CD.
