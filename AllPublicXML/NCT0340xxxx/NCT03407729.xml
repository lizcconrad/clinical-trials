  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This observational study will investigate whether differences in birth events and oxygen
      levels during the newborn period affects the brain activity of children during the middle
      childhood years.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators will conduct an observational study comparing two groups of children to
      determine whether differences in birth events and oxygen levels during the newborn period
      lead to structural and functional impairment within the brain's dopaminergic pathways and the
      cortical regions innervated by those pathways. The dopaminergic system is involved in
      modulating motor control and cognitive function.

      Using magnetic resonance diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), structural integrity of dopaminergic
      circuits will be quantified and compared in post-hypoxic former preterm children versus
      healthy control children born at term closely matched by age/sex/race.

      Functional activity during executive function tasks will be quantified and compared in
      post-hypoxic former preterm children versus healthy control children born at term using
      functional magnetic resonance imaging-blood oxygen level dependent (fMRI-BOLD) with high
      density electroencephalography (HD-EEG). Assessment of motor function (grooved pegboard task)
      will also be performed.

        Study Group Children (n=20) will be drawn from a cohort currently maintained by the
        investigators.

        Healthy Control Children will be recruited using various strategies: (1) study flyers given
        to the parents of the prematurely born cohort children to pass along to parents of other
        children with ages similar to their own child. (2) study flyers posted in the hospital's
        primary care pediatric clinics asking interested children/families to contact us to learn
        more about the study; (3) study flyers distributed by professional colleagues/pediatric
        physicians to potential candidate children/families meeting study inclusion criteria.
