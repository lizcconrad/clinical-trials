    <textblock>
      The non-fluent/agrammatic (nfvPPA) and the logopenic (lvPPA) variants of Primary progressive
      aphasia are neurodegenerative diseases characterized by progressive word-finding difficulties
      and effortful speech. Efforts to slow or halt this progression have been largely
      unsuccessful. As such, there is a desperate need for novel treatment strategies in PPA.

      Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is a safe, non-invasive way of
      stimulating cortical targets in a focal and reproducible manner. Therapeutic benefits from
      rTMS have been demonstrated when it is applied in many sequential sessions. For example,
      repeated sessions of rTMS to left dlPFC is an FDA approved treatment for major depressive
      disorder. With respect to language, high frequency (rTMS) increases the response rate for
      picture naming in healthy individuals. rTMS has also been shown to improve the number of
      correct naming responses in patients with Alzheimer's disease. Further, in a sham controlled
      study, Cotelli and colleagues demonstrated that in a group of 10 nfvPPA patients high
      frequency rTMS over the left and right dlPFC during object and action naming tasks improved
      the percent of correct responses for action, but not object naming. Finally, in a sham
      controlled single case study, Finocchiaro et al. applied high frequency rTMS to the left
      inferior mid-frontal gyrus for 3 sessions consisting of five consecutive days (treatment or
      sham). They found a significant and lasting improvement in the patient's performance on verb
      production when comparing active rTMS to sham rTMS or baseline. These studies have
      contributed valuable insights into the potential use of rTMS in treating the language
      symptoms of PPA patients.

    <textblock>
      We hope to recruit 15-20 patients with a confirmed diagnosis of either nfvPPA or lvPPA (made
      by a specialized clinician). Patients must have a mild to moderate language impairment and
      must be native English speakers. Exclusion criteria include contraindications to receiving
      MRI scanning or rTMS (e.g. metallic or electromagnetically activated implants, cranial mass
      lesions, surgical aneurysm clips), the presence of significant medical, neurological or
      psychiatric co-morbid symptoms and patients without study partners It will take approximately
      30 weeks to complete this research study, but the exact timing will vary according to
      patient, investigator and equipment availability. Each patient will have a total of up to 40
      study visits, but most commonly 33 visits. Greater than 33 visits will take place in the
      event that patients' language improves significantly following rTMS in order to test the
      sustainability of the improvement. Visits will take place at the MGH Martinos Center for
      Biomedical Imaging.

      The first visit (lasting 3-4 hours) will include obtainment of informed consent, baseline
      assessments, and a baseline fMRI scan (which will be used for subsequent rTMS targeting).
      After this, PPA patients will return for four blocks of 20Hz rTMS to left dlpfc: two in which
      they receive active rTMS and two in which they receive sham rTMS. The following order will be
      used in all patients: sham-active-sham-active. During each block rTMS (active or sham) will
      be administered daily for 5 days (Monday through Friday). These visits will last 1 to 1.5
      hours each.

      Up to five language assessment visits will be performed following each block of rTMS.
      Typically, there will be three of these assessments, but in cases where there is improvement
      in language function after rTMS, patients may have up to five post-rTMS visits. These visits
      will be spread apart by approximately 15 days. During the first of these visits an fMRI will
      be performed to probe changes induced by rTMS. Scanning will include both resting-state and
      task fMRI acquisitions. It is estimated that these visits will last approximately 3-4 hours
      each.
