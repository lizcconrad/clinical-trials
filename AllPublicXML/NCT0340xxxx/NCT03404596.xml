      The purpose of this study is to better understand what happens when someone attempts to quit
      smoking.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Investigators will provide participants with nicotine patches, smoking cessation treatment
      that will include brief counseling sessions (10-15 minutes each), and text messages sent to
      their provided study phone throughout the day. These messages will be short (1-3 minutes
      long) and will ask participants to do things like focus on the present moment, pay attention
      to their breathing, and be aware of their current thoughts. Participants will be asked to
      wear equipment throughout the day that will measure their physiology and smoking behavior.
      Mobile Health (mHealth) is a general term for the use of mobile phones and other wireless
      technology in medical care.

      The key outcome and hypothesized mechanisms (i.e., lapse and stress) will be measured
      objectively and automatically using AutoSense. AutoSense is a type of human sensing
      technology that allows investigators to detect smoking behavior and stress objectively
      through a chest strap and wrist bands worn by participants. Ecological momentary assessment
      (EMA) will assess acute precipitants such as negative affect, craving, self-efficacy,
      motivation, alcohol consumption, etc. Questionnaires will assess other predictors and
      mechanisms.

    <description>Ecological momentary assessment (EMA) assesses participants' moment-to-moment subjective experiences via self-report assessments on a smart phone. Participants will receive mindfulness strategies for 10 days pre- and post-quit via smart phone to aid in their cessation attempt. Text messages will be sent to provided study phones throughout the day. These messages will be short (1-3 minutes long) and will ask participants to do things like focus on the present moment, pay attention to their breathing, and be aware of their current thoughts.</description>
