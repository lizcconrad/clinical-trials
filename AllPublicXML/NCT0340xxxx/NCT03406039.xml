  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Considering the high comorbidity between alcohol use disorders and emotional problems, there
      is currently a need for accessible, integrated treatments designed to target both disorders
      simultaneously. Evidence suggests that the combined use of Cognitive Behavioural Therapy
      (CBT) and Motivational Interviewing (MI) may be effective at reducing the combined symptoms
      of the two disorders. However, much of the empirical work has focused on testing the
      usefulness of CBT/MI for alcohol misuse and comorbid depression, and the majority of these
      studies involve in-person treatment. Therefore, additional empirical research is required to
      determine the efficacy of combined CBT and MI for alcohol use and both anxiety and depression
      using an online intervention. This may help inform future treatments in this domain, and
      potentially be able to inform the development of online, accessible interventions for this
      population.

      Participants (N = 214) with elevated levels of alcohol use and emotional problems will be
      recruited from Central and Eastern Canada. Participants will be randomly assigned to either
      the treatment group (i.e., combined CBT and MI), or the psycho-educational control group.
      Individuals in the treatment group will be given 8-weeks to work through 12 online modules.
      Throughout the modules, participants will identify goals related to alcohol use and mood,
      learn strategies to cope with alcohol cravings, triggers, and social pressures, and learn how
      to prevent relapse. Modules will also include content designed to target anxiety and
      depression, focusing on strategies designed to help reduce negative thinking and worry,
      increase behavioural activation, and increase self-care (e.g., relaxation techniques, sleep
      hygiene). Participants randomly assigned to the control (i.e., psycho-education) condition
      will receive links to websites that provide general psychoeducation about alcohol and mental
      illness. All participants will complete online assessment measures at baseline, at the end of
      treatment, and at follow-up approximately 4 months later) in order to assess the efficacy of
      the treatment. At the end of the study, individuals in the control group will be given full
      access to the treatment.

    <measure>Change in Alcohol Use</measure>
    <time_frame>Participants will be assessed using the TLFB at three time points: at baseline (i.e., prior to treatment; T0), immediately following the 8-week treatment (T1), and at follow-up (i.e., 24 weeks from baseline, 16 weeks from end of treatment, T2).</time_frame>
    <description>Timeline Follow-Back (TLFB; Sobell &amp; Sobell, 1992) - designed to assess the number of standard drinks consumed during a 30-day period. Participants will be asked to report on the number of drinks consumed daily in the form of a calendar. The TLFB has been shown to provide reliable and valid estimates of alcohol use, and is widely used in basic and treatment studies.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Depression</measure>
    <time_frame>Levels of depression will be assessed at all three time points. T0 - baseline (i.e., 0 days, 0 weeks, 0 months), T1 - end of treatment (i.e., 8 weeks), and T2 - follow up (i.e., 16 weeks from end of treatment).</time_frame>

    <time_frame>Levels of anxiety will be assessed at all three time points. T0 - baseline (i.e., 0 days, 0 weeks, 0 months), T1 - end of treatment (i.e., 8 weeks), and T2 - follow up (i.e., 16 weeks from end of treatment).</time_frame>

    <measure>Clinically Significant and Combined Reduction of Alcohol Use and Comorbid Emotional Problems</measure>
    <time_frame>Combined changes will be assessed at all three time points. T0 - baseline (i.e., 0 days, 0 weeks, 0 months), T1 - end of treatment (i.e., 8 weeks), and T2 - follow up (i.e., 16 weeks from end of treatment).</time_frame>
    <description>We will also use a combined outcome to look clinically significant reductions in alcohol misuse and depression or anxiety. Specifically, a short version of the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT; Saunders et al., 1993, referred to as AUDIT-C) will be used, where falling below 4 for women and 5 for men would reflect that participants are no longer drinking hazardously. Similarly, falling below 16 on the CES-D OR 5 on the GAD-7 would reflect that participants are no longer experiencing moderate emotional symptoms. A binary outcome will be created for participants scoring below the AUDIT-C cut-off AND the cut-off for either depression OR anxiety (coded as 1) versus those scoring above cut-offs (coded as 0).</description>

    <measure>Quality of Life</measure>
    <time_frame>Quality of life will be assessed at all three time points. T0 - baseline (i.e., 0 days, 0 weeks, 0 months), T1 - end of treatment (i.e., 8 weeks), and T2 - follow up (i.e., 16 weeks from end of treatment).</time_frame>

    <description>Participants' use of other drugs in addition to alcohol will also be included as outset continuous moderators and will be assessed using the National Institute on Drug Abuse Alcohol, Smoking, and Substance Involvement Screening Test (NIDA ASSIST; National Institute on Drug Abuse, 2009). Examples of these additional substances include cannabis, cocaine, prescription medication, methamphetamine, and opioids.</description>

    <description>The treatment condition will have access to 12 treatment modules and have 8-weeks to complete them. The content of all modules is derived from Cognitive Behavioural Therapy and Motivational Interviewing. Through module engagement, young adults will identify goals related to alcohol use and mood, learn strategies to cope with alcohol cravings, triggers, and social pressures, and learn how to prevent relapse. There will also be several modules to target anxiety and depression, focusing on strategies designed to help reduce negative thinking and worry, increase behavioural activation, and increase self-care (e.g., sleep hygiene).Participants will have immediate access to all modules, and it will be recommended that they work through the modules sequentially.</description>
