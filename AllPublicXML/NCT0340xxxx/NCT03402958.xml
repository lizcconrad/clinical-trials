  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Osteoporosis is a major public health problem. Its screening and its treatment remain largely
      insufficient while therapies have demonstrated their effectiveness. In the event of a severe
      fracture, the update of the 2016/2017 recommendations, prepared by the Research and
      Information Group on Osteoporosis and the French Rheumatology Society, concerning
      osteoporosis recommends a specific treatment with bisphosphonates as first-line treatment,
      without bone densitometry, regardless of age. The frequency of prescribing anti-osteoporotic
      treatment as an outpatient after a fracture of the upper extremity of the femur is very low
      (2% to 21% according to the studies). The main factors associated with non-prescription found
      are co-morbidities (charlson score&gt; 6), dementia, obesity (BMI&gt; 30), chronic alcoholism, male
      sex, polypharmacy&gt; 4, age. Conversely, the factors associated with prescribing are recurrent
      falls (&gt; 2 / year), a history of osteoporotic fracture, an Iso Resource Group&gt; 3, female sex,
      and corticosteroid therapy.
