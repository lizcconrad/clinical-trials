    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to improve understanding of the pathophysiologic process that
      leads to the development of glaucamotous damage. The mechanism by which vision loss in
      glaucoma occurs is still unknown, but it is clear that increased intraocular pressure (IOP)
      is a major risk factor. It is also thought that the LC is a site of primary damage during
      pathogenesis of the disease. This prospective study with determine the in-vivo mechanical
      response to IOP modulation at the level of the ONH and LC.

      The present study will briefly increase the pressure in eyes of living subjects and examine
      the effect of elevated intraocular pressure on optic nerve topography and position during
      pressure elevation using optical coherence tomography imaging of the posterior eye. Outcome
      measures will include measurements in microns based on these images quantifying the
      deformation of the lamina cribrosa.
