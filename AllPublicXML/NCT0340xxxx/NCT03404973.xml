  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall goal of the Parkland-UT Southwestern Population-based Research Optimizing
      Screening through Personalized Regimens (PROSPR) is to optimize colon cancer screening
      through personalized regimens in our integrated safety-net clinical provider network, which
      serves a large and diverse population of under- and un-insured patients in Dallas.

      Together, three research projects will assess clinic, system, and organizational factors
      associated with over-, under- and guideline-based screening among this important population
      and will compare benefits, harms, and costs of strategies for facilitating optimized
      screening regimens. Our theme of optimizing colorectal cancer screening in a safety-net
      clinical provider network brings together several components. Its focus on colorectal cancer
      (CRC) screening which is important, because CRC is the second cancer killer in the US while
      being the only major cancer for which optimized screening results in primary prevention.
      Despite this strong potential benefit, CRC screening remains suboptimal overall, and
      especially among low-income and minority individuals served by safety-nets. Safety-net
      networks therefore offer tremendous potential for CRC prevention and control, but numerous
      factors at the clinics-, system-, and organization-level influence their ability to provide
      optimized care.

      Each of our Parkland-UT Southwestern Population-based Research Optimizing Screening through
      Personalized Regimens (PROSPR) Center's projects is innovative and addresses the continuum of
      care. Project 1 addresses transitions 1 and 3, employing novel, algorithmically driven tools
      in clinics to determine personalized optimized screening regimens for individual patients and
      track whether each has received the indicated guideline-based screening. Project 2 addresses
      all three transitions through a novel comparative effectiveness study of benefits, risks, and
      costs of two outreach strategies for promoting screening completion and guideline-appropriate
      follow-up. Project 3 addresses transitions 2 and 3 by focusing on organizational culture,
      structure, and protocols, using both quantitative and qualitative methods to elucidate
      factors influencing completion of effective screening processes. Our projects address
      research priorities identified through a recent National Institute of Health (NIH) State of
      the Science Conference, including: implementing interventions proven effective at increasing
      colorectal cancer (CRC) screening (Projects 1 &amp; 2), conducting research to assess
      effectiveness of tailoring programs to match characteristics and preferences of target
      populations (Project 1), implementing systems to ensure follow up of positive CRC screening
      results (Projects 1, 2 &amp; 3), and conducting studies to determine comparative effectiveness of
      CRC screening methods in usual practice (Project 2).
