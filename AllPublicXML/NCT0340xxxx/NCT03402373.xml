  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Carotenoids and polyphenols are assumed to have an active role in skin health. Sources for
      these phytonutrient are fruits and vegetables. They are widely applied as skin protectants,
      and supplementation with carotenoids have shown to protect against erythema caused by
      UV-radiation. UV radiation generates reactive oxygen species in the skin, which induces
      cellular signaling that may impair cell cycle, cell growth, and regeneration or repair
      processes.

      The face holds an integral role in human social communication and how humans are perceived as
      attractive. In addition to structural facial features, studies have shown that skin
      appearance is highly weighed in the perception of beauty and is determined primarily by its
      coloration and surface topography. Aging is caused by two processes, intrinsic and extrinsic.
      The sun is the primary cause of extrinsic aging and has also been shown to alter the normal
      course of intrinsic or natural aging. On the molecular level, various hypotheses have been
      proposed to explain aging, with free radical theory being prominent. The free radical theory
      addresses the concept of intrinsic biological instability of living systems, in which free
      radicals and other reactive oxygen species (ROS) damage biomolecules, and this damage results
      in aging of the skin (as well as other systems).

      The aim of this study is to examine the effects of an oral antioxidant supplement on skin
      aging and skin condition.
