  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      this study evaluates the addition of initial short term NSAID treatment to physiotherapy
      prescribed exercise treatment in patient with early phase tendinopathy. Half of the
      participants will initially receive NSAID (naproxen) for 7 days, while the other half will
      receive a placebo, where after both groups will be subjected to 3 months heavy slow
      resistance training.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      NSAID is effective in short term pain relief in musculoskeletal disorders, but little is
      known about the long-term effect in early phase tendinopathy, when used as a supplement to
      treatment as usual, namely heavy slow resistance training and training load reduction. In
      this study, NSAIDs will be used, which works through COX inhibition, which again inhibits
      Prostaglandins, in this way investigators attempt to dampen the initial inflammation and
      pronounced cell activity that is thought to be present in early phase tendinopathy. With this
      project, it will be attempted to investigate whether initial dampening adds to the effect
      achieved through heavy load resistance training, which is thought to stimulate structural
      repair and regeneration in the tendon, by applying appropriate load to the tendon tissue,
      thereby stimulating the tendon cells to repair and regeneration.
