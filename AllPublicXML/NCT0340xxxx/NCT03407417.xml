  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this proposal is to test the efficacy of a patient-centered, tailored message
      intervention delivered via virtual technology for increasing colorectal cancer (CRC)
      screening within guidelines among racial/ethnic minority and rural patients. This protocol
      focuses on the clinical portion of grant NCI 1RCA207689-01A1

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients (N=3,000) will be recruited via a secure, clinical data warehouse to complete a
      patient-randomized test of the efficacy of the intervention for promoting initial and repeat
      FIT testing. Patients identified as eligible will be contacted through MyChart to test a
      web-based, culturally-sensitive virtual human intervention for CRC screening. The
      web-application will provide information to encourage CRC screening. Therefore, this study is
      a minimal risk study.
