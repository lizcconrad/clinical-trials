  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1b/2a, open-label, multi-center, non-randomized, dose-escalation study of
      PT-112 in combination with the anti-PD-L1 antibody, avelumab, in selected advanced solid
      tumors. The study is to be conducted in two parts: the Dose Escalation Phase of PT-112 within
      the combination and the Dose Confirmation Phase. The Dose Escalation Phase will determine the
      Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) and recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) of PT-112 in the combination
      as avelumab will be administered at a flat dose of 800 mg. The trial will evaluate the PK
      (pharmacokinetic) effects of PT-112 and the safety and tolerability of the combination as
      well as preliminary clinical effects. The Dose Confirmation Phase will consist of two
      additional cohorts in patients with non-small cell lung cancer or urothelial carcinoma who
      will be treated at or below the MTD of PT-112 in the combination.

             / PD-L1-containing checkpoint inhibitor therapy administered as their most recent

             leading to drug discontinuation;

         10. Participation in other studies involving investigational drug(s) within 28 days prior
