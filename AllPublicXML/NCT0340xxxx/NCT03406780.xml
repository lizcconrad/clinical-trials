  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      HOPE-2 is a double-blind clinical trial evaluating the safety and efficacy of a cell therapy
      called CAP-1002 in study participants with Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD). Non-ambulatory
      and ambulatory boys and young men who meet eligibility criteria will be randomly assigned to
      receive either CAP-1002 or placebo every 3 months for a total of 4 doses during a 12-month
      period.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      -  Approximately 84 eligible study participants will be randomized to either CAP-1002 or
           placebo in a 1:1 ratio.

        -  The trial will include visits at Screening, Baseline/Day 1, Week 4, and Months 3, 6, 9,
           and 12 with IV infusions of CAP-1002 or placebo on Day 1 and Months 3, 6, and 9.

        -  Safety evaluations will include adverse events, concomitant medications, physical exam,
           vital signs, 12-lead ECG, and clinical laboratory testing.

        -  Efficacy will be evaluated in the Performance of the Upper Limb, pulmonary function
           testing, North Star Ambulatory Assessment (ambulatory subjects only), strength testing,
           cardiac MRI, and quality of life.

        -  If trial data suggests an appropriate risk/benefit profile of CAP-1002, Capricor, upon
           the recommendation of the Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB), will introduce an
           open-label extension study to offer CAP-1002 to study participants who were randomized
           to placebo and completed all trial visits during the 12-month period.

    <description>The active pharmaceutical ingredient in CAP-1002 is Cardiosphere-Derived Cells (CDCs). CDCs are known to secrete numerous bioactive elements (growth factors, exosomes) which impact the therapeutic benefits of the cell-based therapy. The mechanism of action is the composite ability to be immunomodulatory, anti-fibrotic and regenerative.</description>
