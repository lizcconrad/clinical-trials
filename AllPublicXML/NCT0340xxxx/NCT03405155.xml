    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well nivolumab works in treating patients with stage IIB-IIC
      melanoma that can be removed by surgery. Monoclonal antibodies, such as nivolumab, may
      interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the efficacy nivolumab administered in the adjuvant setting in patients with
      resected stage IIB or stage IIC cutaneous melanoma.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate and estimate the median duration of overall survival (OS) in stage IIB-IIC
      melanoma patients.

      II. To evaluate and estimate the median duration of distant metastases-free survival (DMFS)
      in stage IIB-IIC melanoma patients.

      III. To assess safety and toxicity using Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events
      (CTCAE) version (V)5.

      IV. To assess quality of life using the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Melanoma
      (FACT-M) quality of life instrument.

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess and compare clinical, histological, immunological and molecular panels as
      prognostic and predictive biomarkers.
