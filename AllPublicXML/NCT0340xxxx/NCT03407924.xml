  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to examine the effects of exercise on recovery after traumatic
      brain injury. Investigators will determine if exercise enhances rehabilitation by increasing
      substances (proteins) that can facilitate recovery.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Exercise-based therapies can promote recovery of function and are easily implemented in the
      clinical rehabilitation setting. This study will determine if exercise facilitates recovery
      by improving markers of neuroplasticity and decreasing neuroinflammatory responses. The
      investigators will also determine if variations in genes involved in neuroplasticity, memory
      and inflammation influence the responsiveness to exercise and rehabilitation. Particular
      genetic polymorphisms involved in neuroplasticity and inflammatory responses will be
      evaluated. Recovery will be determined by assessing cognitive function, life quality and
      balance.

    <description>Participants with traumatic brain injury (TBI) that are enrolled in a comprehensive rehabilitation program (R) will be engaged in an aerobic exercise program (AER). These participants will also receive standard rehabilitation which includes exercise within the physical therapy session. Given that the duration of the rehabilitative program is variable the period of AER training will be no less than 4 weeks and will not exceed 30 weeks. Activity levels will be monitored.</description>
