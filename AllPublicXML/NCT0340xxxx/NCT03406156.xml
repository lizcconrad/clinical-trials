    <description>Debulking Period: Obinutuzumab with or without bendamustine (bendamustine administered in participants with high tumor load as described in the protocol) during the debulking period (up to 6 cycles).
Treatment Period: Venetoclax + obinutuzumab regimen initiated when participant achieves low tumor burden during debulking period, or if the participant has not achieved low tumor burden status after 6 cycles of debulking, the participant may proceed to venetoclax per the discretion of the treating provider after discussion with the study physician. During this regimen period, participants to receive obinutuzumab in combination with venetoclax for 5 months then venetoclax therapy alone to continue for a total duration of 52 weeks.</description>
