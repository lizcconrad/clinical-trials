  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Upper extremity allotransplantation is a new procedure which is becoming more common in the
      United States. Ongoing data collection for research purposes is vital to the long-term
      assessment as to the safety of the procedure and accompanying immunosuppression protocol, as
      well as quantifying patient outcomes and changes in quality of life. For these reasons, The
      Johns Hopkins Hand/Arm Transplantation Team is interested in enrolling transplanted patients
      in a follow-up protocol to continue collecting informative data to further the field of
      vascularized composite allotransplantation.

    <description>Questionnaire to asses Physical and instrumental activities for daily living. It contains 8 items that are rated with a summary score from 0 (low functioning) to 8 (high functioning). The scale will vary along a range of levels of competence- without any help, with some help, or does he need someone for the activities.</description>

    <description>The SMFA consists of two sections: 34 questions covering the assessment of the patients function and 12 questions covering how bothered patients are by their symptoms. Each question is scored 1 for no problems/no difficulty/not bothered (depending on the question) to 5 for unable to do a task/symptoms all the time/being greatly bothered.</description>
