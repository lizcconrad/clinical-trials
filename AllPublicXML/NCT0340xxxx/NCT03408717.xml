  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pre-existing pain and severe postoperative pain are predictors of persistent pain after
      surgery, but a complete understanding on the development of persistent pain is still lacking.
      The study aims to identify clinically relevant and genetic risk factors for persistent
      postsurgical pain that can be reliably distinguished statistically.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will focus on: (i) risk factors representing biopsychosocial processes that
      influence chronic pain, such as pain and psychological vulnerability; (ii) genetic factors
      relating to mechanistic pathways to persistent pain generation. Patients will be recruited
      from those undergoing breast cancer surgery at the mentioned site. Pain and anxiety
      assessment will be conducted via visual analogue scoring, mechanical temporal summation
      assessment and a series of questionnaires. After the surgery, all patients will be given
      appropriate analgesia, and the pain score and analgesia usage will be recorded. Phone survey
      will be conducted 4 and 6 months, respectively, after surgery to determine the outcomes.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Postsurgical pain scores in both groups</measure>
    <time_frame>4 months after surgery</time_frame>
    <description>Pain scores (Numeric Rating Scale 0-10) at 4 months follow-up evaluations, Zero being no pain, and 10 being the worst pain possible. The pain scores on surgical site, arm and armpit will be collected respectively.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Pain vulnerability in both groups</measure>
    <time_frame>2 months (Upon recruitment until before surgery)</time_frame>
    <description>Assessment will be done via Pain Catastrophizing Scale (PCS) questionnaire before surgery. Pain catastrophizing refers to the negative thought processes patients have when they are exposed to pain or painful experiences. The PCS is a 13-item scale, with each item rated on a 5-point scale: 0 (Not at all) to 4 (all the time). It is broken into three subscales being magnification (0-12), rumination (0-16), and helplessness (0-24). A higher value in each subscale indicates a higher tendency to that subscale (worse outcome).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Psychological vulnerability in both groups (1)</measure>
    <time_frame>2 months (Upon recruitment until before surgery)</time_frame>
    <description>Assessment will be done via Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) questionnaire before surgery. PSS is a measure of the degree to which situations in one's life are appraised as stressful. PSS is a 10-item scale, and its scoring is obtained by reversing responses (e.g., 0 = 4, 1 = 3, 2 = 2, 3 = 1 &amp; 4 = 0) to the four positively stated items (items 4, 5, 7, &amp; 8) and then summing across all scale items. Scores ranging from 0-13 would be considered low stress, whereas those who scored 27-40 would be considered as having high perceived stress.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Psychological vulnerability in both groups (2)</measure>
    <time_frame>2 months (Upon recruitment until before surgery)</time_frame>
    <description>Assessment will be done via Brief Symptom Inventory-18 (BSI-18) questionnaire before surgery. BSI-18 has been used as a tool for psychological distress and psychiatric disorders especially in oncology populations. It comprises three components: Somatization (0-24), depression (0-24) and anxiety (0-24). The respondent's overall level of psychological distress is measured by Global Severity Index (GSI), which is the total summed score of BSI-18 (0-72). A higher value in each subscale indicates a higher tendency to that subscale (worse outcome).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Mechanical Temporal Summation as measured by von Frey filament in both groups</measure>
    <time_frame>2 months (Upon recruitment until before surgery)</time_frame>
    <description>Assessment will be done via Mechanical Temporal Summation assessment before surgery. A 180 gram von Frey filament is applied on the subject's forearm. Patient will then be asked to rate the pinprick pain score on a verbal rating scale, 0-100. Following this, 10 consecutive touches at random locations are applied with a 1 second interstimulus interval and within a 1 cm diameter circle. The patient will then be asked to rate the 10th pain score (0-100). The Mechanical Temporal Summation Score is obtained by the difference between the 11th pain score and the 1st pain score. If the score is greater than zero, the patient is implied to have presence of Mechanical Temporal Summation.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Pain threshold as measured via algometer in both groups</measure>
    <time_frame>2 months (Upon recruitment until before surgery)</time_frame>
    <description>Assessment will be done via algometer testing before surgery. Pressure is applied 90 degree straight down force on the subject's right/left centre of the trapezius muscle using an algometer, with a speed of pressure ~ 1kgf/s. The above procedure is then repeated 3 times at each site (left/right) which is indicated on the pressure mark with each time having the reading recorded. When patient shows no response â‰¥ 6kgf, the threshold is recorded as 6kgf. The patient upon feeling pain will say stop or raise the hand to terminate the test. The mean value is obtained by averaging the readings and will then be recorded as the threshold estimate.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Postsurgical pain scores in both groups</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months after surgery</time_frame>
    <description>Pain scores (Numeric Rating Scale 0-10) at 6 months follow-up evaluations, Zero being no pain, and 10 being the worst pain possible. The pain scores on surgical site, arm and armpit will be collected respectively.</description>

      DNA will be extracted from venous blood using the Puregene method at the Research Laboratory
      of the mentioned site. Known functional polymorphisms in Catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT),
      Calcium channel, voltage-dependent, gamma subunit (CACNG2) and Sodium Voltage-Gated Channel
      Alpha Subunit 9 (SCN9A) gene with evidence of associations with depression, pain, stress and
      anxiety would be determined by the Taqman allelic discrimination assay method. Alleles will
      be called using the software. Genetic data will be analyzed for association with the presence
      of persistent pain.
