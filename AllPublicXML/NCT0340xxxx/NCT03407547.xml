  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This clinical study is organized for people with stroke often experience difficulties with
      their sensation in their upper limb. New technologies may be able to help these important
      problems. However, there is currently not enough knowledge about how the brain recovers in
      people with sensory impairments in their arm and hand. Using a non-invasive technique of
      recording brain activity, known as electroencephalography (EEG), brain activity in
      combination with somatosensation of the hand will be measured. Therefore, the purpose of this
      study will be to analyse brain activity in relation to somatosensory impairments after stroke
      during the first two weeks after stroke.

        Participants will be recruited during the first 2-3 days post-stroke. They should have:

          1. a first-ever unilateral, supra-tentorial stroke, as defined by Wold Health
             Organisation;

          2. admission to the acute hospital,

          3. deficit in distal pinprick somatosensory measured by Rivermead assessment of
             somatosensory performance (score of ≤4) and/or motor impairment measured by Fugl Meyer
             Assessment (score of ≤12 out of 14),

          4. the age of &gt; 18 years and

          5. the ability to provide informed consent.

        Healthy adults will also be recruited and they should have:

          1. no history of sensory impairments in their hands

          2. the age of &gt; 18 years and

          3. the ability to provide informed consent.
