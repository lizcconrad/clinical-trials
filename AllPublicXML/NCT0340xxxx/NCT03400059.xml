  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The efficacy of intranasal kinetic oscillation stimulation using the Chordate System S211 as
      a preventative treatment will be examined in patients diagnosed with chronic migraine. The
      medical device system will be applied in 6 treatments at weekly intervals. The study will
      examine the effects on monthly headache days with moderate to severe intensity.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, multicenter clinical investigation of
      a medical device. The study consists of a 4-week screening period, a 6-week treatment period
      (2 weeks run-in and a 4-week observation window to assess the treatment effect), and a 4-week
      follow-up period.

      The study primarily aims at evaluating the effect of intranasal kinetic oscillation
      stimulation using the Chordate System S211 as a preventative treatment on monthly headache
      days with moderate to severe intensity.

             informed consent;

          3. Diagnosed as suffering from chronic migraine with or without aura (≥15 headache days
             per month for more than 3 months before screening including at least 8 migraine days)
             according to the IHS classification (International Classification of Headache
             Disorders [ICHD]-III beta);

          4. Migraine onset before the age of 60 years;

          5. Reported history of migraine for at least 1 year before screening;

          6. Reported stable prophylactic migraine medication regimen, if any, during the 3 months
             prior to screening;

          7. Able and willing to maintain current prophylactic migraine medication regimen (no
             change in type, frequency or dose) from screening to end of follow-up;

          8. Women of childbearing potential must be willing to use highly effective contraceptive
             methods (failure rate &lt;1% per year when used consistently and correctly) during the
             study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Unable to distinguish between migraine headaches and other headache types;

          2. Treatment with Botox in the head/neck area within 4 months of the screening visit, or
             planned Botox treatment during the study;

          3. Previous or ongoing treatment with an implanted stimulator or other implanted device
             in the head and/or neck;

          4. Known pronounced anterior septal deviation, or other known relevant abnormality in the
             nasal cavity, including bacterial infection and wounds;

          5. History of relevant sinus surgery, transsphenoidal surgery for pituitary or other
             lesions or cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) rhinorrhea;

          6. Fitted with a pacemaker/defibrillator;

          7. Previously treated with therapeutic x-ray intervention in the facial region (that
             could have influenced the nasal mucosa);

          8. Ongoing upper respiratory infection or malignancy in the nasal cavity;

          9. History of regular nose bleeding (epistaxis), or concomitant condition or medication
             that could cause excessive bleeding including treatment with an anticoagulant;

         10. Head injury or open wound that contraindicates use of the Chordate Headband;

         12. Concurrent condition or risk of non-compliance that, in the investigator's opinion,
             may affect the interpretation of performance or safety data or which otherwise
             contraindicates participation in a clinical investigation;

         13. Pregnant and lactating women;

         14. Participation in a clinical investigation within 3 months of enrolment or planned
             participation at any time during this clinical investigation;
