      Background:

      When people see and hear, the brain changes signals from the eyes and ears into perceptions
      and thoughts. No one fully understands how this happens. Researchers want to explore how
      healthy brains process sights and sounds.

      Objectives:

      To explore how people understand what they see and hear when the brain processes sights and
      sounds.

      Eligibility:

      Adults ages 18 65 who have at least 20/40 vision in at least one eye and do not use a hearing
      aid.

      Design:

      Some participants will take tests online anonymously. They will do computer tasks related to
      colors and behavior.

      In-person participants will be screened with medical history and physical exam. They will
      complete questionnaires and vision and hearing tests.

      Participants will plan how many testing sessions they will have and when. Sessions last 2 5
      hours. They may include:

      Magnetic Resonance Imaging: Magnets and radio waves to take pictures of the brain.
      Participants will lie on a table that slides in and out of a tube. They will do a task during
      the scan.

      Magnetoencephalography: Records magnetic field changes from brain activity. Participants will
      sit or lie down. A cone will be lowered onto their head. They may do a task during the test.

      Electromyography: Electrodes attached to the skin will measure the electrical activity of
      muscles.

      Electroencephalogram: Electrodes on the scalp will record brain waves.

      Electrocardiography: Electrodes on the chest will record heart electrical activity.

      Tests of memory, attention, thinking, vision, and hearing.

      Eye Tracking: Cameras will follow participants eye movements. They may wear a cap with
      infrared cameras in front of their eyes.

      During the sessions, participants vital signs may be monitored.

      Objective:

      The experiments covered by this protocol aim to uncover basic knowledge about the normal
      brain mechanisms that give rise to perception and cognition. The protocol encompasses
      sub-studies in healthy volunteers ( participants ) to uncover behaviors and their
      physiological basis. The protocol includes only non-invasive techniques with minimal risk,
      including psychophysics, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), magnetoencephalography
      (MEG), and on-line tests using Amazon s Mechanical Turk (MTurk). We will conduct:

        1. Pilot-phase sub-studies: The goal of these hypothesis-generating sub-studies is to
           obtain enough information to generate specific testable hypotheses. This list will be
           updated at the time of Continuing Review (CR) to inform the IRB which sub-studies have
           been conducted to date. The hypothesis-generating sub-studies will:

             1. be exploratory in nature using only non-invasive methods such as: MRI, MEG and
                behavioral tasks

             2. attempt to obtain sufficient information to generate a power analysis; In general,
                it is anticipated that two to five subjects will be initially tested. Following
                this initial phase, an additional 10-25 subjects will be recruited. It is
                anticipated that 12-25 subjects will be recruited for each sub-study.

        2. Hypothesis-testing sub-studies conducted in-lab. Prior to transitioning to a
           hypothesis-testing sub-study, the protocol will be amended to obtain prospective IRB
           approval. In these sub-studies, we will test a specific hypothesis that can be completed
           with a defined number of healthy participants. The number of participants required for
           each sub-study will be determined by power analysis. A statistical plan will be
           submitted for prospective IRB approval for each hypothesis-testing sub-study.
           Hypothesis-testing sub-studies will undergo regular statistical review. Data quality
           assessment will be done after each testing session. In the event of subject dropout or
           unsuccessful recording, a replacement participant will be recruited.

        3. Sub-studies conducted on-line. We will conduct tests using MTurk. Subjects will be
           recruited anonymously and compensated through payments we make to Amazon. For pilot
           MTurk sub-studies, statistical tests will be conducted when 50 or fewer participants
           have been tested, and a power analysis will be performed to determine if the sub-study
           should be continued, and if so, the number of subjects required.

        4. Training for new investigators.

        5. Technical development: These experimental sessions will allow us to refine scan
           parameters and experimental paradigms to improve data quality and increase our ability
           to obtain accurate information.

      Study Population:

      Normal volunteer participants aged 18-65, who are in good general health and have normal or
      corrected-to-normal vision will be recruited from the local community and studied under this
      minimal risk protocol. We plan to recruit up to 200 in-person participants and up to 10,000
      on-line volunteers.

      Design:

      We will design small hypothesis-generating sub-studies that are pertinent to the theme of the
      brain mechanisms for perception and cognition. In some sub-studies, the same subject will be
      asked to participate in tasks involving fMRI, MEG and psychophysics, and possibly multiple
      sessions of each, so that we can control for individual differences in relating the outcomes
      of each experimental technique. In other sub-studies, participation in multiple tasks will
      not be required. The extent of the participant involvement, and what they will be asked to
      do, will be clearly disclosed during consent, as indicated in the consent documents. Brain
      activity of healthy human volunteers will be monitored by fMRI and/or MEG. Anatomical MRI
      will be collected in some subjects to allow better localization of brain dynamics. Behavioral
      tests will be conducted using standard psychophysical approaches, involving presentation of
      visual and/or auditory stimuli while eye-movements are monitored using non-invasive eye
      tracking (such as with an infra-red camera directed at the participant s eyes). Subjects will
      be shown simple visual stimuli such as blobs, stripes and spirals in assorted colors, moving
      dots, checkerboards, and every-day images and video clips, such as of fruit rolling on a
      table cloth, faces, and scenery recorded in a car. Auditory stimuli will include every-day
      sounds such as birds singing, conversation, whispering, footsteps, car engines, and animal
      vocalizations, presented within normal sound limits (60- 90 dB). We will not use provocative
      or sexually explicit images, clips or sounds.

      During fMRI and MEG sessions, subjects will be asked to free view, passively fixate, or
      engage in an attentional task during fixation, such as reporting with an eye movement or
      button press occasions when two images of the same category are presented sequentially.

      Outcome Measures:

      Performance on behavioral tasks and brain activity (fMRI and MEG) will be combined to yield
      information about the neural correlates and processes underlying different aspects of the
      human neural visual processing stream including color perception, attention, visual
      discrimination and object/face/place recognition.

      i. MRI: to analyze measures such as the anatomical structures of the brain (using structural
      MRI); amplitude of the blood-oxygenation-level-dependent (BOLD) signal &amp; using fMRI).

      ii. MEG: to quantify measures such as power spectrum, event- or task-related potentials,
      synchronization/desynchronization, and coherence between sensors or sources located close to
      the brain areas of interest.

      iii. Behavioral measures: to quantify measures such as hit rate, reaction times, thresholds,
      similarity judgments, associations, naming (such as names for color stimuli and sounds) and
      eye movements.

      We may measure autonomic data during the course of the experiment (such as heart rate,
      respiration, end-tidal CO2, skin conductance), which will be correlated with the outcome
      measures.
