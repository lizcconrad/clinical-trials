  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To evaluate the safety and effectiveness of the ReFlow Medical Wingman Catheter used to cross
      de novo or restenotic infrainguinal CTOs that cannot be crossed with a standard guidewire.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Prospective, multi-center, non-randomized single-arm study of the Wingman Catheter to cross a
      single infrainguinal peripheral chronic total occlusion (CTO). Safety and effectiveness will
      be evaluated during the index procedure through 30-day follow-up.
