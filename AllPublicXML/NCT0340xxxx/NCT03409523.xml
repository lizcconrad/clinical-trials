  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will develop a new electronic health record module to improve guideline-compliant
      care of older adults with diabetes. The module will incorporate effective behavioral
      economics (BE) principles to improve the degree to which care of older adults is compliant
      with Choosing Wisely guidelines; this generally involves less aggressive targets for HbA1c,
      and reductions of medications other than metformin.

      The implementation of the module will ultimately be triggered by medication prescribing in
      EPIC. The BE principles include suggesting alternatives to medications, requiring
      justification, setting of appropriate default order sets, and incorporation of anchoring and
      checklists to guide behavior. The study will involve provider workflow analysis based on
      observation, module user testing, and live usability testing with direct observation and
      semi-structure interviews.

      The primary objective of this study is to develop a scalable, EHR customization toolkit that
      applies BE insights to promote appropriate diabetes care in older adults based on the
      American Geriatric Society's Choosing Wisely Guideline, as to assess the acceptability of the
      resulting module.
