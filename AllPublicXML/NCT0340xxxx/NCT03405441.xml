    <measure>Slow Wave Activity Recorded by the Electroencephalogram (EEG)</measure>
    <time_frame>Pre-dose, 1 hour (h), 2h, and 4h post dose on Day 1</time_frame>
    <description>The Effect of JNJ-55375515 on slow wave activity recorded by the electroencephalogram (EEG) will be evaluated. EEG recordings are made using gold electrodes, fixed at Midline Frontal Electrode (Fz), Midline Central Electrode (Cz), Midline Parietal Electrode (Pz) and Midline Occipital Electrode (Oz), with the same common ground electrode as for the eye movement registration (international 10/20 system). Per session eight consecutive blocks of eight seconds are recorded. For each lead, fast Fourier transform analysis will be performed to obtain the sum of amplitudes in the very low (0.5-2 Hertz [Hz]), delta- (2-4 Hz), theta (4-7.5 Hz), alpha- (7.5-13.5 Hz), beta- (13.5-35 Hz), and gamma-(35-48.9 Hz) frequency ranges.

In healthy adults, 14 pattern/location associations must be learned. In the presentation phase of the task the pattern appears at the location and the participant is required to acknowledge that they have seen the pattern by touching the location at which it appears. Patterns are presented in random order. In the learning phase of the task, participants must place each of the 14 patterns in their correct locations. They must do this in 10 rounds. Number of errors made in correctly placing each of the four patterns in their location four times. (Lower score = better performance).</description>
