  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A high physical fitness is crucial for a good quality of life in persons suffering from a
      spinal cord injury. The aim of the present observational study is to investigate the
      influence of an individually tailored 8-week endurance training program on endurance
      performance of patients with a paraplegia during their first rehabilitation.
