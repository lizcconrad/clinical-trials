  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This observational study intends to analyze the characteristic of specific accidents happened
      in Austrian's mountainous regions. The mechanisms of accidents which are evaluated are
      lightning accidents, cardiopulmonary resuscitation with or without automated external
      defibrillator, frostbite injuries, accidents with flying vehicle (e.g. paraglider,
      hang-glider…).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The data are collected retrospectively from the database of Austrian alpine police force.
      These data are analyzed. The information from this database (scene of accident, weather,
      daytime…) is compared to secondary data collected from the University Hospital of Innsbruck.
      The comparison of both databases was approved by the Austrian Data Protection Agency. The
      goal of the study is to give detailed information of circumstances leading to accident and
      give medical information of the patient's condition and his outcome.
