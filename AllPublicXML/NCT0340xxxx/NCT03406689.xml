      The analgestic efffect of Nepafenac 0.1% Eye Drops and Nepafenac 0.3% Eye Drops on pain
      related to intravitreal injections will be evalutated.

      Pain perception will be assessed by the Short Form of the McGill Pain Questionnaire.

    <textblock>
      Intravitreal injection (IVI) is a preferred route of administration of drugs in the posterior
      segment of the eye. Intravitreal injection of anti-VEGFs constitutes the mainstay for the
      treatment of various retinal diseases such as AMD, RVO, DME etc. The procedure of the IVI is,
      however, associated with a level of discomfort for the patient.

      Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) inhibit the activity of cyclooxygenase-1 and
      cyclooxygenase-2, and thereby, the synthesis of prostaglandins and thromboxanes.
      Cyclooxygenase-2 inhibition leads to the anti-inflammatory, analgesic and antipyretic effects
      of NSAIDs. Ophthalmic NSAIDs constitute an established and effective treatment option for the
      management of inflammation and pain associated with cataract surgery and of pain associated
      with corneal refractive surgery, for inhibition of intraoperative miosis and for the
      treatment of seasonal allergic conjunctivitis.

      The primary goal of this study is to assess the analgesic effect of Nepafenac 0.1% and
      Nepafenac 0.3% Eye Drops on pain related to intravitreal injections immediately after and up
      to six hours postIVI.

      A number of patients scheduled to undergo IVIs of anti-VEGFs will be randomized and divided
      in three groups. All patients must have already undergone at least one IVI. In patients
      receiving IVIs in both eyes only one eye will be included in the study.

      The patients of the first group will receive Nepafenac 0.1 % Eye Drops 45 minutes prior to
      the injection.

      The patients of the second group will recieve Nepafenac 0.3 % Eye Drop 45 minutes prior to
      the injection. The patients of the third group will receive Artificial Tears 45 minutes prior
      to the injection.

      Patients will be required to complete the greek version of the short form McGill Pain
      Questionnaire (SF-MPQ) comprising of the Visual Analogue Scale, the main component of the
      SF-MPQ and the Present Pain Intensity Scale immediately after the injection and 6 hours
      post-IVI.

    <description>As measured by the Visual Analogue Scale. The Visual Analogue Scale (abbreviation VAS) is a self report pain score chart designed as a 10 cm horizontal line marked at both ends. Each boundary of the line represents the extremes of painful experience (0=no pain and 10= the worst pain ever experienced).
The patient is asked to mark on the scale the exact point corresponding to their perception of pain intensity and the score is calculated by measuring from the left hand side to the mark made by the patient, ranging from 0 to 10.
Higher scores indicate more severe pain.</description>

    <description>As measured by the Main Component of the Short Form of the McGill Pain Questionnaire.
The main component of the Short form of the McGill Pain Questionnaire (abbreviation SF-MPQ) comprises of 15 adjectives describing the pain experienced (11 sensory and 4 affective). The patient is asked to grade the intensity of each specific pain quality on an intensity scale from 0 to 3 (0= none, 1=mild, 2=moderate, 3=severe).
The total score of the main component is derived by adding the rank values given by the patient for each descriptor out of 45. Scores can range from 0 to 45.
A higher score of the main component of the SF-MPQ reflects more serious pain.</description>

The patient is instructed to choose the adjective indicating their pain state. The score for the PPI is derived from the number next to the patients' adjective of choice, ranging from 0 to 5.
