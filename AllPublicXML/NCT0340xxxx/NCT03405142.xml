  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well panitumumab-IRDye800 works in identifying head and neck
      cancer that has spread to the lymph nodes in patients with head and neck cancer.
      Panitumumab-IRDye800 may help surgeons to identify metastatic lymph nodes during surgical
      removal of the primary tumor and/or lymph nodes of the neck with equal or better accuracy
      than the current methods.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine if near-infrared fluorescence imaging of panitumumab-IRDye800 can identify
      metastatic disease in regional neck lymph nodes of patients with head and neck squamous cell
      carcinoma (HNSCC).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine if panitumumab-IRDye800 can identify sentinel nodes with the same accuracy as
      technetium Tc 99m-labeled tilmanocept (Lymphoseek).

      OUTLINE:

      Beginning 2-5 days before surgery, patients receive panitumumab IRDye800 intravenously (IV)
      over 60 minutes. On the day before surgery, patients also receive technetium Tc 99m-labeled
      tilmanocept via injection and undergo lymphoscintigraphy and single photon emission computed
      tomography/computed tomography (SPECT/CT).

      After completion of study, patients are followed up for 30 days.

    <description>The sensitivity and specificity of the intraoperative findings on whether the LN is fluorescent (i.e. presence of panitumumab-IRDye800) to the histopathological status of the LNs will be calculated. The matched pair Durkalski's test accounting for the cluster-correlation within patient, for all sensitivity and specificity comparisons using the clust.bin.pair package in the R statistical software will be used. Significance for both primary and secondary analyses will be assessed at the 0.05 level and to assess uncertainty, 95% confidence intervals will be provided for all estimates.

    <description>Whether the LN tracer Lymphoseek can identify metastatic disease in regional neck LNs of patients with head and neck squamous cell cancer will be determined. Similar to the primary analysis, the specificity and sensitivity of Lymphoseek for metastatic LN identification, using histology as the gold standard will be calculated, and compared to neck dissection with Durkalski's test. Since false negatives are of particular concern, the odds of obtaining a false negative using panitumumab-IRDye800 relative to the odds of obtaining a false negative using Lymphoseek-based sentinel node biopsy will be</description>
