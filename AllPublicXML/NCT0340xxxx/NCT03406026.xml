  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to evaluate if the application of a protocol focused on the
      equilibrium systems versus the conventional treatments decreases the time to acquire
      equilibrium in standing, the risk of falls and favors the early initiation of treatments
      aimed at recovering the physiological gait.

      In order to respond to the objectives, a randomized clinical trial was proposed on a total N
      of 70 stroke survivors (N = 35 patients in the control group and N = 35 patients in the
      intervention group), who Are in the subacute stage of the disease, meet the inclusion and
      exclusion criteria, and require hospitalization to perform the rehabilitative treatment.

      For this, a rehabilitation treatment protocol was designed focusing on the equilibrium
      systems. The intervention of the study will be carried out during 4 weeks. The control group
      will receive conventional rehabilitation treatment for stroke patients, consisting of
      physiotherapy therapy for 60 minutes; While the intervention group will receive conventional
      rehabilitative treatment during the first 45 minutes and the last 15 minutes therapy will be
      based on the protocol designed.

      The evaluation of the program will be carried out based on the stated objectives. In order to
      evaluate the improvement of the patients in terms of balance, gait, risk of falls and patient
      autonomy, these will be assessed at the beginning of the intervention at 15 days and at the
      end (30 days). After the intervention two more assessments will be made; At 3 months and at 6
      months to follow up in time.

    <description>The main aim of the study is to test that evaluates the dynamic balance with Mini Balance Evaluation Systems Test. It is an essay that lasts for about 10 minutes, which makes the patient not find a tiredness. It consists of four sections with a total of 14 elements that evaluate each of the systems elements of the balance: biomechanical limitations, stability limits, postural responses, posterior adjustments anticipatory, sensory orientation, dynamic balance and cognitive effects during gait.
It is score by assigning 2 points if the performance is normal, 1 point if the deficit is moderate and 0 points if the deficit is severe. In the case that the patient needs external support, on point will be subtracted from the score obtained on the category evaluated. Finally, if the patient need help from the physiotherapist, the category will be scored as 0 points. The paretic and the non-paretic side will be assessed, and the worse scored will be recorded.</description>

    <measure>Falling risk</measure>
    <time_frame>At baseline, 15 days, 1 month</time_frame>
    <description>Measured by the Berg Balance Scale (BBS) The Berg is a widely used test for assessing balance and to predict falls risk in the elderly. It has been validated with post-stroke patients. The Berg consists of 14 items, each scored from 0-4. Thus a score for the Berg could in theory range from a minimum of 0 to a maximum of 56. A score below 45 is indicative of balance impairment; thus the lower the score the greater the falls risk. We computed the slopes (i.e. rates of change from baseline to 3-months and 6-months) using a random effect ANOVA (random intercept and random slope), and determined if the slopes were different using unpaired Student's t-tests.</description>

    <measure>Independence in basic activities of daily life</measure>
    <time_frame>At baseline, 15 days, 1 moth</time_frame>
    <description>Measured by the Barthel Index. The Barthel index is a questionnaire with 10 items that values independence for the development of basic activities of daily living (eating, washing, dressing, arranging, stool, urination, going to the retete, moving chair, walking and climbing And down stairs). The score goes from 0-100, total dependence, maximum independence. More specifically, the results are categorized as follows: &lt;20 total dependence, 21-60 severe dependence, 61-90 moderate dependence, 91-99 mild dependence, 100 independence.</description>

    <description>Balance System Protocol Stroke differentiates 2 levels of difficulty in relation to the patient's condition and progressively according to their evolution. If the patient maintains stability in standing for at least 30 s, he starts in Level 2 and otherwise he will remain in Level 1 until he acquires it. In level 1 the progression of exercises is: 1.Pressure stimulation of the foot support points; 2.Proprioceptive ankle work; 3.Sit-to-stand work and vice versa; 4.Sit-to-stand work with delayed affection. In level 2, the progression of exercises is: 1.Standing unbalances; 2.Standing on Balance-pad; 3.Work to get monopodal support; 4.Balance pad in monopodal support; 5.Monopodal support work with closed eyes.</description>
