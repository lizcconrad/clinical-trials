  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Retinal vein occlusion (RVO) includes central RVO (CRVO) and branch RVO (BRVO). A highly
      prevalent retinal vascular disease, RVO is second only to diabetic retinopathy. Most of this
      high prevalence is driven by BRVO; the yearly incidence of BRVO in the United States is
      150,000 and that of CRVO is 30,000. In CRVO, hemorrhages and edema develop throughout the
      retina, whereas in BRVO the pathology is more sectoral, involving the portions of the retina
      drained by the obstructed branch vein. This suggests that increased intraluminal pressure
      behind the obstruction may lead to transudation of blood cells and plasma into the retina.
      However, recent studies have demonstrated that although increased venous pressure may be the
      precipitating event for hemorrhages and edema, increased production of vascular endothelial
      growth factor (VEGF) occurs early in RVO and is a major contributor to their evolution and
      persistence. In addition, the high levels of VEGF contribute to progression of retinal
      nonperfusion and hence retinal ischemia, which may in turn increase production of VEGF, and
      may explain why some eyes enter a vicious cycle of worsening disease often referred to as
      conversion to an ischemic RVO.

      Treat-and-extend intravitreal anti-VEGF with age related macular degeneration and diabetic
      macular edema has been reported to offer the opportunity to indivisual management while
      minimizing treatment burden and similar visual and anatomical outcomes to those with fixed
      montly dosing.

      Also, small retrospective treat-and-extend intravitreal bevacizumab injection for treatment
      of BRVO associated macular edema demonstrated similar visual outcomes and number of
      intravitreal injections as did pro-re-nata treatment with ranibizumab conducted in phase 3
      trials but with fewer visits and lower annual medical costs.

      The effects of afilbercept have been reported to persist for over 8 weeks in DME and AMD
      studies. In addition, VIBRANT study also demonstrate that bi-monthly injection of aflibercept
      showed significant visual improvement in BRVO patients.

      In the treat-and-extend studies of RVO, ranibizumab has been extended for up to 4 months at
      intervals of 2 weeks. But, to our knowledge, there was no prospective study of
      treat-and-extend regiments with intravitreal aflibercept in treatment naïve patients in BRVO.

      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of the treat-and-extend
      regimen extending to 4 months by intervals of 4 weeks using intravitreal aflivercept
      injection for treatment of macular edema secondary to BRVO.
