      Approaches are needed to help primary-care pediatricians address high blood pressure. This
      study will test whether an electronic health-record-based tool to address high blood pressure
      is feasible and improves the evaluation and management of high blood pressure in clinical
      practice. If successful, this approach can be used to address other lifestyle-related and
      complex health problems (e.g., dyslipidemia and diabetes), then disseminated and used
      nationwide.

      The investigators have developed a new, electronic health-record (EHR)-based tool that is
      designed to help pediatricians:

        1. IDENTIFY AND DOCUMENT

             1. when a child's blood pressure is elevated, and

             2. whether it has been elevated before--including number of prior elevations to
                document the correct diagnosis (for example, elevated blood pressure, vs.
                hypertension stage 1, vs. hypertension stage 2), THEN

        2. ORDER the next action(s) needed per guideline-based recommendations, AND per prior
           actions taken--including:

             1. laboratories and studies per 2017 updated guidelines

             2. follow-up interval in primary care

             3. referral to nephrology, when indicated, and

             4. patient education on diet/lifestyle modification.

      The investigators are working on improving this system further with addition of orders for:

        1. referral for sleep-apnea testing and treatment, when indicated, and

        2. blood-pressure medications (for example, initiation, titration, or addition of agents
           depending on blood-pressure control, comorbid conditions [e.g., diabetes], and risk for
           pregnancy)

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators' data suggest that (1) addressing weight-related comorbidities and frequent
      follow-up are associated with weight-status improvement in overweight (OW) children, (2) that
      parents rank checking for weight-related health problems as the #1 most important recommended
      weight-management clinical practice, but that (3) comorbidities are infrequently addressed.
      Thus, to improve weight status, interventions are needed to improve comorbidity
      identification, evaluation, and management in primary care. Because the investigators' data
      suggest that identification of high blood pressure is particularly poor, and that identifying
      blood-pressure elevations in young children at three separate encounters is complex, they are
      using existing underutilized data to automate addressing high blood pressure/hypertension in
      an electronic health record system (EPIC-based), and, if successful, applying the method to
      other weight-related comorbidities in primary care.

      OF NOTE: in developing and pilot-testing this decision support tool, providers wanted access
      to it for patients without overweight/obesity. Thus, although the trial was borne out of work
      in weight-management research, the trial will focus on all children irrespective of weight
      status.

    <description>Proportion of patients with high blood pressure addressed post decision-support implementation (vs. pre-), defined as proportion of patients with elevated blood pressures or higher who have one or more diagnosis or orders placed to diagnose, evaluate, or manage hypertension. We will compare the slope of the post- vs. pre-implementation periods to examine change in monthly rate of HTN eval/management (indicated elements ordered/patients eligible) related to decision support that are in excess of secular trends in clinical practice. In the post-implementation period, the denominator will be determined by tracking patient-level decision-support fires. In the pre-implementation period, the denominator will be determined by applying the decision-support algorithm to retrospective data in monthly increments to identify patients who would have been eligible.</description>
