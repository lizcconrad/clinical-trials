    <textblock>
      The role of fat in breast cancer development and growth has been studied extensively using
      body mass index, a measure of whole body fatness, and dietary fat intake in a number of
      epidemiological studies. However, there is a paucity of studies, on an individual level, to
      assess the role of breast fat itself in breast cancer due to lack of a non-invasive and fast
      measurement method. Since breast fibroglandular cells are surrounded by breast fat cells, the
      characteristics of breast fat may have a stronger relationship with breast cancer
      development, as supported by recent studies showing that a majority of breast cancer develops
      at the interface between fibroglandular tissue and adipose tissue. However, it is not trivial
      to study the role of breast fat, mainly due to the lack of a non-invasive and fast
      measurement method sensitive enough to important features of breast fat, such as types of
      fat.Recently, we have developed a rapid MRI method, referred to as Gradient-echo
      Spectroscopic Imaging (GSI), to measure fatty acid composition during clinical breast MRI
      exams. GSI can provide map of saturated fat and unsaturated fats in the breast adipose tissue
      without performing tissue biopsy. Our pilot study found that the postmenopausal women with
      aggressive breast cancer, known as invasive ductal carcinoma, have a significantly higher
      percentage of saturated fat in their breast adipose tissue than the postmenopausal women with
      only benign lesions.

      The overarching goal of this study is to determine the role of saturated fatty acid in breast
      cancer development and growth. In this proposal, GSI will be used for non-invasive in vivo
      measurement of saturated fat in the breast adipose tissue of postmenopausal women who undergo
      diagnostic breast MRI exams (Aims 1 and 2) or MRI-guided biopsy scans (Aim 3). The central
      hypotheses is that (i) the breast saturated fatty acid fraction measured by GSI is associated
      with the presence of malignant lesions in the breast and (ii) the breast saturated fatty acid
      fraction correlates positively with inflammation in the breast adipose tissue that may lead
      to increase in estrogen production in adipocytes.The proposed study will evaluate whether
      breast saturated fat is an independent risk factor for breast cancer, and whether it can
      provide additional diagnostic information to current clinical diagnostic exams. In addition,
      the proposed imaging measure of breast saturated fat can be used to assess the efficacy of
      any intervention to reduce cancer-related inflammation in the breast adipose tissue and to
      investigate the possible role of fatty acid composition in prevention and clinical management
      of breast cancer.
