  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall goal of this work is to adapt, refine, and conduct an open trial of a
      parent-training intervention for Veterans with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms
      using feedback from Veterans, VA clinicians, and expert consultants as key stakeholders. PTSD
      symptoms are associated with parent-child functioning difficulties, which are also an
      important determinant of quality of life and functional recovery. This project will examine
      the feasibility and acceptability of an evidence-based group intervention to improve
      parenting behaviors, parenting satisfaction, and family functioning in Veteran parents with
      PTSD symptoms and who have children between the ages of 3 and 12.

      This intervention is derived from an existing evidence-based intervention to improve Veteran
      relationship functioning (Strength at Home; SAH), and it is informed by the Cognitive
      Behavioral Theory of Interpersonal Functioning and the Military Family Attachment frameworks
      for the association between PTSD and family functioning problems. The intervention also
      includes a pre-treatment Motivational Interviewing Assessment (MIA) to assist Veterans in
      strengthening and building motivation to change their parenting behaviors. The goals and
      change talk identified in the pre-treatment MIA are then referred to throughout the
      treatment. Groups are gender-specific, meaning that the investigators will pilot the
      treatment in separate groups of women and men Veterans.

    <measure>Client Satisfaction Questionnaire-8 (CSQ)</measure>
    <time_frame>eight week</time_frame>
    <description>The Client Satisfaction Questionnaire-8 (CSQ) assesses acceptability post-treatment. Eight items are scored on a 4-point scale inquiring about quality of services, treatment satisfaction, and willingness to recommend the treatment to others. Ratings are summed, with higher scores representing greater acceptability ratings (possible range 4-32). This measure is commonly used in both clinical trials and program evaluation, and has been shown to correlate with treatment attendance and outcomes. It takes approximately three minutes to complete. Evaluations of the measure found it to be reliable, with high coefficient alphas (.83-.93) to support internal consistency, and that it evidences positive construct validity with other measures of satisfaction. Where available, mean CSQ ratings can also be compared against norms from other studies in similar populations.</description>

    <time_frame>eight week</time_frame>
    <description>Veteran feedback will be elicited after sessions using an open-ended measure to assess satisfaction with SAHP strategies and content. Satisfaction will be evaluated via Veteran ratings of how helpful the session was, how helpful the homework was (0 = 'not at all helpful,' 8 = 'definitely helpful'), whether they learned anything during the session, and which components of each session were helpful or unhelpful. A modified version of this form will evaluate satisfaction with the MIA during the open trial.</description>

    <description>Aim 1: To obtain and incorporate expert clinician and Veteran feedback on credibility, acceptability, and satisfaction with the intervention to ensure Veteran-friendly intervention manual, materials, and processes. Aim 1 will be accomplished through two rounds of expert panel review of treatment/MIA manual and two rounds of pilot testing of the treatment for Veteran Feedback in 16 female and 16 male Veterans.
Aim 2: To evaluate feasibility of study recruitment, retention, assessment procedures and proposed methods of the intervention. Preliminary examination of whether the intervention results in improvements to parenting behaviors, parenting satisfaction and overall family functioning.</description>

          -  Current parent to a child between the ages of 3 and 12.

               -  If the parent has more than one child within the target group, they will choose
                  one of their children to be the index child for the purposes of SAHP

               -  Though we expect skills learned will translate to other children in the family

               -  The child must reside with the Veteran or spend at least an average of two days
                  per week with the Veteran

          -  Screen positive for elevated PTSD symptoms on the PTSD checklist for DSM 5 (PCL-5)

               -  The PCL-5 is a 20 item self-report measure of PTSD symptoms in the past month.
                  Items are rated on a 5 point Likert scale (0 = not at all, 4= extremely) and
                  participants endorse symptoms based on &quot;a very stressful experience.&quot;

               -  Items are summed with higher scores reflecting greater symptomatology. The
                  measure evidences good reliability (Internal consistency = .96; test-retest =
                  .84), discriminant and convergent validity and takes 5-10 min. to complete

          -  Screen positive (above the 85th percentile) for parent-child functioning problems
             based on Parenting Stress Index- Short Form; PSI-SF

               -  All three subscales and the total stress scale on the short-form are highly
                  correlated with those on the long-form (.97-.99), and is expected to take
                  respondents about 10 minutes to complete

               -  The total stress scale can successfully differentiate between different levels of
                  risk for parent-child functioning problems and has strong convergent validity.
                  High Cronbach's alpha scores have been reported across all scales, ranging from
                  .88 to .9584

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Major neurocognitive disorder, including due to TBI

                  is a 3-5 min. clinician administered interview for lifetime history of TBI

               -  The OSU TBI-ID is a recommended common data element by NIH and evidences good-
                  excellent reliability and validity

               -  The OSU TBI-ID will be used to identify severe TBI as defined as a score of 5

               -  The participant's medical record may also be used for secondary verification in
                  the case of TBI

               -  For those scoring a 5, further referral and screening for comprehension ability
                  will be recommended to determine exclusion (as the intent is to identify
                  individuals who may not understand or comprehend study materials)

          -  Untreated/poorly managed psychosis or substance dependence

               -  The Mini-International Diagnostic Interview (MINI), is a structured diagnostic
                  interview that can be completed in less than 10 minutes

               -  It is one of the most widely used diagnostic interviews and evidences
                  psychometric properties that are like more complex and lengthier measures

               -  The psychotic disorders and substance dependence subscales of the MINI will be
                  used to screen for DSM-V criteria for current psychosis and substance dependence

               -  Participants meeting the diagnostic criteria above will be asked about their
                  current treatment and if needed, the PI (licensed clinical psychologist) will

               -  Those not engaged in treatment (diagnosis without ongoing medication management
                  or psychotherapy) and/or evidencing need for referral to detox (e.g. symptoms of

                  as defined as a score of 2 or more on the BDI-II suicide item

               -  The BDI-II suicide item evidences a moderate correlation with the other scales of
                  suicidal ideation in clinical samples, and has predictive validity

               -  Follow-up risk-assessment will be provided by the PI who is a licensed clinical
                  psychologist

               -  Individuals will be eligible after crisis intervention has been received
