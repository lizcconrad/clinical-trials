  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this trial is to collect and compare safety and effectiveness data of
      Magnetic Resonance guided Focused Ultrasound (MRgFUS) using the ExAblate 2100 device and
      radiotherapy in the treatment of metastatic bone tumors.

      This study is designed as a prospective, double arm, randomized study with External Beam
      radiation therapy (EBRT) serving as control arm.

      The study hypothesis is that MRgFUS is an effective non-invasive and safe treatment for the
      palliation of metastatic bone tumors with a low incidence of co-morbidity as compared to
      EBRT.

    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, randomized, double arm study to collect data on safety and
      effectiveness of ExAblate MRgFUS and EBRT treatments of metastatic bone tumors. Following
      treatment assignment and treatment itself, subjects will be followed for up for 6 months to
      evaluate pain relief as well as quality of life. Additional data regarding dosage and
      frequency of analgesic consumption for the management of the bone tumor induced pain will
      also be collected. MRI of the treated lesion will be obtained 3 and 6 months post therapy to
      evaluate effect on the lesion in both radiation and MRgFUS arms. This is clinically
      acceptable and widely utilized diagnostic method in follow up of this patient population.

      Data will be collected for total of 144 patients, 72 patients treated by EBRT and another 72
      patients treated by FUS. Treating physician, as of his/her normal practice, might offer
      additional treatment of other type in cases where pain score of the treated lesion will not
      improve by at least 2 points, and will remain 4 or greater. Additional treatment may be
      performed up to one month following treatment. Prior to offering alternative treatment, an
      MRI will be performed to evaluate effect on the lesion. Patient receiving another treatment,
      different from the initial one (i.e. patient initially treated with FUS is now treated by
      EBRT) will be considered as treatment failures for the primary analysis and their post-x-over
      follow-up results will be analyzed separately.

    <description>The treatment process begins with the physician acquiring a set of MR images, identifying target volume(s) of tissue to ablate, and then drawing the treatment contours.
The therapy planning software computes the type and number of sonications required to treat the defined region while minimizing total treatment time. MR images taken during the sonication provide a diagnostic quality image of the target tissue and a quantitative, real-time temperature map overlay to confirm the therapeutic effect of the treatment</description>
