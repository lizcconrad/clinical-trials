      Evaluate the preliminary safety and performance of the Electrosurgery Applicator (ANET
      device) during and after bronchoscopic ablation of a target pulmonary nodule/tumor.

      This study is a prospective, single arm, single center study that will evaluate the
      effectiveness of the ANET Electrosurgery Applicator in up to 10 subjects.

      Subjects who consent to participate in this study will have a lung tumor that is scheduled to
      be removed surgically as part of their normal treatment. During the surgical procedure, just
      prior to resection the subject's tumor will be treated with the ANET device. The ANET device
      uses a bronchoscope to reach the tumor. Ultrasound on the bronchoscope, CT, and X-rays are
      used to make sure the ANET device is in the tumor. Once in the tumor, the ANET device uses
      radio-frequency (RF) ablation to treat the tumor. After standard surgical resection the tumor
      and surrounding tissue is evaluated to characterize the effect of the ANET.

          4. Resection/surgical candidate

          5. Participants must be at least 18 years old and able to provide consent

        Exclusion criteria:

          1. Subjects in whom flexible bronchoscopy is contraindicated

          2. Target nodule &lt; 1.0 cm

          3. Prior radiation or neo adjuvant chemotherapy of the target nodule/tumor

          4. Any comorbidity that the investigator feels would interfere with the safety of the
