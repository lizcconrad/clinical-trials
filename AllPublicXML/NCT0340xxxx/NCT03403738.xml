    <textblock>
      Disaster survivors need freely accessible resources to self-monitor their emotional recovery
      and help them address mental health needs they may develop after a disaster. The
      investigators will evaluate a novel, scalable, and highly sustainable smartphone/web-based
      intervention that is designed to address post-disaster PTSD and depressed mood. The
      intervention, Bounce Back Now, will be tested in a study with 5,000 disaster survivors and
      will be accessible via any internet-connected device (e.g., laptop, tablet, smartphone).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Globally, an average of 390 disasters, 100,000 related deaths, 260 million disaster victims,
      and $140 billion in economic damages were recorded per year between 2002-2012. The U.S. is
      one of the top 5 countries—with China, Philippines, India, and Indonesia—most frequently
      affected by disasters. The adverse mental health effects of disasters are extraordinary and
      costly. Up to 38% of distressed survivors presenting to shelters and assistance centers have
      stress-related and adjustment disorders. Most survivors who develop disaster-related mental
      health problems do not receive services. The 2013 report of the International Federation of
      Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies calls for technology-based solutions to heighten access
      to disaster assistance resources. With US cellphone and smartphone ownership now topping 90%
      and 60%, respectively, opportunities are tremendous to create cost-efficient, scalable
      solutions that increase capacity to address mental health needs in disaster-affected
      communities. The investigators propose highly innovative, time-sensitive research to examine
      the effectiveness of a widely accessible, technology-based disaster mental health
      intervention.

      Mental health recovery trajectories are highly variable in disaster settings. 7,14 Most
      survivors recover without intervention and may need nothing more than a brief symptom
      tracking resource (i.e., watchful waiting). Some develop mental health needs (e.g.,
      post-traumatic stress, depression) for which a brief self-help intervention may aid recovery.
      Some have chronic mental health problems (pre-existing or disaster related) that necessitate
      formal treatment. Others (e.g., serious mental illness) may require immediate assistance. The
      proposed intervention, Bounce Back Now (BBN), addresses each level of need using a
      web/smartphone-based approach that builds on the investigator's prior work. BBN consists of 3
      key components: (1) a symptom and activity-tracking component that we piloted in emergency
      department settings, (2) a self-help intervention that was found to be efficacious in a
      recent RCT with families affected by a tornado outbreak, and (3) a resource component that
      principally connects survivors to the SAMHSA-administered Disaster Distress Helpline (DDH)
      when immediate assistance is needed (e.g., serious mental illness) or when local mental
      health treatment referrals are needed or preferred.

      This study will leverage the mental health workforce to recruit 5,000 disaster survivors via
      partnerships with the American Red Cross (ARC) and Office of the Assistant Secretary for
      Preparedness and Response (ASPR). These partnerships allow cost-efficient testing of
      interventions, recruitment of individuals at high risk for developing disaster-related mental
      health problems, and collection of data at the level of triage to aid in prediction of mental
      health needs and coordination of care. Participants will be randomly assigned to receive BBN
      vs. enhanced usual care (i.e., EUC; usual care plus comprehensive resource list). BBN will be
      optimized for smartphones but accessible from any device with an internet connection.

    <description>25-item measure to assess avoidance behavior as well as pleasant and social activities. Each item is rated on a 7-point Likert scale ranging from 0 (not at all) to 6 (completely). To score the BADS, items from all scales other than the Activation scale are reverse-coded and then all items are summed. To score the subscales, no items are reverse-coded. This process allows high scores on the total scale and the subscales to be represented by the scale and subscale names. In other words, for the total scale, higher scores represent increased activation, while for the Social Impairment subscale, higher scores represent increased social impairment.</description>

For example, for the adult 8-item form, the lowest possible raw score is 8; the highest possible raw score is 40.</description>

    <description>3-item screen that identifies hazardous drinkers or individuals with active alcohol use disorders. The AUDIT-C is scored on a scale of 0-12.
Each AUDIT-C question has 5 answer choices. Points allotted are: a = 0 points, b = 1 point, c = 2 points, d = 3 points, e = 4 points. In men, a score of 4 or more is considered positive, optimal for identifying hazardous drinking or active alcohol use disorders. In women, a score of 3 or more is considered positive (same as above). Generally, the higher the score, the more likely it is that the patient's drinking is affecting his or her safety.</description>
