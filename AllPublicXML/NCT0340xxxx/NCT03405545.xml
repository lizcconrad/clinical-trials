  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This human intervention study will test if supervised HIIT-based intervention improves
      skeletal muscle NOGD capacity in obese subjects. Moreover, we aim to investigate whether the
      consumption of an insulinogenic, CHO-rich drink during and after exercise prevents the
      adverse effects related to blood glucose fluctuations (energetic feelings, mood state) while
      maintaining the effect of HIIT on NOGD and promotes the adherence of the subjects to the
      training program in the long term.

    <textblock>
      42 overweight-obese (BMI 25-35 kg/m2), sedentary females and males aged 45-65yr will be
      enrolled in this study.

      This study will be conducted in 2 randomized intervention groups;

        1. HIIT+ carbohydrate-rich beverage

        2. HIIT+ water.

      Both groups will train 3 times/week under supervision during 12 weeks (period 1) and remotely
      supervised during 40 weeks (period 2). Before, after and during each training period, there
      will be multiple metabolic measurements.

    <measure>Mood state assessed by Likert Scale, 0 to +7 score</measure>
    <time_frame>30 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>The Likert Scale is a classified as one-dimensional method assessing the degree of pleasantness and arousal as perceived by the participants. Subjects have to indicate the extent to which they agree or disagree with a series of statements. For the Likert Scale, a higher score indicates a better mood with a scale range of 0 to 84.</description>

    <time_frame>15 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>The CFQ11 is a questionnaire that assesses the extent and severity of fatigue. This questionnaire has 11 items, which are answered on a 4 points scale with a higher value indicating greater symtoms of fatigue (with a score range from 0 to 11).</description>

    <measure>Skeletal muscle mitochondrial function assessed by Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy Scan using 31P-MRS methodology, based on the phosphocreatine (PCr) recovery kinetics after exercise.</measure>
    <time_frame>1 hour</time_frame>
    <description>The participant is positioned in the scanner with a home-built exercise device to perform consecutive knee-extensions, in which the participant has to lift a weight whilst laying in the scanner (50-60% max leg capacity of the subjects) for 5 minutes. Scout images of the upper leg are acquired and fine-tuned shimming is applied. Before, during and after exercise, spectra are acquired every 4 seconds. The restoration of PCr is driven almost purely by oxidative metabolism, the time to restore the normal amount reflects mitochondrial function (a faster restoration time means better mitochondrial function).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Metabolic Flexibility during exercise assessed by indirect calorimetry.</measure>
    <time_frame>30 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>Participants will undergo a standardized cycling test at low, moderate and high intensity (30%-50%-70%) during 10 minutes each. Throughout the test, indirect calorimetry will be performed in order to measure changes in substrate oxidation during exercise.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Ectopic Fat accumulation in the liver assessed by magnetic resonance spectroscopy.</measure>
    <time_frame>1 hour</time_frame>
    <description>Participants will undergo a magnetic resonance spectroscopy scan from which hepatic fat content will be quantified. In the 1H-MRS spectra, the water signal, that is dominating the proton spectra, will be suppressed using frequency-selective pre-pulse and the spectra will be fitted to quantify the lipid peak. A separate spectrum will be measured without water suppression to quantify the unsuppressed water signal. The CH2/Water ratio will be used as parameter of intrahepatic lipid content.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Maximal Acetylcarnitine formation in the upper-leg at rest and after exercise assessed by Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy Scan</measure>
    <time_frame>1 hour</time_frame>
    <description>Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) will be used to guide the spectroscopy measurements and fine shimming will be performed to optimize the magnetic field homogeneity within the region of interest. A volume of interest will be selected within the m. vastus lateralis from the MRI images and the 1H-MRS spectra will be acquired from this region of interest. The intensity of the creatine signal will be used as internal reference.</description>
