  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to investigate the effect a specific exercise program on the
      incidence of injuries in the lower extremity. 72 elite orienteerers, aged 18-40 years, are
      allocated to an intervention or control group. The intervention group performs four specific
      exercises, four times a week (10 minutes per session) in conjunction with normal training.
      Injury data are collected every second week using valid injury questionnaire distributed by
      text messages over 14 weeks. Primary outcome is the incidence of substantial injuries in the
      lower extremity. Secondary outcomes are incidence of ankle sprains and the average
      substantial injury prevalence across the 14 weeks.

      The high physical load associated with running through uneven terrain contributes to that
      orienteerers are exposed to high injury risk, where the majority of injuries located in the
      lower extremities. Specific training programmes have been effective at reducing injury risk
      in sports. Yet, not trial has been conducted in elite orienteering. The aim of this study is
      to investigate the effect a specific exercise program on the incidence of injuries in the
      lower extremity. 72 elite orienteerers, aged 18-40 years, are allocated to an intervention or
      control group. The intervention group performs four specific exercises, with three difficult
      levels intensified every second week over the first four weeks, targeting strength,
      flexibility and coordination of the lower extremity. The exercises are completed four times a
      week (10 minutes per session) in conjunction with normal training. Injury data are collected
      every second week using valid injury questionnaire distributed by text messages over 14
      weeks. Primary outcome is the incidence of substantial injuries in the lower extremity.
      Secondary outcomes are incidence of ankle sprains and the average substantial injury
      prevalence across the 14 weeks. Participants will be recruited in January-February 2018. The
      intervention starts in February 2018 and data collection will be completed in June 2018. Data
      analyses are expected to be completed in October-November 2018.

      Due to high injury risk and lack of injury prevention trials in orienteering, a RCT
      investigating the effect of a specific exercise program on the incidence of injuries in the
      lower extremity, is warranted. The results of this trial will be beneficial to orienteerers,
      clubs, federations and increase our understanding on how lower extremity injuries can be
      prevented in a physically challenging sport.

    <description>The intervention consists of an exercise program developed by the medical team of the National Federation of Orienteering. Specifically, it consists of four exercises targeting strength, flexibility and coordination of the lower extremity. The orienteerers are asked to perform the exercises four times a week throughout the entire study period. The exercises are heel rises, runners pose, single leg stance and one-leg jumps with three difficult levels aiming to mainly improve lower extremity strength and neuromuscular function (online supplement). Each second week the exercises' difficulty level is increased.</description>
