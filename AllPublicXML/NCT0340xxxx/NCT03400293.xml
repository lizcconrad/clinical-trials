  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed to identify the burden associated with HIV and its treatment, and
      assess their health-related quality of life (HRQoL) by measuring key HRQoL domains, including
      satisfaction with treatment and care, and internalised stigma (ISAT). The study will also
      explore data for various important subpopulations such as subjects who are virally
      suppressed; who we anticipate will be the majority of study subjects. The study design is an
      observational, cross sectional study employing subjects' own mobile phone devices for data
      entry.

    <measure>Percentage of virally suppressed PLHIV reporting different HRQoL scores</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 1 Week</time_frame>
    <description>Evaluation of HRQoL will be conducted using scores achieved by Functional Assessment of HIV Infection (FAHI). QoL assessment will include physical well-being, social well-being, emotional well-being, functional and global well-being, and cognitive functioning</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of virally suppressed PLHIV reporting different satisfaction with care scores</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 1 Week</time_frame>
    <description>Evaluation of burden will include stigma, stigma, depression, and work productivity. The descriptive analysis will be assessed using Patient Satisfaction Questionnaire (PSQ)-18, Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ)-2, and ISAT scores</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percent difference in HRQoL scores among subject subgroups</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 1 Week</time_frame>
    <description>Subject subgroups are defined in terms of the following socio-demographic, clinical, and biomedical factors: a. Age: older versus. younger (i.e., &lt; 50 years old and over 50 years old) b. Gender (men / women / transgender) c. Race / ethnicity d. Sexual orientation (straight / gay / bisexual) e. Level of income f. Type of Insurance g. Apple (iPhone operating system) versus Android users h. Treatment regimen (e.g., number of pills per day, frequency of medication, single treatment regimen (STR) versus multiple treatment regimen (MTR) i. Diagnosis time / stage at which diagnosis was received (i.e. prompt vs. late diagnosis, time since diagnosis) j. Absence or presence (and number) of comorbidities k. Severity of symptoms (as assessed by the Symptom Distress Module patient reported outcome (PRO) instrument) l. Achievement of viral suppression.</description>
