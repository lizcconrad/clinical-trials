  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is one single group of participants with NSCLC who have not been cured by other
      treatments. It is the first time the drug has been used in humans, and will be in two parts.

      The primary purpose of the parts are:

        -  Dose Escalation: To investigate the safety and tolerability and to determine the maximum
           tolerated dose (MTD) and the recommended dose for expansion (RDE) of DS-1062a

        -  Dose Expansion: To investigate the safety and tolerability of DS-1062a

      This study is expected to last approximately 2.5 years from the time the first subject is
      enrolled to the time the last subject is off the study.

      The number of treatment cycles is not fixed in this study. Participants who continue to
      benefit from the study treatment may continue, unless:

        -  they withdraw

        -  their disease gets worse

        -  they experience unacceptable side effects.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The dosage strength will change during the study but all participants will receive the same
      study drug. So the study is not a true 2-arm study, it is a 2-part study.

      In both parts, subjects with pathologically documented unresectable advanced NSCLC who have
      been refractory to or relapsed from standard treatment or for which no standard treatment is
      available, will be enrolled. Additional solid tumors might be evaluated, if the study
      treatment demonstrates acceptable safety, tolerability and efficacy in NSCLC patients. After
      the primary analysis, the main (registered) study will be considered complete, but data will
      be collected from participants who continue receiving study drug.
