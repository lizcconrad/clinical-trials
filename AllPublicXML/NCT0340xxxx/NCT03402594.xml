  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hypoxemia is common in acute ischemic stroke and associated with neurological deterioration
      and mortality. However, the benefit of oxygen therapy is controversial. Severity of stroke
      may affect the benefit of oxygen supplementation. Abnormal breathing patterns are commonly
      found among stroke patients and may increase the risk of hypoxemia. High flow nasal cannula
      (HFNC) has several advantages from controllable fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2), reduction
      of nasopharyngeal resistance and positive end expiratory pressure effect. In this study, we
      aimed to assess the therapeutic effect of HFNC on oxygen desaturation index (ODI) and
      neurological outcomes in stroke patients with moderate and severe severities, compared with
      no and low flow oxygen supplementation.
