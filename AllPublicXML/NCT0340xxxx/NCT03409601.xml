  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study uses a crossover design in which the portion size of food is varied at each meal.
      Across four test meals, subjects will be served four different portions of food, and intake
      will be determined from pre- and post-meal food weights. The first visit will be a screening
      visit, at which subjects will complete the consent form, have their height and weight
      measured, and rate the taste of the study food. Test meals will be scheduled once a week for
      four weeks. At visits 2-5, subjects will eat lunch and rate characteristics of the meal. At
      visit 6, subjects will complete various questionnaires. The objective of this study is to
      determine whether any individual characteristics related to satiety influence the effect of
      portion size on intake.
