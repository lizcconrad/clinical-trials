    <textblock>
      This US study will assess hemophilia A patient characteristics, health history and reasons
      for switching or not switching from both patient/caregiver and physician perspectives. For
      this purpose, this research study will include hemophilia A: 1) patients who have switched
      from conventional therapy to new FVIII products with an improved PK profile. 2) patients who
      remain on conventional therapy (who have never switched) but have considered switching,
      including those patients who switched from conventional therapy to new FVIII products with
      improved pharmacokinetics and then subsequently &quot;switched back&quot; to conventional replacement
      therapy. In doing so, real world evidence will be obtained from both patient and physician
      perspectives offering key insights for effective therapeutic management of patients with
      hemophilia A and to more fully understand what drives patient switching from a patient
      perspective and a physician perspective.

        Hemophilia A patients/caregivers will be recruited via opt-in patient panels and/or
        research databases.
