    <textblock>
      Current guidelines recommend radiofrequency catheter ablation of the cavotricuspid isthmus as
      treatment for symptomatic/drug-refractory atrial flutter, in spite of the fact that
      recurrences of flutter and incidence of post-ablation atrial fibrillation are common.

      In this study, the investigators asses the hypothesis that the use of cryoballoon Pulmonary
      Vein Isolation ('novel' treatment) to achieve the electrical disconnection between the
      pulmonary veins and the heart will lead to higher rates of freedom from abnormal heart
      rhythms (atrial flutter, atrial fibrillation, or atrial tachycardia) and more improved
      quality of life than treatment using heat energy (radiofrequency ablation) directed at the
      cavotricuspid isthmus ('conventional treatment').

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Atrial flutter and atrial fibrillation are believed to share the same initiating triggers in
      the form of pulmonary vein ectopy. Cavo-tricuspid isthmus-dependent atrial flutter almost
      always results from short bursts of antecedent atrial fibrillation. Radiofrequency (RF)
      ablation of the cavo-tricuspid isthmus (CTI) is the current accepted first-line treatment for
      atrial flutter, although post-ablation atrial fibrillation commonly occurs, even in the
      absence of pre-existing atrial fibrillation.

      Cryoballoon Pulmonary Vein Isolation (PVI) has become an established treatment for atrial
      fibrillation. In patients with both atrial flutter and fibrillation, PVI alone has been shown
      to control both types of atrial arrhythmia, with no benefit derived from supplemental RF CTI
      ablation.

      This study aims to demonstrate that standalone cryoballoon PVI for typical atrial flutter
      without RF CTI ablation will lead to a significant difference in preventing recurrence of
      atrial arrhythmia compared to radiofrequency ablation of the CTI, and should be offered as
      first-line therapy.
