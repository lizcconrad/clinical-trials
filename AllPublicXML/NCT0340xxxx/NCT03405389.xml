    <textblock>
      Following standard of care (routine) procedures, a total number of 50 patients suffering from
      a non-condylar and/or condylar fractures of the mandible requiring Mandibulo-maxillary
      fixation (MMF) for a minimum of two weeks during or subsequent to open reduction internal
      fixation (ORIF) will be prospectively enrolled in this focused registry.

      Classification of the injury and the time needed for application of the MatrixWAVE MMF system
      will be collected. Follow-up visits will be performed between 2 to 6 weeks and 3 months
      according to standard of care to evaluate the mandible function impairment, pain and local
      complications (anticipated procedure-related adverse events) related to the MatrixWAVE MMF
      system.

          -  Any not medically managed severe systemic disease

          -  Recent history of substance abuse (i.e. recreational drugs, alcohol) that would
