  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this protocol is to refine the accuracy of proton beam therapy (PT) by the use of
      dual energy computed tomography (DECT), in conjunction with novel iterative image
      reconstruction algorithms, to more precisely determine the tissue properties through which
      the proton beam path travels.

    <description>Patients enrolling in this study will undergo additional sequential DECT scans in addition to their routine single-energy computed tomography (SECT) or TwinBeam DECT scans
In Arm A, patients are treated with treatment plans optimized and calculated on the SECT data. Plan dose is re-calculated for every patient with the clinical plan in a Monte Carlo dose calculation engine for better accuracy. The investigators will use TOPAS, an extension of Geant4 simulation toolkit, as the dose calculation engine.
Additional scans of the thorax or head-and-neck/brain will be acquired at 70 or 80 kVp and 140 kVp (with or without additional filter) prior to initiating proton therapy and at approximately two and four weeks after initiating therapy as well as at the conclusion of radiation therapy.</description>

    <description>Patients enrolling in this study will undergo additional sequential DECT scans in addition to their routine SECT or TwinBeam DECT scans
In Arm B1, DECT data is used to estimate the actual dose delivered using the clinical plan based on SECT data.
Additional scans of the thorax or head-and-neck/brain will be acquired at 70 or 80 kVp and 140 kVp (with or without additional filter) prior to initiating proton therapy and at approximately two and four weeks after initiating therapy as well as at the conclusion of radiation therapy.</description>

    <description>Patients enrolling in this study will undergo additional sequential DECT scans in addition to their routine SECT or TwinBeam DECT scans
In Arm B2, the plan is re-optimized on DECT data with the conventional uncertainty margin of 3.5% of proton range.</description>

    <description>Patients enrolling in this study will undergo additional sequential DECT scans in addition to their routine SECT or TwinBeam DECT scans
In Arm B3, the plan is re-optimized on DECT data with the SPR uncertainties derived from the patient-specific uncertainty model developed.
Additional scans of the thorax or head-and-neck/brain will be acquired at 70 or 80 kVp and 140 kVp (with or without additional filter) prior to initiating proton therapy and at approximately two and four weeks after initiating therapy as well as at the conclusion of radiation therapy.</description>

    <description>In addition to acquiring the medically-routine TwinBeam dual energy dataset, each patient subject will be scanned sequentially at two different beam energies (70 or 80 kVp and 140 kVp) as part of this research study. The sequential imaging protocol is needed because the TwinBeam system does not produce sufficiently separated low- and high-energy x-ray spectra to accurately map proton stopping power ratios. A slight modification will be introduced to the CT scanner by adding a customized tin filter to produce further differentiation between high and low energy spectra.</description>
