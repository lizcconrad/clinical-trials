  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this pilot study, menthol cigarette smokers will be randomized to one of three
      experimental marketplaces: 1) a condition simulating a ban on menthol cigarettes but not
      menthol e-cigarettes (condition A); 2) a condition simulating a ban on both menthol
      cigarettes and menthol e-cigarettes (Condition B); and 3) a condition in which menthol is not
      banned for either product (Condition C - the control condition). All conditions would have
      medicinal nicotine available if subjects decide to quit tobacco products entirely. At visits
      occurring every two weeks over a 6 week period, subjects will receive &quot;credits&quot; that they
      could exchange for any product available in their randomized marketplace condition. Outcomes
      include the amount of each tobacco product used.
