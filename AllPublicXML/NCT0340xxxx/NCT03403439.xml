  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this trial is to investigate whether and to what extent
      co-administration of multiple doses of itraconazole affect single dose pharmacokinetics of
      BI1015550, i.e. to compare the relative bioavailability of 6 mg BI 1015550 when given alone
      (reference, treatment R) to the relative bioavailability of 6 mg of BI 1015550 given on the
      4th day of a 12-day-treatment with itraconazole (test, treatment T) following oral
      administration in healthy male subjects.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Healthy male subjects according to the assessment of the investigator, based on a
             complete medical history including a physical examination, vital signs (BP (Blood
             Pressure), PR (Pulse Rate)), 12-lead ECG (Electrocardiogram), and clinical laboratory
             tests

          -  Age of 18 to 55 years (incl.)

          -  BMI of 18.5 to 29.9 kg/m2 (incl.)

          -  Signed and dated written informed consent prior to admission to the study in
             accordance with GCP and local legislation

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Any finding in the medical examination (including BP (Blood Pressure), PR (Pulse Rate)
             or ECG (Electrocardiogram)) is deviating from normal and judged as clinically relevant
             by the investigator

          -  Repeated measurement of systolic blood pressure outside the range of 90 to 140 mmHg,
             diastolic blood pressure outside the range of 50 to 90 mmHg, or pulse rate outside the
             range of 45 to 90 bpm (beats per minute)

          -  Any laboratory value outside the reference range that the investigator considers to be
             of clinical relevance

          -  Any evidence of a concomitant disease judged as clinically relevant by the
             investigator

          -  Gastrointestinal, hepatic, renal, respiratory, cardiovascular, metabolic,
             immunological or hormonal disorders

          -  Cholecystectomy and/or surgery of the gastrointestinal tract that could interfere with
             the pharmacokinetics of the trial medication (except appendectomy and simple hernia
             repair)

          -  Diseases of the central nervous system (including but not limited to any kind of
             seizures or stroke), and other relevant neurological or psychiatric disorders,
             including but not limited to mood disorders and any history of suicidality.

          -  History of relevant orthostatic hypotension, fainting spells, or blackouts

          -  Chronic or relevant acute infections

          -  History of relevant allergy or hypersensitivity (including allergy to the trial
             medication or its excipients or other Azoles )

          -  Use of drugs within 30 days prior to administration of trial medication if that might
             reasonably influence the results of the trial (incl. QT/QTc interval prolongation)

          -  Participation in another trial where an investigational drug has been administered
             within 60 days prior to planned administration of trial medication, or current
             participation in another trial involving administration of investigational drug

          -  Further exclusion criteria apply
