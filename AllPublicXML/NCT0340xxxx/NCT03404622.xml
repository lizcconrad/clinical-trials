  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of current study is to compare the rates of IUCD expulsion and complications in
      immediate post-placental insertion versus delayed IUCD insertion (6-weeks after cesarean
      delivery)

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Intrauterine devices (IUDs) are among the most effective forms of contraception, offering
      greater than 99% efficacy per year of use and are completely reversible .

      Post-placental intrauterine device (IUD) insertion is a safe, convenient, and effective
      option for postpartum contraception. &quot;Post-placental&quot; refers to insertion within 10-15
      minutes of placental delivery, after vaginal or cesarean delivery.

    <description>The time until expulsion of the IUD will be defined as the time from insertion until expulsion occurred, if known. If the date of expulsion is not known, this will be documented as the day after the IUD was last known to be in place. If a pregnancy is detected and the IUD is absent (and the participant was unaware of expulsion), the expulsion will be assumed to have occurred at the time of conception, as determined by gestational age on ultrasound. Expulsions will be measured as total expulsions and separately noted whether complete or partial</description>
