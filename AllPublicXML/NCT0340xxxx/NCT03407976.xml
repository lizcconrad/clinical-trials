      This is an open label nonrandomized Phase I/ IIA trial designed to assess the safety,
      tolerability, and efficacy of apatinib in combination with pembrolizumab. Phase I will assess
      the safety of combining increasing oral daily doses of apatinib with a fixed dose of IV
      pembrolizumab every three weeks and will determine the RP2D (Recommended Phase 2 Dose). Phase
      II will assess the efficacy of the RP2D of apatinib in combination with pembrolizumab and
      provide additional safety and tolerability data in three disease-specific cohorts

          -  Known prior severe hypersensitivity to investigational product or any component in its
             formulations, including known severe hypersensitivity reactions to monoclonal
