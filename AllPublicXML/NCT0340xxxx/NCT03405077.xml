  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Interpersonal psychotherapy (IPT) is an evidence-based therapy for the treatment of eating
      disorders (including binge eating disorder, bulimia nervosa, and disordered eating not
      meeting full diagnostic criteria). On a basic level, IPT is a time-limited treatment that
      helps the client understand the relationship between symptoms and social interactions.
      Traditional training methods require substantial cost, time, and resources, making
      evidence-based treatments difficult to disseminate. As such, college clinicians are not
      typically trained in IPT delivery, which prevents their clients from reaping the potential
      benefits of treatment. This study will attempt to show how technology can overcome such
      barriers to training dissemination.

      The purpose of this study is to see if online training in IPT is as effective as in-person
      training. To find out, the following procedures will occur: First, college mental health
      clinicians will complete baseline online questionnaires and deliver their usual treatment to
      1 or 2 clients with symptoms of eating disorders. Then, they will complete the guided online
      training program and post-training assessments. Next, they will treat 1 or 2 different
      clients with eating disorders and complete post-training assessments. As part of the baseline
      and post-training assessments, clinicians will complete a telephone-based simulation
      assessment with staff raters, in which the investigators will recreate a client session and
      rate how well the clinicians adhere to IPT in treating the simulated client. The guided
      on-line training program will ultimately be compared to the &quot;gold standard&quot; training (the
      group receiving in-person training in an associated, IRB-approved study, # 201111113).

    <description>Therapists in this study will be trained in IPT using an online platform. The program is self-paced but will have a deadline; the suggested pace is at least 12 hours spaced over 2 months. The guided online training program was developed in collaboration with 3C institute, an award-winning research and development company that creates web- and evidence-based programs. Content will be adapted from &quot;gold-standard&quot; training.</description>
