  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There are limited evidence-based treatments for adolescents with binge eating and fewer
      specifically targeting adolescents with both binge eating and overweight/obesity. The
      existing research for adolescents with overweight/obesity and loss of control (LOC) eating
      supports a stepped-care model of treatment in which enhanced behavioral weight loss treatment
      is the first line of treatment followed by more intensive therapeutic treatment for
      individuals with remaining emotional eating difficulties. Thus, in this proposed study, the
      investigators will systematically develop a stepped-care protocol and manualized
      interventions for adolescents with LOC and binge eating behaviors. The investigators will
      then evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of the interventions in a pilot trial and
      gather preliminary outcome data to inform development of a subsequent randomized controlled
      trial.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Binge eating affects a significant number of adolescents. Among adolescents seeking obesity
      treatment, rates of binge eating behavior range from 20-36%. Studies of non-treatment seeking
      adolescents have also identified high rates of binge eating, suggesting that this behavior is
      not exclusive to clinical samples. Moreover, as in adults, binge eating in youth is
      associated with numerous psychosocial problems, including depression, anxiety, low
      self-esteem, body dissatisfaction and weight concern.

      Stepped-care models provide a lower intensity treatment and modify subsequent treatment
      intensity based on early treatment response. A stepped-care model would build upon the
      clinical treatment resources already established at the study site.

      In this study, the investigators will conduct a small pilot of the stepped-care model. All
      participants will begin with the same initial treatment, an introductory behavioral weight
      loss group for parents and adolescents with abnormal weight gain and/or overweight/obesity.
      Early responders will continue in this treatment for an additional 12 weeks. Participants who
      show a weaker early response will be assigned to a higher intensity individualized treatment.
      All participants will receive 16 weeks of treatment.Assessments will occur at three time
      points: prior to intervention (baseline), mid-treatment (4 weeks), and end of treatment (16
      weeks). The investigators will assess the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary
      effectiveness of the stepped care approach. These data will inform the development of a
      subsequent RCT.

    <description>This intervention is grounded in Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT), Dialectical Behavioral Therapy (DBT), and Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT). The core elements include regulating eating patterns, self-monitoring, developing openness to an acceptance perspective, fostering a willingness to accept distress, teaching defusion from distressing thoughts and feelings, practicing mindful awareness, fostering self-as-context, and directing patients towards clarifying and focusing on life values. Self-monitoring of eating behaviors and emotions are encouraged using a free app that facilitates electronic self-monitoring of eating patterns and symptoms. For participants who elect not to use this app, paper self-monitoring records are provided.</description>
