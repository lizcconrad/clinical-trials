  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Breast cancer is rarely curable after metastasis, and the therapeutic options are limited.
      Interestingly, the host immune response is strongly predictive for the effect of chemotherapy
      in subgroups of patients with breast cancer. The aim is to release the brake on the immune
      response by use of ipilimumab, which blocks CTLA-4 and may deplete regulatory T cells,
      combined with nivolumab (anti PD1). Importantly, it is possible that non-responders to
      nivolumab/ipilimumab (nivo/ipi) can be turned responders by use of immunogenic chemotherapy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There is compelling evidence from animal studies, supported by data from humans, that some
      chemotherapeutic agents are immunogenic. Doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide have been shown to
      be particularly powerful inducers of immunogenic cell death. Both agents fulfil 5/5 criteria
      established for assessing the immunogenicity of different chemotherapeutic drugs. There is
      also strong evidence from humans, particularly in breast cancer, indicating that the clinical
      effect of doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide depends on the host immune response. Further,
      these agents have been shown to induce a Type I interferon immune response in breast cancer.
      Taken together, there is a strong rationale for synergy between doxorubicin/cyclophosphamide
      and PD-1/CTLA-4 blockade. The trial combines nivolumab and ipilimumab with established 1st
      choice chemotherapy in patients with metastatic luminal B breast cancer. Nivolumab/ipilimumab
      (nivo/ipi) may i) potentiate the patient´s spontaneous anti-tumor immune response ii)
      synergize with chemotherapeutic agents that induce immunological cell death

             be required

         14. Female subjects of childbearing potential should agree to remain abstinent (refrain
             from heterosexual intercourse) or use contraceptive methods that result in a failure
             rate of &lt; 1% per year, during the treatment period and for at least 5 months after the

             reccommendations by the treating physician.

          5. Uncontrolled pleural effusion, pericardial effusion, or ascites. Patients with
             indwelling catheters (e.g., PleurX®) are allowed

          6. Uncontrolled tumor-related pain. Patients requiring narcotic pain medication must be
             on a stable regimen at study entry. Symptomatic lesions (e.g., bone metastases or
             metastases causing nerve impingement) amenable to palliative radiotherapy should be
             treated prior to randomization. Asymptomatic metastatic lesions whose further growth
             would likely cause functional deficits or intractable pain (e.g., epidural metastasis

             coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure not meeting the above criteria, or
             LVEF &lt; 50% must be on a stable medical regimen that is optimized in the opinion of the
             treating physician, in consultation with a cardiologist if appropriate

         11. Severe infection within 21 days prior to randomization, requiring hospitalization

         12. Received oral or IV antibiotics within 1 week prior to Cycle 1, Day 1. Patients
             receiving routine antibiotic prophylaxis (e.g., to prevent chronic obstructive
             pulmonary disease exacerbation or for dental extraction) are eligible

         13. Major surgical procedure within 21 days prior to randomization or anticipation of the
             need for a major surgical procedure during the course of the study other than for
             diagnosis. Placement of central venous access catheter(s) is not considered a major
             surgical procedure and is therefore permitted

             chimeric or humanized antibodies or fusion proteins

         15. Known hypersensitivity to any of the components of the investigational products

             years (i.e. with use of disease modifying agents, corticosteroids or immunosuppressive
             drugs). Replacement therapy (e.g., thyroxin, insulin, or physiologic corticosteroid
             replacement therapy for adrenal or pituitary insufficiency, etc.) is not considered a
             form of systemic treatment. Patients with eczema, psoriasis, lichen simplex chronicus
             or vitiligo with dermatologic manifestations only (e.g., no psoriatic arthritis) are
             permitted provided that they meet all of the following conditions:

               1. Rash must cover less than 10% of body surface area.

               2. Disease is well controlled at baseline and only requiring low potency topical

         17. Undergone allogeneic stem cell or solid organ transplantation

         18. A history of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (including pneumonitis), drug-induced
             pneumonitis, organizing pneumonia (i.e., bronchiolitis obliterans, cryptogenic
             organizing pneumonia), or evidence of active pneumonitis on screening chest CT scan.
             History of radiation pneumonitis in the radiation field (fibrosis) is permitted

         20. Active hepatitis B (defined as having a positive hepatitis B surface antigen [HBsAg]
             test at screening) or hepatitis C. Patients with past hepatitis B virus (HBV)
             infection or resolved HBV infection (defined as having a negative HBsAg test and a
             positive antibody to hepatitis B core antigen [anti-HBc] antibody test) are eligible.
             Patients positive for hepatitis C virus (HCV) antibody are eligible only if polymerase
             chain reaction (PCR) is negative for HCV RNA

         21. Active tuberculosis

         22. Currently receiving study therapy or has participated in a study of an investigational

             medications (including but not limited to prednisone, dexamethasone, cyclophosphamide,
             azathioprine, methotrexate, thalidomide, and anti−tumor necrosis factor [TNF] agents)
             within 2 weeks prior to randomization, or anticipated requirement for systemic
             immunosuppressive medications during the trial

               1. Patients who have received acute, low-dose, systemic immunosuppressant
                  medications (e.g., a one-time dose of dexamethasone for nausea) may be enrolled
                  in the study

               2. Patients with a history of allergic reaction to IV contrast requiring steroid

         27. A history or current evidence of any condition, therapy, or laboratory abnormality
             that might confound the results of the trial, interfere with the subject's
             participation for the full duration of the trial, or is not in the best interest of
             the subject to participate, in the opinion of the treating Investigator

         28. Known psychiatric or substance abuse disorders that would interfere with cooperation
             and the requirements of the trial

         29. Received a live vaccine within 30 days of planned start of study therapy, or is
