  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized single-blind, placebo-controlled, Phase 1, single ascending dose (SAD)
      and repeat dose (RD), safety and tolerability study of AVB-S6-500 in healthy subjects. A SAD
      portion of the study consists of 4 sequential dose escalation cohorts, whereas RD portion of
      the study consists of a single cohort receiving 4 weekly doses of AVB-S6-500. In both SAD and
      RD study arms, subjects are randomized to receive either a study intervention (AVB-S6-500) or
      matching placebo.
