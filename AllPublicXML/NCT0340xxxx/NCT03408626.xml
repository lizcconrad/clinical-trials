  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will be conducted to assess the efficacy of caries excavation using the
      papain-based chemo-mechanical method (Brix 3000) in comparison to conventional rotary tools
      in the reduction of the bacterial population in occlusal carious cavities
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Twenty-three patients who will fulfill the inclusion criteria will be enrolled to the study.
      For every patient two contra-lateral class I carious molars will be selected, so the total
      number of included molars will be 46 molars. One contra-lateral molar will be randomly
      assigned to the chemo-mechanical (Brix 3000) caries removal technique and the other will be
      assigned to the conventional rotary one. From every molar two dentin specimens will be
      collected (baseline and after excavation) with a total of 92 samples

    <description>Birx 3000 and the exclusive Encapsulating Buffer Emulsifier (EBE) technology claim it has effective and selective proteolytic action to remove collagen fiber in the carious tissue. It has an antibacterial and antifungal power, thus it has an antiseptic power at the tissue level .furthermore, this gel does not contain chloramines in its formula, which enhances its toxicological safety feature.</description>
