  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Rationale Prolonged mechanical ventilation (MV) is common in patients with severe Brain
      Injury (BI). Guidelines for the management of extubation are largely lacking for patients
      with BI, and the role of tracheostomy is highly uncertain. More important, data on practice
      of management of extubation is yet underreported, as is the use of tracheotomy in this
      specific subset of critical care patients.

      Objective The objective of this prospective observational study is to describe the management
      of extubation and tracheostomy in intensive care unit (ICU) patients with BI. The aim is to
      describe the incidence of extubation failure and the rate of tracheostomy.

      Study design The &quot;Extubation strategies in Neuro-Intensive care unit patients, and
      associations with Outcomes (ENIO)&quot; is an observational multicentre international cohort
      study.

      Study population The investigators will include patients undergoing BI, with an initial
      Glasgow Coma Score ≤ 12 and with a delivered duration of mechanical ventilation (MV) ≥ 24
      hours at ICU admission. The inclusion period will last 6 months in total, and each centre is
      expected to include at least 24 patients during this period. With over 60 ICUs participating
      worldwide, we expect to include 1500 patients.

      Main parameters Parameters to be collected include: general neurological management,
      ventilatory management, general ICU complications, specific data on extubation and
      tracheostomy, general in-ICU outcomes and in-hospital mortality.

      Nature and extent of the burden and risks associated with participation Because of the
      observational design of the study using routinely collected data, there is no additional
      burden for the patient. Collection of data from ICU charts and/or (written or electronic)
      medical records systems bears no risk to the patients.
