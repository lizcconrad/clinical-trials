  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase I study to investigate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK) and
      pharmacodynamics (PD) of the novel compound, AZD5718 in healthy Japanese men. The results
      from this study will form the basis for decisions on future studies.

    <textblock>
      This study will be a Phase 1, randomized, single-blind, placebo-controlled, single and
      multiple ascending dose sequential group design in up to 48 healthy male Japanese subjects,
      performed at a single study center. The planned number of cohorts is 4 but up to 6 cohorts
      may be included if the Safety Review Committee (SRC) considers it necessary to repeat a dose
      level or if additional dose steps are required. Screening will be completed between Days -28
      and -1. Primarily gradual escalation of the dose will be conducted with the oral suspension.
      Eight subjects will participate in each cohort. Four ascending dose levels are planned.
      Within each cohort 6 subjects will be randomised to receive AZD5718 and 2 subjects randomised
      to receive placebo. Each subject will receive one dose of AZD5718 or placebo on the first
      dosing day (Day 1, single ascending dose, SAD) and on Days 3 to 10 (multiple ascending dose,
      MAD). On Day 2 no dose will be given to the subject. In total each subject will receive 9
      doses. Dosing for each ascending dose cohort will proceed after the SRC has evaluated the
      safety, tolerability and other relevant data of a completed cohort. The subjects will stay at
      the study site until 48 hours post-dose and will return 7 to 10 days after dosing for a
      follow-up visit. Each subject will be involved in the study for 7 weeks.

    <description>To assess any clinically important abnormalities in the cardiovascular system functioning as a variable of safety and tolerability of AZD5718 following oral administration of single and multiple ascending doses. A 12-lead 10-second safety ECG will be performed with the Schiller Cardiovit CS-200 recorder immediately following all scheduled dECGs. 12-lead continuous dECG will be recorded over at least 5 minutes with the Schiller Cardiovit CS-200 recorder and transmitted to the AstraZeneca central dECG repository, according to AstraZeneca ECG Center´s standard procedures for settings, recording, and transmission of dECGs. For dECG, QTcF (QT interval corrected for heart rate using Fridericia's formula) will be calculated as QTcF =(QT*(RR/1000)^(-1/3)), where RR (the time between corresponding points on 2 consecutive R waves on ECG) is presented in milliseconds. Heart rate (HR) will also be calculated, based on the RR interval.</description>

             excluded from other aspects of the study described in this protocol.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. History of any clinically important disease or disorder which, in the opinion of the
             Investigator, may either put the subject at risk because of participation in the
             study, or influence the results or the subject's ability to participate in the study.

          2. History or presence of gastrointestinal, hepatic or renal disease or any other
             condition known to interfere with absorption, distribution, metabolism or excretion of

             resting ECG and any clinically important abnormalities at screening and check-in in
             the 12-Lead ECG as considered by the Investigator that may interfere with the
             interpretation of QTc interval changes, including abnormal ST-T-wave morphology,
             particularly in the protocol defined primary lead or left ventricular hypertrophy. If

             e.g., ventricular hypertrophy or pre-excitation, at screening and check-in. If deemed
             necessary, an ECG may be repeated once for each ECG measurement.

         13. Known or suspected history of drug abuse as judged by the Investigator.

         14. Current smokers or those who have smoked or used nicotine products (including

             they have any ongoing or recent (i.e., during the Screening period) minor medical
