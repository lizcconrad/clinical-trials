  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The presence of an adnexal mass is a frequent reason for a woman to be referred to a
      gynaecologist. The discrimination between benign and malignant adnexal masses is central to
      decisions regarding clinical management and surgical planning in such patients. Patients with
      malignant tumours should be referred to a gynaecological oncologist, as the quality of
      cytoreductive surgery and surgical staging/lymph node dissection are important prognostic
      factors in ovarian cancer. These specialized surgical procedures require the specific skills
      and experience provided by gynaecologic oncology surgeons. Furthermore, appropriate and
      timely referral to a gynaecologic oncologist has been proven to increase survival in patients
      with ovarian cancer.Conversely, patients believed to have a benign mass requiring surgery are
      able to have this performed by a general gynaecologist. A standardized method for
      preoperative identification of probable malignant masses would allow optimization of
      first-line treatment for women with ovarian cancer. A risk of malignancy index would be
      valuable for the selective referral of relevant patients to specialized oncology centres.
      Currently, clinical examination, ultrasound assessment, and assays of tumour markers are part
      of the standard work-up for an adnexal mass. Although none of these indicators alone is very
      sensitive or specific for detecting malignancy, an index developed by Jacobs et al.
      incorporates information about the patient's menopausal status and serum Cancer antigen A-125
      levels, and ultrasound characteristics of the mass to predict the risk of malignancy with
      greater sensitivity and specificity than any one factor alone.Some of the potential
      advantages of risk malignant index include rapid triage of patients through the referral
      system and fewer operations for benign masses being performed by gynaecologic oncologists.
