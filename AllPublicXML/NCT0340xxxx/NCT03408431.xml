    <textblock>
      In a previous study, NCT03147469, the investigators found that the vocal cords were more
      easily visualized by fiberoptic bronchoscopy with neck extension positioning. On the basis of
      this finding, the investigators are going to conduct a randomized controlled trial to
      evaluate the effect of neck extension on the success rate of blind intubation through
      laryngeal mask.

      Participants undergoing general anesthesia will be randomly assigned to group E (with neck
      extension) or group C (with neutral position). Ambu® AuraGain™ laryngeal mask will be placed
      first, and then, a lubricated endotracheal tube will be gently intubated through the
      laryngeal mask. The participants will be mechanically ventilated with an endotracheal tube if
      blind intubation succeed. Blind intubation will be performed with a maximum of two attempts.
      If all attempts failed, the laryngeal mask will be removed and the tube will be intubated
      using a direct laryngoscopy.

      The primary outcome of this study is the success rate of blind intubation within a first
      attempt. Secondary outcomes included overall success rate of blind intubation within a
      maximum of two attempts, time for blind intubation, the incidence of postoperative
      hoarseness, cough, and sore throat, and any obvious complications related to airway
      management such as bleeding, airway trauma, dental fracture, aspiration, or bronchospasm.
