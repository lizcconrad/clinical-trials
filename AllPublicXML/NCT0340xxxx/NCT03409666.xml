  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single center, prospective, randomized controlled study. The primary objective of
      this study is to measure migration over two years with RSA. Patients will be randomized in
      two arms, receiving a Taperloc Complete Reduced Distal or a Taperloc Complete Microplasty hip
      stem.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A total of 50 patients will be enrolled into the study, randomized 1:1. All patients will
      receive a G7 limited hole acetabular cup with E1 liner.

      All potential study subjects will be required to participate in the Informed Consent process.
