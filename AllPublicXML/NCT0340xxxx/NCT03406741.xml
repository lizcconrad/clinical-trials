  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hirschsprung's disease (HD) is a rare congenital disease (1:5000) characterized by neonatal
      functional low bowel obstruction that is caused by aganglionosis of the distal bowel. HD
      treatment consists in surgery of colonic reduction in the early childhood, requiring
      afterward a long-term follow-up. In the long term complications (incontinence, constipation,
      enterocolitis, soiling)but also iterative anesthesia in childhood and repeated
      hospitalizations can have negative effects on child's development.

      The main aim of the study is to estimate neuropsychological development at school age (6-10
      years). Of children operated of HD Secondary aims are evaluation of the neuro-driving
      development and global health, comparison of quality of life levels to those of French
      population standards as well as to study the complex relations between on one hand the
      quality of life of these children and on the other hand the socio-demographic data, the
      initial clinical elements and the surgical coverage, as well as their health and current
      cognitive profile.

      This multicenter study included pediatric surgery departments of Marseille. All children born
      between 1/1/2005 and 31/12/2010 and presenting HD represent the population. All the families
      will be contacted resting on the networks of set up follow-up. A written agreement will be
      collected with the parents. For all the participating children, a consultation will be
      organized: quality of life data (reported by children and by their parents in validated
      standardized questionnaires), clinical examination of the child, cognitive profile of the
      child. The duration of inclusion is scheduled for 12 months.

      This is the first French study using auto-reported data on children's quality of life at
      school age affected by a HD. The results of this study will allow developing hypotheses on
      predictive risk factors for neuropsychological development disorders. Besides a better
      knowledge of the relation existing between these children quality of life and their
      functional results due to the disease could help clinicians in their medical reflections.

    <measure>Evaluation of child behavior by the Goodman questionnaire: Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ).</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>It includes 25 questions that are asked to parents. It is used within research, evaluating treatment outcome and as part of clinical assessment in order to examine a child's mental well-being. A total difficulties score is calculated using the SDQ, which ranges from 0-40. Each 1 point increase in the total difficulties score corresponds with an increase in the risk of developing a mental health disorder. Categories have been proposed by Youth in Mind authors in order to assess whether a child's score is close to average, slightly above average, high or very high.</description>
