  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will see whether the addition of more frequent planning CTs during the course of
      radiation, and of Positron Emission Tomography (PET), a diagnostic test similar to CT, prior
      to and during a course of radiation may provide information that could potentially be used
      during the treatment to improve the initial radiation plan.

    <description>PET Imaging requires the use of an investigational drug, a radioactively-labelled sugar called 18F-Fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG). FDG is glucose labelled with a radioactive fluorine atom. It is given by intravenous injection and is particularly absorbed by cancer cells. The radioactive signal given off by the FDG can then be detected by the PET scanner providing an image of the cancer (or tumour).</description>
