    <description>BAY2402234 is a potent and selective small molecule inhibitor of dihydroorotate dehydrogenase. A solution of BAY2402234 will be available to initiate the trial and there are plans to transition to a tablet form of BAY2402234 once it becomes available. Both liquid and tablet formulations of BAY2402234 will be continually administered once daily by mouth in 28 day cycles.</description>

             achieving a response to initial therapy and refractory AML is defined as failure to
             achieve a response after one previous line of therapy. Response is defined as per IWG
             criteria (CR, CRi or CRp). Patients who are not candidates to receive or who decline
             standard of care therapy are also eligible.

          -  Patients with intermediate-1 or higher risk MDS who have failed therapy with a
             hypomethylating agent, or have failed lenalidomide therapy if harboring a
             5q-chromosomal deletion.

          -  Patients with relapsed/refractory CMML.

          -  Estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) &gt; 40 mL per 1.73 m*2

          -  Patients must have adequate coagulation (international normalized ratio [INR] ≤ 1.5,
             activated partial thromboplastin time [aPTT] ≤1.5 X the upper limit of normal [ULN])

          -  Adequate liver function (total bilirubin ≤1.5 X ULN (or ≤3 X ULN in patients with
             documented Gilbert's syndrome or for patients with hyperbilirubinemia considered due
             to myeloid disease), alanine aminotransferase [ALT] and aspartate aminotransferase
             [AST] ≤3 X ULN (or ≤5 X ULN for patients with liver involvement of their myeloid
             disease)

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients eligible for hematopoietic stem cell transplantation

          -  Clinical symptoms suggesting active central nervous system (CNS) leukemia or known CNS
             leukemia

          -  Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection

          -  Chronic or active hepatitis B or C if not controlled by antiviral therapy

          -  History of organ allograft (allogeneic bone marrow or stem cell transplant) within 4
             months prior to first dose of study drug

          -  Serious, uncontrolled infection requiring systemic antibiotic, antifungal or antiviral
             therapy. Prophylactic antibiotic, antifungal and/or antiviral therapy is permitted

          -  Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) &lt;40%
