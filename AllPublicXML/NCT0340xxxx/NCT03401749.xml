    <textblock>
      Intervention: This study will involve three different study arms with different interventions
      prior to surgery: (1) shower only, (2) shower plus Theraworx wipes, (3) shower plus
      chlorhexidine wipes

      Study Design: Single center RCT

      Sample Size: 500 patients, aged 18+

      Objectives: Primary Objectives:

        1. Monitor for safety and adverse effects.

        2. Evaluate for differences in peri-operative skin cultures between treatment groups;

        3. Compare surgical site infection rates between groups.

      Secondary Objectives:

        1. Assess for patient compliance for each different treatment arms.

        2. Measure patient satisfaction.

        3. Measure nurse satisfaction.

        4. Visual assessment of wound healing

      Expected Results: We expect no statistically significant difference in peri-operative
      cultures or surgical site infection rates between groups.

    <description>Theraworx TM is a cosmetic product that is a non-rinse skin formulation that combines multiple ingredients, including Aloe Concentrate, Allantoin, Tego Betaine F 50, Tego Betaine L-7, Lauryl Glucoside, Abil 8852, Vitamin E, Natural Fragrances, Methyl paraben, Propyl paraben, EDTA, Antimicrobial Preservative, Colloidal Silver, and Beta Glucan, in preoperative disposable bath wipes. The main proposed antimicrobial mechanism of action involves the local reduction in skin pH to around 4.6.</description>
