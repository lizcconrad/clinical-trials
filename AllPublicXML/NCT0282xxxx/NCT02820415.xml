      Oocyte accumulation by vitrification is a valid strategy to increase the number of available
      embryos for biopsy and the number of viable euploid embryos to transfer after preimplantation
      genetic testing.

      In the present study, the investigators considered the hypothesis to accumulate vitrified
      oocytes with a view to increasing the number of oocytes for micro-injection and consequently
      the number of blastocyst to diagnose for patients with normal ovarian reserve and candidate
      for PGT. The partecipants were proposed to undergo several cycles of ovarian stimulation. In
      the first cycles, mature (metaphase II) oocytes were vitrified and consequently accumulated.
      In the last cycle, the freshly produced mature oocytes and the previously accumulated ones
      were micro-injected together with the same partner's semen sample. PGT was performed on
      blastocysts produced from the two sources of oocytes. The comprehensive chromosomal analysis
      of biopsied trophectoderm cells was performed using NGS technology. The number of available
      euploid blastocyst and the proportion of euploid/aneuploidy embryos from fresh and
      vitrified/warmed oocytes were compared. In conclusion the investigators evaluated the
      efficacy of oocyte accumulation by vitrification in increasing the number of available
      embryos for biopsy and the number of viable euploid embryos to transfer after PGT.

    <description>patients aged between 29.0 and 42.3 years, with basal FSH on day 3 between 2.9 and 12.0 IU/l. Undergoing 36 patients for RIF or RM. In each couple, the two partners had a normal karyotype. The patients underwent one to two cycles of ovarian stimulation to vitrify and accumulate oocytes and a last (second or third) cycle of ovarian stimulation. Ovarian stimulation was performed by the administration of recombinant FSH and LH (Gonal-F and Luveris: Merck-Serono, London, UK or Puregon, MSD, Franklin Lakes, USA) from cycle day 3 and luteal gonadotrophin-releasing hormone antagonist flexible schema (Cetrotide : Merck-Serono, London, UK).</description>
