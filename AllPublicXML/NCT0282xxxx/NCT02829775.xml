      This open label extension study will give an opportunity to the participants that have
      responded to the treatment with Pegylated-Interferon Alfa-2a (Pegasys) or Recombinant
      Interferon Alfa-2a (Roferon-A®) in prior clinical studies NO15753 (NCT00003542) for Renal
      Cell Carcinoma (RCC), NO15764 (NCT number not available) and NO16006 (NCT02736721) for
      Chronic Myelogenous Leukemia (CML), and NO16007 (NCT number not available) for Malignant
      Melanoma (MM).
