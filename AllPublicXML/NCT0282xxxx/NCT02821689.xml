  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Interstitial lung disease (ILD) is a common complication of dermatomyositis (DM) with
      prevalence up to 65%, and is considered to be one of the determining factors of prognosis.
      Clinical amyopathic dermatomyositis (CADM), which is a special phenotype of DM, with
      characteristic cutaneous manifestations but no or only subclinical myopathy. Many studies,
      mainly from Asia, including ours, have demonstrated that these patients with CADM tend to
      develop a rapidly progressive ILD (RPILD) and have a poor response to conventional therapy,
      such as high-dose corticosteroids and immunosuppressants, leading to lethal outcome with a
      6-month survival rate of less than 50%.

      Pirfenidone, a new oral antifibrotic agent, has been approved for the treatment of idiopathic
      pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). Randomized controlled trials of pirfenidone in patients with IPF
      suggested that it could ameliorate pulmonary function decline and improve the
      progression-free survival. Its utility in connective tissue disease (CTD) related ILD has
      been implicated, but no evidence has yet demonstrated its efficacy. Therefore, the
      investigators conduct this study to evaluate the possible therapeutic effects of pirfenidone
      on RPILD associated with CADM.

    <description>Eligible participants for clinical trial were randomized in a 2:1 ratio to pirfenidone/blank add-on. Pirfenidone was administered in three divided doses (200mg tid), and increased to the manufacturer's instructed target dose (600mg tid) over a 2-week period. Investigators were allowed to adjust the dose according to the participants' tolerance.</description>
