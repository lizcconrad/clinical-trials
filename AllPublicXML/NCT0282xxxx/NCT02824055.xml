  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, three period crossover
      study to evaluate the effects of RO5545965 on the functioning of key brain circuitry involved
      in negative symptoms using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and reward-based
      learning in stable participants with mild to moderate negative symptoms of schizophrenia
      treated with antipsychotics. Participants will be randomized to one of six different
      sequences during which each participant will receive three 3-week treatment courses with
      RO5545965 5 milligrams (mg), RO5545965 15 mg and placebo. Each treatment period will be
      separated by a washout period of 14 days. Total duration of study will be approximately 17
      weeks.
