  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed to evaluate the addition of ketamine to dexmedetomidine as adjunctive
      therapies of severe alcohol withdrawal in medical ICU patients. Specifically, this study will
      assess whether the combination of ketamine and dexmedetomidine reduces the doses of
      conventional agents used for alcohol withdrawal while maintaining patient comfort and safety
      and will explore if the combination alters the expression of catecholamines in the serum over
      time.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The combination of ketamine and dexmedetomidine for alcohol withdrawal is pharmacologically
      rationale and may provide additive benzodiazepine-sparing effects. All subjects will receive
      benzodiazepine therapy as standard of care.

      The objectives of this randomized, double-blind pilot study of 20 subjects with severe
      alcohol withdrawal are to a) determine if adding ketamine 0.5 mg/kg per hour to
      dexmedetomidine 0.6 µg/kg per hour (both agents administered for up to 72 hours) as
      adjunctive therapies to a symptom-triggered benzodiazepine protocol reduces the dose
      requirements of conventional sedatives while maintaining patient comfort and safety; and to
      b) explore whether epinephrine, a marker of autonomic activity, is expressed differently when
      ketamine is added to dexmedetomidine as adjunctive therapies.

    <measure>Cumulative Lorazepam Dose Over the First 12 Hours of Alcohol Withdrawal</measure>
    <time_frame>12 hours</time_frame>
    <description>As part of routine care, the bedside nurse will record the administration of all sedative agents. The hourly, daily and cumulative doses of agents will be determined by the sum of as needed doses, scheduled intermittent doses, and hourly infusion rates. All conventional therapies will be guided by the institution-specific, symptom-triggered alcohol withdrawal protocol to maintain CIWA scores ≤ 7. Intravenous lorazepam is the preferred benzodiazepine for management of alcohol withdrawal in the medical ICU. Phenobarbital and propofol are infrequently used and they are not included in the protocol. All benzodiazepine and barbiturate doses, whether oral or intravenous, will be converted to lorazepam equivalents using the following conversion: 1 mg lorazepam = 2 mg midazolam = 7.5 mg clorazepate = 15 mg phenobarbital.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Severe alcohol withdrawal defined by a CIWA score ≥ 15 and the need for at least 16 mg
             of lorazepam equivalents over a four-hour period. All benzodiazepine and barbiturate
             doses, whether oral or intravenous, will contribute to the cumulative amount using the
             following conversion: 1 mg lorazepam = 2 mg midazolam = 7.5 mg clorazepate = 15 mg
             phenobarbital.

          2. Patients receiving standard therapy for severe alcohol withdrawal according to the
             UCH-specific, symptom-triggered alcohol withdrawal protocol in the ICU (or admission
             to the ICU is anticipated). Lorazepam is the preferred benzodiazepine agent for
             patients requiring ICU admission due to alcohol withdrawal.

          3. Informed consent within 36 hours of qualifying for the study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients &lt; 18 years of age or &gt; 85 years of age.

          2. Patients receiving benzodiazepine therapy for purposes other than alcohol withdrawal
             (e.g. sedation, seizure control other than alcohol withdrawal).

          3. Patients with alcohol withdrawal not requiring ICU admission.

          4. Patients receiving epidural administration of medication(s).

          5. Comatose patients by metabolic or neurologic affectation.

          6. Patients with active myocardial ischemia or second- or third-degree heart block.

          7. Patients with Child-Pugh score of C.

          8. Moribund state with planned withdrawal of life support.

          9. Patient pending transfer to another facility.

         10. Patients with known or suspected severe adverse reactions to dexmedetomidine (or
             clonidine) or ketamine.

         11. Pregnant females or females suspected of being pregnant.

         12. Prisoners or active parolees.

         13. Previous study participation.

         14. Patients already receiving ketamine for alcohol withdrawal. Patients receiving
             dexmedetomidine will be excluded if the infusion exceeds 1 µg/kg per hour for more
