    <textblock>
      This research study is designed to see if a drug called Nivolumab is effective in treating
      patients with advanced refractory biliary tract cancers. Nivolumab has been approved by the
      U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for treatment of certain types of cancer but is not
      approved by the FDA for treatment of your type of cancer.

    <description>This is a single arm study with two stage design using nivolumab in advanced biliary tract cancer (BTC), for participants who have failed or are intolerant to at least one line of therapy and no more than 2 lines of therapy. In the first stage, 18 participants will be accrued. If there is at least one response (or several participants with stable disease based on the study team's discretion), an additional 34 patients will be accrued for a total of 52 patients.</description>
