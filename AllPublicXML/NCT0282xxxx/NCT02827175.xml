  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Annually about 10 to 15 million international travelers from Europe visit tropical countries.
      Returning from a journey, fever is the cardinal symptom of many infections. This is the
      second reason for consultation (23%) for return from a trip, after digestive disorders (42%).
      Urgent evaluation must always be proposed. Although that may be the manifestation of a benign
      disease, fever of return can also presage a rapidly progressive and lethal disease. In 50% of
      cases, patients return home, after treatment and disappearance of symptoms, though the
      microorganism responsible for the pathology is not able to be identified. The prescription of
      a series of systematic biological examinations in the form of a diagnostic kit has shown its
      relevance and its effectiveness in improving the etiological diagnosis of endocarditis and
      pericardites for optimal support. In this study we propose to assess the effectiveness of the
      systematic prescription of a diagnostic kit 'fever of the traveler' to all patients
      hospitalized with a fever after returning from a trip. &quot;Ready to use&quot; kit brings together in
      a single bag (i) instructions for use, (ii) the tubes, bottles and jars for the etiological
      diagnosis of fever of the traveler in the usual support (iii) an additional blood tube for
      research of pathogens emerging.

      Primary:

      To assess the effectiveness of a diagnostic kit for the etiological diagnosis of fevers of
      travelers on the return.

      Hypothesis:

      Improvement of at least 15% of the etiological diagnosis of fevers of travelers on the return
      through the development of a diagnostic kit.
