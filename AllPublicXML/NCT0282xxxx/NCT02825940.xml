  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This Phase I, open-label, multicenter study will evaluate the pharmacokinetics, safety, and
      preliminary anti-tumor activity of atezolizumab as monotherapy in Chinese participants with
      locally advanced or metastatic gastric cancer, nasopharyngeal cancer, esophageal cancer, and
      hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) that are refractory to standard therapeutic modalities and for
      whom no further standard therapy is available or who have refused standard therapy; and the
      safety and preliminary anti-tumor activity of atezolizumab in combination with gemcitabine
      and cisplatin in Chinese participants with Stage IV, treatment-naive non−small cell lung
      cancer (NSCLC). The study will consist of a pharmacokinetic (PK) phase and an extension
      phase.
