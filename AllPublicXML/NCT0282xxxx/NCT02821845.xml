    <textblock>
      This project will characterize lower extremity eccentric muscle function among individuals
      who have undergone locomotor training after spinal cord injury and will evaluate the effect
      of downhill training at slow speeds - targeted to rehabilitation eccentric function of the
      hip.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Lower extremity eccentric motor control is is critically important for locomotor function but
      is impaired after spinal cord injury (SCI). Even after treadmill training, preliminary
      evidence indicates that eccentric deficits persist among individuals with SCI. This proposal
      aims to characterize eccentric motor control of the muscles about the hip during locomotion
      and evaluate the efficacy of downhill gait training at slow speeds as an intervention to
      improve eccentric function of the hip joint during walking.

          -  18-90 years old.

          -  ability to speak English. Note: the quality of life measures have not been validated
             yet in non-English speaking populations.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  evidence of lower motor neuron injury in the legs

          -  acute deep vein thrombosis

          -  skin wounds in regions where harness or hands provide support

          -  pregnancy. Note: Persons who are pregnant will not be enrolled as exercise tolerance
             is unknown in these women with SCI.

          -  cognitive conditions that preclude providing informed consent

          -  ventilator-dependence as study results will be confounded by mobility limitations

             equipment)

          -  hospitalization for myocardial infarction, cardiac surgery or congestive heart failure
             exacerbation within 3 months of enrollment in study
