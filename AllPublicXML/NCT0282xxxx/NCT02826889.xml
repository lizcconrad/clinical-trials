  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Appropriate fluid management is an important part of anesthesia in patients undergoing
      surgery, and several dynamic indices have been suggested to have high predictability for
      fluid responsiveness in patients receiving mechanical ventilation. Among various surgical
      positions, the prone position is known to cause unique physiologic and hemodynamic changes
      and affect the predictability and cut-off values of dynamic indices for fluid responsiveness.
      A previous study reported that pulse pressure variation (PPV) and corrected flow time were
      able to predict fluid responsiveness with relatively high accuracy in patients undergoing
      spine surgery in the prone position using a Wilson frame. However, the Jackson frame is known
      to have less effects on the cardiovascular system compared to the Wilson frame, and therefore
      may be physiologically more appropriate in patients undergoing surgery in the prone position.
      The pleth variability index (PVI) is a dynamic index that can be monitored non-invasively in
      patients under mechanical ventilation. The present study aims evaluate the validity of PPV
      and pleth variability index (PVI) as predictors of fluid responsiveness in the supine and
      prone positions in patients undergoing posterior lumbar spinal fusion using the Jackson
      table.

    <description>Philips Intelivue MP70 monitor (Intellivue MP70, Philips medical Systems, Suresnes, France) -a radial arterial cannula is inserted and arterial pressure waveforms are monitored through Philips Intelivue MP70 monitor. In the monitor, PPVauto is displayed in real-time. It is based on automatic detection algorithms, kernel smoothing, and rank-order filters.</description>
