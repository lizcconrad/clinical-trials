  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Colitis is inflammation of the large bowel and it is often caused by conditions known as
      ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease. In these conditions, the body has an exaggerated
      inflammatory response against the bowel - the body attacks the bowel. Patients who have had
      colitis affecting most of the large bowel for more than 8 years are at increased risk of
      cancer of the large bowel. In view of this, many national gastroenterology organisations have
      recommended that such patients have regular colonoscopies to detect pre-cancerous areas and
      even early cancer in the large bowel. Early detection of such areas, will lead to early
      treatment thereby reducing the risk of developing significant large bowel cancer. These
      regular colonoscopies are known as surveillance colonoscopies.

      Official international guidelines for surveillance in patients with ulcerative and Crohn's
      colitis advise to take 4 random samples of large bowel tissue (biopsies) every 10 centimeters
      and of any suspicious areas. Recent studies have shown that spraying dye such as indigo
      carmine (a type of food dye) helps highlight abnormal areas that could harbor pre-cancerous
      cells. This technique is time-consuming, and tedious. There are no set standards of what is
      considered a satisfactorily completed dye spray colonoscopy. The uptake of this technique in
      the UK has not been uniform. Therefore virtual chromoendoscopy has been studied as an
      alternative method to improve the detection of pre-cancerous tissue in patients with
      longstanding colitis.

      Virtual chromoendoscopy systems enhances specific characteristics of the lining of the large
      bowel such as surface patterns and mucosal vasculature. This theoretically increases the
      detection of pre-cancerous tissue compared to high definition white light endoscopy alone.
      Narrow-band imaging or NBI (Olympus, Tokyo, Japan), Blue Laser (Fujinon, Tokyo, Japan) and OE
      scan (Pentax, Tokyo, Japan) use optical light filters to select particular narrow spectrums
      of red, green and blue light with a relative decrease in the proportion of red light. The
      Fujinon Intelligent Chromo-Endoscopy (FICE) system uses post hoc computer algorithms,
      applying different filters to the stored endoscopic images and enabling a theoretically
      endless number of combinations of filters that can be used. The Pentax I-SCAN system also
      allows post hoc modification of the images. It provides the ability to enhance the mucosal
      surface to better highlight mucosal changes.

      These new imaging techniques have a theoretical advantage, which is extendedly used for sales
      purposes but so far has not been proven in the surveillance for precancerous or early cancer
      of the large bowel in patients with longstanding colitis.
