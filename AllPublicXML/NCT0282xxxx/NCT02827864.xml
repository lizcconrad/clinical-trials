  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This project is designed to investigate the effects of combining tDCS and MT in patients with
      subacute and chronic stroke. This project is also designed to investigate the optimal
      application timing of tDCS in combination with MT in patients with subacute and chronic
      stroke. Patients with subacute and chronic stroke will be recruited and randomized into one
      of the 3 groups: sequentially apply tDCS and MT group (SEQ), apply tDCS concurrently with MT
      group (CON), and MT with sham tDCS group (SHAM). All participants will receive 40 minutes of
      MT followed by 30 minutes of functional task training. For the participants in the SEQ group,
      20 minutes of tDCS will be applied prior to MT, while tDCS will be applied concurrently with
      MT for the first 20 minutes in the CON group. As for the SHAM group, tDCS electrodes will be
      placed on the scalp without actual current output. The interventions will be carried out 90
      minutes per day, 5 days per week, for 4 weeks. Behavioral outcomes will be assessed by
      blinded evaluators before, after, and 3 months post intervention. To study the possible
      interaction of treatment group and time of outcome evaluations, group (SEQ vs. CON vs. SHAM
      groups) × time (pretest vs. posttest vs. follow-up) repeated measures ANOVA will be
      performed. Additionally, the partial eta square (η2) will be calculated to determine the
      effect size of interest.

The participants will carry the actigraphy all day except for activities that involve water, such as swimming or bathing. Using the actigraphy, investigators will be able to record and calculate the number of hand movements per minute, and the data will be analyzed with the MAHUFFE software (http://www.mrc-epid.cam.ac.uk/). The actigraphy has often been used to evaluate arm use in patients with stroke.</description>

    <time_frame>baseline, 1 month, 4 months</time_frame>
    <description>To evaluate health-related quality of life, the SIS 3.0 will be used. The SIS consists of 59 test items grouped into 8 domains (strength, hand function, ADL/IADL, mobility, communication, emotion, memory and thinking, and participation/role function). The participants will be asked to rate each item in a 5-point Likert scale regarding to the perceived difficulty in completing the task. The total score for each domain ranges from 0 to 100. An extra question will be asked to evaluate the participant's self-perceived overall recovery from stroke. The SIS 3.0 has satisfactory psychometric properties.</description>

    <description>CAHAI is a validated, upper-limb measure that uses a 7-point quantitative scale in order to assess functional recovery of the arm and hand after a stroke. The purpose of this measure is to evaluate the functional ability of the paretic arm and hand to perform tasks that have been identified as important by individuals following a stroke. The CAHAI has good psychometric properties.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change scores of The Facial Pain Scale-Revised (FPS-R )</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, 1 month</time_frame>
    <description>The FPS-R will be used to assess the level of post-exertional pain, respectively. These evaluations will be measured using a 6-point scale with no pain to extreme pain, which depicts six photocopied faces showing neutral to extremely painful expressions. The vertically aligned format of the scales will be used to prevent potential bias of report due to UN.</description>

    <measure>Change scores of The short form of the Betts Questionnaire Upon Mental Imagery (Betts QMI)</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, 1 month</time_frame>
    <description>Betts QMI will be used to assess a person's ability to engage in imagery. The shortened Questionnaire Upon Mental Imagery measures vividness of mental imagery in seven sensory modalities: visual, auditory, cutaneous, kinaesthetic, gustatory, olfactory, and organic. High scores indicate low imagery capacity, and vice versa. The short form of the Betts QMI had high test-retest reliability.</description>
