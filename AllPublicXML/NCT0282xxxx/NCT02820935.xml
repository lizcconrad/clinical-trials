      This is a two-part study to be conducted at a single study site in the US. Both parts of the
      study may be conducted in parallel.

      A total of approximately 38 subjects will participate in this study, with approximately 19
      subjects in Part 1 and approximately 19 subjects in Part 2. Each subject may only participate
      in one of the parts.

      This is a two part study to be conducted at a single study site. Both parts of the study may
      be conducted in parallel.

      A total of approximately 38 subjects will participate in this study, with approximately 19
      subjects in Part 1 and approximately 19 subjects in Part 2. Each subject may only participate
      in one of the parts.

      Each Part will consist of 2 study periods. Part 1 and Part 2, each subject will participate
      in a Screening phase, one baseline visit per period, one dosing phase per period, and
      follow-up telephone call.

      In Part 1, subjects will receive a single dose of CC-220 in Period 1 and, following an
      appropriate washout, multiple doses of itraconazole plus one dose of itraconazole with CC-220
      in Period 2. In Part 2, subjects will receive CC-220 in Period 1 and, following an
      appropriate washout, multiple doses of rifampin plus one dose of rifampin with CC-220 in
      Period 2.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

        Subjects must satisfy the following criteria to be enrolled in the study:

          1. Subject is ≥ 18 and ≤ 65 years of age at the time of signing the informed consent form
             (ICF).

          2. Subject must understand and voluntarily sign an ICF prior to any study-related
             assessments/procedures being conducted.

          3. Subject is willing and able to adhere to the study visit schedule and other protocol
             requirements.

          4. Subject is in good health as determined by a Physical examination (PE) at screening.

          5. Subject agrees to abide by the requirements and restrictions outlined in the CC-220
             Pregnancy Prevention Plan for Subjects in Clinical Trials.

          6. Female subjects not of childbearing potential must:

             a. Have been surgically sterilized (hysterectomy or bilateral oophorectomy; proper
             documentation required) at least 6 months before screening, or be postmenopausal
             (defined as 24 consecutive months without menses before screening, with a
             follicle-stimulating hormone [FSH] level of &gt; 40 IU/L at screening).

          7. Male subjects must:

             a. Practice true abstinence1 (which must be reviewed on a monthly basis and source
             documented) or agree to use a barrier method of birth control (condoms not made out of
             natural [animal] membrane [latex condoms are recommended]) during sexual contact with
             a pregnant female or female of childbearing potential (FCBP)2 while participating in
             the study, during dose interruptions, and for at least 28 days after the last dose of
             investigational Product (IP), even if he has undergone a successful vasectomy.

          8. Subject has body mass index (BMI) ≥ 18 and ≤ 33 kg/m2 at screening.

        1 True abstinence is acceptable when this is in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle
        of the subject (periodic abstinence [eg, calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, post-ovulation
        methods] and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of contraception). 2 A female of
        childbearing potential (FCBP) is a female who: 1) has achieved menarche at some point; 2)
        has not undergone a hysterectomy or bilateral oophorectomy; or 3) has not been naturally
        postmenopausal (amenorrhea following cancer therapy does not rule out childbearing
        potential) for at least 24 consecutive months (ie, has had menses at any time in the
        preceding 24 consecutive months).

        9. Subject has clinical laboratory safety test results that are within normal limits or
        acceptable to the Investigator. Platelet count, absolute neutrophil count, and absolute
        lymphocyte count must be above the lower limit of normal at screening.

        10. Subject is afebrile, with supine systolic blood pressure (BP) ≥ 90 and ≤ 140 mmHg,
        supine diastolic BP ≥ 50 and ≤ 90 mmHg, and pulse rate ≥ 40 and ≤ 110 bpm at screening.

        11. Subject has a normal or clinically acceptable 12-lead ECG (Electrocardiogram) at
        screening. In addition:

          1. If male, subject has a corrected QT value (based on Fridericia's formula) ≤ 430 msec
             at screening.

          2. If female, subject has a corrected QT value (based on Fridericia's formula) ≤ 450 msec
             at screening.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        The presence of any of the following will exclude a subject from enrollment:

          1. Subject has any significant and relevant medical condition (including but not limited
             to neurological, gastrointestinal, renal, hepatic, cardiovascular, psychological,
             pulmonary, metabolic, endocrine, hematological, allergic disease, drug allergies, or
             other major disorders), laboratory abnormality, or psychiatric illness that would
             prevent the subject from participating in the study.

          2. Subject has any condition including the presence of laboratory abnormalities, which
             places the subject at unacceptable risk if he/she were to participate in the study.

          3. Subject has any condition that confounds the ability to interpret data from the study.

          4. Subject is a female of childbearing potential, pregnant, or breastfeeding.

          5. Subject was exposed to an investigational drug (new chemical entity) within 30 days
             preceding the first dose administration, or five half-lives of that investigational
             drug, if known (whichever is longer).

          6. Subject has used any prescribed systemic or topical medication (including but not
             limited to analgesics, anesthetics, etc) within 30 days prior to the first dose
             administration.

          7. Subject has used any non-prescribed systemic or topical medication (including
             vitamin/mineral supplements, and herbal medicines) within 14 days prior to the first
             dose administration.

          8. Subject has used CYP3A inducers and/or inhibitors (including St. John's wort) within
             30 days prior to the first dose administration. The Indiana University &quot;Cytochrome
             P450 Drug Interaction Table&quot; should be utilized to determine inhibitors and/or
             inducers of CYP3A.

          9. Subject has any surgical or medical conditions possibly affecting drug absorption,
             distribution, metabolism and excretion, eg, bariatric procedure. Appendectomy and
             cholecystectomy are acceptable.

         10. Subject donated blood or plasma within 8 weeks before the first dose administration to
             a blood bank or blood donation center.

         11. Subject has a history of drug abuse (as defined by the current version of the
             Diagnostic and Statistical Manual [DSM]) within 2 years before the first dose
             administration, or positive drug screening test reflecting consumption of illicit
             drugs.

         12. Subject has a history of alcohol abuse (as defined by the current version of the
             Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM)) within 2 years before the first dose
             administration, or positive alcohol screen.

         13. Subject is known to have serum hepatitis or known to be a carrier of hepatitis B
             surface antigen (HBsAg) or hepatitis C antibody (HCV Ab), or have a positive result to
             the test for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) antibodies at screening.

         14. Subject smokes &gt; 10 cigarettes per day, or the equivalent in other tobacco products
             (self-reported).

         15. Subject is part of the clinical staff personnel or a family member of the clinical
             site staff.

         16. Subject has received immunization with a live or live attenuated vaccine within 2
             months prior to administration of the first dose of IP or is planning to receive
             immunization with a live or live attenuated vaccine for 2 months after administration
             of the last dose of Investigational Product (IP).
