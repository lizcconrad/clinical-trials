      The overall goal of this project is to test whether the Learn. Engage. Act. Process (LEAP)
      intervention helps teams within the Veterans Health Administration's local MOVE! group weight
      management programs be more in line with guidance. Forty-eight sites will be randomized to
      the LEAP intervention, which is a virtually delivered program that relies on the IHI Model
      for Improvement, an online learning platform for clinician teams to share ideas and progress,
      an audit and feedback process, and a barrier buster tool. The LEAP intervention will be
      compared to active support that is provided to all VA MOVE! programs by the National Center
      for Health Promotion and Disease Prevention (NCP). The investigators will compare whether
      participation in LEAP results in engaging more Veterans in the MOVE! weight management
      program compared to facilities not participating in LEAP. The investigators will also collect
      information to understand what components of LEAP worked best and how to scale up so more
      teams can participate in LEAP.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The Veterans Affairs (VA) National Center for Health Promotion and Disease Prevention (NCP)
      first disseminated MOVE! weight management program guidance in 2006. Program guidance was
      updated in 2014, which is expected to increase engagement and improve outcomes. However,
      variation in local programs is high. The overall goal of this project is to test the Learn.
      Engage. Act. Process (LEAP) intervention to work with teams virtually, to build skills in
      implementing program improvements. Forty-eight sites will be randomized to the LEAP
      intervention using a stepped-wedge trial design. LEAP is a virtually delivered program that
      relies on the IHI Model for Improvement, an online learning platform for clinician teams to
      share ideas and progress, an audit and feedback process, and a barrier buster tool. The LEAP
      intervention will be compared to active support provided by NCP to all local VA MOVE! teams.
      The investigators will compare whether teams participating in LEAP have MOVE! programs that
      engage more Veterans compared to facilities not participating in LEAP. The investigators will
      also collect information to understand which components of LEAP worked best and how to scale
      up and implement LEAP more broadly. The project aims are:

      Aim 1: To develop three core products to enhance NCP support to VAMCs and to pilot LEAP in
      three VAMCs.

      H1: Dissemination of products to enhance NCP support will improve MOVE! outcomes.

      Aim 2: To determine effectiveness of LEAP plus enhanced NCP support (LEAP+NCP) versus
      enhanced NCP support alone.

      H2: VAMCs with LEAP+NCP will have better MOVE! group outcomes than VAMCs with enhanced NCP
      support alone.

      Aim 3: To conduct formative and cost evaluations to refine design of LEAP and inform future
      scaling-up of LEAP.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Rate of MOVE! Visits per 1000 Candidate Veterans</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Rate is calculated as aggregate number of MOVE! group visits per facility divided by aggregate count of candidate Veterans living w/in 40 miles multiplied by 1000. This will include facility level aggregated number of MOVE! group visits at rolling prospective 6 month time periods after the end of each stepped-wedge cohort timeframe. Time periods are rolling based on stepped-wedge trial design. Data will be extracted from CDW.</description>
