    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to evaluate Immunotherapy with a peptide vaccine and
      Programmed Death Ligand 1 (PD-L1) inhibitor as a possible adjuvant treatment for Stage II or
      III Triple Negative Breast Cancer. This research study is studying the safety, tolerability,
      and immune response of these treatments.

      The names of the study interventions involved in this study are:

        -  PVX-410 Vaccine

        -  Durvalumab (MEDI4736)
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This research study is a Phase Ib clinical trial, which tests the safety of an
      investigational intervention and also tries to better understand how the investigational
      intervention affects the body. &quot;Investigational&quot; means that the intervention is being
      studied.

      The FDA (the U.S. Food and Drug Administration) has not approved PVX-410 and Durvalumab as a
      treatment for any disease.

        -  Durvalumab is a protein that affects your immune system by blocking the PD-L1 pathway.
           The PD-L1 pathway controls the body's natural immune response, but tumors can interrupt
           this pathway and partially resist or escape the immune system. By blocking the PD-L1
           pathway, Durvalumab may help the immune system identify and catch tumor cells.

        -  PVX-410 is an investigational vaccine that is being developed to treat multiple myeloma
           and triple negative breast cancer.

        -  In this research study, the investigators are studying the body's immune response to the
           PVX-410 study vaccine in combination with Durvalumab. This study will help researchers
           understand if the vaccine and Durvalumab can work together to help the body's immune
           system recognize triple negative breast cancer. The investigators are also studying the
           safety of the PVX-410 vaccine alone and together with the Durvalumab.
