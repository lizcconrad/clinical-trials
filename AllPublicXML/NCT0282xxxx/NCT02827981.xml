  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Active discopathies or MODIC 1, are a diagnostic entity discovery with the contribution of
      MRI in which the first cases were described by Dr. Michael MODIC in 1988. It is characterized
      by a vertebral bone edema secondary to active discarthrose. Its prevalence is estimated at 6%
      of the general population and up to 40% of the CLBP according to studies. Following the
      discovery of this recent diagnostic entity, responsible for low back pain, the question of
      its management is debate in the medical community. Early studies demonstrate the
      effectiveness of corticosteroid injections in intra-disc. Other works, most recent, suggest
      the contrary, infectious, incriminating a pathogenic role of certain bacteria such as
      Propionibacterium acness or Corynebacterium propinquum recommending, in contrast, treatment
      with prolonged antibiotic therapy. This study will aim to assess the effectiveness of
      intra-disc infiltration GHPSJ carried out between 2007 and 2014. The innovation of our work
      will be to assess these infiltrations in various subgroups such as patients with a previous
      surgery of the spine or a history of scoliosis or spondylolisthesis.

      1. Primary objective:

           Evaluate the effectiveness of intra-disc infiltrations conducted in the rheumatology
           department of pain in the active disc disease.

        2. Secondary objectives:

             -  Evaluate the duration of the benefit on pain caused by gesture

             -  Assess the impact of the gesture on NSAIDs and / or analgesics

             -  Analysis of different subgroups (antecedent of surgery, spondylolisthesis,
                scoliosis) Inclusion / non-inclusion: Patients older than 18 who were hospitalized
                between 2007 and 2014 in the Rheumatology Department for intradiscal infiltration.

      Methodology: A retrospective, single-center, non-interventional Study duration: 6 months
      Acquisition of data: demographic data, data on the disc disease, data on the assessment of
      pain, the effectiveness of infiltration of analgesics and / or NSAIDs, or need infiltration
      surgery for the gesture.

      Supports: patient questionnaire report hospital, medical, Excel grid of data collection),
      analysis (statistic: local management) Anonymised data in the Excel spreadsheet Development
      of the study: Data collection, statistical analysis, literature review Retrospective study
      based on recovering data regarding efficacy of infiltrative gesture that some patient was
      performed in 2007, with possibility of bias on the recovery of data in view of the age of the
      gesture for some patients.

      An analysis of each folder from the hospital report will be carried out in parallel in order
      to compare the data collected by the questionnaire with the reporting. The sending of
      questionnaires and letters will be performed by the service attaches where a pre-stamped
      letter. The address of the patients will be that recorded in the base DxCare.
