    <textblock>
      The aim of the proposed project is to compare the effectiveness of two strategies designed to
      enhance patient understanding of medication risks/benefits: (1) Medication Guides, mandated
      for many medications by the Food and Drug Administration and (2) Drug Facts Boxes, developed
      by Woloshin and Schwartz to enhance the usability of consumer medication information. The
      investigators will also assess whether the effectiveness of these communication strategies
      can be increased by Gist Reasoning Training, which is designed to enhance patients' ability
      to extract meaningful gist from complex information.The investigators anticipate enrolling
      300 individuals with rheumatoid arthritis. The study will use a randomized controlled trial
      design with four study arms. Data will be collected primarily via self-administered,
      Internet-based surveys using REDCap. All participants will be followed for 6 months after the
      completion of baseline data collection.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a systemic, autoimmune disorder affecting 0.5% to 1% of the
      adult population in developed countries worldwide. Current guidelines underscore the
      importance of aggressive treatment of RA with disease modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDS)
      to control inflammation. Aggressive treatment has been shown to improve patient-centered
      outcomes, including better symptom control, functional status, and health-related quality of
      life and reduce the risk of premature death. A major issue in implementing aggressive therapy
      in practice, however, involves patient reluctance to escalate therapy when they believe that
      their symptoms are tolerable, despite the presence of active disease, due to concerns about
      medications risks. Moreover, patients often find it difficult to obtain accurate and
      personally-relevant information about medication risks and benefits that is written in
      language they can understand. There is a clear gap between the information patients want
      about medication risks and benefits and the information they currently receive as part of
      routine care.

    <measure>Change from Baseline to 6-Month Follow-up in the % of participants classified as having made an informed decision</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Informed decision making is characterized by making a value-consistent decision based on accurate knowledge. Knowledge will be assessed as described under Outcome 2. Values will be assessed using a 10-item scale developed by Fraenkel et al. Scores on this scale can range from 0 to 10, with lower scores reflecting a reluctance to use medications to control disease activity. Participants will be classified as having made an informed choice if they: (1) answered at least 85% of the knowledge items correctly, scored 6 or more on the values scale, and are currently taking one or more DMARDS OR (2) answered 85% of the knowledge items correctly, scored 5 or less on the values measure, and are not currently taking a DMARD. Otherwise, individuals will be classified as not having made an informed choice.
The investigators will assess change in the % of participants classified as having made an informed decision from Baseline to 6-Month Follow-Up.</description>

    <measure>Mean change from Baseline to 6-Month Follow-up: Knowledge of the Risks and Benefits Associated with DMARD Therapy</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Knowledge of DMARD risks and benefits will be assessed by measures developed by Fraenkel et al., Barton et al., and Fayet et al. The combined measure will have a total of 36 items. Most items are answered on a true/false scale (with a don't know option provided). Each correct response will receive 1-point (maximum of 36 points).
The investigators will assess change in the total score over time from baseline to 6-month follow-up.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Mean change from Baseline to 6-Month Follow-up: Gist Reasoning Ability</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The investigators will use the Test of Strategic Learning (TOSL) to quantify participants' ability to abstract gist meanings from complex text. The TOSL consists of 4 text passages varying in length (from 291 to 575 words) and complexity. Each participant will respond to one passage (randomly determined, without repeats at the individual level) at each time point. Participants will be asked to provide a summary of the original text, focused on bottom-line-meaning rather than specific details. Responses will be recorded using a manualized objective scoring system wherein participant summaries that focus on abstracted gist meanings receive a higher score than those that focus on the verbatim details included in the text passages. Each gist meaning abstracted by the participant will receive 1 point. A total score of 37 points is possible.
The investigators will assess change in the total score over time from baseline to 6 month follow-up.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Patient Interest in Information About Treatment Options</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>After participants complete the baseline questionnaire, they will be directed to a website that provides written prescription drug information (either Medication Guides or DrugFactsBoxesÂ®, depending on group assignment) for medications used to treat RA. From baseline to the 6-month follow-up, the investigators will electronically track the number of different written materials examined, the number of different materials printed, the number of times the participant accesses the website, and the total amount of time the participant spends on the website. The mean for each of these variables will be computed within each arm of the study and compared across arms.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Mean change from Baseline to 6-Month Follow-up: Satisfaction with Medication Information</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>This outcome will be assessed by the 17-item Satisfaction with Information about Medicines Scale (SIMS). Items ask participants to rate the amount of information they have received about different aspects of their medications. Responses are summed across items to yield a total score with a possible range of 17 to 119, with higher scores reflecting greater satisfaction with the amount of information received.
The investigators will assess change in the total score over time from baseline to the 6-month follow-up.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Mean change from Baseline to 6-Month Follow-up: Arthritis Self-Efficacy</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The investigators will assess confidence in one's ability to manage arthritis symptoms in different situations via the 8-item Arthritis Self-Efficacy Scale (e.g., keep pain from interfering with things participants want to do). Responses are recorded on a 10-point scale with endpoints labeled &quot;Very Uncertain&quot; and &quot;Very Certain&quot;. This measure has been widely used in arthritis patient populations for over two decades and has been shown to have excellent psychometric properties, including high internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha generally exceeds 0.90) and sensitivity to change following participation in illness self-management programs.
The investigators will assess change in the total score over time from baseline to the 6-month follow-up.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Mean change from Baseline to 6-Month Follow-up: Illness Intrusiveness</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Illness Intrusiveness will be assessed by the 13-item Illness Intrusiveness Ratings Scale. Items ask respondents to rate the degree to which their &quot;illness and/or its treatment&quot; interferes with aspects of life that are essential for quality of life. Responses will be recorded on a visual analog scale, with endpoints labeled Not Very Much (0) and Very Much (100). The instrument will be score by summing across all items to obtain a total score. Cronbach's alpha for the total score has been found to range from .78 to .97 across 36 different health conditions. Among patients with RA, Cronbach's alpha for the total score was .87.
The investigators will assess change in the total score over time from baseline to the 6-month follow-up.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Mean change from Baseline to 6-Month Follow-up: Health Distress</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Health Distress will be assessed by the 4-item measure developed by Lorig and colleagues. This measure was adapted from the Medical Outcomes Study health distress scare for use in arthritis populations. The adapted measure has demonstrated high internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha= .87) and responsiveness to change following completion of an arthritis self-management course. Participants will respond to each question on a 7-point scale, ranging from None of the Time (1) to All of the Time (6). Thus, the total score will range from 4 to 24, with higher scores reflecting greater Health Distress.
The investigators will assess change in the total score over time from baseline to the 6-month follow-up.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Mean change from Baseline to 6-Month Follow-up: Global Health Status</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>This outcome will be assess by a single-item asking participants to rate their current health on a 5-point scare where 1= Excellent, 2= Very Good, 3= Good, 4= Fair, and 5= Poor. This item is part of the Medical Outcomes Study Core Survey Instrument and responses have been shown to predict mortality and health care utilization as well as multi-item health status measures.
The investigators will assess change in the item score over time from baseline to the 6-month follow-up.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Mean change from Baseline to 6-Month Follow-up: Overall Treatment Satisfaction</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire for Medication (TSQM-9) will be used to assess treatment satisfaction. TSQM-9 has 3 subscales: effectiveness, convenience and overall satisfaction. Items ask participants to rate their satisfaction with difference aspect of their treatment regimen on a 7-point scale with endpoints labeled, Extremely Dissatisfied (1) and Extremely Satisfied (7). Internal consistency of each subscale has been demonstrated with Cronbach's alpha exceeding 0.80 for each sub-scale. Each subscale has been shown to discriminate between individuals classified as exhibiting Low vs. Medium medication adherence.
The investigators will assess change in the overall treatment satisfaction score over time from baseline to the 6-month follow-up.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Mean change from Baseline to 6-Month Follow-up: Disease Activity</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Disease Activity will be assess using the RAPID3. This instrument is based on the Multi-Dimensional Health Assessment Questionnaire (MDHAQ), which is adapted from the standard HAQ. The RAPID3 includes the 3 Core Data Set measures of physical function, pain, and patient global estimate. The score for physical function ranges from 0 to 10 and is calculated by adding the ten activities of daily living, each scored from 0 to 3 by the patient and dividing the total raw score by 3. Pain and global estimate of health are measured on a likert scale from 0 to 10. The three 0-10 scores for physical function, pain, and global assessment of health are added together for a composite score, ranging from 0 to 30.
The investigators will assess change in the composite score over time from baseline to the 6-month follow-up.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Mean change from Baseline to 6-Month Follow-up: Depression</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Depression will be assessed using the Neuro-QOL Version 1 item bank developed by the Patient Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS). A minimum number of items (4 for adult) must be answered in order to receive a score for Depression CAT. The first item is selected because it provides the most information about the U.S. general population. The response to this item will guide the system's choice of the next item for the participant. The participant's response to this item will dictate the selection of the following question, and so on. As additional items are administered, the potential for error is reduced and confidence in the respondent's score increases. CAT will continue until either the standard error drops below a specified level, or the participant has answered the maximum number of questions (12), whichever occurs first.

    <measure>Mean change from Baseline to 6-Month Follow-up: Fatigue</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Fatigue will be assessed using the Neuro-QOL Version 1 item bank developed by the Patient Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS). A minimum number of items (4 for adult) must be answered in order to receive a score for Fatigue CAT. The first item is selected because it provides the most information about the U.S. general population. The response to this item will guide the system's choice of the next item for the participant. The participant's response to this item will dictate the selection of the following question, and so on. As additional items are administered, the potential for error is reduced and confidence in the respondent's score increases. CAT will continue until either the standard error drops below a specified level, or the participant has answered the maximum number of questions (12), whichever occurs first.

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Mean change from Baseline to 6-Month Follow-up: Health Literacy</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Health literacy will be assessed via the Newest Vital Sign (NVS). This instrument, which tests literacy skills for both numbers and words, has been validated against a previously validated measure of health literacy (the TOFHLA). Participants are given a specially designed ice cream nutrition label to review and are asked a series of questions about the label. 1-point is given for each correct answer (maximum of 6 points). 0-1 points suggests high likelihood (50% or more) of limited literacy, 2-3 points indicates the possibility of limited literacy, 4-6 points almost always indicates adequate literacy.
The investigators will assess change in the total health literacy score over time from baseline to the 6-month follow-up.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Mean change from baseline to 6-Month Follow-up: Medication Adherence</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Medication adherence will be assessed by the 8-item measure (MMAS-8) developed by Morisky and colleagues. The MMAS-8 scale is a recognized indicator of medication adherence, consisting of 8 questions with a sum score ranging between 0 and 8 points. The higher score indicates higher adherence to the prescribed therapy recommendation.

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Interest in Obtaining Information about Illness Self-Management</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>After the 1-month follow-up interview, all participants will be given an opportunity to take part in the BetterChoices, BetterHealth program. To assess interest in obtaining additional information, the investigators will track whether or not participants enroll in this class, the number of class sessions attended, and whether or not participants complete the class. The investigators will compute the percentages of participants in each arm of the study who enroll/complete the class and the mean number of classes attended prior to the 6-month follow-up.</description>

    <ipd_description>The investigators will create a web-site to disseminate study findings. Access to the website will not be restricted in any way. The website will provide a link for individuals to obtain a copy of study data. Individuals will be required to complete a form to request the data, indicating their name, contact information, and the research questions they plan to address. The investigators will then provide individuals with a complete, cleaned, deidentified copy of the final SAS dataset and a copy of the study protocol described above which will include all of the information needed to replicate the analyses or use the dataset to perform secondary analyses. The investigators will use SharePoint to provide these materials to those who request them. The link providing access to study data will appear and be active within nine months following the final year of funding.
