    <textblock>
      The purpose of this small pilot study is to refine a combined intervention of IV amino acids
      and cycle ergometry in critically ill patients, and to gather preliminary data, before
      proceeding with a larger multi-center RCT. A total of 10 patients will receive the combined
      intervention.

    <description>Beginning within 96 hours of ICU admission, participants will receive the following combined intervention:
IV amino acids (15% solution) delivered by continuous infusion, such that the total enteral and IV protein will be between 2.0-2.5 g/kg/day.
In-bed cycle ergometry exercise delivered in 45-minute sessions 5 days per week according to a detailed specific protocol that includes a safety check and gradual increases in resistance if the participant is actively cycling.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. &gt;=18 years old

          2. Requiring mechanical ventilation or high flow nasal cannula (HFNC) with actual or
             expected total duration of mechanical ventilation or HFNC &gt;48 hours

          3. Expected ICU stay &gt;4 days after enrollment (to permit adequate exposure to the
             proposed intervention)

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. &gt;120 continuous hours of mechanical ventilation or HFNC before enrollment

          2. Expected death or withdrawal of life-sustaining treatments within 7 days from
             enrollment

          3. No expectation for any nutritional intake within the subsequent 72 hours

          4. Severe chronic liver disease (MELD score &gt;20) or acute fulminant hepatitis.

          5. Documented allergy to the amino acid intervention

          6. Not ambulating independently prior to ICU admission (use of gait aid permitted)

          7. Pre-existing primary systemic neuromuscular disease (e.g. Guillain Barre)

          8. Neuromuscular blocker infusion (eligible once infusion discontinued if other inclusion
             criteria met)

          9. Pre-existing intracranial or spinal process affecting motor function

         10. Pre-existing cognitive impairment or language barrier that prohibits outcomes
             assessment

         11. Lower extremity impairments that prevent cycling (e.g. amputation, knee/hip injury)

         12. Weight &gt;150kg

         13. Pregnant

         14. Incarcerated
