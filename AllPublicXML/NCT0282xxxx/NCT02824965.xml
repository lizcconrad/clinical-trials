  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This will be a Phase Ib open-label trial of CAVATAK™ (CVA21) in combination with
      Pembrolizumab for the treatment of patients with advanced NSCLC. The dose of Pembrolizumab
      will be fixed at 200mg. Three cohorts (dose levels) of intravenously-delivered CVA21 will be
      explored, using a standard 3+3 patient dose escalation design. The starting dose of CVA21
      will be one log below the 1 x 10^9 TCID50 dose found to be safe when CVA21 was given alone in
      an ongoing Phase I study (NCT02043665).

      Primary Objective &amp; Hypothesis

      (1) Objective:

      To evaluate the safety of intravenous CVA21 in combination with pembrolizumab in patients
      with advanced NSCLC.

      Hypothesis:

      Pembrolizumab in combination with intravenous CVA21 will be well tolerated in patients with
      advanced NSCLC.

      Secondary Objective &amp; Hypothesis

      (1) Objective:

      i. To evaluate the efficacy of intravenous CVA21 in inducing an immune cell rich tumour
      microenvironment in patients with a baseline biopsy demonstrating a tumour with an immune
      cell poor microenvironment.

      ii. To evaluate the efficacy of intravenous CVA21 in combination with pembrolizumab in
      patients with advanced NSCLC using irRECIST.

      iii. To evaluate the safety of intravenous CVA21 in combination with pembrolizumab.

      iv. To identify a safe and potentially effective dose for intravenous CVA21 in combination
      with intravenous pembrolizumab.

      v. To serially evaluate the presence of detectable virus and anti-viral antibodies in
      peripheral blood of the trial participants.

      Hypothesis:

      i. CVA21 will induce immune cell infiltration into tumors of patients that lack an immune
      cell rich micro-environment.

    <description>The overall response according to the irRC is derived from time-point response assessments based on tumor burden. In the irRC, an immune-related Complete Response (irCR) is the disappearance of all lesions, measured or unmeasured, and no new lesions; an immune-related Partial Response (irPR) is a 50% drop in tumour burden from baseline as defined by the irRC; and immune-related Progressive Disease (irPD) is a 25% increase in tumour burden from the lowest level recorded. Everything else is considered immune-related Stable Disease (irSD).</description>

             rearrangements are eligible only after initial TKI failure and chemotherapy is not
             felt to be a suitable option by the investigator.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Is currently participating and receiving study therapy or has participated in a study

                  may qualify for the study.

               -  Note: If subject received major surgery, they must have recovered adequately from
                  the toxicity and/or complications from the intervention prior to starting

             drugs). Replacement therapy (eg., thyroxine, insulin, or physiologic corticosteroid
             replacement therapy for adrenal or pituitary insufficiency, etc.) is not considered a
             form of systemic treatment.

             that might confound the results of the trial, interfere with the subject's

             the subject to participate, in the opinion of the treating investigator.

         15. Has known psychiatric or substance abuse disorders that would interfere with
             cooperation with the requirements of the trial.

         16. Is pregnant or breastfeeding, or expecting to conceive or father children within the
             projected duration of the trial, starting with the pre-screening or screening visit
             through 120 days after the last dose of trial treatment.

         17. Has previously received treatment with CVA21.

         18. Has a known history of Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) (HIV 1/2 antibodies).

             [qualitative] is detected).

         20. Has received a live vaccine within 30 days of planned start of study therapy.
