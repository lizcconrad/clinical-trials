  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will attempt to validate a method of estimating root length on panoramic
      radiograph by crown measurement on intraoral digital scans.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Intraoral digital scans will be taken on patients who have completed orthodontic treatment,
      and measurements will be made on the crown dimensions. These dimensions will then be applied
      onto the same teeth as seen on panoramic radiographs and a mathematical relationship will be
      determined for root length. Changes in root length will be measured from initial records to
      treatment complete panoramic radiographs and these estimates will be compared to actual root
      length changes as measured in CBCT (Cone Beam Computed Tomography) records.
