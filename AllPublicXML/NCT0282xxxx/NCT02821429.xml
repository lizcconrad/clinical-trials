      Respiratory weaning failure worsens prognostic of patients following on-pump cardiac surgery.
      There are increasing evidences that pulmonary, diaphragmatic or cardiologic echographies are
      useful in order to improve this critical medical status.

      Based both on a previous study conducted in the critical care unit of Purpan and on
      literature we hypothesize that a combined thoracic echography score could be of interest. We
      make the hypothesis that the use of a score based on thoracic combined echography (ETC =
      cardiac, pulmonary and diaphragmatic) allows to predict the failure of respiratory weaning in
      cardiac surgery and allows to improve the characterization of the causes of this failure
