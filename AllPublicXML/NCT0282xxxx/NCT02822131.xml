  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      High dietary phosphate intake in the general population is associated with a higher risk for
      developing kidney disease and cardiovascular disease with an increased overall mortality.
      Whereas the effects of high phosphate intake on general health become clearer, almost nothing
      is known about underlying mechanisms. More recently, the investigators and others found in
      animal models that FGF23 stimulates the renal NaCl cotransporter NCC, the target of thiazide
      diuretics, and that increased NCC activity may increase blood pressure. The investigators
      could also show that increasing dietary phosphate intake in mice, increases FGF23 and NCC
      activity within 3 days. Thus, the objective of this single-centre observational cross-over
      study including 20-45 year old healthy male probands is to elucidate the role of dietary
      phosphate on blood pressure regulation and renal handling of sodium chloride in healthy
      subjects. Further the impact of dietary phosphate intake on the regulation of phosphaturic
      hormones and other factors regulation blood pressure will be investigated. In addition, the
      investigators will examine whether phosphate intake modulates gut microbiome composition. The
      primary outcome in this study is the change in blood pressure in healthy subjects on
      low-phosphate diet compared to healthy subjects on high-phosphate diet. In addition, to
      assess changes in NCC activity as the main mechanism of phosphate-sensitive blood pressure
      regulation, renal sodium chloride excretion after administration of hydrochlorothiazide will
      be measured. The secondary outcomes of this study are: changes in renal phosphate, calcium
      and potassium excretion, changes in phosphate regulation hormones such as 25-OH-Vit. D,
      1,25-(OH)2-Vit. D, PTH, FGF23, dopamine in plasma and urine, changes in plasma and urinary
      aldosterone levels, changes in sodium/chloride-cotransporter NCC and NaPi-IIa assessed from
      urinary exosomes, and changes in stool phosphate excretion and gut microbiome composition.
