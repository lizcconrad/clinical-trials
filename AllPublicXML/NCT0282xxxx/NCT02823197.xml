    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether a theory- and evidence-based intervention
      aiming to promote active transport for short distance travel among older adolescents is
      effective in increasing attitude, subjective norm, self-efficacy, awareness and habit towards
      active transport, and intention to use active transport after obtaining a driving license.

    <time_frame>The outcome will be measured at baseline (before start intervention), posttest (1 week after the intervention) and follow-up (8 weeks after the intervention)</time_frame>
    <description>Subjective norm towards active transport will be assessed via three items (family, friends, partner) with a five-point answer format.</description>

    <time_frame>The outcome will be measured at baseline (before start intervention), posttest (1 week after the intervention) and follow-up (8 weeks after the intervention)</time_frame>
    <description>Awareness towards active transport (e.g. ecology, health benefits, private car ownership,...) will be assessed via eight items with a five-point answer format.</description>

    <time_frame>The outcome will be measured at baseline (before start intervention), posttest (1 week after the intervention) and follow-up (8 weeks after the intervention)</time_frame>
    <description>Habit towards active transport (e.g. walking or cycling for transport is something I automatically do) will be assessed via four items with a five-point answer format.</description>

    <description>Participants receive a 2-hour lesson (at school) promoting active transport for short distance travel to various destinations. Furthermore, they are asked to join a Facebook group on active transport in which 3 messages per week are posted during an eight-week period. The Facebook posts aim to promote the use of active transport for short distance travel.</description>
