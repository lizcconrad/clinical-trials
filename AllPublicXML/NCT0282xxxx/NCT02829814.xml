  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The present trial is designed to assess the safety and efficacy of TNX-102 SL 2.8 mg tablets,
      taken daily at bedtime after 12 weeks of treatment in patients with fibromyalgia.

      The use of low-dose sublingual formulation of cyclobenzaprine (TNX-102 SL) dosed nightly for
      fibromyalgia is supported by the results of TNX-CY-F202 Phase 2b study -- the results provide
      strong evidence that TNX-102 SL 2.8 mg dosed nightly results in beneficial effects upon pain,
      sleep and other FM symptomatology.

  <overall_status>Terminated</overall_status>
  <why_stopped>
    For business reason unrelated to safety or tolerability,Tonix has discontinued the Fibromyalgia
    development with TNX102 SL.
