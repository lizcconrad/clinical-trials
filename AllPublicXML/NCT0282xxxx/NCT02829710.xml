  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Management of analgesia and sedation is an integral component of the medical care of a
      critically-ill child. Its role is to assure comfort and safety to a patient undergoing
      painful cares and technical procedures; it can also be, in particular situations like acute
      respiratory distress syndrome or acute brain injury, a full processing treatment.

      Sedation involves, most of the time, the association of an opioid and a sedative. The use of
      these drugs is difficult in children, because of a specific metabolism, inducing tolerance
      and withdrawal in case of prolonged administration.

      The COMFORT-BEHAVIOR (COMFORT-B) scale is a validated, simple, reliable and reproducible
      score evaluating sedation and analgesia. Sedation scoring systems must be used regularly to
      avoid inadequate sedation.

      Excessive sedation is associated with poor outcomes like prolonged mechanical ventilation,
      longer hospitalisation and more frequent withdrawal symptoms. Adult and paediatric data
      suggest that goal-directed sedation algorithms allow a more appropriate adaptation of the
      treatment to the patient's need and permit a reduction in the duration of mechanical
      ventilation.

      The objective was to evaluate the impact of a nurse-driven sedation protocol in a paediatric
      intensive care unit on duration of mechanical ventilation, total doses and duration of
      medications, Paediatric Intensive Care Unit (PICU) length of stay, incidence of
      ventilator-associated-pneumonia and occurrence of withdrawal.

    <description>All children aged less than 18 years, requiring mechanical ventilation for at least 24 hours and admitted in PICU between January 2013 and December 2013.

    <description>All children aged less than 18 years, requiring mechanical ventilation for at least 24 hours and admitted in PICU between May 2014 and March 2015.
Nurses managed analgesia and sedation following an algorithm, including COMFORT-B scale.</description>

    <description>The nurse-driven sedation protocol included the COMFORT-B scale. Initial doses were chosen by the physicians then all changes were made by the nurses with the aim of attaining an optimal range of analgesia and sedation, which was defined as values from 11 to 17 on the COMFORT-B score.</description>
