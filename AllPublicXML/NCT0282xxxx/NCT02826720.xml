  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of present study is to investigate any relationship between hyperlipidemia and
      periodontal disease regarding the periodontal parameters and plasma lipid parameters, along
      with age, gender, brushing habit, body mass index, dietary habit, physical activity, alcohol
      consumption.

      In this cross sectional study, a total of 160 individuals were divided into two groups based
      on their metabolic status: hyperlipidemic group (n=97) and normolipidemic group (n=63).
      Plaque index, gingival index, bleeding on probing (BOP), probing depth (PD), clinical
      attachment level (CAL) clinical parameters and community periodontal index of treatment needs
      (CPITN) scores were measured. Triglyceride (TG), total cholesterol (TC), low density
      lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C) and high density lipoprotein-cholesterol (HDL-C) levels had
      been determined previously during individuals routine systemic examinations. Daily brushing
      habits and interdental cleaning together with dietary habits, alcohol consumption and
      physical activity levels were also recorded.
