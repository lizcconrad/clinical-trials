  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      MedJ-01 Ridaforolimus Eluting Coronary Stent System is a single use device/drug combination
      product comprising:

        -  A mounted Cobalt Chromium (CoCr) alloy based stent

        -  A Rapid Exchange (RX) Coronary System Delivery System

        -  A Poly n-butyl methacrylate (PBMA) and CarboSil®Polymer matrix coating

        -  Ridaforolimus drug - CAS Registry Number: 572924-54-0 MedJ-01 is indicated for improving
           coronary luminal diameter in patients with symptomatic heart disease due to lesions in
           vessels with reference diameters of 2.5 mm to 4.25 mm, including complex lesions.

      JNIR01 is aimed at assessing TLF at one year with the MedJ-01 stent in a Japanese patient
      population to show equivalence to the results of the BIONICS Trial.

      This study aims to evaluate MedJ-01 safety and efficacy for de novo or restenosis lesion with
      target vessel diameter of 2.5mm to 4.25, for subjects undergoing coronary artery stent
      implantation. The target population is subjects undergoing PCI for angina (stable or
      unstable), silent ischemia (in absence of symptoms a visually estimated target lesion
      diameter stenosis of ≥70%, a positive non-invasive stress test, or FFR ≤0.80 must be
      present), NSTEMI, and recent subacute STEMI (&gt;72 hours from initial presentation and stable).
      Complex lesions are allowed. A maximum of two target vessels and two lesions per vessel may
      be treated (two lesions separated by up to 10 mm that can be covered by a single stent are
      considered as one lesion); the total planned study stenting in the coronary tree cannot
      exceed 100 mm.
