      Obese and overweight children or teens can join the Prevention and Care of Pediatric Obesity
      and Pediatric Diabetes Organization of Mulhouse. Those patients who are no longer able to
      exercize because of their physical condition start an effort rehabilitation program at the
      Organization. The study will evaluate the impact of this rehabilitation program on quality of
      life and appetency to physical activity for these children and teens.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Because of a National Obesity Plan (2010-2013) initiated by the French government in charge
      of health, the Pediatric Obesity and Pediatric Diabetes Organization of Mulhouse was created
      in 2011.

      This Organization is in charge of children or teens with:

        -  severe or growing obesity associated with respiratory, osteo-articular metabolic
           complications

        -  comorbidities worsened by obesity

      The Organization and the Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation department of the Mulhouse
      Hospital have worked together to create an effort rehabilitation program for obese or
      overweight children. The program, aiming movement rehabilitation, is based on reinforcement
      and endurance activities in a playful atmosphere and in an important motivational dimension.
      A medical examination is performed before the first session to confirm the patient's ability
      to follow an effort rehabilitation program. Each session is supervised by a teacher of
      adapted physical activity.
