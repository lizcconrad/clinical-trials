  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Alcohol misuse affects 5 million people in France. Even though the elderly are also concerned
      by this pathology, there is not much information about chronic alcohol misuse of this
      population in particular.

      Biological markers like gamma-glutamyltranspeptidase (GGT), mean corpuscular volume (MCV) and
      carbohydrate deficient transferrin (CDT) are usually used to detect alcohol abuse. As a
      biological marker of alcohol misuse, the specificity of the CDT is known to be superior to
      the GGT as well.

      However, when it comes to the elderly, alcoholism diagnosis tools are based on research of
      younger populations.

      This study aims to evaluate the benefit of the CDT to detect chronic alcohol use in the
      elderly.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Problematic alcohol misuse is frequent but tends to decrease with age. According to the
      French Alcohology Society, 10% of the adult population is alcohol abstinent and after 65
      years old, they are 40% to abstain from alcohol.

      On the other hand, the French Alcohology Society also reports that a regular or daily alcohol
      consumption for older people increases the risk of dependence on alcohol.

      For the elderly, biological disorders can be related to polymedication or other conditions
      related to the aging process, making it difficult to diagnose alcoholism for aged people.

      For the study, the three-item Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT-C) will be
      submitted to :

        -  every patient admitted in the Hospital of Mulhouse (France) for at least a day in the
           Geriatrics Department

        -  every patient entering the General Practitioner Support Association of Alsace, France
           (translated in French as the &quot;RAG&quot;).

      When the score of the AUDIT-C reaches at least 1 point, the study will collect results of the
      GGT and MCV performed as routine practice and add the CDT in the blood tests.

    <description>The Audit-C questionnaire is a three item alcohol screen that can help identify persons who are hazardous drinkers or have active alcohol abuse disorders (including alcohol abuse or dependence). The AUDIT-C is a modified version of the 10 question AUDIT instrument.
Score from 0 to 12. Each Audit-C question has a 5 answer choice, allotted points are from 0 to 4 points. In men, a score of 4 is considered as positive, optimal for identifying hazardous users or active alcohol abuse disorders. The same for 3 points in women.</description>
