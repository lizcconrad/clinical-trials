      Hepatitis B virus (HBV) reactivation happens after liver resection for HBV-related
      hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients, particularly for those with positive serum HBV-DNA .
      The incidence rate and risk factors of HBV reactivation after hepatectomy for serum HBV-DNA
      negative HBV-related HCC are unclear.From July 2012 to December 2015, 174 consecutive
      patients with serum HBV-DNA negative HBV-related HCC underwent resection were prospectively
      enrolled in the studied. There are 66 patients received preoperative antiviral therapy
      (antiviral group) and 108 patients did not receive any antiviral therapy (non-antiviral
      group). The incidence of HBV reactivation, risk factors of liver function were analyzed in
      perioperative period. HBV reactivation developed in 30 patients (27.8%) in the non- antiviral
      group and 2 patients (3.0%) in the antiviral group, respectively (P &lt; 0.001). Multivariate
      analysis revealed that minor hepatectomy (HR, 4.695; 95% CI, 1.257-17.537, P = 0.021) and
      without antiviral therapy (HR, 8.164; 95% CI, 1.831-36.397, p =0.006) were risk factors
      attributed to HBV reactivation. Patients in antiviral group and non-antiviral group or
      reactivation group and without reactivation group have similar ALT, TBil, ALB, and PT in 7
      days after resection. However, patients in antiviral group have significantly better ALT and
      ALB on day 30th after resection than those in control group. Moreover, similar phenomenon
      were observed when comparing those with or without HBV reactivation. Resection could lead to
      HBV reactivation during the perioperative period for serum HBV DNA negative HBV-related HCC,
      especially in patients who did not receive any antiviral therapy. Anti-HBV therapy can reduce
      the risk of reactivation, thus improving liver function after hepatectomy.
