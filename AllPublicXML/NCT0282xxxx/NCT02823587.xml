    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the effect of pulmonary rehabilitation on the
      transport of secretions, inflammation and respiratory resistance, and its repercussions on
      the quality of life in patients with bronchiectasis.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Bronchiectasis is characterized by pathological and irreversible dilation of bronchi caused
      by the inefficient removal of secretions and microorganisms and the perpetuation of
      inflammatory processes induced by chronic or recurrent infections, causing more damage to the
      airways that result in infections, and greater lesion airways and lung parenchyma. Pulmonary
      rehabilitation in people with bronchiectasis aims to improve exercise capacity, through
      effects on aerobic capacity and peripheral muscles, and to improve disease control and
      quality of life. The aim this study is to evaluate the effects of pulmonary rehabilitation on
      the transport of secretions, inflammation and respiratory resistance, and its repercussions
      on the quality of life in patients with bronchiectasis. In this study 60 volunteers, of both
      sexes, aged between 18-60 years, adequate the inclusion criteria, which will be assessed by
      lung function tests, the saccharin transport time, the inflammatory markers in the airways,
      the respiratory system resistance and quality of life scales. Volunteers will be randomly
      divided in pulmonary rehabilitation (PRG) and control groups (CG) that will be subdivided in
      bronchiectasis and healthy subgroups. In the PRG group they will receive supervised physical
      training twice a week and will be instructed to adopt a routine of home exercises, while CG
      will be informed about the benefits of physical activities. All volunteers will be evaluated
      after 8 weeks of the baseline and at the end of the research. Data evolution will be
      collected from medical records and notes of the medical team and physical therapy that will
      follow the routine of these participants
