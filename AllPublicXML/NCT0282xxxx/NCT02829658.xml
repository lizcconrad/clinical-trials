  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Borderline personality disorder (BPD) is characterized by a pervasive pattern of instability
      and impulsivity. Several North American prospective studies support the high level of mental
      health care utilization in this population. There is little data in other systems of health
      organization, such as France. Furthermore, little is known on the variables associated with
      the mental health service utilization among BPD patients.

      The main objective was to compare the utilization of mental health care among BPD patients,
      to the general population and patients with another personality disorder (PD) and to describe
      the demographic and clinical factors associated with the group of patients who use the most
      health care.

    <description>Assessment by a psychologist including the Structured Interview for Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM)-IV Personality Disorders (SIDP-IV) was given straight to those who had a score above 28. This questionnaire allowed us to distinguish one group of subjects with BPD and a group with other PD (without BPD). Clinical evaluation included Axis I (MINI), Axis II (SIDP-IV), psychopathological features (YSQ-I, Defense Style Questionnaire (DSQ-40), demographic variables and therapeutic alliance (Haq-II).</description>

        First, four groups were composed: BPD, other PD, control groups for PD and other PD. The
        first two groups were recruited from a screening of inpatients including a
        self-administered questionnaire (Personality Disorder Questionnaire 4+). Matched controls
        (age, sex) composed the 3rd and 4th group (BPD control and other PD control). They were
        randomly chosen in the health database insurance previously used.
