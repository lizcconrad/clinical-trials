    <textblock>
      The Vietnam Era Health Retrospective Observational Study (VE-HEROeS) is a national study on
      the health and well-being of Vietnam Veterans, including Blue Water Navy Veterans, as well as
      Veterans who served elsewhere during the Vietnam Era (1961-1975), and similarly aged U.S.
      residents who never served in the military. The investigators will invite approximately
      43,000 Vietnam and Vietnam Era Veterans, and approximately 11,000 members of the general U.S.
      population to participate in VE-HEROeS. These individuals are scientifically selected to
      participate; the study is not able to accept volunteers.

      All participants in VE-HEROeS will be asked to fill out a questionnaire on their military
      service, general health, age-related conditions, health care use, and the health experiences
      of their children and grandchildren. A smaller group will be asked to provide the
      investigators with access to some of their medical records. Topics of special focus for the
      study include cognition, hepatitis C infection, and neurologic conditions.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      It has been more than 40 years since the Vietnam War ended and there is little recent
      systematic knowledge of how Veterans of the Vietnam Era (1961-1975) have fared with regard to
      their overall health, lifestyle factors, and aging. This epidemiologic study, called the
      Vietnam Era Health Retrospective Observational Study (VE-HEROeS) will provide information
      about the health and well-being of Veterans of the Vietnam Era to Veterans and their families
      who have questions about the long-term health effects of service during the Vietnam War, to
      clinicians who care for Veterans and lack sufficient evidence to explain health conditions,
      and to the VA healthcare system in order to improve VA healthcare and anticipate future
      healthcare needs. The main objective of this study is to determine if the overall health of
      Veterans of the Vietnam War and Vietnam Era, with a special focus on neurologic conditions
      and hepatitis C infection, is different from that of their counterparts who did not serve in
      the military. Exploratory aims of the study are to determine if the investigators can obtain
      a sample of Blue Water Navy Vietnam Veterans (who served exclusively in deep coastal waters
      off of North or South Vietnam) and use the survey to describe their current health, and to
      determine the prevalence of Veterans who attribute health conditions of their descendants to
      their own military service, especially conditions potentially transmitted epigenetically. The
      study design is a survey, with hepatitis C and neurologic conditions validated by medical
      record review. The questionnaire includes both validated scales and new items about physical
      and mental health, exposures, and lifestyle. There are two versions of the questionnaire: one
      for Veterans of the Vietnam Era and one for those selected from the U.S. general population
      who have never served in the military. The questionnaires are as similar as possible, with
      the exception of questions about military service, exposures, or experiences that are either
      removed or modified in the non-Veteran questionnaire because they do not apply to this
      population.

    <description>Overall health will be measured by the mean physical component summary score (PCS) and the mean mental component score (MCS) of the Short Form 8 (SF-8) compared across the four groups. Mean scores on the 8 health concepts measured by the SF-8 (physical functioning, role limitations due to physical functioning, bodily pain, general health, energy/fatigue, social functioning, role limitations due to emotional problems, and psychological distress/well being) will also be compared. Adjustments may be made for age, gender, and prevalent co-morbidities.</description>

    <description>The investigators will compare post-war prevalence of conditions that have been linked to Vietnam War service in other scientific studies of multiple designs: neurologic conditions ( Parkinson's disease, dementia, stroke, brain injury), Hepatitis C; hypertension, ischemic heart disease, Type II diabetes, peripheral neuropathy, various cancers, cirrhosis, alcohol and drug dependency.</description>

    <description>Vietnam War Theater Veterans are defined for this protocol as those who served in the U.S. Armed Forces on the ground, in the air, or on the inland waters of Vietnam, Cambodia, and/or Laos between February 28, 1961 and May 7, 1975, inclusive. The investigators based this definition on legal dates of service set forth in 38 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) 3.2 - Periods of war, but broadened the definition of sites of military service that constituted war zones based on written historical accounts and input from Vietnam Veterans.</description>

        Veterans: We will obtain a stratified random sample of 45,067 Veterans from the Department
        of Veterans Affairs' United States Veterans Eligibility Trends &amp; Statistics (USVETS)
        database which we believe to be the most complete database of U.S. military Veterans in
        existence. Stratification will be on period of service within the Vietnam era: 1961-1964 or
        1965-1975. We will remove decedents and those without a current US postal address from the
        sample.

        U.S. public: The U.S. public general population comparison sample will be an age- and
        gender-matched sample of living non-Veteran members of the U.S. public born before 1958.
