      retrospectively

      Acquisition of data:

        -  Study of computer file: report available on DxCare hospital and Cora

        -  Collection of data as excel spreadsheet

        -  Statistical analysis: local management

        -  Anonymity of data:

             -  For each subject will be awarded an identifier (original name and surname - year of
                birth) and the data will be entered on a computer file which will be sent to the
                statistician in charge of analyzing the GHPSJ site. There will be no exchange of
                personal data for this study is single center on the site GHPSJ.

      Development of the study:

        -  Procedure:

             -  Series includable patients from the PMSI data

             -  Select folders according the inclusion criteria

             -  Collecting information from files on Excel spreadsheet by the internal charge of
                data collection (Sylvain CHAWKI)

             -  Statistical Analysis

             -  Writing Article

        -  Expected duration of patient recruitment: Retrospective of 2 and a half years from
           January 1, 2013 to April 31, 2015
