  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a confirmatory randomized controlled trial of the efficacy of a novel intervention
      combining neuroplasticity-based cognitive training with aerobic exercise, compared to the
      same systematic cognitive training alone. Treatment occurs for 6 months after randomization,
      with a followup assessment at 12 months. The investigators hypothesize that combining
      neuroplasticity-based computerized cognitive training and neurotrophin-enhancing physical
      exercise will produce neurotrophin increases and cognitive and functional improvements, even
      relative to cognitive training alone. The investigators target the period shortly after a
      first episode of schizophrenia to maximize the generalization of cognitive improvement to
      functional outcome, before chronic disability is established.

      The Cognitive Training and Exercise intervention consists of 24 weeks of systematic
      computerized cognitive training, 4 hours per week, plus aerobic exercise, 150 minutes per
      week. The Cognitive Training Intervention includes the same systematic cognitive training.
      The first 12 weeks involve neurocognitive training, using training exercises from Posit
      Science Brain HQ. The second 12 weeks involves social cognitive training, using the Posit
      Science SocialVille modules. Aerobic exercise occurs as two 45-minute sessions at the clinic
      and two 30-minute sessions at home weekly. Intensity of aerobic exercise is tailored to
      maintain an individualized target heart rate zone and is monitored by a heart rate recorder.
      A weekly one-hour Bridging Skills Group with other members of the treatment condition is
      designed to aid generalization of training to everyday life situations. The immediate target
      is brain-derived neurotrophic factor. The primary treatment outcomes are overall cognitive
      deficit level and global functioning level.
