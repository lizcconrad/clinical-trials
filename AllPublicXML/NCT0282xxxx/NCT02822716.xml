      The objectives of this study are to study the safety and effect of IRE as a treatment for
      inoperable hepatic and pancreatic malignancy.

    <textblock>
      Irreversible electroporation (IRE) is a form of non-thermal local ablation for solid tumors,
      it induces apoptosis of tumor cells by creating irreversible damage in the cell membrane
      using electric current. The use of thermal ablation for tumors adjacent to major blood
      vessels is not advisable because the &quot;heat-sink effect&quot; owing to blood vessels render the
      thermal treatment not effective. On the other hand, application of thermal ablation to a
      tumor adjacent to blood vessels or bile ducts will cause thermal damage to these structures.
      It has been shown in animal experiments that IRE is effective in causing cell death while
      blood vessels, bile ducts, and nerves in the vicinity are preserved. Early evidence of
      clinical studies has shown that IRE is a reasonably safe and effective treatment for
      pancreatic and hepatic tumors.

    <description>Irreversible electroporation (IRE) is a form of non-thermal local ablation for solid tumors, it induces apoptosis of tumor cells by creating irreversible damage in the cell membrane using electric current. IRE treatment is given for a therapeutic purpose as a non-surgical alternative to those patients with an inoperable condition.</description>

    <description>The treatment procedure is carried out percutaneously under ultrasound or CT guidance, or using laparoscopic or laparotomy approach when the lesion is close to hollow viscera or abdominal wall, with the patient under general anaesthesia. Insulated needle electrodes, will be placed in the treatment areas under ultrasound or CT guidance. The tumor lesion is identified, measured, and located by ultrasound or CT. Electrical current is administered in pulses with electrocardiographic synchronization to reduce the risk of cardiac arrhythmia.</description>
