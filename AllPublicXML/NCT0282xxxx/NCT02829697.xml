  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim is to investigate the effect of perineural administration of a series of different
      volumes of local anaesthesia (ropivacaine 0.2%) on nerve block duration and the variability
      of the duration in the common peroneal nerve and the sciatic nerve in healthy volunteers.

      The hypothesis is that nerve block duration is correlated to local anaesthetic volume, but
      only to a certain degree. After a sufficient volume a 'saturation level' will be reached, and
      nerve block duration will not increase further.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The trial is divided into two similar phases. Each phase will focus on a specific nerve.
      Phase 1 will focus on the common peroneal nerve and Phase 2 will focus on the sciatic nerve.

      After baseline measurements, the investigators will insert a peripheral intravenous catheter.
      Then, the investigators will insert a suture-method peripheral nerve catheter (Certa
      CatheterTM). Procedures will be done in a sterile manner as a standard of practice. The
      investigators will use an ultrasound (US)-guided short-axis, needle in-plane technique. For
      the US-scan, the investigators will use a linear or a curvilinear transducer.

      During interventions, volunteers will be monitored with continuous pulse oximetry. Placement
      of the peripheral nerve catheter will be facilitated by US using small injections of
      mepivacaine (carbocaine 2 %) in the skin and surrounding tissues and only isotonic saline (5
      mL) in the perineural space to prevent blocking of the nerve before ropivacaine injection.
      The catheter orifice will be placed by pulling either end of the catheter and guided by the
      built-in echogenic markings seen on US. Before injection of ropivacaine, the investigators
      will do careful aspirations through the catheter in order to prevent intravasal injection.

      Each ropivacaine injection will be administered via an infusion pump. This will ensure a
      constant infusion rate set to 10 mL per minute. During infusion, the volunteers will be
      monitored with continuous pulse oximetry.

      Before instigation of the ropivacaine infusion, the investigators will use US to verify full
      absorption of the isotonic saline in the perineural space.

      For each nerve, the subject will be randomly allocated to and receive one of five possible
      ropivacaine volumes. All volunteers and outcome assessors will be blinded to the ropivacaine
      administrations and infusion procedures. Outcome assessors will not be in the room, when the
      medication is prepared nor given. Preparation will take place behind a curtain and therefore
      also blinded to the volunteers.

    <measure>Duration of sensory nerve block</measure>
    <time_frame>1-24 hours</time_frame>
    <description>Application of a round, cooled glass container in the sensory distribution area of the tested nerve: The lateral part of the lower leg for the common peroneal nerve and beneath the foot for the tibial nerve. Testing will start after onset of sensory nerve block and continue until normal sensation has returned. When testing the sciatic nerve, we will continue testing until normal sensation has returned in both components of the nerve, i.e. the tibial and common peroneal nerve.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Length of nerve exposed to local anaesthesia</measure>
    <time_frame>10 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>We will measure local anaesthetic spread in a proximal-to-distal manner parallel to the nerve trajectory. Total length of the neural spread will be reported in millimetres from the most proximal point to the most distal point in which fluid, i.e. ropivacaine, is seen on ultrasound in proximity to the nerve. Testing will be done immediately after end of ropivacaine infusion.</description>

    <measure>Onset of sensory nerve block</measure>
    <time_frame>10-180 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>Application of a round, cooled glass container in the sensory distribution area of the tested nerve: The lateral part of the lower leg for the common peroneal nerve and beneath the foot for the tibial nerve. Testing will start ten minutes after end of infusion and continue for every fifth minute until onset. We will test for a maximum of 180 minutes.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Onset of motor nerve block</measure>
    <time_frame>10-180 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>Testing will start ten minutes after end of infusion and continue for every fifth minute until onset. When onset of sensory nerve block is confirmed, testing of motor nerve block onset will end as well, if not already found. Motor nerve block of the tibial nerve will be evaluated by plantarflexion of the ankle. Motor nerve block of the common peroneal nerve will be tested by dorsiflexion of the ankle.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Degree of sensory nerve block</measure>
    <time_frame>1-24 hours</time_frame>
    <description>We will test sensory nerve block using a subjective rating scale. We will grade from one to four: 1) &quot;not different from ipsilateral antebrachium&quot;; 2) &quot;different from ipsilateral antebrachium&quot;; 3) &quot;warm sensation&quot;; 4) &quot;no sensation&quot;. Grades 2-4 will be considered as successful sensory nerve blocks. It will be noted if the volunteer is in doubt. Nevertheless, this will be considered as a successful sensory nerve block and graded as 2) in the post hoc statistical analyses.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Degree of motor nerve block</measure>
    <time_frame>1-24 hours</time_frame>
    <description>This will be tested with the volunteer in the upright position using a sturdy counter for balance if necessary. Motor strength will be evaluated using a normal everyday activation of the lower leg: A toe and a heel raise, testing the common peroneal nerve via activation of the anterior tibial muscle and the tibial nerve via activation of the gastrocnemius muscle, respectively. Motor nerve block intensity will be evaluated on a scale from one to three: 1) normal strength, 2) paresis or 3) paralysis. Volunteers will be asked to perform a maximum contraction building up muscle force over three seconds. It will be noted if the volunteer is in doubt, which will be considered as 2) paresis in the post hoc statistical analyses.</description>
