  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The SCD (Selective Cytopheretic Device) is an extracorporeal device used as an adjunct to
      renal replacement therapy (RRT) to improve the outcomes of pediatric patients with acute
      kidney injury (AKI). Funding Source - FDA OOPD (SCD-PED-01)
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The selective cytopheretic device (SCD) is comprised of tubing, connectors and a hemofilter
      cartridge. The device is connected in series to commercially available Continuous Renal
      Replacement Therapy (CRRT) devices. Blood from the CRRT circuit is diverted after the CRRT
      hemofilter through to the extra capillary space (ECS) of the SCD. Blood circulates through
      this space and it is returned to the patient via the venous return line of the CRRT circuit.
      Regional citrate anticoagulation is used for the entire CRRT and SCD blood circuits.

          3. Age less than 22 years.

          4. Females of child bearing potential who are not pregnant (confirmed by a negative serum
             pregnancy test) and not lactating if recently post-partum.

          5. Intent to deliver full supportive care through aggressive management utilizing all
             available therapies for a minimum of 96 hours.

          6. Clinical diagnosis of AKI due to hemodynamic or toxic etiologies requiring CRRT (see
             Appendix B).

             AKI is defined as acute kidney injury occurring in a setting of acute ischemic or
             nephrotoxic injury with any one of the following:

               -  Increase in SCr by ≥0.3 mg/dL (≥26.5 μmol/L) within 48 hours or;

               -  Increase in SCr to ≥1.5 times baseline, which is known or presumed to have
                  occurred within the prior 7 days or;

               -  Urine volume &lt;0.5ml/kg/h for 6 hours

          7. All patients must be able to tolerate regional citrate anticoagulation. Tolerance of
             regional citrate anticoagulation is defined as meeting both of the following criteria:

               1. Two (2) hrs of treatment with citrate anticoagulation without side effects of
                  citrate therapy.

               2. Two (2) consecutive intra-circuit iCa levels &lt;0.40 mmol/L, at least 30 minutes
                  apart within the first 4 hours of citrate therapy.

          8. At least one non-renal organ failure or presence (proven or suspected) of sepsis -
