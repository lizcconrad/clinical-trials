    <textblock>
      SP2086 is a novel inhibitor of Dipeptide base peptidase 4, allows an insulin-independent
      approach to improve type 2 diabetes hyperglycemia. In this single-dose and multiple-dose
      study the investigators evaluated the safety, tolerability and Pharmacokinetics profiles of
      SP2086 in healthy volunteers.
