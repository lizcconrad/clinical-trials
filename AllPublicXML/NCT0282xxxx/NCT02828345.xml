      This research trial studies the levels of a type of biomarker, circulating tumor cells
      (CTCs), in the blood of patients with stage I-IV melanoma. A biomarker is a biological
      molecule found in blood, other body fluids, or tissues that is a sign of a normal or abnormal
      process, or of a condition or disease. A biomarker may be used to see how well the body
      responds to a treatment for a disease or condition. Studying samples of blood in the
      laboratory obtained before and after treatment from patients with melanoma may help doctors
      learn more about changes that occur in CTC levels and whether they may predict how well
      patients will respond to therapy.
