  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Aggressive hydration with lactated Ringer's solution (LRS) has been shown in a preliminary
      research to reduce the incidence of post-endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography
      (ERCP) pancreatitis. This randomized, controlled trial was designed to assess the effect of
      peri-procedural aggressive intravenous hydration with LRS on the incidence of post ERCP
      pancreatitis.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients underwent first-time ERCP were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive either LRS at a
      rate of 150 ml/hr starting 2 hours prior to procedure, and continued during and after
      procedure to complete 24 hours (aggressive hydration) or LRS at a rate calculated by the
      Holliday-Segar method given peri-procedurally as described earlier (standard hydration).
      Visual analog scale, serum amylase, lipase, C-reactive protein (CRP), and urine analysis were
      assessed prior to procedure and 24 hours after. The primary endpoint was post ERCP
      pancreatitis defined as new or increased epigastric pain persisting for ≥24 hours, elevation
      of amylase or lipase &gt;3 times the upper limit of normal.

    <description>Post ERCP pancreatitis is defined as hyperamylasemia (amylase &gt;3 times the upper limit of normal [300 U/L]) and pancreatic pain (epigastric abdominal pain radiating to the back scored by patient as development of or increase of pain ≥3 on a 0-10 visual analogue pain scale and persisting for ≥24 hours after ERCP). In those who had pain before the procedure, pancreatic pain is defined as an increase of ≥3 on the 0-10 visual analogue scale.</description>

    <measure>severity of post ERCP pancreatitis</measure>
