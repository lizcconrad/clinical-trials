    <textblock>
      This is a 1-treatment arm, open label design. This 1-day study includes a screening on day of
      attendance at clinic, followed by a washout period of 30 minutes to 8 hours (if participants
      are eligible for dosing the same day). The study also includes a supervised dosing with 10 mL
      oral solution and a 1 hour in-clinic evaluation period.

    <measure>Onset of Warming Sensation</measure>
    <time_frame>10 minutes post-dose</time_frame>
    <description>Onset and duration of action of warming sensation was measured by two stop watches started when the participants took the oral solution. First watch was stopped at the start of warming sensation and the second watch was stopped at the end. If onset had not occurred by 10 minutes then time to onset was censored at 10 minutes. 53 of the 57 participants had onset within 10 minutes after dosing.</description>

    <measure>Duration of Warming Sensation</measure>
    <time_frame>10 minutes post-dose</time_frame>
    <description>Duration of action of warming sensation was measured by two stop watches started when the participants took the oral solution. First watch was stopped at the start of warming sensation and the second watch was stopped at the end. If onset of warming sensation occurred within 10 minutes of dosing but had not ended by the end of 10 minutes following dosing, then the duration was censored at 10 minutes minus the time to onset</description>

    <measure>Warming Sensation Intensity at Pre-Dose and 60 Sec (Seconds) Post-Dose</measure>
    <time_frame>Pre-dose and 60 sec post-dose</time_frame>
    <description>Warming Sensation Intensity was measured on 100 mm visual analogue scale (VAS), marked as &quot;no warming sensation&quot; on the left hand side (= 0 mm) and &quot;strongest possible warming sensation&quot; at the right hand side (=100 mm) at pre-dose.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Participants With Acceptability of Warming Sensation</measure>
    <time_frame>10 minutes post-dose</time_frame>
    <description>Acceptability of strength of warming sensation was measured by a scale: 5= Much too strong; 4=Too strong (too warming); 3= Just about right (pleasant warming); 2= Too weak (not warming enough); 1= Much too weak</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Participants With Overall Opinion of Warming Sensation</measure>
    <time_frame>10 minutes post-dose</time_frame>
    <description>Overall opinion of warming sensation was measured by scale: 9= Like extremely; 8= Like very much; 7= Like moderately; 6= Like slightly; 5= Neither like nor dislike; 4= Dislike slightly; 3= Dislike moderately; 2= Dislike very much; 1= Dislike extremely</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Participants With Overall Opinion of Oral Solution</measure>
    <time_frame>1 hour post-dose</time_frame>
    <description>Overall opinion of oral solution was measured by scale: 4 = Excellent; 3 = Good; 2 = Fair; 1 = Poor; 0 = Unacceptable.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Local Oral Tolerability</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1 (at screening and end of study)</time_frame>
    <description>Local oral tolerability was assessed by performing oropharyngeal examination as follows: Results of oropharyngeal examination (Normal and abnormal); If abnormal, any signs of lesion on oral mucosa or irritation of oral mucosa.</description>

          <description>Duration of action of warming sensation was measured by two stop watches started when the participants took the oral solution. First watch was stopped at the start of warming sensation and the second watch was stopped at the end. If onset of warming sensation occurred within 10 minutes of dosing but had not ended by the end of 10 minutes following dosing, then the duration was censored at 10 minutes minus the time to onset</description>
          <population>The safety Population was defined as all treated subjects, i.e., all subjects who received any dose of study drug. The Safety Population was the primary population for both the primary and secondary endpoint and safety analysis. Of the 57 subjects in the Safety Population, 53 reported an onset of a warming sensation within10 minutes after dosing.</population>
