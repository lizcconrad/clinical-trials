    <textblock>
      This pilot clinical trial studies how well durvalumab before surgery works in treating
      patients with oral cavity or oropharynx cancer. Monoclonal antibodies, such as durvalumab,
      may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To investigate the effect of durvalumab on local and systemic immune activation by HPV
      status in patients with oral cavity and oropharynx head and neck squamous cell carcinoma
      (HNSCC).

      II. To examine the effects of durvalumab on systemic immune response to HPV and tumor
      associated antigens.

      III. To examine the effects of durvalumab on immune regulatory mechanisms. IV. To explore the
      association between levels of immune-regulatory micro-ribonucleic acid (miR) in plasma and
      saliva and immune response.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Investigate the effect of the treatment with durvalumab on the computed tomography (CT)
      scan and positron emission tomography (PET) scan response.

      II. Evaluate the safety of a short induction treatment with durvalumab.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive durvalumab intravenously (IV) over approximately 60 minutes on day 1.
      Treatment repeats every 2 weeks for up to 2 courses in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity. Within 3-17 days after last dose administration of durvalumab,
      patients undergo surgery. Patients may receive an additional dose of durvalumab if time to
      surgery is longer than 30 days.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 90 days.
