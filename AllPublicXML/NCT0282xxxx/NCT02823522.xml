    <textblock>
      Non-Celiac Gluten Sensitivity (NCGS) has been recently included among the gluten-related
      diseases. Patients suffering from NCGS are diagnosed after carefully excluding celiac disease
      (CD), and immunoglobulin E (IgE)-mediated wheat allergy. Then, in the absence of sensitive
      and specific diagnostic biomarkers for NCGS, a monitoring of the patient during elimination
      and re-introduction of wheat by a double-blind placebo controlled (DBPC) challenge method has
      been suggested as diagnostic hallmark. Some studies seem to suggest that wheat components
      other than gluten can cause the symptoms, and therefore the term &quot;non-celiac wheat
      sensitivity&quot; (NCWS) has been proposed instead of NCGS. While it is well known that CD is a
      long-life condition and a strict adherence to the gluten-free diet must be maintained, it is
      unknown whether this is valid for NCWS. On the year 2012, the researchers published a
      retrospective study, including 276 patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS)-like symptoms
      who had been diagnosed with NCWS using a DBPC challenge during a ten-years period
      (2001-2011). The present prospective study aimed to evaluate: A) how many of these patients
      are still following a wheat-free diet, and B) which percentage was still suffering from NCWS,
      diagnosed by DBPC wheat challenge, in a subgroup of that cohort.

      Non-Celiac Gluten Sensitivity (NCGS) has been recently included among the gluten-related
      diseases. Patients suffering from NCGS are diagnosed after carefully excluding celiac disease
      (CD) diagnosis by negative CD-specific serum antibodies and absence of intestinal villi
      atrophy, and excluding IgE-mediated wheat allergy, by negative serum specific IgE and/or skin
      prick test with wheat antigens. Then, in the absence of sensitive and specific diagnostic
      biomarkers for NCGS, a monitoring of the patient during elimination and re-introduction of
      wheat by a double-blind placebo controlled (DBPC) challenge method has been suggested as
      diagnostic hallmark. Obviously, this a cumbersome and time-consuming procedure which has been
      used in few studies.

      Despite an increasing percentage of the general population define themselves as
      &quot;gluten-sensitive&quot;, and by the year 2017 the market of the gluten-free products will be worth
      6.6 billion of dollars, doubts persist about many aspects of NCGS. Some studies seem to
      suggest that wheat components other than gluten can cause the symptoms, and therefore the
      term &quot;non-celiac wheat sensitivity&quot; (NCWS) has been proposed instead of NCGS. Furthermore,
      while it is well known that CD is a long-life condition and a strict adherence to the
      gluten-free diet must be maintained, it is unknown whether this is valid for NCWS.

      On the year 2012, the researchers published a retrospective study, including 276 patients
      with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS)-like symptoms who had been diagnosed with NCWS using a
      DBPC challenge during a ten-years period (2001-2011).

      The present prospective study aimed to evaluate the persistence of the NCWS condition in that
      cohort and, consequently, the researchers estimated : A) how many of these patients are still
      following a wheat-free diet, and B) which percentage was still suffering from NCWS, diagnosed
      by DBPC wheat challenge, in a subgroup of that cohort.

    <description>A structured questionnaire was administered to evaluate how many patients were still following a gluten-free diet (GFD) and how many a wheat-free diet.</description>

    <measure>Evaluation of the effect of the GFD on IBS symptoms</measure>
    <time_frame>Between July and November 2016</time_frame>
    <description>The researchers administered a modified version of the IBS Global Assessment of Improvement (IBS-GAI) score. A responder was defined as a patient whose symptoms were either 'moderately improved' or 'substantially improved' compared with the period preceding the NCWS diagnosis.</description>

    <measure>Evaluation of the severity of the IBS condition</measure>
    <time_frame>Between July and November 2016</time_frame>
    <description>The researchers administered the IBS Symptom Severity Scale (IBS-SSS), evaluating the change in total IBS-SSS score from the first evaluation (time of the NCWS diagnosis) and the follow-up evaluation (present study). A respondent was classified as a patient whose overall symptom severity on the IBS-SSS changed &gt;50 points.</description>

    <description>Finally, the repetition of the DBPC-wheat challenge will be proposed to the patients still on GFD. Those who will accept will be randomized to undergo the challenge. It will be performed with the same method used in the retrospective study.</description>
