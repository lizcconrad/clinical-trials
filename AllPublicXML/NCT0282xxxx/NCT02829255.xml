      Prospective interventional trial in lowlanders evaluating the effect of acute exposure,
      acclimatization and re-exposure to high altitude on cerebral autoregulation
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Baseline measurements will be performed in Santiago de Chile, 520 m, over the course of 3
      days. Participants will then travel by commercial airline (5 h flight) and by bus (3 h ride)
      to the ALMA base camp located at 2900 m near San Pedro de Atacama, northern Chile.
      Participants will stay there for the next 8 nights and they will be spend the days (6-8 h
      daily) at the telescope station at 5050 m while undergoing testing as described above at the
      first and the last day at 5050m. Daily transports from 2900 to 5050 m will be by car (1 h
      ride, one way). After the first 8 day altitude sojourn participants will return to the
      Santiago area (520 m) for a 6 day recovery period.

      A second altitude sojourn with an identical schedule as the one described above and a final
      low altitude stay of 3 days will follow.
