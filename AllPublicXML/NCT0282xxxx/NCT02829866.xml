  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Total hip replacement (THP) is widely used for hip osteoarthritis treatment. Surgeons are
      constantly looking to improve all aspects related to this procedure weather is improvement of
      implant design, instrumentation or surgical technique. Excellent clinical and radiological
      results were observed at medium and long term in the last years for AMIStem system.

      This observational study has the objective to survey hip prosthesis stability and function of
      the operated hip in patients who are not exposed to surgical risks. The principal
      investigator will contact all patients in order to perform the follow-up visit according to
      standard practice. Patients operated between January 2010 and December 2011 will be invited
      in the study during the clinical visit organised according to standard practice. Preoperative
      clinical and radiological data, intraoperative details and postoperative follow-up data at
      1-year will be retrospectively collected. Five-year data will be prospectively collected
      after inclusion in the study.
