      This chart review describe the response to systemic chemotherapy of patients with non-small
      cell lung cancer (NSCLC) harbouring a known somatic activating human epidermal growth factor
      receptor 2 (HER2) mutation. The analysis of this data will provide an initial description of
      the response to systemic chemotherapy in patients with NSCLC harboring an activating HER2
      mutation in order to inform the design and powering of future randomized controlled clinical
      trials of HER2-directed therapy.
