  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Angioplasty augmented radiofrequency denervation popliteal artery, in our opinion, will
      remove the spasm with macro and microcirculatory blood flow, which increases
      revascularization patency of tibial arteries.

Occlusion or subintimal perform transluminal recanalization of the artery. Then do balloon angioplastic stenosis or occlusion. Then in 3 portion of the popliteal artery starts ablation by the use &quot;Vessix Renal Denervation System Balloon&quot; performed radiofrequency denervation. After removal of the balloon, control angiography is performed.
