  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      We hypothesize that combining anti-PD1 treatment with radiotherapy might result in improved
      clinical response rates and PFS compared to anti-PD1 treatment in monotherapy.

      The current phase II trial aims at exploring the suggested benefits of the combination and
      aims to improve local and distant tumour responses by exploiting the pro-immunogenic effects
      of radiotherapy in addition to anti-PD1 treatment.

    <description>In patients with metastatic melanoma, anti-PD-1 treatment will be combined with stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT).
A total dose of 24 Gy SBRT will be delivered in 3 fractions to one measurable lesion and fractions will be separated &gt;48h and &lt;96h.</description>
