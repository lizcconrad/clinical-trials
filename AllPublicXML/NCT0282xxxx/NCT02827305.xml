      This study evaluates the adjunctive use of Centella Asiatica (gotukola) to scaling in the
      reduction of plaque and gingival inflammation. Patients were divided into three groups of
      which group 1 received scaling and gotukola mouthwash, group 2 received scaling only and
      group 3 received gotukola mouthwash only.

    <textblock>
      Mechanical plaque control by tooth brushing is considered to be the ideal way of preventing
      plaque associated gingivitis. However due to various factors individuals fail to perform an
      adequate quality of self performed plaque control. Centella Asiatica (gotukola) possess wide
      range of biological activities like anti-inflammatory, anti-psoriatic, anti-ulcer,
      hepato-protective, anticonvulsant, immunostimulant, cardioprotective, antidiabetic,
      antiviral, antibacterial, antifungal, etc. So, it could be used as adjunctive to mechanical
      periodontal therapy.

    <description>A total of 36 patients were participated in the study and the outcome measures were assessed 15 days after the start of the study, PLaque index ( Silnes and Loe 1964) - The buccal, lingual,mesial and distal surfaces of the index teeth is given a scoring from 0-3 The scores from the four areas of the teeth are added and divided by four in order to give the plaque index of the tooth. The index for the patient is obtained by summing the indices for all six teeth and dividing by six. Gingival index -Loe and Silnes 1963- The buccal, lingual,mesial and distal surfaces of all ginival tissues of index teeth were given a scroe from 0-3.This then constitutes the GI for the area and scores from the 4 areas of the tooth are added and divided by four to give GI for the tooth. Scores for individual teeth may be grouped to designate the GI for the group of the teeth. The scores are added and divided by nu,ber of teeth to get GI for an individual</description>
