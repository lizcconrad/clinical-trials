  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators will investigate which patients' characteristics are associated with
      caregivers burden and its evolution for outpatients visiting a memory clinic, in particular
      how functional autonomy, behavioral and psychological symptoms as well as patients
      comorbidities can influence caregiver burden.

      The study will be conducted among outpatients with progressive cognitive complaint followed
      in a Memory Clinic and their primary caregiver. The investigators hypothesis that caregivers
      experience a higher burden due to disease symptoms such as impairment of functional autonomy,
      behavioral and cognitive impairment, whatever the aetiology of the cognitive decline.

    <time_frame>The caregiver burden will be measured at baseline (Day 0)</time_frame>
    <description>The caregivers burden will be assessed using the validated short version of the Zarit Burden Inventory (ZBI), which was previously developed for routine medical care. The score is noted as a continuous variable ranging from 0 (no burden) to 7 (higher burden). The questionnaire includes 7 questions for which the caregivers could answer &quot;never&quot;, &quot;sometimes&quot; or &quot;nearly always&quot;: Does the fact of caring for your relative lead to 1. Difficulties in your family life, 2. Difficulties in your relationship with friends, hobbies, or in your work, 3. An impact on your health, 4. Do you have the feeling of no longer recognizing your relative? 5. Are you concerned for the future of your relative? 6. Do you feel you need more help to take care of your relative? 7. Do you feel a burden in taking care of your relative? The questionnaire of ZBI will be sent at home and completed by the caregiver before the patient's consultation at the memory centre.</description>
