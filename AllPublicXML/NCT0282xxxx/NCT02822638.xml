  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Ischemic heart disease is the leading cause of mortality in industrialized countries. ST
      elevated acute myocardial infarction is one of its most frequent and deadly manifestation. In
      the last 20 years, STEMI mortality has been reduced by 50% with the advent of timely
      reperfusion (primary percutaneous intervention) and significant progression in pharmacologic
      intervention.

      However, death and heart failure incidence after STEMI remain elevated: up to 20% at one
      year.

      Also, therapeutic management following international guidelines is standardized toward a
      &quot;one-size fits all&quot; therapeutic management.

      In order to continue improving myocardial infarction outcomes, there is a need to better
      understand and individualize therapeutic targets such myocardial reperfusion injury, post
      reperfusion inflammation, adverse left ventricular (LV) remodeling ….

      This knowledge will allow us to propose new therapeutic strategies and in the long run strive
      towards personalized medicine.

      The aim objective of this cohort of STEMI patients is to identify new biological markers of
      injury and prognosis.

      In STEMI patient refered for PCI at Louis Pradel Hospital, blood samples were taken on
      admission at (H0) and 4h after reperfusion.

      To constitute the serum bank of our STEMI cohort, samples were collected the same time as the
      blood tests done routinely.

      These additional samples were be centrifuged and treated and stored in a collection of
      biological samples of total serum and plasma and blood at the Biological Resource Center of
      HCL Neurobiotec at -80 ° C (DC- 2008-72, AC-2013-1867 certified NFS96900 FR13-018140).
