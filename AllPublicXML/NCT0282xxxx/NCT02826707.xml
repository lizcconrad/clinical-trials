  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Despite physical activity (PA) being a valuable modality for promoting health, the evidence
      for effective PA intervention strategies for manual wheelchair (MWC) users is underdeveloped.
      Community-based programs and telephone-counselling interventions to increase PA among MWC
      users have had some success, but the uptake and adherence to these interventions remains low
      within this population. Community-based programs may not reach MWC users who live in rural
      areas and have issues with transportation, while health professionals may not optimally
      relate with MWC when providing telephone counselling. Although the PA needs of MWCs are not
      fully understood, there is reason to believe that including peers into intervention delivery
      may have benefits.

      A feasibility trial is critical and prudent prior to moving forwards with a large and
      expensive multi-site randomized controlled trial (RCT) to ensure that: the intervention meets
      the needs of the target population; the right outcomes are measured; and that the
      intervention is feasible to administer.

      The objective of this study is to evaluate the feasibility of a Smartphone-delivered Peer-led
      Physical Activity Counselling (SPPAC) program for MWC users.

    <description>Physical activity will be measured objectively using Actigraphy, a small, lightweight accelerometry-based tri-axial activity monitor (Actigraph 3GTX) that is worn on the wrist and MWC without impeding bodily movements or PA. Information about motion direction and speed are integrated to produce an electrical current with variable magnitude and duration. The electrical current data are stored in the monitor as 'activity counts.'</description>
