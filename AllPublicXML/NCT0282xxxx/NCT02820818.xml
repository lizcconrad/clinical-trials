  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Preterm birth alters the normal sequence of lung development with lasting respiratory
      consequences. It is still unclear whether observed respiratory morbidities in preterm born
      individuals reflect sequelae from a non-progressive lung disease that occurred early in life
      or result from ongoing active disease that, if left undiagnosed and untreated, could increase
      the risk of a COPD-like phenotype. We propose to examine micro-structural abnormalities of
      the lung using innovative non-invasive imaging technologies in relation to pulmonary function
      and markers of inflammation and oxidative stress in young adults born preterm.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  20-29 years old

          -  For the pre-term subject: &lt;29 weeks gestational age, with or without BPD

          -  For the matched term control: â‰¥37 weeks gestational age with birth weight appropriate
             for gestational age i.e. between the 10th and 90th percentile

          -  Subject understands the study procedures and is willing to participate in the study as
             indicated by the signature on the informed consent

          -  Subject is judged to be in otherwise stable health on the basis of medical history

          -  Subject is able to perform reproducible pulmonary function testing (i.e., the 3 best
             acceptable spirograms have FEV1 values that do not vary more than 5% of the largest
             value or more than 100 ml, whichever is greater)

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patient is, in the opinion of the investigator, mentally or legally incapacitated,
             preventing informed consent from being obtained, or cannot read or understand the
             written material

          -  Patient is unable to perform spirometry or plethysmography maneuvers

          -  Subject has an implanted mechanically, electrically or magnetically activated device
             or any metal in their body which cannot be removed, including but not limited to
             pacemakers, neurostimulators, biostimulators, implanted insulin pumps, aneurysm clips,
             bioprosthesis, artificial limb, metallic fragment or foreign body, shunt, surgical
             staples (including clips or metallic sutures and/or ear implants)(at the discretion of
             the MRI Technologist/3T Manager)

          -  In the investigator's opinion, subject suffers from any physical, psychological or
             other condition(s) that might prevent performance of the MRI, such as severe
             claustrophobia
