      In this study we aim to more precisely define the clinical utility of PSMA imaging across a
      range of clinical indications in men with prostate cancer. To accomplish this, we will make
      the 18F-DCFPyL PET/CT scan available to urologists, medical oncologists, and radiation
      oncologists at Johns Hopkins and survey physicians as to the indication for ordering the
      PET/CT and if a change in management occurred as the result of new information gained from
      the scan. We believe these data will prove critical for planning future studies aimed at
      evaluating the efficacy of this test for improving patient outcomes.
