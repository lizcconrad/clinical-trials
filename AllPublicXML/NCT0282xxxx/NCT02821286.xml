  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This project intends the analysis and profiling of specific antibodies against major peanut
      allergens in peanut allergic individuals and molecular cloning of human antibodies against
      major peanut allergens.
    </textblock>

      -  Characterization of patient samples reactivity (sera obtained from blood) against major
           peanut allergens.

        -  Isolation of antibody-producing B cells.

        -  Molecular cloning of peanut-specific antibodies from antibody gene sequences obtained
           from B cells.

        -  Biophysical and functional characterization of isolated antibodies
