    <textblock>
      This is a pilot study of surgical patients whose postoperative care will be augmented with a
      personalized risk prediction platform (CALYPSO app).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      CALYPSO is a software platform that uses machine learning techniques to create personalized
      risk predictions for postoperative complications. Individual risk factors are then linked to
      best-practice interventions tailored to the individual patient. The investigator aims to test
      the hypothesis that using CALYPSO-augmented postoperative care will reduce complication rates
      in patients undergoing elective general surgery. Subjects undergoing surgery will be assigned
      to the CALYPSO intervention in the postoperative period.
