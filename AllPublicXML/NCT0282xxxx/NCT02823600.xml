  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to look at retinal abnormalities in outpatient renal
      dialysis patients using the FDA approved RetinaVue 100 hand-held (non-mydriatic) camera.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There are no studies evaluating (diabetic or non-diabetic) retinopathy in the renal dialysis
      patient population (~300,000 Americans). Approximately 50% of this population has End-stage
      Retinal Disease (ESRD) due to diabetes. Dialysis patients are among the most debilitated
      patients, and thus, have even more barriers to receiving their recommended annual retinal
      evaluation. The advent of the RetiaVue hand-held retinal camera holds great promise in this
      population, as dialysis patients access medical care 3 times a week, for several hours at a
      time at their dialysis clinic.

    <time_frame>one year</time_frame>
    <description>Usability survey data to be collected at two different time points by the camera operators. The first survey will be completed at the end of each eye exam asking the camera operator to assess the time and number of attempts to acquire acceptable images, the number of eye exams completed per full battery charge, and patient perceptions of ease of use. The second survey will be completed once per week and contains 11 questions measuring usability as ease of use on a 5-point Likert scale ranging from &quot;Strongly Disagree&quot; (1) to &quot;Strongly Agree&quot; (5).</description>
