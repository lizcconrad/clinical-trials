  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Prader-Willi Syndrome (PWS) is a rare syndrome with a prevalence of 15 to 20 000 at birth.
      PWS represents a large fraction of mental retardation syndromes due to a genetic cause and
      the most frequent cause of genetic obesity. The majority of the patients are seen by
      paediatricians. This syndrome is responsible for severe physical, psychological and social
      impairments.

      The diversity and the severity of the manifestations of this disease explain the requirement
      of multidisciplinary care which deserve specific evaluation. Today the follow-up and
      management of a great proportion of these patients are greatly insufficient if not absent.

      Teams strongly lack information on the natural history of this severe disease and on the
      factors involved in its evolution and the outcome of these patients throughout life. The
      present project is to implement a register in the whole country for children and adult
      patients
