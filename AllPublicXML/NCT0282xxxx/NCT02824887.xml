      Compare the curative effects of electroacupuncture deep needling difference in efficacy of
      the conservative treatment for lumbar five point therapy and routine western medicine, to
      explore the efficacy and superiority, open a new way for the treatment of lumbar disc
      herniation.Through a comparative analysis of the data on the efficacy of different TCM
      Syndrome Types in the subgroup of patients with, to explore the effect of Electroacupuncture
      of deep needling and five lumbar acupoint therapy is most suitable for the TCM syndrome
      type.Through follow-up, patients in the two groups moment condition and the survival of the
      state was evaluated, explore the effect of electroacupuncture deep needling the long-term
      effects of five lumbar acupoint therapy for treatment of lumbar disc herniation and factors
      that may influence the recurrence of symptoms.

      Beijing and North China area is lumbar protrusion of the intervertebral disc is the most
      prevalent area, much due to white-collar workers movement amount is small, the long-term bad
      posture, or do not move for a long time does not accept the ultraviolet radiation due to
      osteoporosis. The lumbar disc herniation in young people in a year of rapid growth trend,
      serious illness and severe low back pain even cannot move and accompanied by paralysis of the
      legs, hair is cool, weakness, intermittent claudication even muscle atrophy and neurological
      dysfunction, and so on. Some of them have already caused the degeneration of intervertebral
      disc or the phenomenon of aging. Recent studies show that only 10% - 20% of the lumbar disc
      herniation patients need surgical treatment, for does not have the surgery patients with,
      choice of a curative effect, quick effect and side effects of small, simple conservative
      treatment methods become many lumbar intervertebral disc herniation were urgent
      needs.Electroacupuncture and deeply needling five lumbar acupoint therapy is the person in
      charge of the project after more than 20 years of clinical experience put forward the
      innovation specific therapy is a novel method for the treatment and prognosis of lumbar
      protrusion of the intervertebral disc to carry out the innovative clinical research
      applications, both at home and abroad there is no precedent. The project team through a small
      range of clinical research and literature research have confirmed the efficacy of electro
      acupuncture treatment of lumbar disc herniation is reliable, but the long-term efficacy of
      acupuncture therapy has not been carried out. Therefore, combined with the cohort study of
      conventional medical practice without human intervention, the results of the study more in
      line with the actual advantages of the design prospective cohort study. Through long-term
      follow-up, with a large number of clinical evidence of electroacupuncture deep needling five
      lumbar acupoint therapy for treatment of lumbar disc herniation with conventional western
      medicine conservative treatment when compared to the differences in efficacy, treatment,
      recurrence rate, and to explore the long-term effect of lumbar disc herniation recurrence
      factors and this kind of therapy in the treatment of lumbar disc herniation.This project
      involved deep needling lumbar five points and long-term follow-up of the key contents and fit
      the lumbar disc herniation rate high, and recurrent episodes of the characteristics of the
      course of lingering, represents a concern in modern medical disease curative effect at the
      same time pay more attention to the development direction of the prognosis of the disease,
      with good prospects for clinical application. After 1 year, 175 patients visit and follow up
      the formation of the research results, will be able to EA deep needling lumbar five point
      therapy to provide high quality clinical evidence, and gradually formed this kind of special
      treatment as the core characteristics of traditional Chinese medicine treatment pattern,
      promote the hospital in clinical characteristics and advantages of the party to the
      development. And in order to attract patients with indications, the amplification of the
      unit's outpatient volume, to achieve indirect economic benefits. From the social point of
      view, this study explore drawn about the clinical results and the research process of the
      patients for rehabilitation guidance, will be of direct benefit to the patient's path choice,
      for long-term efficacy and prognosis of diseases and lay a good foundation, reduce disease
      recurrence to help patients to relieve pain, shorten the course of disease, saving the cost
      of medical treatment. At the same time, a large number of clinical cases of the subject group
      will be used to establish a database of patients with lumbar disc herniation, which is
      convenient for the retrospective study in the future. This study through the practice of
      training training a group with high data acquisition and doctor-patient communication skills
      and master the characteristics and effective treatment method for the researchers, will also
      become the support project subject to bear the backbone of the sustainable development.
