  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) is a chronic autoimmune, inflammatory disease and
      musculoskeletal pain is one of the most common symptoms. This study will investigate whether
      transcutaneous stimulation of the vagus nerve will decrease lupus musculoskeletal pain. This
      study will additionally investigate the biologic effects of vagus nerve stimulation on
      inflammation. It will be the first clinical study using one of the body's own pathways of
      modulating the immune system and inflammatory response, the cholinergic anti-inflammatory
      pathway, in SLE.

    <description>Patients will receive transcutaneous stimulation of the auricular branch of the left vagus nerve for 5 minutes daily for 4 consecutive days. The device is a handheld electrical pulse generator and a pair of electrodes to be placed at the ear for stimulation. The specific target at the ear will be the auricular branch of the vagus nerve which innervates the skin of the ear canal. Electrodes will be placed near/at the entrance to the canal of the ear to provide stimulation to the auricular branch.</description>
