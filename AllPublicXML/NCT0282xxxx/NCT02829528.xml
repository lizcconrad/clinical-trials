      An initial evaluation of Little Flower Yoga for Kids will be conducted in a small sample of
      18-30 Kindergarten and First Grade students (3-5 per class) enrolled in Girls Preparatory
      Charter School of the Bronx. The overall aim of this study is to ascertain the short and
      longer-term effects of Little Flower Yoga for Kids, a promising yoga and mindfulness program
      for children, which incorporates five elements (connect, breathe, move, focus, relax) to
      improve the child's ability to sustain attention and regulate emotions.

      The overall aim of this project is to ascertain the effects of Little Flower Yoga for Kids, a
      promising yoga and mindfulness program for children developed by Jennifer Cohen Harper, MA,
      E-RCYT, which incorporates five elements (connect, breathe, move, focus, relax) to improve
      the child's ability to sustain attention and regulate emotions. While research supports that
      yoga programs and mindfulness programs yield positive outcomes on numerous factors, there are
      no independent studies presently examining the effects of a combined yoga and mindfulness
      intervention (like Little Flower Yoga for Kids) on both emotion regulation and sustained
      attention.

      The investigators propose conducting an initial evaluation of Little Flower Yoga for Kids in
      a small sample of 18-30 Kindergarten and First Grade students (3-5 per class) enrolled in
      Girls Preparatory Charter School of the Bronx. Little Flower Yoga for Kids is currently part
      of the curriculum at Girls Preparatory Charter School of the Bronx and implemented by Kelli
      Love, M.Ed., 500 RYT, received her certification from the Little Flower Yoga for Kids Teacher
      Training Program. Specifically, the investigators will conduct a preliminary trial with a
      sample of 5-7 year olds (Kindergarten/First Grade), who meet a predetermined threshold of
      having either emotional regulation and/or attentional difficulties, to determine the effects
      of Little Flower Yoga for Kids on sustained attention and emotion regulation. Measures of
      these outcomes will occur at initial participant screener, baseline, mid-treatment (4.5
      months after the start of the program), and post-treatment (after 9 months).

    <description>Little Flower Yoga for Kids is a New York based organization dedicated to making the tools of yoga and mindfulness available to all children and teens. Their Teacher Training Program focuses on the physical, mental emotional, and social wellbeing of students. Teachers are trained to use the five elements format (connect, breathe, move, focus, relax). Implementation of the Little Flower Yoga for Kids curriculum will be manualized prior to the start of the study with Ms. Love, and will be presented as a series of activities (e.g., poses) throughout the school year. The emphasis in these yoga and mindfulness activities is exploration not competition, which allows the child to learn and develop at her own pace with the support of Ms. Love. The children participate in the Little Flower Yoga for Kids intervention at school for 40 minutes per class, 3 to 5 times per week, for the entire academic school year (9 months).</description>

        While all students enrolled in kindergarten or first grade at Girls Preparatory Charter
        School of the Bronx (between the ages of 5-7) will continue to take yoga class (with the
        Little Flower Yoga program Curriculum) taught by Ms. Keli Love, the investigators will only
        be collecting data on (at most) 30 of the students. The following inclusion and exclusion
        criteria will be employed to determine which students will be included in the data
        collection:

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Suspected emotion regulation and/or attention difficulties by the child's teacher.
             This procedure includes completion (by the teacher) of the Emotion Regulation
             Checklist (ERC) and the inattention subscale of the Swanson, Nolan, and Pelham - IV
             (SNAP-IV) (see measures section below). The Kindergarten and First Grade teachers will
             be asked to identify the top 5 students in their class exhibiting high levels of
             emotion dysregulation and/or inattention in comparison to their peers, and to then
             fill out the two assessment measures for each of the 5 selected children. They must
             meet a predetermined threshold of either measure, which have been determined based on
             previous research, to be included in the data collection;

          -  Child must be fluent English speaker, so they are able to complete the assessments.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Of the individuals chosen for participation in data collection, they will be excluded from
        the study if:

          -  There is evidence of significant developmental delay or psychosis that impacts the
             child's ability to function and to fully engage in the yoga-mindfulness intervention;

          -  If the youth or parent presents with emergency psychiatric needs that require services
             beyond that which can be managed within a preventive intervention format (e.g.
             hospitalization, specialized placement outside the home), active intervention by
             research staff to secure what is needed will be made.
