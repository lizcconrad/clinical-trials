  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The morbidity of colorectal cancer and the surgery number among elderly is growing. The
      investigators need to provide more advanced and specific monitoring technology for these
      patients. Index of consciousness (IoC) monitor is now widely used among endoscopy,
      cholecystectomy and other common clinical applications. The investigators goal is to verify
      whether using IoC monitor could help to improve the postoperative recovery after colorectal
      surgery.

      Participants will be randomly assigned, in a 1:1 ratio, to receive IoC monitoring or BIS
      monitoring during the operation as the criteria for adjustment of analgesics use. The
      randomization sequence will be computer-generated, and randomization will be performed in
      blocks and will be stratified according to participating center. The number of dialysis and
      patient's recovery after the transplantation will be recorded. The participation of each
      patient is scheduled till they discharge from hospital.

Keep IoC1 40 to 60 while IoC2 30-50.Target concentration of propofol was decreased by 0.5 μg/ml per adjustment when IoC1&lt;40, with a maintenance value between 40 and 60. The target concentration of remifentanil was increased by 1 ng/ml per adjustment when IoC2&gt;50 but was decreased by 1 ng/ml per adjustment when IoC2&lt;30, with the maintenance value between 30 and 50.</description>

Keep BIS 40 to 60.The doses of propofol and remifentanil were adjusted by the anesthetists according to BIS. Target concentration of propofol was decreased by 0.5 μg/ml per adjustment when BIS&lt;40, with a maintenance value between 40 and 60. The target concentration of remifentanil was increased by 1 ng/ml per adjustment when BIS&gt;60 but was decreased by 1 ng/ml per adjustment when BIS&lt;40, with the maintenance value between 40 and 60.</description>
