      Primitive kidney disease IgA, represented by Berger's disease and rheumatoid purpura
      nephropathy, are the first cause of kidney failure from chronic glomerulonephritis: changes
      in 20 years to end-stage renal failure is described in 10 to 30 % of cases in Berger's
      disease and in 15 to 20% of cases in nephropathy HSP. These two pathological entities share
      biological and histological characteristics, as well as common pathophysiological mechanisms,
      particularly the production of abnormally glycosylated IgA1 promoting their proliferation in
      the mesangium. Tonsils part of Iga abnormal production sites that would be associated with an
      infectious stimulus, tonsillectomy has been studied as a possible treatment in primitive IgA
      nephropathy. The benefit of tonsillectomy is controversial: many Japanese studies demonstrate
      its effectiveness in terms of reduction of proteinuria, improved renal function in the long
      term regression of histological lesions and reduced risk of relapse following clinical
      remission whereas European studies do not suggest its effectiveness in treating IgA
      nephropathy. In this context, the aim of our study is to describe the scope of practice of
      tonsillectomy in the treatment of primary renal disease in IgA child in the inter East region
      and describe the short renal become Strasbourg end of the cohort that received this
      treatment.
