  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research is to develop and test the feasibility of an exercise
      intervention for persons with painful knee osteoarthritis involving the patella (kneecap).
      Participants in the patellofemoral osteoarthritis (PFOA) group will be treated with a 6-week
      supervised exercise program that targets strengthening the hip and trunk core muscles.
      Painfree control participants will attend one session to gather biomechanical, strength, and
      function data for use in comparison to the patellofemoral osteoarthritis group. Feasibility
      outcomes include adherence to the treatment program, recruitment, and retention. It is
      hypothesized that PFOA group participants will change score on a knee pain and function
      questionnaire by the minimum clinically important difference score for positive improvement
      at the end of the 6-week intervention program.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators propose to develop and test the feasibility of a 6-week supervised hip and
      core muscle exercise intervention for persons with painful patellofemoral osteoarthritis
      (PFOA), a common condition for middle-aged and older adults. Currently there is limited
      evidence regarding effective conservative interventions for PFOA, a chronic condition that is
      painful and limits function and quality of life. Exercise is recommended as a first-line
      treatment for knee osteoarthritis, but the optimal type of exercise for PFOA is unknown. This
      intervention is based upon similar programs shown to improve pain and function in younger
      persons with patellofemoral pain, a condition that may lead to PFOA. Feasibility outcomes
      include adherence to the treatment program, recruitment, retention, and the impact of the
      intervention on participants' pain and function at 6-weeks and 6 months after finishing the
      program. The investigators will also compare PFOA participants to a matched pain-free
      volunteer control group to explore the differences in their biomechanics, muscle strength,
      pain report, and function at baseline. Data from this feasibility study will be used to
      design a future randomized controlled trial investigating the efficacy of conservative
      exercise interventions for PFOA. The investigators' overarching goal is to develop a
      conservative exercise intervention that improves the symptoms, function, and quality of life
      of persons with PFOA.
