  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Recent studies have found that up to 45 % of patients with type 1 diabetes have metabolic
      syndrome, a cluster of conditions (abdominal obesity, hypertension, dyslipidemia, insulin
      resistance) that increase the cardiovascular risk. The investigators have observed in
      previous studies a strong association between the adherence to a Mediterranean diet and the
      prevalence of metabolic syndrome on patients with metabolic syndrome. However, no
      intervention has been realized on this population and the current recommendations (low fat
      diet) differ from the Mediterranean diet. A nutritional intervention on the principles of the
      Mediterranean diet could therefore play a role in the treatment of the metabolic syndrome in
      Type 1 diabetes patients. The main objective of this study is to examine the impact of a
      nutritional intervention on the waist circumference after 6 months of an intervention group
      (Mediterranean diet) versus a control group (low fat diet).

    <description>Participants will receive nutritional lessons on the principles of the Mediterranean diet. This type of diet is defined with a carbohydrate intake of 45-55% of total energy intake, 15-20% of proteins, 30-35% of lipids and less than 7% for saturated fat. Nine sessions with a nutritionist are planned to cover various topics of the diet.</description>
