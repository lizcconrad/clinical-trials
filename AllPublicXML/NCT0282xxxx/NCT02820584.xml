  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Mono-center, un-controlled, open label, first in human, clinical trial. Approximately 20
      patients (in order to achieve 12 valuable patients). The expected accrual time would range
      between 12 and 18 months. Follow-up, including clinical, immune and radiological monitoring
      will end two years after the initial surgery of the last patient enrolled. The primary
      objective will be to assess the activity of immunotherapy in terms of its effect on immune
      response. In particular we will investigate the effect of treatment on effector cells
      including CD8 T cells, NK cells and Natural Killer T (NKT) cells. The sample size of 12
      eligible patients was identified on ethical and practical considerations, rather than by a
      formal sample size calculation.
