    <textblock>
      This pilot study seeks to demonstrate feasibility to conduct data collection and illustrate
      potential for effect of fractionalized bouts of stair climbing on glucose control in adults
      at risk for type 2 diabetes.

      Objective: Compare the short-term effects of two different fractionalized stair climbing bout
      protocols on glucose control among adults at risk for type 2 diabetes.

      Rationale: Fractionalized physical activity is associated with reduced BMI, glycated
      hemoglobin, lower 2-hr plasma glucose and insulin sensitivity in cross-sectional studies.
      Yet, few studies have examined the effects of fractionalized or intermittent physical
      activity in a prospective manner. Furthermore, the research is limited to patients with
      diagnosed type 2 diabetes, or using exercise of a moderate intensity.

      The hypothesis is that stair climbing, a vigorous-intensity activity, may have a greater
      health effect. However, this has not been tested in short bouts of activity that are spread
      out during a day.

      Implications: Fractionalized physical activity may be more feasible for adults at risk for,
      or with diagnosed type 2 diabetes who are not currently active. These short bouts can
      increase energy expenditure throughout the day, rather than in one long continuous bout as
      currently recommended.
