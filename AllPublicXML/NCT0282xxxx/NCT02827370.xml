      The purpose of the study is to determine if a targeted dietary change can enhance the effect
      of neo-adjuvant chemotherapy
    </textblock>

      Primary objective:

      I To determine if dietary alternations designed to downregulate the dominate molecular
      drivers of an individuals' breast cancer will enhance the effect of neoadjuvant chemotherapy
      and allow for an increase in the pathologic complete response rate.

      Secondary objectives

      I) Investigator measurable changes to molecular and patient characteristics from precision
      nutrition to determine a metric for evaluation this treatment in future studies.

    <description>During chemotherapy, patients will receive dietary counseling based on the molecular pathways driving their specific breast cancers found through genetic testing. Nutritional recommendations will seek to down-regulate the dominant molecular drivers of an individual's breast cancer while they are receiving standard chemotherapy as outlined by their treating medical oncologist.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Pathologically proven invasive breast cancer

          -  Planned neoadjuvant chemotherapy determined by the judgment of the medical oncologist

          -  The patient must be female

          -  Age ≥ 18

          -  Non-metastatic and non-inflammatory breast cancer

          -  History/physical examination, including breast exam and documentation of weight and
             Karnofsky Performance Status of 80-100% for at least 60 days prior to study entry.

          -  Women of childbearing potential must be non-pregnant and non-lactating and willing to
             use medically acceptable form of contraception during chemotherapy

          -  Patient must capable of and provide study specific informed consent prior to study

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patient is male.

          -  Age &lt;18 years

          -  Clinical stage IV cancer

          -  Inflammatory breast cancer (T4d)

             in situ of the cervix) unless disease free for a minimum of 1 year prior to
             registration

          -  Non-epithelial breast malignancies such as sarcoma or lymphoma

          -  Active Gastrointestinal/Malabsorption disorder at the discretion of the Principal
             -Investigator which may include:

               -  Chronic Diarrhea or Vomiting
