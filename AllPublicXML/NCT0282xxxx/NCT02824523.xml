    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to learn new information about the underlying cause of
      aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease (AERD) and the benefit of high-dose aspirin therapy.
      AERD is a disease that involves asthma, recurring nasal polyps, and respiratory reactions to
      aspirin and other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. This study will be conducted on
      individuals with AERD who are referred to the Brigham and Women's Hospital AERD Center for
      clinical evaluation and potential aspirin desensitization. Desensitization to aspirin and
      subsequent treatment with daily high-dose oral aspirin is standard of care for patients with
      AERD who do not respond adequately to steroids and have recurrent nasal polyposis or
      symptomatic asthma. This study will involve four visits to Brigham and Women's Hospital and
      will align closely with the standard of care for the treatment of AERD.

          -  History of at least one clinical reaction to oral aspirin or other nonselective COX
             inhibitor with features of both lower (cough, chest tightness, wheezing, dyspnea) and
             upper (rhinorrhea, sneezing, nasal obstruction, conjunctival itching and discharge)
             airway involvement

          -  Stable asthma (post-bronchodilator FEV1 of â‰¥70%, no use of oral or systemic steroids
             for at least 1 month, and no hospitalizations or emergency room visits for asthma for
             the prior 6 months) at the time of entry into the study

          -  Currently taking montelukast as part of standard asthma treatment for at least 4 weeks

             visits for asthma for the prior 6 months)

          -  Use of zileuton (which can mask symptoms of aspirin-induced reaction) within 1 month
