    <textblock>
      South Africa has one of the highest rates of violence towards women globally. However, little
      is known about how to prevent men's use of violence. The Sonke CHANGE Trial tests an
      intervention that targets men as individuals, groups, and community members in a peri-urban
      setting in South Africa. Eighteen neighborhoods will be randomly assigned to either the
      intervention condition or a control group. By speaking to men at baseline, 12 months, and 24
      months, investigators will learn whether violence and other health behaviors shift over time.
      Alongside the trial, qualitative research will explore how the intervention took place and
      why participants may change attitudes or behaviors.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will refine and evaluate a multi-level model for reducing violence against women
      and girls in urban South Africa.

      The intervention is a refinement of an existing gender-transformative programme that includes
      community mobilisation and advocacy. Called the Sonke CHANGE intervention, it will extend
      beyond a conventional group-based workshop approach to address the multi-level nature of
      violence and create an enabling environment for men to embrace more equitable forms of
      masculinity. Given the strong associations between masculinities and men's use of partner
      violence, now is an opportune moment to test the Sonke CHANGE model to determine its impact
      on men's use of violence.

      The multi-level Sonke intervention will be evaluated using a cluster randomised controlled
      trial design. In a peri-urban setting of Diepsloot, neighbourhood &quot;clusters&quot; (n=18) will be
      randomly assigned to receive the intervention or a wait-list condition. Baseline, 12 month,
      and 24 month measures will assess changes in primary outcomes (men's reported use of intimate
      partner and non-partner violence) and secondary outcomes (severe violence, masculinity norms,
      harmful alcohol use, mental health). Formative qualitative research will explore the
      environmental context of Diepsloot, community views on violence, men's mobility, and their
      experiences of fathering. A longitudinal process evaluation will explore intervention
      delivery, unfolding of the advocacy element of Sonke CHANGE intervention, and potential
      mechanisms to change amongst participants.

    <description>Men's use of violence towards an intimate partner will be measured using an adapted version of the questionnaire from the South African Medical Research Council's Study on Men's Health and Relationships (6, 61). The questionnaire includes items around emotional abuse, economic abuse, physical violence, and sexual violence. Primary outcomes will be defined as dichotomous outcomes: any use of physical violence and / or any use of sexual violence.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in severe violence</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months, 24 months</time_frame>
    <description>Men's use of severe violence is defined as any instance of men reporting more than once response to a single physical or sexual IPV item OR a response of once or more than once to two or more physical and/or sexual items.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in controlling behavior</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months, 24 months</time_frame>
    <description>Male Controlling Behaviour will be measured using the Pulerwitz Sexual Relationship Power and Control scale items (65). This scale has been validated in South Africa (66), and has been used by members of our team in previous studies (67).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in gender attitudes</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months, 24 months</time_frame>
    <description>Gender Attitudes will be measured using the Gender Equitable Men's Scale (GEM Scale) (63), an 18-item Likert scale. Gender Norms will be comprised of similar items, but phrased in a Likert scale for whether a man's friends hold those beliefs.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in harmful alcohol use</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months, 24 months</time_frame>
    <description>Harmful alcohol use will be measured using the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT), a 10-item scale designed to measure alcohol consumption and identify risks for alcohol abuse and dependence (62).</description>

    <description>The Sonke CHANGE intervention is a multi-level model aimed at individual, group, community, and societal levels. Sonke's programming is comprised of three core components:
Workshops based on the premise that deeply held gender and sexuality beliefs can be critically examined and transformed in a reflective group setting. Workshops aim to challenge inequitable and harmful ideas about manhood and encourage men to take action to promote equality.
Community Action Teams (CATs) are comprised of interested men and women, who mobilize on a voluntary basis around issues in their neighborhoods. Methods include ambush theatre, murals painting, door to door campaigns, street soccer festivals, rallies, and community dialogues.
Local Advocacy is undertaken by CAT members, who aim to hold government and other duty bearers to account for VAWG prevention. CAT members join local community structures to advance community education and local government accountability.</description>
