  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The disease Osgood-Schlatter is most commonly found in sports teenager growing up apophysose
      accounting for 28.4% of osteochondrosis by Breck. It relates to 62% of osteochondrosis knee
      and affects adolescent girls between 10 and 12 and boys between 12 and 15 It is usually
      considered a benign pathology that cures in the majority of cases. However, in 5-10% of cases
      there is persistent residual pain in adulthood.

      The classic complication is the avulsion fracture of the tibial tuberosity in adolescents who
      continued his sports without restriction.

      The possible consequences are numerous including the presence of a free bone fragment at the
      insertion of the tendon originally described by Osgood the establishment of a genu
      recurvatum, a high kneecap or patella alta and an enlarged tibial tuberosity (ATT) annoying
      sport.

      The main two treatments are complete rest from sport activity or cast immobilization.

      The main objective is to compare these two technics according to the proportion of full
      sporting recovering at 12 months
