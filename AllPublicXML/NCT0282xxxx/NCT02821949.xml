    <textblock>
      Treatment of a stage IV NSCLC is based on chemotherapy and requires before each session to
      check clinically, biologically and radiologically absence of infection. This biological
      evaluation is based on the CRP rate. Lots of infections may occur in this situation and could
      reduce by three the patient's life duration. However it is very important to make as early as
      possible a correct diagnosis of infection. CRP rate is classically higher for those patients
      even without any infection. In comparison with CRP, Procalcitonin (PCT) is well-known for its
      better sensibility and specificity for the infection diagnosis but has never been study in
      case of active cancer. The aim of this study is to evaluate the Procalcitonin basal rate for
      those patients suffering from NSCLC. It could be a simple and reliable method to use. So the
      investigators decided to include each new patient with NSCLC stage IV coming for his
      first-line chemotherapy without any infection sign, and to realize a Procalcitonin dosage
      before the start of the treatment. This sample will be analyzed at the chemical laboratory
      and the result will not be communicated to the patient physician. A new clinical evaluation
      will be realized either at the hospital or by phone at day 7 to search any sign of infection.
      In absence of infection, patient will be reevaluated at day 14, 21 and 30. In case of
      infection, a new Procalcitonin (and CRP) dosage will be performed.
