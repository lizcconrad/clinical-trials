      Using phage libraries extensively pre-absorbed on a series of normal cell types, we will
      isolate phage specifically internalized by B-CLL cells from newly diagnosed and untreated CLL
      patients. Peptide sequences are then derived by Next Generation Sequencing (NGS). NGS-based
      studies are contributing to an improved understanding of cancer heterogeneity in order to
      tailor treatment to patients based on the individual makeup of their tumor. However the use
      of NGS to derive phage displayed peptide sequences is so far rare (22). Traditionally, after
      exposure to a target and recovery by elution, the phage clones are isolated by titration on
      bacterial lawns. It is technically demanding and labour intensive to select and analyze more
      than about 15 of the sometimes thousands clones recovered. Therefore information on other
      potentially important sequences is missed. NGS allows sequencing of the entire recovered
      phage pool and provides far more detailed bioinformatic analyses of peptide sequences or
      motifs. RNA from the CLL cells is used for RNA-seq expression sequencing. The wide
      application of NGS in combination with bioinformatics tools has begun to revolutionize cancer
      research, diagnosis and therapy. The peptide and RNA sequencing data will afford
      bioinformatic testing of correlations of exome expression and clinical parameters with the
      pattern of peptide sequences internalized by CLL cells of different patients. This
      information is crucial to answering questions 1, 2 and 3 discussed on page 1 above. The
      results of this analysis will probably not allow identification of specific receptors
      targeted by the peptides. The aim at this stage of the research is to identify candidate
      targeting peptides. Once identified, further research will be needed to identify the
      receptors to which they bind. Regarding question 4, there is currently very little published
      information on the therapeutic potential of PDCs in leukemia. Using two peptides we have
      isolated that target murine A20 leukemic cells, we will prepare multi-drug PDCs (using
      technology we have developed) and in an animal model, test their ability to enhance the
      survival and quality of life of CLL bearing animals.

      Methodology A: CLL specific peptides: (Specific aim 1) Whole blood samples are received from
      healthy volunteers and newly diagnosed and untreated CLL patients according to our Helsinki
      permit no. 0432-13-RMC. (Rabin Medical Center) Acquisition of samples at follow up and from
      an additional 80 patients will be covered by additional Helsinki submissions now underway.
      Lymphocytes are separated using Ficoll and the B cells isolated using a B-cell isolation kit.
      The B-cells from the healthy volunteers and an aliquot of those isolated cells from each
      patient are frozen for later use (see D: below). The remaining patient cells are divided into
      two fractions. One is used for RNA extraction. The other is exposed to an &quot;Absorbed&quot; phage
      library pre-absorbed on normal cells. After incubation, cells are washed and phage bound to
      the cell membrane are eluted and recovered. Cells are then lysed and the lysate retained.
      Phage in the eluate and lysate (membrane-bound and internalized respectively) are amplified
      separately in E.coli. The amplified phage are isolated and DNA prepared for NGS. Sequencing
      is carried out in an external core facility (The Technion Genome Center).

      . B: Bioinformatic analyses of peptide sequences (Specific aim 1) I) Sequencing of peptides:
      Sequence reads are obtained from phage DNA libraries generated and analyzed with
      high-throughput sequencing (Illumina HiSeq system). Quality control checks are performed
      using FastQC tool. The reads are processed to trim adaptors and remove the consensus
      sequences from either side using the Cutadapt software (23). The remaining fragment tags
      contain the peptides' DNA sequence and are expected to be 21 nucleotides in length. Next, the
      BioString package from the Bioconductor framework are used to translate these nucleotide
      sequences, and the number of occurrences of each peptide sequence is calculated to find the
      most frequent peptides. Following normalization to library size, peptide sequence counts from
      different patient libraries are compared to find common sequences. Sequences from the
      membrane-bound pool fraction are subtracted from the internalized pool fraction so as to
      remove membrane-bound clones that may not have been successfully eluted off the CLL cell. The
      sequences remaining in the internalized pool serve as candidates for peptide-conjugate
      therapy. A univariate logistic regression approach will then be used to test possible
      associations of peptide counts with clinical and genetic findings. When clinical parameters
      are treated as continuous variables, linear regression will be implemented. Candidate
      peptides will be queried against the PepBank database (24) in order to check if they are
      known to be related to cancer or other diseases and conditions such as apoptosis or
      angiogenesis. Finally, a bioinformatic pipeline script will be developed automating the above
      bioinformatics analysis steps.

      II) RNA-seq to detect gene expression patterns and fusion genes:

      The main aim of the RNA-seq analysis is to detect specific gene expression patterns which can
      be correlated with peptide sequences and clinical parameters. These expression patterns will
      give clues to cell surface receptor expression and intracellular pathway activity. Patients
      will be divided based on the peptide sequences internalized by B-CLL cells, and a statistical
      test will be performed in order to detect differentially expressed genes. Pathway analysis
      will be performed in order to infer functional changes which may shade a light on the
      possible role of the peptide receptors in the cell signaling cascade. Trim galore software
      will be used for adapter trimming, and for removing low quality bases from the ends of reads.
      Trimmed reads will be mapped to the human genome (hg38) using TopHat2 software. The number of
      reads overlaping each of the annotated genes will be counted using the HT-seq python package.
      DESeq within the Bioconductor framework will be used for normalization and differential
      expression analysis using variants of Fisher's exact test. The Generally Applicable Gene-set
      Enrichment (GAGE) method will be applied to detect up and down-regulated pathways. RNA-seq is
      also used to detect fusion gene events in the patient's cancer cells and can be used as an
      independent validation method to test the sensitivity of the peptide-dye conjugate used as
      for disease monitoring. For this aim, three different tools TopHat-fusion, defuse and
      ChimeraScan will be used to identify fusion transcripts. Several filtration steps will be
      applied in order to remove low-quality candidates as described before, and only those
      candidates detected by all the three tools will be chosen for RT-PCR validation.

      C: Syntheses of Peptides and conjugates (Specific aims 1,2,3) Peptides will be synthesized
      using solid-phase chemistry. In the first stage of the project, the two peptides specific for
      A20 mouse leukemic cells already identified will be synthesized, namely HIS SER THR PRO SER
      SER PRO (Peptide 1) and ASP SER SER LEU PHE ALA LEU (Peptide 2). In later stages (see below),
      selected human CLL specific peptides will be synthesized as their sequences become available.
      Only peptides will multiple repeat reads (&gt;5) (see B above) will be selected (maximum of 3
      per patient) as these represent phage clones with greater propensity to induce uptake into
      cells. Peptides will be synthesized both as fluorescent dye- and drug-conjugates based on our
      previous work with targeted multi-drug conjugates (21). We will employ drugs with differing
      mechanisms of action, such as the nitrogen mustard Chlorambucil used to treat elderly CLL
      patients, and the microtubule inhibitor Combretastatin 4A, known to induce apoptosis in CLL
      cells (25). Purity and composition of the products will be verified by HPLC and LC/MS.
      Syntheses will be carried out by an external supplier.

      D: In vitro validation of peptide specificity and PDC activity: (Specific aims 1, 2, 3)
      Specificity of peptides: The specificity of targeting peptides will be demonstrated by
      incubating peptide-dye conjugates with target and controls cells. For the mouse CLL system,
      A20 cells will be used as target cells and normal mouse splenic lymphocytes and primary
      cultures of mouse skin and epithelial cells will be used as controls cells. For the human CLL
      system, patient CLL cells and normal human lymphocytes and HUVEC cells will be used as target
      and controls cells respectively. Cells will be incubated with FITC-labeled peptides at both
      4oC and 37oC, washed and analyzed for binding and internalization respectively. Binding will
      be evaluated by flow cytometry and internalization by confocal microscopy.

      Cytotoxicity of PDCs: Target and control cells will be incubated for 24 and 48 hrs with
      increasing concentrations (0-50uM drug equivalents) of free drug or PDCs. Percent Growth
      Inhibition will be assessed by the XTT assay. Cytotoxic A20 specific PDCs will then be
      evaluated in vivo (see E: below).

      Cell culture systems: The A20 cell line is grown and maintained in FBS supplemented RPMI
      culture medium. Normal primary cultures are maintained with selective media. On the other
      hand, the survival of human CLL cells in culture is dependent on several unique
      microenvironmental factors, including antigen stimulation of the B-cell BCR, T cell help
      through the CD40-CD40L interaction, stimulation from the bone marrow stromal cell-derived
      CXCL12 chemokine and stimulation of Toll-Like Receptor 9. These conditions will be mimicked
      in vitro (26) by addition to the culture medium of anti-IgM (to crosslink the BCRs),
      co-culture with fibroblasts expressing CD40L, addition of recombinant CXCL12 and CpG
      dinucleotides respectively. These conditions will be used to test the specificity and
      efficacy of human PDCs against cryopreserved samples of patient CLL cells and normal human
      lymphocytes (controls).

      E: Animal studies using A20 mouse model of CLL (Specific aim 3) While several antibody-drug
      conjugates for the treatment of CLL have been used or are being tested (16), there is little
      published information as to the efficacy of PDCs for this disease. Therefore we aim to study
      the behavior of our A20 specific PDCs in an animal model of CLL, according to protocols
      approved by the Ariel University Institutional Animal Ethics Committee, permit no.
      IL-47-08-13. To validate the calibration of CLL development, A20 cells will be injected
      intravenously into Balb/c mice and the development of CLL symptoms monitored. Usually this
      takes between 40-50 days.

      Study A): At this point, we know little about the most effective treatment schedule with
      PDCs. For this reason, and based on published literature, we will first test the systemic
      tolerance of the animals to the drugs in the PDCs by injecting groups of non-tumor bearing
      mice intraperitoneally with 1, 7.5 or 15 mg/Kg of one Chlorambucil and Combretastatin 4A
      containing PDC every third days for 3 weeks. Animals will be monitored for systemic morbidity
      and survival. On the basis of these results, an initial treatment schedule will be selected
      to compare two concentrations for each of the two PDCs. Animals showing initial signs of CLL
      will be treated and followed for survival and development of CLL symptoms for at least and
      additional 70 days.

      Study B: Using the Study A results, the most effective PDC will be studied further. The PK of
      the drug conjugate will be analyzed by administering it in 5 drug concentrations, including
      that used for Study A. Blood samples will be drawn from the tail vein at 0.25, 0.5, 1, 2, 5,
      10 and 24 hrs. PDC will be extracted and analyzed by LC/MS for content and integrity. Drug
      concentrations will be analyzed by HPLC and used to calculate standard PK parameters [Cmax;
      TCmax; T1/2]. Based on these experiments, an additional treatment protocol will be devised
      aimed at maintaining a maximum blood PDC concentration over the treatment period. The
      protocol will be tested on an additional group of animals. After the treatment period,
      animals will be followed for survival and development of CLL symptoms for at least and
      additional 70 days.

      F: Detection of CLL cells in animal and patient whole blood. (Specific aims 1 and 2) The aim
      of these experiments is to assess the potential of CLL-specific peptide-dye conjugates to
      detect CLL cells in blood samples. Calibration experiments will be carried out on three
      levels.

        1. Cell doping: Cryopreserved samples of patient CLL cells will be added to either RPMI
           culture medium or normal human blood (in three concentrations). B-cells isolated as
           described in A above will be incubated with the appropriate Peptide-dye conjugate for
           30mins at 37OC. Cells will be washed and analyzed for peptide binding by flow cytometry.
           Similarly, A20 cells will be added to normal mouse blood and tested with A20 specific
           peptide-dye conjugates.

        2. Animal model: Using the animal model described above, blood samples will be taken
           once/week during the tumor induction phase. After RBC lysis, the remaining cells will be
           incubated with peptide-dye conjugates, washed and analysed by flow cytometry.
           Furthermore, samples will be taken once/fortnight from animals surviving Study B and
           analysed for Minimal residual Disease and relapse.

        3. Patient follow up: Aliquots of blood samples taken during routine follow up of the CLL
           patients will be used. Cells will be incubated with the appropriate Peptide-dye
           conjugate for 30mins at 37OC. Cells will be washed and analyzed for peptide binding by
           flow cytometry.

      G: Statistics Cytotoxicity of PDCs and free drug will be assessed by calculating % Growth
      Inhibition of treated versus untreated cells. Experiments will be performed in triplicate and
      repeated thrice. In animal studies, survival will be assessed using Kaplan-Meier curves.
      Additional statistics related to the bioinformatic analyses are described in detail above in
      section 1.7-B.
