        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Having been administered PRI-724 in Study 1101 after being confirmed to meet the
             inclusion criteria and not to meet the exclusion criteria and consenting to
             participate in the study.

          2. Having provided voluntary written consent for participation in this study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients who are pregnant or may be pregnant, or who desire to become pregnant or may
             be pregnant during the clinical study [excluding patients who have undergone a
             sterilization procedure or postmenopausal patients (if amenorrhea without medical
             reasons continues more than 12 months), patients who are nursing.

          2. Patients who do not consent to practice birth control during the clinical study
             (including male patients).

          4. Patients with a history of drug or alcohol addiction within five years at the time of

             year.

          5. Patients contraindicated for liver biopsy. However, this criterion will not apply to a
             patient who has turned out to be contraindicated for liver biopsy after having been
             administered PRI-724 in Study 1101.

          6. Patients who participated in another clinical trial, except PRI-724-1101 trial, within
             30 days at the time of providing written consent.

          7. Patients who have discontinued administration of PRI-724 in Study 1101 due to death or
             other reasons and become lost for follow-up.

          8. Other, at the point when Study 1101 has been completed (or discontinued), patients who
             are judged inappropriate for inclusion in the study by the investigator for such
             reasons as the presence of serious pathological condition.
