      Patients will receive AZD9291 at a dose of 80 mg once daily. Systemic evaluation will be done
      by PET-CT scan after 6 weeks.

      In responding patients AZD9291 will be given orally 80 mg daily for 12 weeks. Non-responding
      patients will receive AZD9291 for the period of 6 or 12 weeks (according to the results of
      response assessment at each time-point).

             • T790M is allowed.

          2. Treatment with any of the following:

          8. Any of the following cardiac criteria:

               -  Mean resting corrected QT interval (QTc) &gt;470 msec, obtained from 3 consequent
                  ECGs, using the screening clinic ECG machine-derived QTc value;

               -  Any clinically important abnormalities in rhythm, conduction, or morphology of
                  resting ECG;

               -  Any factors that increase the risk of QTc prolongation or risk of arrhythmic
                  events, including unexplained sudden death under 40 years of age in a
                  first-degree relative, or any concomitant medication known to prolong the QTc
                  interval.

          9. Any evidence/past medical history of interstitial lung disease (ILD) or radiation
