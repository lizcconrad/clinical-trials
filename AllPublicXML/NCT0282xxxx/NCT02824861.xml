    <textblock>
      This study evaluates a technology based intervention (physical activity tracker, text
      messages, health coach, global positioning system enabled location based feedback on physical
      activity) to support physical activity in cancer survivors after completing oncology
      rehabilitation. In Phase 1 all participants received the full intervention. In phase II
      participants are randomly assigned to receive the full intervention or a fitbit only.

    <textblock>
      This intervention, offered to participants after completing oncology rehabilitation,
      integrates known preferences and determinants of physical activity participation in women and
      breast cancers survivors including social support, professional guidance, self-efficacy, goal
      setting, self-regulation, and environmental awareness delivered through accessible
      technology. For the iteration phase, the investigators will conduct an initial, abbreviated
      intervention wave lasting 4 weeks; the investigators will then incorporate participant input
      and feedback on the specific components to refine the intervention prior to a pilot trial.
      Means of delivering the components include communication and support through tailored text
      messaging, health coaching phone calls, self-monitoring of physical activity through a
      wearable sensor, and environmental assessment of community physical activity options (e.g.,
      parks, fitness centers, trails) based on global positioning system information.
