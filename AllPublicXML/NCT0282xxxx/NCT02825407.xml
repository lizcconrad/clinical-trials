  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There are few data on elderly people concerning mechanisms involved in the in vivo release
      and perception of aromatic compounds. Any knowledge on this point would be of great interest
      to the scientific community. Concerning the dimensions of sensory perception and in-mouth
      comfort, there is, to our knowledge, no methodology to describe them. These dimensions are
      truly original and innovative, and investigating them will lead to the development of foods
      adapted to elderly populations with chewing and salivation disorders.

      The expected results are:

        -  to obtain two groups of subjects with differences in chewing abilities and saliva
           production

        -  the characterization of flavour release profiles in elderly subjects with regard to oral
           physiology (mastication and salivation) and saliva composition

        -  a sensory profile describing in-mouth comfort when food is eaten
