      Long-term outcome in late-onset Pompe disease treated beyond 36 months (ATBIG-Pompe-Study), a
      multicenter, multinational, longitudinal, non-interventional observational study in subjects,
      at least 8 years old, diagnosed with late-onset Pompe disease retrospectively and
      prospectively collects data to understand clinical progression in terms of muscle and
      respiratory function, and clinical symptomology treated with alglucosidase alfa more than 36
      months in 100 subjects.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The presentation and course of late-onset Pompe disease is much less foreseeable than the
      classic infantile form. Some patients experience a rapid worsening in skeletal muscle
      function leading to loss of ambulation and respiratory failure, while others progress less
      rapidly. So there is a more inconstant response to treatment in skeletal muscle and lung
      function in the long-term. Therefore, an unmet clinical need is the collection and analysis
      of long-term data of rhGAA enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) in late-onset Pompe disease
      patient aged 8 years and older. The principal goal of our investigator driven study is to
      gain conclusive insight in long-term outcome data beyond 36 months up to 10 years of ERT
      treatment. In addition we will collect biological samples from all patients for a future
      biomarker study including gene modifier search by genome and RNA seq (not part of this
      proposal). This study may provide clinicians and researchers with a better understanding of
      late-onset Pompe disease under long-term treatment, to the benefit of all patients affected
      with late-onset Pompe disease, as well as, individuals and families with related diseases.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Late-onset Pompe patients, aged over 8 years.

          -  The patient is willing and able to provide signed informed consent.

          -  The patient (and patient's legal guardian if patient is under 18 years of age) must
             have the ability to comply with the clinical protocol.

          -  Long-term Myozyme treatment beyond 36 months.

          -  Known GAA genotype.

          -  GAA activity (Dried blood spot testing, or other methods).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  - The patient is concurrently participating in another clinical study using Myozyme or
             other treatment.

          -  The patient, in the opinion of the Investigator, is unable to adhere to the
             requirements of the study.

          -  The patient has clinically significant organic disease (with the exception of symptoms
             relating to Pompe disease), including clinically significant cardiovascular, hepatic,
             pulmonary, neurologic, or renal disease, or other medical condition, serious

             Investigator, precludes participation in the study or potentially decreases survival.
