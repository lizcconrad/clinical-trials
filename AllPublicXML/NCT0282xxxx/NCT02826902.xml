  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The effect of total intravenous anesthesia (TIVA) versus inhalational anesthesia on the
      quality of recovery from surgery has been reported in several different types of operations.
      The Quality of Recovery 40 (QoR-40) questionnaire is designed multi-dimensionally to assess
      the degree of recovery after anesthesia and surgery, and has been validated in previous
      studies. Limb lengthening surgery is unique in that it is usually purely cosmetic, and the
      patients are mostly young and healthy patients. The present study aims to compare the quality
      of recovery with the QoR-40 questionnaire, in patients undergoing bilateral limb lengthening
      surgery under general anesthesia with either TIVA with propofol or inhalational anesthesia
      with desflurane.
