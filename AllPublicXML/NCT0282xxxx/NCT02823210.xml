  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN) are clonal hematopoietic disorders sharing a common
      natural evolution: a chronic phase, characterized by a major risk of vascular events,
      followed by an accelerated phase eventually leading to transformation to acute leukemia. MPN
      include polycythemia vera, essential thrombocythemia, primary myelofibrosis, and rarer
      entities. During the past years, CML became a paradigm for targeted therapy and personalized
      cancer medicine. For other MPNs, the discovery of the JAK2V617F mutation followed by many
      other mutations, opened similar perspectives. However, several questions remain to be
      answered in MPNs regarding the clinical implication of these major scientific discoveries:
      what is the clinical impact of JAK2V617F and other molecular biomarkers on the risks of
      complications and progression? Can these new biomarkers be used in the perspective of a
      personalized therapy of MPNs? his project will focus on the qualification of a series of
      known mutations as biomarkers in MPNs based on large multicenter cohorts of patients with
      well-annotated samples
