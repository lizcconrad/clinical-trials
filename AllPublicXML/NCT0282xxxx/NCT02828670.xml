  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      T follicular helper (TFH) cells represent a T cell subset dedicated to the activation of B
      cells. They have been involved in the pathogenesis of autoimmune diseases in humans such as
      lupus and Sjögren disease. We recently showed that TFH are implicated in the activation of
      autoreactive B lymphocytes during ITP. Autoimmune hemolytic anemia (AIHA) is an autoimmune
      disease due to antibodies targeting red blood cells. To date, the role of TFH in the
      pathogenesis of AIHA is not known.

      We hypothesize that AIHA is associated with an increase in the number and/or function of TFH,
      that could participate in the activation of autoreactive B lymphocytes.
