  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to better understand the health, including lung health, of
      Veterans who deployed in support of Operation Enduring Freedom (OEF), Operation Iraqi Freedom
      (OIF), or Operation New Dawn (OND) and other deployments following these Operations.

  <detailed_description>

      The aim of the study is to characterize the impact of deployment-related pollution exposures
      during the Post-9/11 Gulf War Era on current respiratory health using objectively ascertained
      and standardized physiologic and epidemiologic measures. The primary objective in support of
      this aim is to assess the association of cumulative exposure to PM2.5 during deployments to
      the U.S. bases and other locations in Central Asia (Afghanistan and Kyrgyzstan), Southwest
      Asia (Iraq, Kuwait, Qatar, and United Arab Emirates) and Africa (Djibouti) with current
      measures of pulmonary function. Secondary objectives in support of the aim will examine the
      association of cumulative exposure to PM2.5 during deployments with the clinical outcome of
      medically-treated asthma. The investigators will also explore the impact of deployment
      duration on both pulmonary function and asthma.

      This study will execute 4 distinct efforts to meet the study objectives: (1) enroll a study
      cohort of up to 6,200 Veterans who live within the catchment area of 6 VA recruitment sites,
      conduct an in-person assessment of pulmonary function, and collect data on key covariates;
      (2) create a spatial-temporal exposure grid of environmental PM2.5 levels averaged per week
      per 1 square kilometer at locations where military personnel served; (3) link each
      individual's location and duration (spatial-temporal) history during deployed and
      non-deployed times with averaged PM exposures during each of these time periods; and (4)
      conduct association analyses to test hypotheses of deployment-related cumulative PM2.5
      exposure and current respiratory health by combining exposure data with data collected from
      the cohort members and from their military records.

        The sampling frame for the study is military personnel identified from Department of
        Defense (DoD) Defense Manpower Data Center (DMDC) records who meet the inclusion and
        exclusion criteria. From among those Veterans who meet study eligibility, the investigators
        will identify a sample of Veterans living in the catchment area of the participating VA
        medical centers for recruitment. The study is not open to volunteers; Veterans must be
        selected from the sampling frame to participate.
