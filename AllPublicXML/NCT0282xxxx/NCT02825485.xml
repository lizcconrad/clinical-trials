  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It has previously been found that there is no correlation between degree of hydronephrosis
      and presence of reflux; however this is oftentimes the criteria physicians use to obtain a
      VCUG.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Investigators conducted a previous retrospective study to evaluate other possible findings on
      ultrasound that may better predict reflux. Investigators found that if a postnatal ultrasound
      showed any of the three findings of hydroureter, duplication or dysmorphic kidney, then the
      odds ratio of detecting reflux was 8.07 (95%CI 3.86, 16.87). The purpose of this study is to
      perform a randomized prospective study to validate this retrospective study. Investigators
      hypothesis is that patients with hydronephrosis alone will be more likely to have negative
      VCUG studies; hence obtaining a VCUG for this indication may not be warranted.
