    <textblock>
      The primary objective of the study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of single oral
      doses of BIIB068 in healthy participants. Secondary objectives are to characterize the
      single-oral-dose Pharmacokinetic (PK) of BIIB068 in healthy participants, to determine the
      effect of food on the single-oral-dose PK of BIIB068 in healthy participants and to examine
      the effect of administration of the proton pump inhibitor (PPI) esomeprazole on the
      single-dose PK of BIIB068 in healthy participants.

          -  All male subjects must practice highly effective methods of contraception during the
             study and be willing and able to continue contraception and not donate sperm for at
             least 1 spermatogenic cycle (90 days) after administration of last dose of study
             treatment.

          -  All female subjects of childbearing potential must practice highly effective methods
             of contraception during the study and be willing and able to continue contraception
             for at least 1ovulatory cycle (30 days) after their last dose of study treatment.

          -  Must have a body mass index (BMI) between 18 and 32 kg/m2

          -  Must be in good health as determined by the Investigator, based on medical history and
             screening evaluations.

        Key Exclusion Criteria:

          -  History of any clinically significant cardiac, endocrine, gastrointestinal (GI),
             hematologic, hepatic, immunologic, metabolic, urologic, pulmonary, neurologic,
             dermatologic, psychiatric, or renal disease, or other major disease, as determined by
             the Investigator.

          -  History of severe allergic or anaphylactic reactions, or history of any allergic
             reactions that in the opinion of the Investigator is likely to be exacerbated by any
             component of the study treatment.

          -  Clinically significant abnormal laboratory test values, as determined by the
             Investigator, at Screening or Day-1.
