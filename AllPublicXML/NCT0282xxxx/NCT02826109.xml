  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Periodontal disease is a gum infection caused by plaque on teeth containing both bacteria and
      calculus (hard) deposits. These need to be removed on a regular basis to maintain gum health
      and to prevent teeth weakening. A routine cleaning procedure, scaling/root planing, is
      accompanied with post-operative soft tissue tenderness and teeth sensitivity making oral
      hygiene maintenance difficult during wound healing. The need for novel therapeutic
      approaches, such as cyanoacrylate adhesives, has been identified. It has been hypothesized
      that its application may provide comfort and assist patients with their daily oral self-care
      procedures following teeth cleaning.

      Hypothesis: The supra-gingival marginal application of cyanoacrylate adhesive will promote
      periodontal wound healing and prevent the increase of sensitivity of hard (teeth) and soft
      (gingiva) tissues following non-surgical periodontal therapy (NSPT).

      This pilot study involves a small number of participants, and while it is not designed to
      prove causation, it will evaluate safety and efficacy. If clinical results are positive,
      these data may be used to determine sample and power needs for larger studies.

      With enhanced post-operative comfort, the patient's ability to disrupt biofilm and maintain
      optimal daily oral self-care can be achieved. Biofilm disruption is paramount to achieving
      periodontal health. Specifically, the adjunctive placement of an adhesive dressing may reduce
      biofilm accumulation that is associated with periodontal inflammation. This novel application
      could improve the patient's oral and thus overall health.

      The present pilot trial aims to explore the therapeutic effectiveness of a cyanoacrylate
      adhesive (PeriAcryl速90 HV) in reducing patient-reported outcomes related to discomfort and
      sensitivity post NSPT, examine their potential positive effects on periodontal wound healing
      as well as recording any potential side-effects that may have been experienced by the
      patients.
