      Introduction

      Preeclampsia (PE) and intra-uterine growth restriction (IUGR) are two major pregnancy
      complications related to chronic utero-placental hypoperfusion. Three-dimensional power
      Doppler (3DPD) angiography has been used for the evaluation of utero-placental
      vascularisation and three vascular indices have been calculated: the vascularisation index
      (VI), flow index (FI) and vascularisation-FI (VFI). However, several technical endpoints
      hinder the clinical use of 3DPD as physical characteristics and machine settings may affect
      3DPD indices, and so its clinical significance is not yet clear.

      Objectives

      The primary objective is to better understand the clinical significance of 3DPD indices by
      evaluating the relationship between these indices and placental morphometry. Secondary
      objectives are (i) to determine the impact of machine settings and physical characteristics
      on 3DPD indices, and (ii) to evaluate physio-pathological placental vascularisation patterns.

      Methods and analysis

      This is a prospective controlled study. We expect to include 112 women: 84 with normal
      pregnancies and 28 with PE and/or IUGR (based on our former cohort study on 3DPD indices for
      PE and/or IUGR prediction (unpublished data)). Within 72 h before planned or semi-urgent
      caesarean section, utero-placental 3DPD images with five different machine settings will be
      acquired. Placentas will be collected and examined after surgery and stereological indices
      (volume density, surface density, length density) calculated. The 3DPD indices (VI, FI and
      VFI) of the placenta and adjacent myometrium will be calculated. Correlation between Doppler
      and morphological indices will be evaluated by Pearson or Spearman tests. Agreement between
      3DPD indices and morphological indices will be assessed by Bland and Altman plots. The impact
      of Doppler settings and maternal characteristics on 3DPD indices will be evaluated with a
      multivariate linear regression model.
