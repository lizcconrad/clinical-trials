  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Some robotic endoscopic surgeries require a steep Trendelenburg position and a carbon dioxide
      pneumoperitoneum. This minimally invasive approach has the advantages of less postoperative
      pain, shorter hospital stay and faster recovery. After prolonged operative time in a
      Trendelenburg position rare but significant complications are a cerebral oedema or a well leg
      compartment syndrome.

      Well leg compartment syndrome results from inadequate perfusion in the lower limbs and the
      perfusion pressure is decreased proportionally to the lower extremity elevation. The
      condition can lead to release of intracellular proteins and myoglobinuria, hyperpotassaemia
      and metabolic acidosis followed by cell necrosis. The risk for tissue damage increases after
      4 hours in a Trendelenburg position.

      If not promptly diagnosed and treated, a compartment syndrome has devastating complications
      like permanent dysfunction, limb loss, renal failure or even death.

      There are no specific guidelines for diagnosis and for the timing of surgical decompression.
      Fasciotomy is a clinical decision. There is no universal agreement at which compartment
      pressure irreversible muscle damage occurs.

      The only objective diagnostic tool available is currently to measure the intramuscular
      pressure, however this is invasive, painful and may yield unreliable results. An
      intracompartment pressure of 0- 10mm Hg is the normal range.

      Near Infrared Spectroscopy (NIRS) monitors are validated and approved to measure cerebral and
      somatic tissue oxygenation below the sensors and may help detecting promptly a compartment
      syndrome.

      Therefore, the investigators designed the present study to detect a change in the tissue
      oxygenation in the lower legs during robotic assisted, laparoscopic surgery in the
      Trendelenburg position.
