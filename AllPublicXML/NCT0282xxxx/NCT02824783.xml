      The aim of the study is to investigate the quality of life and satisfaction of patient who
      underwent colorectal surgery using an enhanced recovery protocol when back home.

      In this retrospective study patients will be telephoned and asked to answer a questionnaire.

      Since October 1st 2015, our center has been labelled reference center for colorectal surgery
      using Enhanced Recovery Protocol (ERP) by GRACE (Groupe francophone de Rehabilitation après
      ChirurgiE; a francophone counterpart of ERAS® society). In case of ERP, the quality of life
      when the patient is at home is not well known. Some argue that patient might experience
      discomfort and lack of autonomy, particularly elderly patient if discharged home too quickly.

      In this study, the investigators will call our patients introduced in the database of GRACE
      to assess the quality of life and patient satisfaction concerning our ERP. Eight domains will
      be investigated: information, stress, feelings when discharged home, pain, fatigue, autonomy,
      feeding problems, and satisfaction.

      When analyzing the results the investigators will pay a particular attention to elderly
      patients (age &gt; 70 yo) to determine whether these experience more difficulties as compared to
      younger patients.
