  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Randomized clinical trial to assess the efficacy of a treatment protocol applied fascial
      therapy in patients with hemophilic arthropathy ankle, oriented to know and describe the
      observed differences on the dependent variables: range of motion, pain and physical
      condition.

      At the same time, the study will determine whether there are adverse effects or bleeding
      complications as a result of applied physiotherapy treatment.

    <description>Patients included in this group will receive treatment over a period of three weeks, receiving 3 physiotherapy sessions lasting approximately 30 minutes each.
The treatment program includes 8 maneuvers that must be administered bilaterally: maneuver longitudinal sliding on the fascial surface plant, maneuver induction of the plantar fascia, maneuver longitudinal surface sliding on the anterolateral compartment of the leg, induction maneuver ankle anterior compartment, maneuver pressure and sliding on the posterior region of the leg, technical release of the popliteal fascia, maneuver induction sural triceps, and lower extremity telescopic technique.</description>

    <description>Patients included in this group will not receive any physiotherapy treatment. However, will be evaluated under the same conditions that patients in the experimental group (pretreatment evaluation, post-treatment and follow-up).</description>
