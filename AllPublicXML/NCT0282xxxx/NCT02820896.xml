  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase I, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind study to evaluate the safety,
      tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and preliminary activity of RO7105705 in two participant
      populations: healthy participants and participants with mild-to-moderate Alzheimer's disease.
      This study is a single dose, dose-escalation, and multiple dose study comprising
      approximately six single dose cohorts in healthy participants administered RO7105705, either
      intravenously (IV) or subcutaneously (SC), and comprising one or more multiple dose cohorts
      in healthy participants administered RO7105705 IV every week (QW), a total of 4 doses, and
      one or more multiple dose cohorts in participants with Alzheimer's disease administered
      RO7105705 IV QW, a total of 4 doses.
