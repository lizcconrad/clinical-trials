    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the safety, tolerance, food effect,
      pharmacokinetics (PK) and pharmacodynamics (PD) of single and multiple doses of extended
      release (XR) formulations of Centanafadine (CTN) in Young Healthy participants.

    <textblock>
      The study will be divided into three parts: A, B, C.

      Part A: Single Dose, extended release (XR) Formulation Selection. This part of the study is a
      single dose, open label, four-period crossover design in a group of 16 healthy participants.

      Part B: Multiple Ascending Dose. Part B has been designed to assess the effect of multiple
      doses of one formulation of XR CTN. This part of the study will be a double-blind,
      randomized, placebo-controlled design.

      Part C: Food Effect. Part C has been designed to determine the effect food has on XR CTN. The
      XR formulation and dose administered will be selected after review of Part B data. This part
      will be an open-label, two-period crossover design in a group of 16 healthy participants.
