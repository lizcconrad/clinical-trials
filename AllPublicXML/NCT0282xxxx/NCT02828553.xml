  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There is an overwhelming amount of deconditioning that occurs during the hospitalization to a
      patient admitted with a primary diagnosis of congestive heart failure. The goals of this
      study are to determine if monitored activity and aggressive mobility provides improved
      outcomes in hospitalized heart failure patients.

      By implementing an ambulatory study, the goal is to decrease the hospital length of stay by
      half of a day, decrease the percentage of patients being discharged to an extended nursing
      care facility, and improve quality of life for the patient. Fiscal year 2014 the average
      length of stay for a CHF patient at Lancaster General Health was 6.0, and as of fiscal year
      2015 this was decreased to 5.8. According to Harlan M Krumbholz's theory of post hospital
      syndrome, patients are subjected to a time of increased risk of impaired stamina,
      coordination, strength and readmission for about thirty days after discharge due to
      deconditioning during their hospitalization. By implementing the ambulatory study, the hope
      is to prevent such extensive deconditioning to help improve the patient's quality of life
      after discharge; thereby reducing length of stay, discharges to skilled nursing facilities,
      30 day readmissions and costs.

      The advent of wearable activity and/or health monitors in the health and fitness industry
      segment has the potential to revolutionize the industry. More importantly, these devices
      allow new variables to be collected to provide an impact on patients' care and outcome such
      as steps taken per day.

      The intention of the ambulation study is to prevent hospital acquired deconditioning; which
      in turn would not only decrease the length of stay, but also improve the discharge
      disposition and place them at home rather than hospice, an extended care facility or rehab.
      Not only is the intent of the study to decrease the length of stay and also improve the
      patient's disposition, but also improve their quality of life. In addition, the study will
      test the effectiveness of the addition of a mobility aide to assist with patients walking on
      the nursing units.

    <description>Walk distance using a 2-minute walk test will be assessed at admission and again at discharge. A clear starting and stopping point will be made with distance marked every 10 feet. A chair with armrests will be at the starting and stopping point of the walk distance. The designated area will be between 5 East and 5 West which will be standard for each patient. After the assessment the nurse will document the total patient's distance to the nearest 10 feet. Example &quot;Ms. Smith walked 100 feet with 3 stops in 2 minutes.&quot; The patient will have a repeat 2 minute walk test on the day of discharge using the same criteria. For the walk test:
Gait belt must be used
Patient will be allowed to stop, lean on the wall and rest, but if requires sitting, terminates the 2 minute walk distance.
