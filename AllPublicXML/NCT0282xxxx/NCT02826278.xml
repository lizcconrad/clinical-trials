    <textblock>
      Normal values for female external genitalia size at birth, particularly clitoris and blood
      level of androgens are not well known. This study's aim is to collect normal values in 180
      newborn girls of 24 to 41 weeks of pregnancy, and to build genitalia growth charts according
      to gestational age and birth weight.

      The investigators will measure clitoris, genito-anal ratio using a small plastic caliper, at
      birth, and their evolution until Day 3 of life (if the child is still at the hospital).

      The investigators also want to establish normal values of blood testosterone,
      17-hydroxyprogesterone, delta4-androstenedione, 21-deoxycortisol, 11-deoxycortisol,
      deoxycorticosterone, corticosterone, dehydroepiandrostenedione, and dihydrotestosterone),
      using samples taken for systematic post natal screening of diseases (only in new born of 35
      or more weeks of birth).

      This is an observational prospective study.

    <description>The measurement is performed on the supine child, with flexed hips and knees retained by the nurse or the nursery nurse. The clitoris will be delimited using cavernosa palpation. The clitoris length will be measured from maxima lablias'root to the top of clitoris, excluding cutaneous cover. Measurements are performed using an-8 cm plastic caliper.</description>
