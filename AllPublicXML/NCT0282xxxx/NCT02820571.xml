  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The OPAL study is about health outcomes in older adults. The investigators are surveying
      4,000 adults across England to see how health and physical activity change over time. The
      information that is collected will help the investigators to understand how a person's
      health, including conditions such as back pain, affect their mobility as they age, and
      provide insight into improving the management of health in older adults.

      The Oxford Pain, Activity and Lifestyle (OPAL) study is a large cohort study of community
      dwelling adults (n=4000) aged 65 years and over. This cohort data will allow the
      investigators to describe the prevalence, severity, course and prognosis a range of
      musculoskeletal problems in older people. The initial focus is to evaluate the impact of back
      pain on important health outcomes for older people (quality of life, mobility, falls and
      fractures). In order to do this, the investigators will study people with and without back
      pain at the inception of the cohort. The OPAL cohort will be followed for 5 years in the
      first instance and the investigators will study a range of factors hypothesised to moderate
      and mediate the effects of back and other musculoskeletal pain for example, co-morbidities.

      The OPAL cohort will be sampled from older people registered with primary care practices.

      The investigators aim to develop a prognostic tool using the cohort data that will help older
      people, GPs and other health professionals identify when LBP is a risk factor for disability,
      functional limitation and loss of mobility, and when LBP should be prioritised as a treatment
      target.

    <description>Life-Space Assessment measures mobility in terms of the spatial extent of a person's life. The purpose of the Life-Space Assessment is to determine a person's usual pattern of mobility during the month preceding the assessment. Life-space is defined based upon the distance a person routinely travels to perform activities over this time frame. This includes determining how far and how often the person leaves his or her place of residence and the degree of independence the person has.</description>
