  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      GSK3128349 is a small protein molecule (biopharmaceutical) that binds to albumin in the body,
      and by itself, has no pharmacological action. A pharmacologically active drug can be attached
      to GSK3128349 with the goal of changing the distribution and/or duration of action of the
      attached drug. This study will determine the distribution and pharmacokinetics (duration) of
      GSK3128349 itself after a single intravenous infusion. GSK3128349 has been labeled with and
      the radioisotope 89Zirconium allowing it to be visualized in the organs of the body using a
      PET scanner at multiple time points after GSK3128349 dosing. The data from this study will
      help predict the distribution of future drugs attached to GSK3128349. The total duration of a
      subject's participation is about approximately 10 weeks, including the screening period.

             dosing day.
