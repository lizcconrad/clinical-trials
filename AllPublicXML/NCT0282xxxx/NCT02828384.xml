    <textblock>
      Background:

      Fecal incontinence (FI) is a common complaint, and is often associated with diarrhea and
      urgency. Foods that are high in fermentable oligo-, di-, and mono-saccharides and polyols
      (FODMAPs) cause symptoms of diarrhea and urgency. Thus, assessing the impact of a low FODMAP
      diet in FI patients is needed.

      Aims:

        1. Compare the treatment response with a low FODMAP vs. psyllium based on number of
           episodes in patients with FI.

        2. Compare the efficacy of a low FODMAP diet vs. psyllium in patients with FI on
           pre-specified clinical and quality of life endpoints.

      Methods:

      This is a prospective, randomized control trial of adults meeting the Rome III criteria for
      FI and at least 1 episode of FI due to loose stool per week. After a 2 week screening period
      and randomization, during which the severity of symptoms will be assessed and eligibility
      determined, patients will be randomized to psyllium vs. low FODMAP diet for 4 weeks. A total
      of 20 patients will be recruited for each arm.

      The primary endpoint will be treatment response based on number of incontinence episodes. A
      treatment response is defined as a reduction in the number of FI episodes/week.

    <description>For stool consistency, a responder with improvement will be defined as one who reports a decrease in mean daily BSFS value ( on a scale of 1-7 with 7 being watery stool) of 1 or more compared to baseline for ≥2 of 4 treatment weeks. The proportion of responders between the 2 groups will be compared.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>number of people responding with reduction in stool frequency</measure>
    <time_frame>4 weeks from baseline</time_frame>
    <description>The number of bowel movements will be recorded each day. Mean daily stool frequency will be averaged for each treatment group at baseline and weekly through week 4. These averages will be compared for the two groups.</description>

    <measure>Change in stool wet weight</measure>
    <time_frame>4 weeks from baseline</time_frame>
    <description>The difference in stool mean wet weight between baseline and during week 4 will be calculated. The change from baseline for each group will be compared.</description>

    <description>Responders are those participants with a reduction in FI episodes of &gt; 50%. The reduction will be measured by the change in mean number of episodes in week 3 and 4 (averaged) from baseline.</description>
