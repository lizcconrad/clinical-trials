      To compare the initial versus delayed verteporfin photodynamic therapy (PDT) in combination
      with conbercept in patients with symptomatic polypoidal choroidal vasculopathy (PCV).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Polypoidal choroidal vasculopathy (PCV) is characterized by polypoidal choroidal vascular
      dilatation with or without abnormally branching vascular networks(BVN) on indocyanine green
      angiography (ICGA). It has been considered to be a subtype of wet age-related macular
      degeneration(wAMD). PCV is more prevalent in Asian patients than in white patients; nearly
      half of Chinese patients who was diagnosed with wAMD actually was PCV.

      However, recently, the first choice treatment for wAMD has shifted to anti-vascular
      endothelial growth factor (VEGF) drugs, such as bevacizumab(Avastin,Genentech Inc),
      ranibizumab (Lucentis, Genentech Inc)and aflibercept (Eylea, Regeneron,Berlin,Germany) from
      PDT, and the vision improving effect has been confirmed regardless of race or disease
      subtype. Therefore, eyes with PCV can be treated initially with anti-VEGF drugs, however,
      they are limited in their ability to resolve polypoidal lesions, for which PDT works
      effectively.

      Combination therapy of PDT and anti-VEGF drugs provides the complementary effects of both
      treatments, but it remains unknown whether PDT should have been administered at the beginning
      of treatment or during follow-up of anti-VEGF therapy. The purpose of this study was to
      compare the 12-months treatment results of initial and delayed PDT combined with conbercept
      (Lumitin, Chengdu Kang Hong Biotech Co., Ltd., Sichuan, China) for PCV.
