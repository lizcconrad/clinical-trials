  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to investigate levels of a protein, mannose binding lectin, in
      patients with acute leukemia who develop or not an invasive fungal infection.

        Inclusion Criteria :

          -  persons who have provided written consent

          -  Patients with national health insurance cover

          -  Patients with malignant hemopathy who have been treated with chemotherapy able to
             induce profound neutropenia (PN &lt; 500 / mm3) lasting more than 10 days.

          -  Patients with malignant hemopathy who have received an autologous bone marrow graft

          -  Patients with severe idiopathic medullar aplasia (PN &lt; 500 / mm3) who need to be
             hospitalized for at least 10 consecutive days (with or without treatment with
             immunosuppressants)

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients who have received an bone marrow PSC allograft (as such patients have a risk
             of aspergillosis, which appears in most cases after medullar recovery; they will not
             be included in the study).

          -  Patients who have received an autologous PSC graf (as the duration of neutropenia is
             in most cases less than 10 days).

          -  Patients whose neutropenia, retrospectively assessed, lasted less than 10 days.
