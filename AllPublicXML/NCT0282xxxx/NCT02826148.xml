    <textblock>
      The diagnosis of developmental disorders in adults is still difficult. Indeed, in France,
      there is not questionnaires to easily and accurately diagnose this disorder. Several
      diagnostic scales were developed in English. Among them, RAADS-R scale, which is a clinical
      tool that aims to better identify autism spectrum disorders including mild forms in adult
      people and help to diagnose of high-functioning autism . The objective of this study is to
      perform a complete validation of this scale in the french version.

      The diagnosis of developmental disorders in adults is still difficult. Indeed, in France,
      there is not questionnaires to easily and accurately diagnose this disorder. Several
      diagnostic scales were developed in English. Among them, RAADS-R scale, which is a clinical
      tool that aims to better identify autism spectrum disorders including mild forms in adult
      people and help to diagnose of high-functioning autism . This scale is a self-administered
      questionnaire completed by the person himself assisted by a clinician (psychiatrist,
      psychologist) which ensures the understanding of issues and the choice of answers. The scale
      contains 80 items including 64 questions describe specific symptoms of autism spectrum
      disorders and 16 questions describe non-symptomatic behaviors. The objective of this study is
      to perform a complete validation of this scale in the french version. 300 adults should be
      included, including 100 adults with high-functioning autism, 100 adults with another
      psychiatric disorder, and 100 adults without developmental disabilities and / or mental.
