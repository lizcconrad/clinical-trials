      This study is a Phase I, Randomised, Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled, Dose-Escalation Study
      to Evaluate Safety, Tolerability and Pharmacokinetics After Single and Multiple Oral
      Administration of DA-8010 in Healthy Subjects.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will be a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose-escalation, single
      and multiple oral dose study conducted in 2 parts.

      In Part A, each subject will participate in 1 treatment period only and reside at the
      Clinical Research Unit (CRU) from Day -1 (the day before dosing) to Day 3 (48 hours
      postdose), except for Group A4, where each subject will participate in 2 treatment periods
      separated by a minimum of 13 days to evaluate the effect of food.

      In Part B, each subject will participate in 1 treatment period only and reside at the CRU
      from Day -1 (1 day before dosing) until the morning of Day 9 (48 hours after the final dose
      on Day 7).
