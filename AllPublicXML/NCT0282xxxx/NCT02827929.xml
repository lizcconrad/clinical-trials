  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to determine whether the systematic education on air way
      disease and inhalers in outpatient settings contributes to improve the quality of life.

      Education has been known to be effective for management of chronic airway disease. However,
      the real benefits remain unclear. An organized education on the chronic airway disease is
      directed by primary care physicians, and the investigators evaluate the effectiveness of the
      education.

      The present study is a prospective and interventional study comparing the outcomes of
      education program for one month.

      A one month education program is composed of three visits (every two weeks follow-up ) during
      which subjects were taught about their diseases, action plans in acute exacerbation, and
      inhaler technique.

      To evaluate the effectiveness of systematic education, questionnaires evaluating quality of
      life and satisfaction of education will be examined after each visit.

      Asthma control test (ACT) in asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) assessment
      test (CAT) in COPD subjects were compared before and after education as an index of quality
      of life.

      Educational effects were also measured, associated with improvement of their knowledge for
      chronic airway disease itself, proper use of inhaler technique, and satisfaction of subjects
      after education.
