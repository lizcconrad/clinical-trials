  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an exploratory study to assess potential maintenance of clinical benefit (cognition
      and symptoms) following 4 weeks of at-home digital therapy in ADHD children.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will be a blinded (investigators and outcome assessors), randomized (from parent
      study Akili-001R), parallel group, follow-up study of the sustained effects of 4-weeks of
      treatment with either EVO Multitasking game-based digital therapy or EVO Words game-based
      digital therapy.

      The trial will consist of 4 visits: Screening (to be conducted at the same time as the
      end-of-study visit for the parent study Akili-001R), FU-Day 28 visit (conducted in clinic),
      and FU-Day 56 and FU-Day 84 visits (conducted remotely via electronically captured parent
      reported outcomes).
