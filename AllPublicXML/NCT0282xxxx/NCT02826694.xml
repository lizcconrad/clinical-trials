  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The NC NEXUS research study is exploring the utility of next generation sequencing in newborn
      screening and parental decision making. The National Institutes of Health (NICHD and NHGRI)
      are co-funding this study under a single U-19.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators will enroll and perform whole exome sequencing on two cohorts of patients.
      One cohort will consist of two hundred newborns with no known conditions whose parents will
      be recruited during the mother's pregnancy. The second cohort will include two hundred
      infants and children up to the age of five years with diagnosed conditions including
      conditions detected through standard newborn screening such as phenylketonuria and other
      inborn errors of metabolism, hearing loss and other rare conditions that may fit criteria for
      newborn screening in the future.

      Parents will be introduced to the study by their clinician or a study recruiter. Those who
      agree to enroll in Phase I will review an online decision guide and be offered a study visit
      conducted by a genetic counselor to obtain informed consent for genomic sequencing of their
      child. Parents consenting to have their child's genome sequenced will be seen after the
      child's birth or at a convenient pre-arranged time and duplicate saliva samples will be
      collected from the children and one sample will be sent to the BioSpecimen Processing (BSP)
      Facility and to Dr. Jonathan Berg's laboratory for sequencing and the other sent to the
      Molecular Genetics Laboratory (MGL) for DNA extraction and storage until needed for clinical
      confirmation. Results will be returned for diagnostic (in the Diagnosed cohort) and medically
      actionable disorders of childhood (both cohorts). Two-thirds of parents who consent to
      sequencing will be randomly assigned to be eligible to request additional findings and use a
      supplement of the online decision aid. All results will be reported to parents by trained
      genetic professionals (genetic counselors and clinical geneticists)

    <description>Analysis of parents' decisions after they complete an on-line decision aid to see if they wish to participate in the study. Parent participants randomized to the decision group, after their child is sequenced, may decide what, if any, additional categories of conditions they wish to learn about. Options will be yes, no, or unsure.</description>

    <measure>Sensitivity of whole exome sequencing in detecting conditions by comparing results of sequencing to the appropriate genes associated with the child's underlying condition.</measure>
    <time_frame>approximately 3-6 months after DNA sample obtained.</time_frame>
    <description>Investigators will analyze sequencing results in the diagnosed cohort to determine the ability of whole exome sequencing to detect pathogenic variants in genes related to phenotype.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Participant characteristics and reactions to the study will be collected through surveys.</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 3 months after final return of results visit.</time_frame>
    <description>Surveys are administered at Time 1 (baseline), after parent participants decide to join phase I of the study, which involves agreeing to view the online decision aid about Next-Generation Sequencing Newborn Screening (NGS-NBS); at Time 2, after parent participants have viewed the decision aid and made a decision about accepting NGS-NBS for their child (yes/no/need more information; note that the timing is variable, depending on when participants complete this task, but may range from hours to weeks); at Time 2a (for parent participants randomly assigned to learn/make decisions about additional information), after parent participants have made the decision to accept none, some, or all categories of additional information (note that the timing is variable depending on when parent participants complete this task, but occurs after return of NGS-NBS results); Time 3, which occurs 2 weeks after return of NGS-NBS results; and Time 4, which occurs 3 months after Time 3.</description>
