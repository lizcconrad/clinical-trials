      The purpose of this study is to test the accuracy of the Pulsewave wrist blood pressure cuff
      in pregnant and postpartum women who have either normal blood pressure or high blood
      pressure.

      The study will include a series of nine blood pressure measurements. The measurements will
      alternate between a gold standard auscultatory blood pressure measurement and the Pulsewave
      monitor.

      A trained clinician will be used for gold standard measurements using an appropriately sized
      cuff around the upper arm, a sphygmomanometer, and a stethoscope. Systolic blood pressure is
      defined by the first Korotkoff sound; diastolic blood pressure is defined by the fifth
      Korotkoff sound.

      Measurements by the Pulsewave monitor will be performed using a proprietary oscillometric
      wrist cuff automated by a computer tablet and software made by CloudDx Inc.

      Women will be seated for 5 to 10 minutes before the first blood pressure measurement. During
      this time, 4 circumference measurements will be taken of the arm and wrist.

        1. The armpit will be measured as proximally as possible.

        2. The mid upper arm will be recorded by measuring at the halfway point between the
           acromion and the olecranon process.

        3. The distal upper arm measurement will be taken approximately 2 cm proximal to the
           antecubital crease.

        4. The wrist will be measured approximately 2 cm proximal to the wrist flexion crease.

      The first two blood pressure measurements will be used as a way to orient the subject to each
      device and the methods so that they are comfortable with the cuff and the process. The seven
      subsequent measurements will be used for analysis. There will be a 30 second to 60 second
      period between blood pressure measurements.
