  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Breast MRI is increasingly important in breast screening imaging. It is currently based on
      dynamic sequences after contrast injection whose temporal resolution must be less than 90
      seconds with dynamic acquisitions at different times.

      These curves profiles are designed to differentiate benign from malignant lesions. Recently,
      Mann et al, (2014) showed that increasing the temporal resolution of dynamic acquisitions;
      lesion enhancement curves over time were more accurate than the curves usually performed.

      It seems necessary to work on sequences having better temporal resolution without
      compromising however spatial resolution.
