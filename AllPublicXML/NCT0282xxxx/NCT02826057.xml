    <textblock>
      This study includes comatose survivors of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest treated with 24
      hours or 48 hours of targeted temperature management.

      The overall aim is to evaluate the importance of plasma complement protein concentrations in
      patients resuscitated after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest and treated with 24 hours or 48
      hours of targeted temperature management.

      The specific aim is to evaluate:

        -  the concentration of plasma lectin pathway proteins the first, second and third day
           after cardiac arrest

        -  the relation between concentration of plasma lectin pathway proteins and mortality

        -  if prolonged targeted temperature management influences the concentration of plasma
           lectin pathway proteins

      This study is a sub-study to the trial entitled: &quot;Time-differentiated targeted temperature
      management (TTH48) (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT01689077)&quot;

      The following Complement Lectin Pathway proteins will be measured: Mannan-Binding-Lectin,
      M-ficolin, H-ficolin, CL-L1, MASP-1, MASP-2, MASP-3, MAp19 and MAp44.
