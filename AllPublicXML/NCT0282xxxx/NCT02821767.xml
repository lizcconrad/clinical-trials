      Background:

      The National Eye Institute (NEI) wants to evaluate and provide standard treatment to people
      with eye diseases.

      Objective:

      To examine and treat people with eye diseases and learn more about eye diseases and how they
      are inherited.

      Eligibility:

      People with eye diseases who can give consent or have a guardian who can consent for them

      Design:

      Participants will be screened with an eye exam.

      Participants will have 1 12 visits per year depending on their eye disease for up to 5 years.
      Visits last about 4 hours and could include:

      Medical and family history

      Physical exam

      Eye exam and photography.

      Oculography: They put on contact lenses or goggles. They watch spots on a computer

      screen for 20 30 minutes.

      Electrooculography: Small metal disks are placed on the skin next to both eyes. They look
      left

      and right in the dark and light for about 30 minutes.

      Electroretinography: They sit in the dark with their eyes patched. A small metal disk is
      taped

      to the forehead. After 30 minutes, the patches are removed and contact lenses put in. They

      watch flashing lights.

      Fluorescein angiography: A needle guides a thin plastic tube into an arm vein. A dye is

      injected through the tube and travels up the blood vessels in the eyes. Pictures are taken of
      the

      eyes.

      Immunosuppressive treatment

      Eye cell sample: Samples are obtained from swabbing, pressing paper on, or taking a small

      biopsy sample from the surface of the eye.

      Blood tests

      Skin, tear, urine, saliva, stool, or hair sample

      Exam under anesthesia for some children

      At each visit participants could get medications, eye drops, eye injections, laser
      treatments, or surgery.

      The National Eye Institute (NEI) is conducting a study to evaluate and provide standard
      treatment to participants with various diagnosed and undiagnosed ocular conditions.

      Objective: The primary objective of this protocol is to provide short term follow-up of
      patients, usually in conjunction with a referring physician. In addition, this protocol
      allows clinicians at the NEI to maintain their expertise in evaluating and treating various
      eye disorders for which there may not be specific research studies. The knowledge gained may
      lead to ideas for future clinical research studies.

      Study Population: The number of participants to be enrolled has no logical upper limit, but
      will be set to 1,000 patients with ocular diseases.

      Design: This is an observational natural history study of multiple ocular diseases and their
      progression and physiology.

      Outcome Measures: No formal outcomes will be measured; however, the clinical assessments of
      enrolled participants can be used to measure the response to standard treatment.
