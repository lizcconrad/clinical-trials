      The purpose of this study is to evaluate this AngioScan angiography software on patients with
      various retinal vascular disorders. The advanced OCT instrument is an FDA approved clinically
      used camera, but the AngioScan angiography software is not FDA approved. Investigators would
      like to know if this imaging device and software can improve the quality of images and
      visualization of imaged tissues and whether they are useful in the diagnosis and treatment of
      eye diseases. Images collected in this study may be compared to other images collected as
      part of standard of care on the same patient (OCT, FA, AF, Fundus).

        Inclusion Criteria:

        â€¢ Any patient with abnormal retinal findings as determined by investigators.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Those suffering from head, neck or other injury which makes them unable to position
             themselves in head restraint for imaging.

          -  Participants who are unable to maintain retinal fixation on a specified target.

          -  Participants unable to achieve sufficient pupil dilation and alignment stability for
             imaging to take place.

          -  Patients with media opacity which preclude high quality imaging.
