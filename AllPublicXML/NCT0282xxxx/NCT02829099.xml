      The primary purpose of the study is to determine the recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) and
      schedule of JNJ-64457107 when administered intravenously (IV) to participants with advanced
      stage solid tumors in Part 1 and to further characterize the safety of JNJ-64457107 when
      administered IV to participants with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), pancreatic cancer
      and cutaneous melanoma in Part 2.

      This study has 2 parts: Dose Escalation (part 1) and Dose Expansion (part 2) which are
      conducted in 3 phases: Screening Phase (up to 28 days prior to first dose of study drug and
      includes procedures like electrocardiogram [ECG], serum pregnancy test), Treatment phase
      (continues until the completion of the End-of-Treatment Visit [30 days after last dose of
      study drug]) and Post-treatment follow-up phase (continues until the participant has died, is
      lost to follow-up, or has withdrawn consent or the study ends). In follow-up, participants
      will continue to be monitored for survival status and subsequent cancer-related therapies
      until the end of study. Additional bio-markers will be assessed, in an optional sub-study, to
      define the impact of JNJ-64457107 on innate and adaptive immune responses in tumors. Safety
      will be monitored throughout the study by Safety Evaluation Team (SET).

    <description>In Part 1, the first cohort will receive JNJ-64457107 at a starting dose of 75 microgram per kilogram (mcg/kg). The proposed treatment schedule is intravenous (IV) dosing every 14 days. JNJ-64457107 doses will be escalated following a modified Continual Reassessment Method (mCRM); the JNJ-64457107 dose will be increased by not more than half-logarithmical (3.2-fold) dose increments. Dose escalation will continue until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and/or RP2D of JNJ-64457107 are defined or the maximum-administered dose (MAD) has been reached. In Part 2, subjects will receive JNJ-64457107 at the RP2D and regimen determined in Part 1.</description>
