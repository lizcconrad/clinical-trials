  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to evaluate the impact of lumbar spine ultrasound on the success
      rate and efficiency of labor epidural placement in the lateral position. The investigators
      hypothesize that ultrasound imaging of the lumbar spine of women in early labor will yield
      similar ultrasound results when done immediately prior to epidural placement. The
      investigators also hypothesize that the use of ultrasound with landmarks marked and depth to
      the epidural space estimated will facilitate epidural placement in terms of both efficiency
      (time required for placement) and efficacy of pain relief.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Several studies have demonstrated a significant benefit in pre-procedural ultrasound for
      epidural placement by anesthesia residents, particularly when performed in the obese
      population. To the investigators knowledge, however, no studies have evaluated this teaching
      modality for the lumber epidural technique in the lateral position. Formalizing the
      educational process for this less frequently performed, highly technical and critical skill
      may have a profound impact on trainee learning curves, and may enhance the overall success
      and efficiency of epidural placement, quality of analgesia provided, and safety of the
      procedure.

    <description>A baseline lumbar ultrasound in a standardized lateral position (by bed markings) will be performed with the midline and L3-L4 interspace marked, and estimated depth to the epidural space recorded. A second lateral lumbar ultrasound will be performed immediately prior to placement at the time of epidural request. The bed position will be standardized with lines drawn down the back, at the flexion of the knee, and heel of the foot. The sonographic measurements will include the midline, the L3-4 interspace, (both marked at the skin surface), and the measured depth to the ligamentum flavum (in centimeters).</description>
