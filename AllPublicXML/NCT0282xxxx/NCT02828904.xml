  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE) associated with the use of chlormadinone acetate
      (CMA) is currently unknown as the available data have significant limitations and lack data
      on direct comparison between levonorgestrel (LNG) and CMA containing COCs. This new study is
      designed to assess the VTE risk associated with CMA containing COCs compared to LNG
      containing COCs in a large case-control study.

      The objective of this study is to compare the VTE risk of COCs containing CMA 2mg / EE 30µg,
      compared to COCs containing LNG 0.15mg and 30µg ethinylestradiol (EE).

      This population-based case-control study will be conducted in Germany. It is intended to
      recruit the VTE cases from the primary care sector (i.e. community based) before referral to
      specialized centers/hospitals, from hospitals (emergency department or internal medicine
      ward) or when the cases are referred back to ambulatory care after diagnosis and initiation
      of treatment in hospital settings or specialized diagnostic centers.

      Cases will be prospectively included if they are diagnosed with a new venous thrombotic event
      after study start.

      Controls will be accrued as soon as cases are identified to match with. The index date for
      controls is the date of the event in the matched cases, i.e. information after this index
      date is dismissed in the analyses. Matching will be based on year of birth, sex and region of
      residence. In addition, all controls have to be either current COC users or recent past users
      (non-use for 3 months or less). The recruitment of matched controls will be stopped as soon
      as 4 matched controls have been identified that are current new or incident users of a CMA or
      LNG COC in the pre-defined dosage (as defined as primary exposure).
