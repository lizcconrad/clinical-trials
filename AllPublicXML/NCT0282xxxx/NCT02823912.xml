  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The increased mortality from cardiovascular disease has a significant impact on the
      population, and the prevalence of these diseases it become one of the major problems, since
      it is the leading cause of mortality and 1 in 3 Mexicans suffer from cardiovascular disease
      according ENSANUT; the above is attributed to the increase of diseases associated with an
      inflammatory process accelerated as obesity, dyslipidemia, hypertension (SAH) and diabetes
      mellitus (DM).

      The cholesterol is a major risk factor in the development of cardiovascular disease, and in
      turn increases the chances of death; however, the treatment of choice is based on changes in
      lifestyle, which for most people are difficult to maintain long-term. As for the drug therapy
      treated with drugs many people do not achieve their therapeutic goals, and therefore the
      inflammatory condition that underlies this disease remains.

      Recent studies have focused on the possible role of capsaicin in the inflammatory state
      through the agonistic effect it has on TRPV1. It has demonstrated the antiinflammatory
      activity of capsaicin to enhance inflammation by free fatty acids (FFA) and reducing the
      expression of certain genes involved in this process induced. Capsaicin is a natural choice
      and well tolerated with few side effects limited to the gastrointestinal tract such as
      dyspepsia and intestinal irregularity, for the above is of interest to evaluate the effect of
      capsaicin on the profile of inflammatory cytokines in individuals with dyslipidemia.

      It will conduct a clinicala trial, double - blind, randomized and placebo control group.
      Female and male patients, with dyslipidemia. Two groups will be formed with 17 patients each
      (capsaicin 150 mg per day or Magnesia calcinada). At the beginning and end of the
      intervention clinical and laboratory determination. The data obteined were analyzed using
      SPSS statistical software version 22. It was considered statistically significant at p &lt;0.05
