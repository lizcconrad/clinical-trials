      Study setting : Ain Shams University Maternity Hospital Study Design : Pilot prospective
      randomized clinical trial Study population: The patients will be recruited from women
      presenting to the outpatient clinic of Ain Shams University Maternity Hospital planned to
      undergo hysterectomy for benign cause according to inclusion/ exclusion criteria which will
      be mentioned later.

      Study duration : the study will be carried out during the period from August 2014 to August
      2016.

      Sample size: total of 50 cases will be included in the study to be divided into two groups,
      the first group will undergo vaginal hysterectomy and the second will undergo Laparoscopic
      assisted vaginal hysterectomy.

      intervention: after approval of the ethical committee, a detailed explanation of the
      procedure will be informed to the participant and after her approval to involve in the study,
      an informed written consent will be taken. Detailed medical history will be obtained from all
      participants recruited in the study along with complete clinical examination and necessary
      laboratory and radiological investigations. Each patient will have a case record form in
      which the data regarding history, examination, investigations, operation costs and
      postoperative events will be recorded

    <description>In case of vaginal hysterectomy, the operative time will be measured from the vaginal incision to closure of the vaginal vault. in cases of Laparoscopic assisted vaginal hysterectomy, the time will be measured from the introduction of the laparoscopic camera port till stitching the laparoscopic incisions after ensuring adequate hemostasis. the time of any concomitant procedures was excluded</description>

    <description>intraoperative blood loss will be estimated via:
- amount of blood in suction bottle.
- Estimation based on number of soaked gauzes by weighing the gauzes used in the procedure before and after surgery ( each 1mg corresponds to 1ml of blood)
- Drop in postoperative hemoglobin and hematocrit when compared with preoperative values.</description>

    <description>the costs of the following will be calculated:
- Admission cost which include ward fee, pre and postoperative management costs and extra charges for post surgical complication.
- anesthesia cost which includes expenses of anesthetics during the procedure. C)- operation cost which include operative material fee.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Age between 40 and 70 years.

          2. Uterine weight more than 280gm. the weight will be estimated sonographically using
             algebraic formula by Kung and Chang expressed in weights and measurements: weight(g)=
             50+(4/3 x Ï€(Pi) x L/2 x W/2 x AP/2) where (L) is the length of the uterus from the
             dome of the fundus to the level of the external os and (W) is the maximum width of the
             uterus at the level of the cornua and (AP) is the anteroposterior diameter of the
             uterus . Both (W) and (AP) will be taken perpendicular to the axis of the uterine
             length.

          3. Presence of a benign cause for hysterectomy. e.g: fibroid uterus, simple endometrial
             hyperplasia not responding to medical treatment and adenomyosis.
