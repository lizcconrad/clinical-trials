    <textblock>
      The study consists of two distinct and sequential parts:

        -  A Phase Ib aimed at determining the MTD (Maximum Tolerated Dose) of the combination
           (copanlisib/cetuximab) and the RP2D

        -  A Phase II aimed at evaluating the efficacy of the combination at the RP2D (Recommended
           Phase 2 Dose)

      All patients will be treated with the Copanlisib, a selective PI3KCA inhibitor, in
      association with Cetuximab.

             scan/MRI, whichever is performed first, and again prior to the first study drug
             administration. If a patient is on chronic corticosteroid therapy, corticosteroids
