  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to explore the effects of omega-3-acid ethyl esters (TAK-085) on
      vascular endothelial function when administered for 8 weeks, as measured by FMD, in patients
      with hyperlipidemia.

    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, collaborative, randomized, open-label study designed to explore the
      effects of administration of omega-3-acid ethyl esters (TAK-085) [2 g (2 g PO QD) or 4 g (2 g
      PO BID) for 8 weeks] on vascular endothelial function, as measured by flow-mediated dilation
      (FMD), in patients receiving a hydroxymethylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitor
      and have concurrent hypertriglyceridemia (hereinafter referred to as TG).

      Considering the potential bias by factors that affect FMD between treatment groups,
      stratified allocation will be performed with fasting TG level as a factor.
