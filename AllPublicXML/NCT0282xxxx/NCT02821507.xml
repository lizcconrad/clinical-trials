  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chondrosarcoma and liposarcoma consists of different subtypes with a wide range of patient
      survival. Current treatment options consist of wide surgical resection, however for patients
      with a local recurrence or metastatic disease the outcome is poor. New treatment options
      being evaluated and mouse models show in vivo that mammilian target of rapamycin (mTOR)
      inhibition can prevent tumour growth. mTOR is an kinase that is present in two complexes and
      thereby activates multiple pathways. Aberrant mTOR signalling is known to be involved in
      cancer cell survival. Several clinical studies for patients with bone or soft tissue sarcoma
      treated with mTOR inhibitors have been conducted and they show promising results. From these
      studies the investigators can conclude that the combination of an mTOR inhibitor with
      cyclophosphamide shows promising results in chondrosarcoma. With the lack of other treatment
      options for unresectable and metastatic chondrosarcoma or myxoid liposarcoma the Eurosarc
      consortium (www.eurosarc.eu) decided to treat these patients in a standardised way according
      to a common protocol with the combination of sirolimus and cyclophosphamide using the growth
      modulation index for evaluation in the current clinical study protocol.
