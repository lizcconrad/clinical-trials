  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary purpose is to examine the impact that physical therapy (PT) interventions,
      including manipulations, have on physical activity levels outside of the clinical environment
      in persons with low back pain (LBP) as measured both objectively with an accelerometer and
      subjectively with questionnaires.

      The secondary purpose is to determine if a relationship exists between objective physical
      activity, self-perceived disability pain catastrophizing thoughts, BMI, age, six-minute walk
      distance, lower extremity muscle endurance.

      The tertiary purpose is to assess the predictive value that a standing manual lumbar
      unloading technique has for relief of pain following manipulation

      At session 1: Participants are screened for eligibility. Baseline outcome measures are
      conducted (self-report questionnaires and physical performance tests). Accelerometer which is
      an instrument to measure physical activity is issued.

      At session 2 (To occur at least one-week later): Accelerometer data is retrieved and
      downloaded to a computer. Participant numerically rates low back pain level at rest and in
      most painful position. Participant receives a manual distraction procedure. Participant rates
      pain level again. Participant starts the physical therapy intervention (manipulation of the
      spine, muscular strengthening and cardiovascular exercise, education). Accelerometer is
      reissued again.

      At session 3 (At least one-week later): Accelerometer is collected and data is retrieved.
      Participant continues with the intervention (manipulation, exercise, education).
