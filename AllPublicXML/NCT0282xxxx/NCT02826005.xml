      Examination the ability to early diagnose HCC by combining three biomarkers technology
      developed by WAKO, And their relevance to cirrhotic of patients with various backgrounds and
      the Israeli population.

      This blood test will serve as an additional diagnostic tool tools currently in use
      (Ultrasound and AFP levels) to cirrhotic patients with high risk to develop hepatocellular
      carcinoma.

      Another group that will be examined for all three biomarkers will be patients which already
      diagnosed with hepatocellular carcinoma, and have normal AFP level in order to examine the
      correlation between the presence of tumor, the number of them and the tumor size and the
      three biomarkers concentration in their blood
