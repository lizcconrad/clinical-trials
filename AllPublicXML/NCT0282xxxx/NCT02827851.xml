  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Stromal vascular fraction of cells (SVF) will be extracted from lipoaspirate by enzymatic
      digestion. SVF will be administered in a single dose intraarticularly 4 weeks after
      arthroscopic debridement. All patients will receive cell therapy.This is a single arm study
      with no control.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients undergone arthroscopic debridement for knee osteoarthritis will be subjected to
      abdominal liposuction under local anaesthesia. Harvested adipose tissue will be processed
      according to patent pending technology based on enzymatic digestion, washing and
      concentration of cell pellet in 5 ml of Hartmann's solution. Isolated SVF will be
      administered in a single dose into anterior part of knee joint cavity 28 days after
      arthroscopy.
