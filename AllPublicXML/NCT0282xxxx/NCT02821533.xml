  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the current study is to study the safety and effectiveness of TACE using a high
      dose of cisplatin for treatment of HCC. It is hypothesized that the formulation is safe and
      it improves the therapeutic effect of conventional TACE.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Most patients with HCC are diagnosed at an intermediate and advanced stage when the tumors
      become unresectable, transcatheter arterial chemoembolisation (TACE) has been widely accepted
      as a standard treatment for them in most international management protocols. The therapeutic
      effect of TACE in terms of objective tumor response is variable and modest (27%-40%),
      indicating that there is actually much room for improvement in the treatment.
      Internationally, high doses and combination of chemotherapeutic agents are being routinely
      and widely used for TACE in major medical centers. Locally, a low dose of cisplatin (10mg)
      has been used as the chemotherapeutic agent for TACE in Hong Kong. There is evidence showing
      that the component of chemotherapeutic agent in TACE does play a significant role in the
      treatment effect of TACE. In an attempt to improve the treatment effect of TACE, the
      investigators propose a formulation of TACE using a high dose of cisplatin as
      chemotherapeutic agent.

    <description>Two consecutive treatments at two months apart will be given. A delay in the second treatment is allowed if patients do not recover to an acceptable state for subsequent cycle of treatment. Two treatment sessions at one month apart may be required for each complete treatment to cover all lesions when the lesions are diffusely distributed and involving both lobes.</description>

    <description>Cisplatin will be mixed with a mixture of Lipiodol and ethanol (LEM), which consists of 33% ethanol by volume in Lipiodol, in a ratio of 2mg cisplatin per mL of LEM, and delivered through catheters or microcatheters to the tumors until there is flow reduction at the tumor feeders. The total dose of cisplatin given in each treatment session is limited to 100mg (50mL LEM) in each treatment session. The usual volume of LEM delivered will be 20 - 30 mL.</description>
