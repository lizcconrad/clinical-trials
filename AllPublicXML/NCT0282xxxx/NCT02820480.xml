    <textblock>
      Rehab in a Crate is a therapy gym designed to be affordable, compact and easily
      transportable. The purpose of this particular study is to gain feedback on the initial design
      of the Rehab in a Crate system. This will be accomplished by using qualitative ethnographic
      research methods (i.e. human centered design) in the form of surveys that have been carefully
      designed by members of the research team. The eligibility criteria of this survey research
      reflects the intended user base of an eventual finished product, which is survivors of stroke
      and cerebral palsy across the globe. And while healthcare professionals are not the user base
      per se, their expertise and feedback should be instrumental in the design of future
      iterations of the Rehab in a Crate. Ease of use, utility, design, and various features, both
      existing and intended, will all be surveyed items.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators aim to survey stroke survivors and healthcare professionals on the design,
      ease of use, utility, and various features of, both existing and those yet-to-be-developed.
      This feedback will help to fine tune further development of this therapy gym, Rehab in a
      Crate, and move forward in the iteration process.

      Note: The device is not being used at this moment for diagnostic or evaluation.
