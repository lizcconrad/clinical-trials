          1. Male or female subjects at least 18 years of age

             consent to participate in the study

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Subjects whose constipation diagnosis and symptoms predate the initiation of treatment
             with the constipating medication.

          2. Subjects with known or suspected ileus, gastrointestinal obstruction, gastric
             retention, bowel perforation, toxic colitis, toxic megacolon

          3. Subjects who have had major surgery 30 days before Visit 1; appendectomy or

          4. Medical conditions associated with diarrhea, intermittent loose stools, or
             constipation, which could confound the interpretation of the results, eg, fecal
             incontinence or irritable bowel syndrome. Subjects with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS)
             that has been previously diagnosed by a physician prior to initiation of the
             constipating therapy and that meets the following criteria, are excluded:

               1. Absence of a structural or biochemical explanation for the abdominal pain symptom

               2. At least 12 weeks during a period of 12 months, of abdominal discomfort or pain
                  with at least 2 of the following 3 features:

          8. Subjects who are allergic to any BLI801 component

          9. Active substance or alcohol use that, in the opinion of the investigator, could
             compromise patient's ability to comply with the study instructions.

         10. Subjects who have participated in an investigational clinical, surgical, drug, or
             device study within the past 30 days

         11. Subjects who, in the opinion of the Investigator, should not be included in the study
             for any reason, including inability to follow study procedures.

         12. Subjects who withdraw consent at any time prior to completion of Visit 1 procedures

         13. Subjects who have had a colonoscopy within 2 weeks of Visit 1 or are scheduled to have
