  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the fifth most common cancer in terms of incidence and the
      second in terms of mortality. At an early stage, which is based on a low number and size of
      liver nodules and the absence of extra-hepatic locations (Milan criteria), a curative
      treatment can be performed, i.e. liver transplantation, surgical resection, or
      thermo-ablation. These treatments can lead to severe complications, so patients benefiting
      from them must be carefully selected. The correct identification of all HCC lesions at the
      time of the therapeutic decision is crucial. MRI is the reference examination for diagnosis
      but its field of exploration is limited to the upper abdominal area and its sensitivity
      decreases for nodules of less than two centimetres. Such lesions could actually be HCC that
      will cause early post-operative progression.

      Positron Emission Tomography (PET; functional imaging) with fluorodeoxyglucose can provide
      prognostic information but impacts initial staging in less than 5% of cases. However, PET
      with fluorocholine (FCH), available in France since 2010, could detect intra- and
      extra-hepatic HCC lesions not identified by conventional imaging, potentially impacting
      patient management (e.g. 52% of patients in a small case study).

      FCH-PET/MRI could therefore be the ideal examination for the initial staging of HCC,
      combining in a single multimodality investigation the reference morphological imaging
      technique and an efficient functional one. The hypothesis of this study is that FCH-PET/MRI
      is able to detect, in patients eligible for curative treatment, additional preoperative
      intra- and extra-hepatic early or metastatic HCC unseen or equivocal with conventional
      imaging (CT and MRI) and responsible for recurrence or disease progression at 6 months.
