    <textblock>
      SP2086 is a novel inhibitor of Dipeptide base peptidase 4, allows an insulin-independent
      approach to improve type 2 diabetes hyperglycemia. In this single-dose and multiple-dose
      study the investigators evaluated the safety, tolerability and PK/PD profiles of SP2086 in
      Type 2 Diabetes Patients .
