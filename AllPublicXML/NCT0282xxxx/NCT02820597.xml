      This pilot study is a single arm study designed to evaluate the feasibility of cryoablation
      in the nasal passageway using the ClariFix Device, to reduce the symptoms of chronic
      rhinitis.

    <description>Change in subject reported symptom severity based on rTNSS (Reflective Total Nasal Symptom Score) at baseline and at 7, 30, and 90 days post-treatment. The rTNSS is the sum of 4 individual subject-assessed symptom scores for rhinorrhea, nasal congestion, nasal itching, and sneezing, each evaluated using a scale of 0=None, 1=Mild, 2=Moderate, or 3=Severe. The rTNSS has a possible score of 0-12. The reflective scores will be based on the subject's evaluation of symptom severity over the preceding 12 hours.</description>
