  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Forty three adolescents with chronic idiopathic neck pain were randomly allocated to receive
      pain neurophysiology education and shoulder/neck exercises (n=21) or no intervention (n=22).
      Data on pain intensity (Visual Analogue Scale), pain disability, neck flexor and extensor
      muscles endurance, scapulae stabilizers endurance, pain catastrophizing (Pain catastrophizing
      Scale), trait and state anxiety (State-Trait Anxiety Inventory) and knowledge of pain
      neurophysiology (Neurophysiology of Pain Questionnaire) were collected. Measurements were
      taken before and after the intervention.

      Statistical analysis were performed using a mixed-methods ANOVA.

    <description>Pain neurophysiology education covered the neurophysiology of pain, transition from acute to chronic pain and the nervous system ability to modulate the pain experience. It was delivered in small groups (4 to 7 participants). A total of 4 sessions were delivered over 4 weeks (1 session per week). Each session took between 45 minutes and 1 hour.
Exercises were aimed at increasing the endurance and strength of the deep neck flexor and extensor muscles and of the scapular muscles delivered over 3 sessions (the first session covered pain neurophysiology education only). Each exercise was performed in 3 series of 10 repetitions. The number of exercises targeting the same group of muscles increased from one in the 2nd session to 2/3 in the 4th session.</description>
