  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to gather information regarding the population with moderate to
      severe inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), the burden of the disease, and understand their
      treatment patterns, particularly on the use of available biologic therapies.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a non-interventional study to determine the rate of control of disease activity in
      moderate to severe IBD participants.

      The study will enroll approximately 400 patients. This multicenter trial will be conducted in
      Brazil. Retrospective data of previous IBD treatments (drug, dose, treatment duration, drug
      changes), and use of other health resources related with the management of IBD for previous
      three years will be collected. Prospective data will be collected for a period of 12 months
      in participants with active disease. UC participants, with no or light disease activity at
      Day 1 will not continue to 12-month follow up. CD participants, with no or light disease
      activity at Day 1 but with colonoscopy or calprotectin levels (i.e, calprotectin &gt;200 ug/g)
      in the previous year suggestive of inadequate control of activity will progress to 12-month
      follow up.

    <measure>HBI Score After 12 Months Among Participants who had Moderately to Severely Active CD at Day 1</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1 and Month 12</time_frame>
    <description>The HBI is used in the assessment and quantification of symptoms and the present level of disease activity of participants with CD. It is a validated clinical index for CD, including the 5 categories of: general well-being, abdominal pain, number of liquid stools, abdominal mass and complications. The score ranges from 0 to 25 with higher scores indicating higher disease activity. The scores were classified as follows: less than 5 is remission, 5 to 7 is mild, 8 to 16 is moderate, and greater than 16 is severe.</description>

    <description>The CDAI evaluates severity of signs and symptoms of CD. Information will be collected on number of liquid stools, intensity of abdominal pain, general well-being, presence of comorbid conditions, use of medications for diarrhea, physical examination, and laboratory, yielding 8 items that are combined with data from a 7-day diary to obtain total CDAI score. Index values of 150 and below are associated with quiescent disease; values above that indicate active disease, values ≥220 indicates moderate to severe disease, and values above 450 are seen with extremely severe disease.</description>

    <description>EuroQoL questionnaire (EQ-5D) considers five attributes of quality of life evaluation, i.e mobility, self-care, usual activity, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression. Each dimension has five possible levels, 1-no problems, 2 slight problems, 3-moderate problems, 4-severe problems, 5-extreme problems, thus defining a total of 3125 possible health states, each one referred to in terms of a 5 digit code. EQ-5D also include an additional visual analogic scale (EQ-VAS), which ranges from 0, worst imaginable health state, to 100, best imaginable health state.</description>

    <description>The Short Form-36 (SF-36) evaluates 8 health dimensions: physical functioning, bodily pain, role physical (limitations due to physical problems), role emotional (limitations due to personal or emotional problems), mental health, social functioning, vitality, and general health perceptions. Based on these 8 scales, two weighted scores are generated: the physical component summary (PCS) and the mental component summary (MCS) score. Scores range between 0 and 100, with higher scores indicating a better quality of life.</description>

    <measure>Mean Total Score of Inflammatory Bowel Disease Questionnaire (IBDQ) and by Domain (Bowel Symptoms, Systemic Symptoms, Emotional Function and Social Function)</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1</time_frame>
    <description>The Inflammatory Bowel Disease Questionnaire (IBDQ) is a 32-item questionnaire that measures 4 dimensions: bowel function, emotional status, systemic symptoms, and social function. Within dimensions, each question presents seven possible answers/points. Each domain score is the sum of 8 responses each ranging from 1 to 7, where 1 indicates worst function and 7 the best. The sub-score ranges from 8 to 56; a higher score indicating a better quality of life. Hence, the total score ranges from 32 to 224, with higher scores representing better quality of life. The IBDQ is not validated for patients with ostomies and therefore should not be applied for these patients.</description>

    <measure>Mean of Participants' Total Percentage of Work Impairment (Work Productivity and Activity Impairment [WPAI] Questionnaire)</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1</time_frame>
    <description>The Work Productivity and Activity Impairment questionnaire (WPAI) assesses the impact of IBD on work productivity and daily activities during the previous 7 days. The WPAI questions are: 1) if currently employed, 2) hours missed due to disease, 3) hours missed other reasons, 4) hours actually worked, 5) degree disease affected productivity while working, 6) degree disease affected regular activities. WPAI generates four component scores: percentage of work time missed (absenteeism); percentage of impairment while working (presentisms); percentage of overall work impairment (absenteeism and presentisms combined); and percentage of activity impairment. Unemployed participants only answer questions related to employment status and activity impairment. Scores for WPAI range from 0% (no impairment) to 100% (total loss of work productivity/activity).</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Male or female.

          2. 18 years or older (at the time of diagnosis of moderate to severe UC or CD).

          3. Diagnosis of moderate to severe CD or UC for at least 6 months prior to Day 1
             appointment according the clinical or endoscopic criteria.

          4. Has provided the written informed consent.

             For the prospective period, eligible participants should present at least one of the
             following criteria that will only be applied at Day 1:

          5. For CD participants:

               -  Crohn's Disease Activity Index (CDAI) ≥220 or

             Considering that for CD participants, the disease activity may not be clearly
             documented only with clinical data, some objective criteria may be considered as entry
             criteria for the 12-month prospective period:

               -  Colonoscopy in the previous year suggestive of inadequate control of activity or,

               -  Calprotectin levels in the previous year suggestive of inadequate control of
                  activity (i.e, calprotectin &gt;200 µg/g).

          6. For UC: partial Mayo Score ≥5. Note : Patients with colostomy and prospective period:
             Although clinical scales defined above are impacted by colostomy these patients will
             not be excluded from the protocol to ensure the assessment of different clinical
             presentations of the IBD. In addition, patients with colostomy must follow the same
             criteria as above to be eligible to the prospective phase.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Indeterminate or not classified colitis.

          2. Current or previous participation in interventional clinical trial (within the last 3
             years).

             In addition, for the 12-month prospective period, participants will be excluded if:

          3. Presenting mental incapacity, unwillingness or language barriers precluding adequate
             understanding or cooperation.

          4. Hospitalized participants at Day 1.

          5. Current off label treatment with Vedolizumab.

        Study Discontinuation Criteria

        It will be considered a premature termination the situation in which the subject
        discontinues the participation, i.e. they are withdrawn from the study before completing
        the 12 months of follow up period (365 days ± 14 days from Day 1), due to any of the
        reasons listed below:

          1. Withdrawal of consent: subjects who for any reason withdraw the free and informed
             consent;

          2. Lost to follow-up (no return of the subject on the expected date of visit - drop-out
             from the protocol);

          3. Death;

          4. Study termination;

          5. Any situation that places the subject within one of the exclusion criteria.

        Note: Patients who are eligible for the prospective period, it means, with active disease
        at Day 1 but who during the 12 months period presents disease remission and/or no activity
        disease condition, are allowed to continue the participation in the study.
