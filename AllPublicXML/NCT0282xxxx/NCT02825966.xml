      A prospective, validation study to evaluate the data accuracy of heart sounds recorded by the
      LifeVest® Wearable Cardioverter Defibrillator (WCD). These data will be compared with the
      heart sounds data recorded by an FDA-cleared device.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      To conduct a prospective, validation study to evaluate the data accuracy of heart sounds
      recorded by the LifeVest® Wearable Cardioverter Defibrillator (WCD). To show equivalence,
      these data will be compared with the heart sounds data recorded by an FDA-cleared device.

      The study will enroll a minimum of 27 and a maximum of 35 subjects.

      Participants will be adult patients (age ≥ 18 years) with at least seven patients over the
      age of 40 years. In addition, at least five patients with a history of heart failure will be
      included.

      First, participants will wear the FDA-cleared device for 15 minutes while sitting quietly.
      Then, the FDA-cleared device will be removed and the participants will wear the WCD for 15
      minutes while sitting quietly. Next, while wearing the WCD, participants will perform various
      activities of daily living, including at least 6 hours of overnight wear. Finally, the WCD
      will be removed and the participants will wear the FDA-cleared again for 15 minutes while
      sitting quietly.

      This is a single center, prospective, observational study. This is a non-significant risk
      device study as all biological study parameters will be measured noninvasively with the WCD
      defibrillation capability disabled. In addition, the study device will not be used as a
      replacement for regularly prescribed therapies or diagnostics.
