      The aim of this study is to examine inhalation behavior in patients enrolled in the German
      Ventavis patient support program Ventaplus when these patients are switched from Ventavis
      (Iloprost) 10 μg/mL to Ventavis (Iloprost) 20 μg/mL formulation.

      The VENTASWITCH study will be a local, prospective and retrospective, observational,
      case-crossover study. Data are collected and downloaded from the I-Neb AAD (Adaptive Aerosol
      Delivery) System. Two data collection periods are planned: period one; data collection from
      the last 3 months using Ventavis (Iloprost) 10 μg/mL (V10) before the index date of switching
      to Ventavis (Iloprost) 20 μg/mL (V20) (retrospective part) and period two; data collection
      for 3 months using V20 from index date (prospective part).

        The study will be conducted in patients who are enrolled in the German Ventavis patient
        support program Ventaplus which is executed for Bayer by the company Contra Care GmbH,
        Nürnberg. Patients who are enrolled in the program and repeatedly experienced extended
        inhalation times with Ventavis (Iloprost) 10 μg/mL which could possibly result in
        incomplete inhalations, are currently being switched to Ventavis (Iloprost) 20 μg/mL by
        their physician.
