  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Recently, European Medicines Agency approved ibrutinib and idelalisib to treat Chronic
      Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL) and two lymphomas: Follicular Lymphoma (FL) for ibrutinib and
      Mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) for idelalisib.

      Clinical trials for ibrutinib and idelalisib were performed with a small number of patients
      (300-350) and showed several side effects profiles. Since, pharmacokinetic properties of
      these 2 drugs highlight a interindividual variability of pharmacokinetic. The aim of this
      study is to determine the association between clinically significant side effects occurrence
      during the first year of treatment and plasma mean concentration of the steady state of
      ibrutinib or idelalisib at 1 month.

      Recently, European medicines agency approved ibrutinib and idelalisib in the treatment of
      Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL) and two lymphomas: Follicular Lymphoma (FL) for ibrutinib
      and Mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) for idelalisib. Nevertheless, clinical trials for these two
      drugs were performed for only 300-350 patients and showed several side effects profiles, the
      most frequent were diarrhea, infection, cutaneous rash… For some patients, treatment had to
      be reduced or stopped temporary or definitely.

      Pharmacokinetic properties of these two drugs highlight an interindividual pharmacokinetic
      considerable variability. The aim of this clinical research study is to determine the
      association between clinically significant side effects occurrence during the first year of
      treatment (serious adverse reaction and/or grade CTCAE ≥ 3 and/or leading a dosage
      concession) and plasma mean concentration of the steady state of ibrutinib or idelalisib
      performed at 1 month.

      To determine plasma mean concentration of the steady state of ibrutinib or idelalisib, blood
      tests will be performed every scheduled monitoring at visit 1 month during a pharmacokinetic
      exploration and during scheduled medical consultation (2, 3, 6 and 12 months) and every
      unscheduled visit in case of side effect occurrence.

      Every scheduled monitoring visit, blood tests will be performed to determine plasma
      concentration in drug. Complementary blood or salivary samples will be collected before the
      treatment, 24 months later and in case of relapse to determine genetic characteristics. In
      parallel, a logbook will be completed by the patient to collect side effects. Finally, an
      oncology certified nurse call patients every 2 weeks. In case of side effect occurrence a
      visit will be organized in the next 3 days and a blood test will be performed.
