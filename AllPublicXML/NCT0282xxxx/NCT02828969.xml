  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Conduct disorders are defined as &quot;repetitive and persistent pattern of behavior in which the
      basic rights of others or major age-appropriate norms are violated&quot;. So defined, these
      disorders are at the crossroads of psychiatry, social field and justice. Conduct disorder
      management is a public health issue and a societal question. Conduct disorders affect 5 to 9%
      of 15-year old boys.

      Care management of children and adolescents admitted for disruptive behaviors in emergency
      rooms is an issue. No consensus or official recommendation exists. However, use of emergency
      care in this context is increasing in most western countries and it exposes to several risks
      (inappropriate use of hospitalizations, social rupture, ignorance of comorbidities and
      suicide risk). The Trajectories project is designed to describe children and adolescents with
      disruptive behaviors, their care management and to follow their life trajectory and
      psychiatric evolution after admission to emergency rooms. Better understanding this
      population will improve their medical and social care management, thereby giving
      professionals the right tools.

      The main objective of this project is to implement a multidisciplinary and integrative
      research combining clinical considerations and social sciences to determine the &quot;trajectory&quot;
      of this population.
