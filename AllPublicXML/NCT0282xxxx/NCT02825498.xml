  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Radiofrequency ablation (RFA) is a standard treatment option for cavotricuspid isthmus (CTI)
      dependent atrial flutter. We plan to perform a randomized prospective trial comparing the
      efficacy of contact force (CF) guided CTI ablation against catheter ablation with the
      operator blinded to contact force parameters.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Subjects will be followed for one year post procedure in order to check for atrial flutter
      recurrences. This will involve an in-person visit at 3 months post procedure, and records
      checks at 12 months post procedure.
