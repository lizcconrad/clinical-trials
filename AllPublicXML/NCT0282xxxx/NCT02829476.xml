    <textblock>
      Adolescent idiopathic Scoliosis (AIS) is the most common spine pathology. It is opposed to
      secondary scoliosis due to chronic diseases. Many hypotheses have been made to elucidate the
      origin of this illness. Recently, the melatonin pathway has been investigated as pinealectomy
      of the chicken creates a scoliosis that resembles AIS and melatonin supplementation reverses
      the process. In addition administration of melatonin to AIS patients improved the pathology.
      However this hypothesis has shown controversial results. Recent studies have demonstrated
      melatonin cellular resistance in osteoblastic cells from AIS patients. Melatonin acts through
      G protein coupled receptor (GPCR), mainly using the Gi pathway. In AIS osteoblasts, this
      pathway is blocked leading to a decrease in the inactivation of the adenylyl cyclase and
      therefore maintenance of high level of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) concentrations
      in the cells. As modulation of cAMP is important for osteogenesis such resistance may be
      critical for the initiation or the development of AIS.

      Gi signalization is used by several other GPCR, thus, this hormonal resistance could
      logically be found in other hormonal or mediator pathways. A precedent study previously
      focused on ghrelin in AIS, and demonstrated that AIS patients possess elevated plasmatic
      values of ghrelin. This study also observed decreased response to ghrelin in AIS cultures
      osteoblasts.
