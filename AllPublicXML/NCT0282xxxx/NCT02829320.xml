    <textblock>
      This 24-week, Phase 3, open-label, non-comparative, multicentre study aims to evaluate the
      efficacy and safety of GSK1278863 in Japanese hemodialysis (HD) patients with renal anemia
      not using erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs). The primary objective is to evaluate the
      initial response to GSK1278863 measured by hemoglobin (Hgb) levels in HD patients not using
      ESAs enrolled in this study. The study is designed to evaluate the appropriateness of the
      starting dose of GSK1278863 and of the GSK1278863 dose adjustment regimen to achieve or
      maintain the target Hgb levels. This study will consist of a 4-week screening period, a
      24-week treatment period (4-week fixed-dose period and a 20-week dose adjustment period), and
      a 2- to 4-week follow-up period.

    <description>Subjects will receive GSK1278863 once daily orally at a starting dose of 4 milligrams (mg) on Day 1, and continued until the day of Week 4. From Weeks 4 to 24, interruption of treatment or dose adjustments will be made within the maintenance dose range of 1 mg to 24 mg according to the dose adjustment algorithm to achieve and/or maintain Hgb within the target range (10.0 to 12.0 g/dL) based on the Hgb value measured every 4 weeks. Dose changes will be made every 4 weeks. Iron replacement therapy will be given according to the standard starting criteria.</description>
