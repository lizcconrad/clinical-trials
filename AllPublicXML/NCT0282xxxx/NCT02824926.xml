  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a non-inferiority, Phase II, open-label, randomized, parallel trial to evaluate
      efficacy and safety of the new intervention (Dapaconazole cream 2%) versus the active control
      (Ketoconazole cream 2%) in patients with Tinea Pedis. Study schedule comprises enrollment,
      treatment and follow-up visits. Treatment period is 14 days.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study sample consists of male and female subjects aged between 18 and 60 years-old,
      either with single or multiple Tinea Pedis lesion(s). Sixty (60) patients will be enrolled,
      but each foot with lesion(s) will be considered as one (1) sample. Therefore, if a patient
      has bilateral lesions, one foot will be allocated to investigational product (Dapaconazole)
      and the other foot will be allocated to active control (Ketoconazole). Randomization will
      determine which foot (right or left) will be treated with Dapaconazole or Ketoconazole.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Male or female subjects, aged between 18 and 60 years-old;

          -  Presence of skin lesion(s) characteristic of Tinea Pedis, with diagnosis confirmed by
             direct mycological exam;

          -  Absence of previous antifungic treatment for the current lesion(s) under study;

          -  Absence of other significant diseases which, at physician's discretion, could have an
             impact on subject's participation in the trial, according to protocol requirements and
             study evaluations: medical history, blood pressure and heart rate, physical
             examination and screening laboratory tests;

          -  Ability to understand the nature and objectives of the trial, including its risks and
             adverse events; willingness to cooperate with the researcher and proceed according to
             all study requirements, which shall be confirmed by Informed Consent Form signature.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Known hypersensitivity to ketoconazole or chemically related compounds; history of
             serious adverse reactions;

          -  Current evidence of clinically significant diseases which, at physician's discretion,
             prevent subject's participation in the trial and/or expose the subject to risks other
             than what is normally expected;

          -  Use of medications that, at principal investigator's discretion, might expose the
             subject to risks other than what is normally expected;

          -  Screening laboratory tests results showing clinically relevant deviations that, due to
             potential risks, prevent participation in the trial, at the researcher's discretion;

          -  Drugs addiction, including alcohol;

          -  Use of any previous treatment to the lesion(s) under study that, according to
             principal investigator's discretion, might interfere with the study objectives;

          -  Treatment, within 3 months before this trial, with any drugs known to have a
             well-established toxic potential to major organs;

          -  Participation in any other experimental research or administration of any experimental
             drug within 6 months before this trial;

          -  Positive pregnancy test, labor or miscarriage within 12 weeks before study treatment;

          -  Any conditions, according to investigator's discretion, that prevent subjects to
             participate in the trial.
