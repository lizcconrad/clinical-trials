    <textblock>
      This research trial studies clinical factors and gene expression analysis for prognosis in
      tissue samples from patients with acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS)-related primary
      effusion lymphoma. Gathering health information over time and studying samples of tissue from
      patients in the laboratory may help doctors learn about the prognosis of patients with
      AIDS-related primary effusion lymphoma.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Identify baseline clinical characteristics and treatment strategies in patients with
      AIDS-associated primary effusion lymphoma (PEL) that correlate with long-term survival (&gt;= 2
      years). (Primary clinical objective) II. Identify differentially expressed genes in PEL that
      are associated with long-term survival (&gt;= 2 years). (Primary genomic objective)

      OUTLINE:

      Medical chart review is performed and patient information is collected regarding human
      immunodeficiency virus human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)/AIDS medical history, staging of
      AIDS related malignancy, and type of treatment. Previously collected tissue samples are
      analyzed via ribonucleic acid (RNA) sequencing and microarray.

    <time_frame>Up to 1 year</time_frame>
    <description>Resultant data will be assessed for quality, normalized and then analyzed for differential gene expression. Standard algorithms will be used in both GeneSpring and Bioconductor for this purpose. In particular, the RNA-sequencing data will be analyzed by the differential expression sequencing algorithm in bioconductor1. Lastly, bioinformatic analysis approaches will be used to help make sense of possible biological links between the genes found to be differentially expressed between the sample groups that may be of prognostic significance.</description>
