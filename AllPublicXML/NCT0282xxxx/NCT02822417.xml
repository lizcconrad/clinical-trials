  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To evaluate the effect of clinical factors on the recovery time of postoperative anesthesia
      and the effect of genetic variation in gDNA on the recovery time of postoperative anesthesia.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Recovery time of postoperative anesthesia is an important index to reflect patient's
      postoperative health status. The investigators want to collect patients' clinical dates and
      their blood samples, then extract DNA from blood samples, acquire every patients' genetic
      variation information. Finally, acquiring the mathematical model of the influence of clinical
      factors and genetic factors on the recovery time after operation, predicting the recovery
      time of anesthesia.
