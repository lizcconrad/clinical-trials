      A prospective, multicenter, open-label, post-approval study of the safety and effectiveness
      of ORBERA™ as an adjunct to weight reduction for obese adults (22 years of age and older)
      with a Body Mass Index (BMI) of ≥ 30 kg/m2 and BMI ≤ 40 kg/m2

      FDA post-approval study designed to demonstrate the safety and effectiveness of ORBERA™ as an
      adjunct to weight reduction for obese adults (22 years of age and older) with a Body Mass
      Index (BMI) of ≥ 30 kg/m2 and BMI ≤ 40 kg/m2. Behavioral modification program in conjunction
      with endoscopic placement of a single ORBERA™ Intragastric Balloon, filled with saline to an
      inflation volume between 400cc and 700cc, for 26 weeks followed by endoscopic ORBERA™
      removal. Outcomes include the mean percent Total Body Weight Loss (%TBWL), changes in weight,
      device and procedure-related AEs and SAEs: gastric ulcers, esophageal injury, placement and
      removal related SAEs, early device removals, and balloon deflations.
