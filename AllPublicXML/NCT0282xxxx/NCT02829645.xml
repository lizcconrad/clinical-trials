  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Eating disorders (ED) are serious mental illnesses with an excess mortality and many affects
      in the quality of life of patients and thier relatives. Management of ED is very difficult :
      the prognosis remains relatively poor both in terms of remission rate and quality of life. In
      this context, the contribution of new strategies for pathophysiological exploration and the
      development of therapeutic options are crucial.

      In this project the investigators aim to constitute un cohort of patients from a day unit
      specialized in the management of ED. A prospective follow-up will be offered to patients to
      assess their clinical and psycho-social evolution. The overall objective is to identify which
      factors are prognostic of clinical improvement of the ED. We also want to better characterize
      patients that will migrate from diagnosis to another.

      The investigators propose to assess, with a cohort of patients with ED the prognostic value
      of cognitive abnormalities associated with ED (cognitive flexibility and central coherence)
      They will recruit 370 patients suffering from a current ED (anorexia, bulimia, binge eating
      disorder, Eating disorder not otherwise specified).

      Each patient will be reassessed every year for 3 years.
