    <textblock>
      Benign prostatic hyperplasia(BPH) is a common disease in urology among old men. If BPH
      symptom cannot be controlled by drugs, then transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP),
      is recommended. Although the procedure is quit safe, these old men often take anticoagulants
      and antiplatelets to control cardiovascular diseases, which arose some concerns for their
      bleeding risk. The management of anticoagulation in patients undergoing surgical procedures
      is challenging because interrupting anticoagulation increases the risk of thrombotic events.
      At the same time, surgery and invasive procedures have associated bleeding risks that are
      increased by the anticoagulant administration. Now, the recommendation about anticoagulants
      and antiplatelets discontinuation had no concrete evidence, especially in TURP. Furthermore,
      there is no relative studies done in Taiwan population, which calls for further
      investigation.
