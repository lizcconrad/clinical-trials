  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A retrospective chart review in which the information in the standard psychosocial
      evaluations done pre-transplant for liver transplant recipients will be coded, recorded, and
      correlated with posttransplant outcomes of the same recipients. Evaluated outcomes include
      rejection episodes and adherence to tacrolimus, calculated through the MLVI (Medication Level
      Variability Index). The researchers will evaluate the degree to which both single elements in
      the evaluation as well as a cumulative score derived by a structured review of the chart
      using the Stanford Integrated Psychosocial Assessment for Transplantation (SIPAT) model can
      predict posttransplant outcomes.

      The research team will perform a chart review and extract data without identifiers from paper
      charts and electronic charts and data tracking system. This data will be obtained from OTTR
      /EPIC as well as paper charts if needed. Those charts will be accessed to obtain demographic
      data (age, gender, income, employment status, marital/relationship status, insurance payer);
      transplant specific data (primary diagnosis, transplant year, tacrolimus blood levels,
      rejection episodes (yes/ no and number of), graft loss (yes/no), re-transplantation (yes/no);
      related medical data (creatinine levels, dialysis dependence (yes/no), ICD diagnoses; and
      psychosocial variables (social worker risk assessment before transplant, presence of social
      and family support, conviction history (yes/no), psychiatric history (diagnoses yes/no).

      Variables will be obtained from the psychosocial pretransplant evaluation write-up (which in
      different years was attached to OTTR or EPIC datasets, or may be present in paper form, and
      from electronic datasets (OTTR / EPIC).

      The data extraction as well as dataset building and data entry will be performed in office
      spaces at ISMMS. No patient contact is anticipated for this study. The predictive model will
      include evaluations of single variables as well as an evaluation of the predictive ability of
      a pre-defined scoring system (the SIPAT) which will be applied to existing data.
