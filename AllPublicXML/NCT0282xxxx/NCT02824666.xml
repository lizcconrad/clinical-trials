      This study involves evaluating the occupancy of ATI-9242 at steady state at three different
      dose levels on D2 receptors in the brain using [18F] Fallypride PET in up to three cohorts of
      subjects.

      This study involves evaluating the occupancy of ATI-9242 at steady state at three different
      dose levels on D2 receptors in the brain using [18F]Fallypride PET in up to three cohorts of
      subjects. The first dose evaluated will be 0.5 mg/kg administered as an IV bolus injection.
      The second dose that will be evaluated will be 1.0 mg/kg as an IV bolus injection. The safety
      and occupancy after each dose level will be evaluated prior to moving to the next dose. On
      two separate days, subjects will undergo [18F]Fallypride PET imaging sessions. The plasma
      concentration of ATI-9242 will be obtained prior to and during the course of the imaging
      session to allow determination of the relationship between plasma concentration of ATI-9242
      with in vivo D2 occupancy.
