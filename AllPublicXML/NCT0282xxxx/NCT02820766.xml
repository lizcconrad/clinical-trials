  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of the study is to determine how the short-term outcome of subjects
      implanted with the JOURNEY™ II BCS Total Knee System compares to subjects implanted with
      other PS total knee systems, and to determine if there is a difference in health care
      resources consumed that may result in economic savings to patients, the facility and/or the
      payer.

      To address the study objectives, patient self-assessment questionnaires, and other objective
      measures of post-operative function and health care resource utilization will be used for
      data collection.
