      The aim of this research project is to compare the use of &quot;Talking Pill Bottles&quot; to usual
      care in patients who have low functional health literacy and who purchase medications for
      primary hypertension at a retail pharmacy with regard to:

        1. feasibility of the procedures,

        2. utility of the equipment,

        3. medication adherence,

        4. self efficacy in medication self management, and

        5. blood pressure control.

      Introduction: Across the healthcare continuum, patients with low functional health literacy
      may have worse outcomes due to difficulties in following prescribed medication regimens.
      While reasons for non-adherence can be drawn from the intra-personal, interpersonal, and
      systemic perspectives; one starting point is the difficulty that patients have reading and
      understanding medication instructions on a prescription bottle labels. Labels can provide a
      vital reminder and decision support aid for patients and healthcare proxies. Yet, skills must
      be available for reading and understanding the labels. The investigators will utilize
      &quot;Talking Pill Bottles&quot; to record prescription medication instructions so that patients can
      re-play the instructions as needed in their homes. Purpose: The aim of this research project
      is to compare the use of &quot;Talking Pill Bottles&quot; to usual care in patients who have low
      functional health literacy and who purchase medications for primary hypertension at a retail
      pharmacy with regard to: a. feasibility of the procedures, b. utility of the equipment, c.
      medication adherence, d. self efficacy in medication self management, and e. blood pressure
      control. Design: This novel intervention will be tested within the context of a retail
      pharmacy in the Pacific Northwest. The pilot test will use a randomized trial design with two
      research arms. Analysis: Within-group change scores on a self efficacy measure and blood
      pressures will be examined with the paired t-test; between group measures will also be
      examined between the two treatment arms. The investigators will also track medication
      complexity as a potential confounder and conduct semi-structured exit interviews. Conclusion:
      Results will help establish the feasibility and utility of providing this technology to
      patients who have low functional health literacy in a retail pharmacy. The investigators will
      gather preliminary descriptive data along with variance and effect size measures for power
      estimations in a future multi-site, randomized controlled trial.
