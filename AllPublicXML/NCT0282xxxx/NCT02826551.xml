      Post-operative pain control following elective anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction
      continues to be a hurdle for orthopaedic surgeons. This obstacle becomes particularly
      problematic during the first 36 hours after the operation, when the patient is experiencing
      pain at its peak intensity. Good control of pain leads to better patient comfort, confidence
      to place weight on the operative limb and improved ability to perform critical exercises in
      this period to improve joint range of motion.

      A variety of anesthetic techniques have been employed to reduce pain including: cryotherapy,
      systemic analgesic and anti-inflammatory drugs, intrathecal, regional blockade of peripheral
      nerves and frequently intra-articular injections. Each technique has been studied at length
      with mixed but overall favorable results. However, in the authors' experience, after femoral
      nerve blockade, patients continue to complain of posterior knee pain in the Post-Anesthesia
      Care Unit (PACU) and peri-operative period. Intra-articular injections comprised of morphine
      and other Na-channel blocker analgesics may curb some of this pain by bathing the posterior
      capsule in anesthetic. However, there is still a large concern amongst orthopaedic surgeons
      about the potential harm these agents may have on the knee's healthy articular cartilage
      surfaces. The long term effects, including chondrolysis have been documented in the shoulder
      and while in the short term this effect is diminished there is still hesitation among
      surgeons to use this form of pain blockade.

      This has led the investigators to adapt a technique of isolated posterior capsular injections
      after total knee replacements from the joint arthroplasty literature, which has shown
      favorable results with low complication risk. The investigators plan to study the
      effectiveness of this technique during ACL reconstruction in an attempt to curb the amount of
      posterior knee pain and decrease the overall narcotic use postoperatively while limiting the
      exposure of the native cartilage to harmful agents.

    <textblock>
      A prospective series of consecutive patients undergoing primary ACLR will be recruited from a
      preoperative log of patients seeing one of two sports medicine fellowship trained surgeons
      within the investigators group. Patients undergoing primary unilateral anterior cruciate
      ligament reconstruction (ACLR) either with bone-patellar bone autograft or Achilles tendon
      allograft will be included by surgeons using similar techniques and fixation options.

      After consenting to participate, subjects will be randomized into one of two groups. Using a
      random number generator, 60 consecutively enrolled patients will be placed in their
      appropriate study arm. (Odd numbers = Control Group) (Even numbers = Experimental Group).
      Only the patient will be blinded to which arm of the study they belong.

      Group 1(Control) patients will undergo routine arthroscopically assisted ACLR surgery with a
      standardized postoperative protocol. Group 2 (Experimental) patients will undergo the same
      procedure with the same postoperative protocols as Group 1, with the addition of the
      posterior capsular injection of 20 cc of Marcaine 0.5%. There are no placebo treatments being
      offered and the surgeons and operating room staff are not blinded to the subjects group.
      Injecting marcaine in this study will be performed in accordance with its standard use
      according to the FDA labeling/guidelines. The physicians will use their discretion as to the
      appropriate location for the injection into the posterior capsule of the knee which should
      bring no additional risks than expected for a knee injection.

      At the conclusion of the case, each patient will receive a dry sterile dressing, followed by
      a compression wrap and a hinged knee brace locked in extension. No drains, pain pumps or
      nerve stimulators will be used. The nurses in the recovery room who will be administering the
      VAS assessment and recording time and frequency of pain medication dosing will be blinded to
      the patients' Group number. The nurses will provide pain medications and the visual analog
      assessment for their duties in the post-op anesthesia unit, and are not administering drugs
      or procedures specifically for research purposes.

      Post-operative Care All patients will be discharged home from the surgery center on the same
      day (within 2-3 hours) postoperatively. Patients will be made weight bearing as tolerated
      with crutches and a brace.

      While in the PACU, at time points 15min and 1 hour, a standardized and previously validated
      visual analog scale (VAS) for pain assessment will be delivered to the patient by the
      recovery room nurse.

      Patients after discharge will then be asked to rate their most severe pain each morning and
      night for 4 consecutive postoperative days using this VAS pain scale. A standardized pain
      medication regimen will be given including: one or two tabs of Percocet 7.5/325mg to be taken
      every 4 to 6 hours as needed. A log of the time and amount of medication taken each POD will
      be kept and recorded by the patients. Patients will also be instructed to use cryotherapy for
      20 min intervals 3 times per day. Patients will also begin on POD 0 the use of continuous
      passive motion machines starting at a comfortable range of motion and progressing 5
      degrees/day as tolerated. Patients will return for their first post-operative visit between
      7-10 days where diaries will be collected and the patient clinically assessed.

      Patient's will also be seen at their three month post-operative visit and be clinically
      assessed for the presence of chondrolysis (a frequently measured outcome during knee pain
      medication injection studies).

      Statistical Analysis Based on previous studies, the Mann-Whitney U test will check
      differences between numeric variables. Nonparametric Kruskal-Wallis tests can compare the
      analgesia level in the two groups and if possible ANOVA test can compare the analgesia
      duration. Chi-square tests will be utilized for any potential complications which will also
      be recorded.

      Power Analysis Prelim Power Analysis per STATS department @ Cedars: sample sizes of 26 for
      each group (N1=N2=26) = Total 52 patients to achieve 80% power to reject the null hypothesis
      of equal means when the population mean difference is 2 with a standard deviation for both
      groups of 2.5 and with a significance level (alpha) of 0.050 using a two-sided two-sample
      equal-variance t-test. A total of 60 patients will be enrolled to ensure the investigators
      achieve adequate power for the study.

      Despite the addition of selective regional blockade by the anesthesia team including femoral
      and saphenous nerve blocks, a portion of patients are still experiencing post-operative knee
      pain within the first few hours to days after the procedure. Pain may be a result of the
      femoral tunnel drilling which theoretically may be relieved by a posterior capsular
      injection. Eliminating this painful period will improve the patient's subjective experience
      undergoing surgery, and may also allow for earlier range of motion and participation in
      rehabilitation strengthening exercises performed by the patient in the peri-operative period.

They will be monitored for pain control and pill intake while in the PACU and the first four days post-operatively the same as the patients in the NO injection Arm of the study.
Marcaine: Pain control medication to theoretically reduce the amount of posterior knee pain that is common after ACL surgery by placing the injection into the posterior capsule of the knee during surgery. This is very easy and safe to accomplish as the surgeon will have direct visualization of the posterior capsule during the surgery.
