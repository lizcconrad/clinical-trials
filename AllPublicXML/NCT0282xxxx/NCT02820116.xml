  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, multicenter, single-arm, phase II interventional clinical trial
      evaluating efficacy and safety of Icotinib as neoadjuvant treatment in patients with IIIA-
      IIIB NSCLC with activating EGFR mutation in exon 19 or 21. Sixty-seven resectable stage IIIA-
      IIIB NSCLC patients with EGFR activating (19/21) mutations will be eligible to be enrolled.
      EGFR mutation will be prospectively tested in all the participants' biopsy samples and
      confirmed in surgical resected samples.

      Neoadjuvant treatment phase:

      Eligible patients will receive 125mg of Icotinib three times per day. Treatment will be
      scheduled to continue until the disease progression or unbearable toxicities appear.

      Surgery treatment phase:

      Tumor response will be evaluated with CT scan after 8 weeks of induction treatment. The
      patients with responsive disease considered to be technique resectable will undergo
      resection.

      Post-surgery phase:

      It is the discretion of the investigator whether the patient is a candidate for
      post-operative treatment which is considered to be in the best interest of the patients. It
      is recommended that patients with positive margins or residual tumor after surgery should
      receive radiation therapy. Patients after surgery will receive long-term follow-up -- chest
      CT scan，abdominal abdominal ultrasound every 3 months, brain MRI every 6 months, bone scan
      (ECT) every 12 months -- for up to 5 years.
