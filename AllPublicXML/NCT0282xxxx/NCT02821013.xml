  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare the effects on patients with metastatic melanoma of
      taking a government approved and paid-for PD-1 inhibitor intermittently, with taking the same
      type of agent continuously. Researchers want to see if the two ways of giving this type of
      treatment work equally well in extending the life of patients with melanoma, or not.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The standard or usual treatment for this disease is to receive treatment with a class of
      agents known as PD-1 inhibitors, or also with the names anti-PD-1 therapy, immunotherapy and
      checkpoint inhibitors. PD-1 inhibitors turn on the immune system, so that it can fight the
      cancer cells in the body. Clinical trials have shown that PD-1 inhibitors (such as
      pembrolizumab and nivolumab) can shrink tumours and extend the life of patients with
      melanoma.

      To-date, PD-1 inhibitors have been given to patients with melanoma continuously (non-stop),
      for as long as they remain beneficial, for up to a total duration of 2 years. The 2 year
      duration was chosen because doctors thought it was reasonable, and has been adopted as the
      standard or usual duration because it was shown to work in clinical trials. However, some
      recent observations suggest that PD-1 inhibitors may work just as well if they are given for
      a shorter time and/or in an intermittent schedule. Intermittent means to take breaks from
      receiving the drug when, and for as long as, the melanoma is better.

      The investigators doing this study are interested to find out whether patients with melanoma
      live as long when the PD-1 inhibitors are given continuously (non-stop) or in an intermittent
      schedule (taking breaks). If the two ways of giving the treatment were to be shown to be just
      as good, benefits of an intermittent schedule may include less clinic visits and side
      effects, better quality of life, and less cost over time for the Health Care System. However,
      this is not known at present.

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Minimum age 18 or as specified in the Product Monograph and eligible for public funding.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Histologically confirmed melanoma that is unresectable / metastatic (stage III or
             stage IV).

          -  Eligible to receive treatment with a government approved and publically-funded PD-1
             inhibitor, according to the guidance / indications described in the Product Monograph
             / Provincial Formulary.

          -  Patients must have evidence of unresectable / metastatic disease, that is considered
             evaluable by the investigator and can be followed, but measurable disease is not
             mandatory.

          -  Patients with brain metastases are allowed, provided they are stable according to the
             following definitions:

               -  Without evidence of progression by for at least four weeks prior to randomization
                  and have no evidence of new or enlarging brain metastases.

               -  Treated with surgery and without evidence of progression prior to randomization
                  and have no evidence or new or enlarging brain metastases.

               -  Treated with stereotactic radiosurgery and without evidence of progression prior
                  to randomization and have no evidence of new or enlarging brain metastases.

                    -  In all cases above, patients should also not be on more than 10mg of
                       prednisone or equivalent.

          -  Patient is able (i.e. sufficiently fluent) and willing to complete the quality of life
             and health utility questionnaires in either English or French. The baseline assessment
             must be completed within required timelines, prior to randomization. Inability (lack
             of comprehension in English or French, or other equivalent reason such as cognitive
             issues or lack of competency) to complete the questionnaires will not make the patient
             ineligible for the study. However, ability but unwillingness to complete the
             questionnaires will make the patient ineligible.

          -  Patient consent must be appropriately obtained in accordance with applicable local and
             regulatory requirements. Each patient must sign a consent form prior to enrollment in
             the trial to document their willingness to participate.

          -  Patients must be accessible for treatment and follow-up. Investigators must assure
             themselves the patients randomized on this trial will be available for complete
             documentation of the treatment, adverse events, and follow-up.

          -  Patients must be randomized prior to the start of, or within 3 weeks from the
             initiation of PD-1 inhibitor treatment. For patients who are being randomized before
             the start of treatment, the PD-1 inhibitor should be started within 5 working days
             after randomization.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients not willing to stop anti-PD-1 therapy, if randomized to the intermittent arm.

          -  Patients with any contraindications to PD-1 inhibitors, as described in the Product
             Monograph or Provincial Formulary, and/or not eligible to receive anti-PD-1 therapy.
