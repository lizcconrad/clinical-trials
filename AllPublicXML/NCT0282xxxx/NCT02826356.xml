  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Specific treatments for angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitor (ACE-I) and
      angiotensin-receptor-blocker (ARB)-induced angioedema exist. Early access to these treatments
      is challenging because they are expensive and have short shelf lives making it illusory that
      all emergency department (ED) stock them. The aim of this retrospective study was to define,
      for each patient with a confirmed ACE-I or ARB-induced angioedema, at which step of the care,
      the specific treatment was administered. The second objective was to analyse the availability
      of these treatment in the area around Lyon, France and the factors that may influence it.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Every patient followed for the first time in our reference center for severe confirmed
             ACE-I or ARB-induced angioedema. Data were analyzed from patients attended either in a
             specialized angioedema consultation or during a hospitalization in our intensive care
             unit.

          -  Severe attack was defined either by its localization over the shoulder or by an severe
             abdominal attack.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        - Patients which received no specific treatment (icatibant, C1-inhibitor concentrate) were
        excluded.
