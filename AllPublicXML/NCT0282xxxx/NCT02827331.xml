  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The question of the inclusion of periods of interruptions and periods unobservable has been
      studied as part of medico-administrative databases. However, the specificity of the health
      insurance databases justify the realization of dedicated methodological research. A thorough
      knowledge of the purpose of these data, how they collect and restitution is an essential
      prerequisite to carry out this work.

      One type of scheme cohort exposed/unexposed led to the formulation of a finding on the basis
      of the comparison between the exposure groups. However, this traditional approach has the
      major drawback of neglecting the changing nature of drug exposure, and therefore fails to
      take into account any changes or interruptions doses. Approaches to take into account the
      time dependent variables were developed. These allow to take into account any interruptions.
      However, as part of study on health databases, sometimes we do not have the status in
      relation to the exhibition on the entire monitoring period. This is for example the case
      during hospitalization. The bias generated by the failure to take account of these periods
      (&quot;non measurable time bias&quot;) can be problematic when a long exposure and chronic disorders
      require hospitalization.
