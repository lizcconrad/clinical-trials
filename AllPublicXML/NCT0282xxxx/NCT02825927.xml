  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether a specific rehabilitation program with oral
      screen used in an elderly population with dysphagia can improve elderly's swallowing
      capacity.

      The present study aims to investigate the effects on swallowing function of a specific
      rehabilitation program with oral screen in the elderly population included. The present study
      is a part of an on-going cross-sectional, descriptive project called SOFIA where
      approximately 400 elderly individuals, admitted to short-term care (from the five
      regions/county Dalarna, Gävleborg, Örebro, Värmland and Västerbotten in Sweden), will be
      included. The purpose of the overall project is to gain a broader understanding of aspects of
      dysphagia, eating, oral health, and quality of life and care among elderly people in
      short-term care facilities.

      In the present study, 35 elderly individuals identified with dysphagia in the overall project
      (swallowing capacity &lt;10ml/sec) and without known dementia will be offered to participate and
      to undergo oral screen training for 5 weeks. The participants' status regarding swallowing,
      eating, quality of life and oral health will be assessed before and immediately after the
      intervention and 6-months post-intervention. A control group (35 people in short-term
      accommodation included in the overall project, identified with dysphagia but not offered the
      intervention) will undergo the same assessments (at start, after 5 weeks, and 6-month
      post-intervention) as the intervention group regarding swallowing, eating, quality of life
      and oral health status.

      Cluster randomisation of short-term accommodation facilities will be made for those patients
      participating from the five regions/county to either intervention group or control group.
      Participants will be recruited consecutively to either the intervention- or the control
      group, depending on which short-term care facility they are staying at.

      The investigators hypothesize that oral screen rehabilitation for elderly individuals with
      dysphagia and with different diagnoses treated in short-term care results in improved
      swallowing capacity.
