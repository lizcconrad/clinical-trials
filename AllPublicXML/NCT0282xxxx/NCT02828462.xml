  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The emergence of oral delivery in cancer therapeutics is expected to result in an increased
      need for better coordination between all treatment stakeholders, mainly to ensure adequate
      treatment delivery to the patient. There is significant interest in the nurse navigation
      program's potential to improve transitions of care by improving communication between
      treatment stakeholders and by providing personalized organizational assistance to patients.
      The use of health information technology is another strategy aimed at improving cancer care
      coordination that can be combined with the NN program to improve remote patient follow-up.
      However, the potential of these two strategies combined to improve oral treatment delivery is
      limited by a lack of rigorous evidence of actual impact.

      The investigators are conducting a large scale randomized controlled trial designed to assess
      the impact of a navigation program denoted CAPRI that is based on two Nurse Navigators and a
      web portal ensuring coordination between community and hospital as well as between patients
      and navigators, versus routine delivery of oral anticancer therapy. The primary research aim
      is to assess the impact of the program on treatment delivery for patients with metastatic
      cancer, as measured by Relative Dose Intensity. The trial involves a number of other
      outcomes, including toxic side effects, patient quality of life and patient experience . An
      economic evaluation adopting a societal perspective will be conducted, in order to estimate
      those health care resources' used. A parallel process evaluation will be conducted to
      describe implementation of the intervention
