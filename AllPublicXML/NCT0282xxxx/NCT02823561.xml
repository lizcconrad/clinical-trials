    <textblock>
      Obesity is one of the greatest public health challenges of the 21st century. Its prevalence
      has tripled in many countries of the European Region since the 1980s, and the numbers of
      those affected continue to rise at an alarming rate. In addition to causing various physical
      disabilities and psychological problems, excess weight drastically increases a person's risk
      of developing a number of noncommunicable diseases including cardiovascular disease, cancer
      and diabetes, in association or not to metabolic syndrome. The risk of developing more than
      one of these diseases (co-morbidity) also increases with increasing body weight. Every year a
      growing number of patient tend to suffer of more severe obesity and difficulty in losing
      weight even with a restricted diet and exercise.

      Garcinia mangostana (Sphaeranthus indicus extract) has known for its antioxidant properties;
      new evidence point out some promising effects in the prevention of lipogenesis and the
      promotion of lipolysis . Currently in the scientific literature there is only one paper, by
      Stern et al., showing the association of Garcinia mangostana assumption in low-calorie diet.
      This work has demonstrated a significant reduction in weight loss , compared to the placebo
      group,due to the use of Garcinia mangostana.

      Aim of the present study is the evaluation of safety and efficacy of weight loss in severe
      obese patients. Also cardiometabolic parameters and flogosys serum indicators will be
      evaluated before and after 6 month therapy of low calory diet alone or in association with
      Garcinia mangostana extract.

      After the screening visit for the evaluation of the inclusion / exclusion criteria and sign
      informed consent(Visit 1), each patient will be randomized (Visit 2; Time 0; Baseline) (1: 1)
      to receive two different treatment for the duration of 26 weeks:

        1. low-calorie balanced diet consistent exercise (control group)

        2. balanced low-calorie diet and regular exercise in combination with the assumption of
           Garcinia mangostana (treatment group)

      Throughout the duration of the study, every eight weeks, unless otherwise indicated from the
      specialists, for each subject was expected a nutritional and an endocrinological visit with a
      anthropometric parameter check (body composition) and compliance to therapy (dietary /
      physical activity diary).

      Also a bood sample test was performed to evaluate electrocardiogram, lipid profile, glucose
      tolerance, hormonal parameters, inflammatory and bone markers.
