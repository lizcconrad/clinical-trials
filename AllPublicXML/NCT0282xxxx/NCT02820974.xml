      There lacks effective early screen system for the migraine-susceptible women during the
      peri-menopause period. The processing of acute pain and cognition as well as the underling
      functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) features are suitable for screening
      pain-susceptible individual. However, there is no study on this issue among the large sample
      peri-menopause women. The investigators thus designed the current trial to investigate the
      processing of acute pain and cognition as well as the underling featured functional magnetic
      resonance imaging (fMRI).The investigators will combine pain behavior,cognitive task, fMRI
      analysis, psychophysiological interaction (PPI) and suitable statistical package to
      investigate the relationship between the above mentioned features and the occurrence of
      migraine and then test the efficacy of these features in predicting migraine development. The
      investigators will then try to establish the screening system for migraine-susceptible
      individuals in peri-menopause women.

      Although the prevalence of migraine is very high during peri-menopause period, there exist
      significant individual differences in whether developing migraine among this population.
      However, there still lacks effective early screen system for the migraine- susceptible women
      during the peri-menopause period. Individual acute pain processing and its interaction with
      cognition as well as the underling featured functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) are
      suitable for screening pain-susceptible individual. Actually, the featured acute pain
      processing and its interaction with cognition as well as fMRI alterations were reported in
      two previous small sample trials among pre-menopause population, however, there is no similar
      study on large sample peri-menopause women. The investigators previously reported abnormal
      acute pain processing and decreased cognition in the experimental peri-menopause rats as well
      as peri-menopause women with migraine. The investigators thus raised the current hypothesis
      that the acute pain processing and its interaction with cognition as well as the underling
      featured functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) are usable for screening
      migraine-susceptible individuals among peri-menopause women. In the current project, The
      investigators will combine pain behavior,cognitive task, fMRI analysis, psychophysiological
      interaction (PPI) and suitable statistical package to investigated the relationship between
      the above mentioned features and the occurrence of migraine and then test the efficacy of
      these features in predicting migraine development. The investigators will then try to
      establish the screening system for migraine-susceptible individuals in peri-menopause women.
