    <textblock>
      The main purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of Apatinib in
      combination with Gefitinib as compared to placebo in combination with Gefitinib in
      participants with stage ⅢB-IV Non-squamous non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) harboring an
      activating epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutation (Del19 and L858R). Safety and
      tolerability of Apatinib in combination with Gefitinib will be assessed in the first portion
      (Part A) before proceeding to the second portion of this study (Part B).

    <measure>(Part A) Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) of Apatinib in Combination With Gefitinib</measure>
    <time_frame>1 months</time_frame>
    <description>MTD was determined by testing increasing doses up to 750 mg daily (qd) on dose escalation cohorts 1 to 3 with 3 patients each. MTD reflects highest dose of drug that did not cause an unacceptable side effect (= Dose Limiting Toxicity (DLT) in more than 30% of patients; e.g., hematologic toxicities like Common Toxicity Criteria (CTC) Grade 4 Neutropenia in specific conditions, platelets &lt; 25,000 cells/mL; specific non-hematologic/biochemical toxicities CTC Grade 3 or 4; additionally, any toxicity considered by the investigator severe enough was designated a DLT); CTC Version 2 were used.</description>
