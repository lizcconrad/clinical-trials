    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the proportion of patients who demonstrate no
      medical need to discontinue therapy among DMT-naïve patients with relapsing forms of multiple
      sclerosis after 1 year of treatment with Rebif 44 mcg tiw or with Tecfidera 240 mg bid based
      on real-world data.

    <description>Number of patients who had no need to discontinue therapy within the first 12months after index date. Unit of measure is number of patients.
No medical need to discontinue therapy is reached if there are no relapses and no new lesions, and no enlarging lesions and the patient did not stop the index medication due to tolerability, adverse events or disease activity. If any of the above occurs, NEDA-2 is not reached.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Diagnosis of Clinically Isolated Syndrome (CIS) or a relapse remitting multiple
             sclerosis (RRMS).

          2. Age between 18 - 55 years at the time of index.

          3. No evidence of prior disease modifying therapy for MS.

          4. Initiated treatment with either Rebif or Tecfidera at the time of index. Patient is
             considered to have initiated treatment if they took at least one dose. Treatment must
             have been initiated after the product was approved by the FDA.

          5. Availability of a high quality baseline MRI brain scan, which must have occurred
             between 6 months prior to the index date to 2 weeks after the index date.

          6. Availability of clinical data in the patient's record for the full study observation
             period, as defined in the primary objective.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Pregnant at any time during the study observation period.

          2. Presence of pre-existing medical conditions known to be associated with brain
             pathology (cerebrovascular and neurodegenerative diseases, presence of active alcohol
             or substance abuse).

          3. Patient discontinued initial therapy prior to completing 1 year of treatment due to a
             reason other than disease activity, tolerability, or safety (e.g. financial,
             convenience, preference, etc.).

          4. Phase III registrational trial patients
