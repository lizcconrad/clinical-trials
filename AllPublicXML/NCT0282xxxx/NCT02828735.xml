      The purpose of the study is to evaluate the use of subcutaneous impedance measured with an
      implanted Medtronic Reveal LINQ™ insertable cardiac monitor (ICM) as respiratory rate
      monitor.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Suspected arrhythmia Diastolic Heart Failure and/or in Renal Failure.

          -  Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) in Stage 5 (GFR = &lt;15 mL/min).

          -  Diastolic Heart Failure in class II and class III (class IV to be considered in end
             stage and non-reversible).

          -  Willing to sign the informed consent form.

          -  Greater than 18 years of age.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Enrolled in another study that could confound the results of this study, without
             documented pre-approval from a Medtronic study manager.

          -  Significant respiratory diseases such as COPD or pulmonary hypertension.

          -  Frequent arrhythmias, including PVC's.

          -  Known systolic heart failure.

          -  Recent infection.

          -  Allergenic or rejection reaction to materials used in incision/insertion tools, Reveal
             LINQ™ ICM exterior or incision closure method.

          -  Active implanted cardiac medical device (e.g. IPG, ICD, CRT, etc).

          -  Not suitable for Reveal LINQ™ implantation (e.g., severe cachexia, dermatologic
             conditions of the skin) or any concomitant condition which in the opinion of the
             investigator would not allow a safe participation in the study.

          -  Body conditions that would complicate accurate measurement of respiratory efforts with
             an external device deployed around the chest.

          -  Not able to take the postures as necessary for the study protocol and not able to walk
             continuously for a period of 6 minutes.

          -  Any concomitant condition which in the opinion of the investigator would not allow a
             safe participation in the study.
