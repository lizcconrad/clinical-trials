  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Twenty patients with PAH had 1 session of Fractionated microneedle radiofrequency treatment.
      Clinical improvement was evaluated using a Hyperhidrosis Disease Severity Scale (HDSS) and
      photographs were taken using the starch-iodine test at every visit and 4 weeks, 8 weeks, and
      24 weeks after the treatment. Skin biopsies were obtained from 3 of the enrolled patients
      before and after treatment. The satisfaction and adverse reactions of the research
      participants were recorded at every follow-up visit.
