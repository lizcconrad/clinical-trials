  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is to compare the safety and effects of donepezil (Aricept) or if it decreases
      memory loss after receiving chemotherapy for breast cancer.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A randomized, placebo controlled, double-blind, parallel group Phase 3 design will be used to
      assess the effect of 24 weeks of donepezil on cognitive function (memory) in breast cancer
      survivors who report having cognitive dysfunction and demonstrate memory impairment 1-5 year
      post chemotherapy. Patients who meet the eligibility criteria will be stratified by age (&lt;50,
      50-59, 60-69, ≥70) and randomized to donepezil or placebo with equal probability.

    <description>Prospective participants will first be asked, &quot;How would you rate the change in your ability to think including remembering, organizing your thoughts and speaking since you were first diagnosed with cancer?&quot; Response choices will be 'No change or better', 'mildly worse', 'moderately worse', 'much worse'. Only if a woman responds with &quot;moderately worse&quot; or &quot;much worse&quot; will she proceed.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>The HVLT-R measures verbal learning and memory. It consists of a 12-item word list which is read to subjects on three successive learning trials. Free recall scores are recorded for each learning trial. Scores for immediate recall (total of three trials), delayed recall (total number of words recalled after 20 minutes), and recognition (total number of words correctly identified) will be the variables derived from the HVLT-R.</description>

    <description>The COWA measures speed of mental processing, verbal fluency, and executive function. Subjects are asked to name as many words as possible all beginning with a specified letter. A total of three trials are administered, each with a different letter (F-A-S). The score on the COWA is the total number of words named across the three trials minus repetitions.</description>

    <measure>Changes in Trail Making Test, Parts A &amp; B (TMT-A, TMT-B) Results</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>Part A of the TMT measures attention and visual motor skills and processing speed and requires subjects to connect 25 numbered circles in the proper sequence (1-2-3-…) as quickly as possible. TMT-B is similar except subjects are required to connect dots in an alternating numerical and alphabetical sequence (1-A-2-B-…). TMT-B with its added complexity and set shifting requirements is a widely used measure of executive function. The score for TMT-A and TMT-B is the total time in seconds required to complete the task. Scores can also be generated for number of errors and number of circles correctly connected.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Women ≥18 years old with history of invasive breast cancer

          -  Must have completed at least 4 cycles of adjuvant/neo-adjuvant cytotoxic chemotherapy
             between 1 and 5 years prior to registration (Ongoing herceptin or other chronic HER 2
             directed therapies are allowed).

          -  Patients receiving ongoing hormonal therapy for breast cancer must be on the same
             hormonal agent for at least 3 months prior to study registration and plan to continue
             for the duration of the study (9 months)

          -  Use of psychotropic medications (anti-depressants, anxiolytics, sleeping aids,
             narcotics) is permitted (patient will be asked to list any that have been taken within
             the last 3 days on the recent medication sheet) if dose is stable over previous 12
             weeks.

          -  Self-reported cognitive problem plus a measured memory deficit (score &lt;7 on single
             trial of Eligibility Pre-screen HVLT-R Form C).

          -  Prior treatment with &gt; 4 cycles of adjuvant/neo-adjuvant cytotoxic chemotherapy

          -  ECOG performance status 0-2

          -  Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document.

          -  Must be able to speak English.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Evidence or suspected recurrent or metastatic disease. Prior brain irradiation is not
             allowed.

          -  Patients may not currently be taking Ketoconazole or Quinidine

          -  History of dementia, Alzheimer's disease, multi-infarct dementia or CVA (history of
             transient ischemic attack (TIA is allowed).

          -  Current use of donepezil, galantamine, rivastigmine, tacrine, memantine,
             methylphenidate, dextroamphetamine, or any other specific cognition enhancing drugs
             are not allowed. For patients who have used these medications they must not have used
             them within 4 weeks prior to registration.

          -  History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic
             composition to donepezil. Hypersensitivity to donepezil.

          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, recent
             myocardial infarction, cardiac arrhythmia.

          -  Traumatic brain injury, multiple sclerosis, acute severe fatigue, chronic fatigue
             syndrome or fibromyalgia.

          -  Psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study
             requirements including but not limited to a history of schizophrenia, psychosis or
             substance abuse.

          -  Untreated current severe depression. Currently treated depression is permitted if
             treatment is stable.

          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study. The effects of donepezil on the
             developing human fetus at the recommended therapeutic dose are unknown. For this
             reason and because donepezil is known to be teratogenic, women of child-bearing
             potential must agree to use adequate contraception (hormonal or barrier method of
             birth control; abstinence) prior to study entry and for the duration of study
             participation. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while
             participating in this study, she should inform her study physician immediately.

          -  It is unknown whether donepezil is excreted in breast milk, for this reason women who
             are currently breast-feeding are not eligible for this study.
