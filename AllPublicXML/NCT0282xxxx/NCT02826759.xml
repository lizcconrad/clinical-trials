  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed to compare the serum sphingolipidomic analyses in healthy,
      pre-diabetic and diabetic subjects. age, sex and BMI are matched among these three groups. As
      ceramide, sphingosine, sphingosine-1-phosphate and sphinganine are involved in inflammation,
      immunity and cancer, investigators proposed a hypothesis that sphingosine-1-phosphate and
      other sphingolipids may be associated with the progress of type 2 diabetes. sphingolipids may
      be a biomarker for diabetes.

      The first purpose of this study is to determine whether serum sphingolipid metabolites
      associate significantly with the weight among type 2 diabetes. 60 patients with diagnosed
      type 2 diabetes will be recruited. The serum concentrations of sphingolipid metabolites of 20
      type 2 diabetic patients with obesity will be compared to age- and sex-matched series of 40
      type 2 patients without obesity.

      The second purpose of this study is to determine whether serum sphingolipid metabolites
      associate significantly with the process and severity of type 2 diabetes. The serum
      concentrations of sphingolipid metabolites of 20 subjects with type 2 diabetes will be
      compared to age-, sex- and BMI-matched series of healthy and pre-diabetic subjects.
      Investigators speculate that the serum concentration of sphingolipid metabolites are
      positively related with the progression of diabetes. In order to discover why serum
      sphingolipid metabolites correlates with the progression of diabetes, detailed information on
      HbA1c, duration of diabetes history and insulin resistance defined by homeostatic model
      assessment (HOMA-IR) will be analysed. These three parameters may affect the serum
      concentrations of sphingolipid metabolites.
