  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      After 13 years of war, PTSD has become pervasive in service members. Traditionally it is
      evaluated by PTSD Checklist Military Version (PCL-M) and treated with cognitive processing
      therapy, prolonged exposure therapy and medication management with limited success.
      Repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) has shown efficacy for improving
      individual cognitive function in the past decades, both in healthy population and in patients
      with depression. TMS has been approved by the FDA in treatment of major depressive disorder
      and migraine headaches. Magnetic EEG guided Resonant Treatment (MeRT) is a form of
      individualized TMS based on member's EEG/ECG input. Investigators propose to use MeRT to
      treat veterans with war-related PTSD, a syndrome that includes depressive and anxious
      symptoms; it is likely that MeRT (namely TMS) will be beneficial and comparable to or better
      than the current FDA approved methods for treating PTSD.

    <description>The double-blind is used during the first 2 weeks. From week 3 and on, the study becomes open label. Subjects in Group I (active MeRT treatment group) will continue receive active MeRT treatment for W3/4; subjects in Group II (placebo/sham group) will receive active MeRT treatment from W3 to W6 for 4 weeks. All subjects will receive 4 weeks active MeRT treatment. The study ends in 8th wk. The data collection points are baseline, weeks of 2, 4, 6, and 8. The data from weeks 1-2 (Phase I) will be utilized to analyze the safety and any effect of MRT procedure may have over placebo. The data from weeks 3 on (Phase II) will be used to address if any benefit of longer MeRT treatment (4 vs 2 weeks). The study design offers both groups 4 weeks of the experimental therapy in a row. This will provide potentially equal benefit to those participants assuming that MeRT helps to improve PTSD symptoms.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Have diagnosis of combat-related PTSD by DSM-V criteria, diagnosed via clinical
             interview by psychologist or psychiatrist (note: combat pilots of remotely piloted
             aircraft are included)

          2. PCL-M score &gt; 45

          3. Age between 18 and 55 years (at day of informed consent)

          4. Willing and able to adhere to the treatment schedule and all required study visits.
