  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is based on the theory of a &quot;unified airway&quot; that considers the nose and paranasal
      sinuses together with lower airways as one integrated unit. The upper and lower respiratory
      tracts function as an interdependent physiologic mechanism, and stimuli that trigger changes
      in one portion of the airway, can provoke similar changes throughout the airway. This is well
      documented in asthmatic patients but documented poorly in patients suffering from chronic
      obstructive lung disease (COPD).

      COPD is associated with sinonasal symptoms and decreased quality of life. Although nasal
      involvement has been found to directly affect the lower airway, sinonasal disease is
      under-diagnosed and under-treated in patients with COPD. This study is embedded in a larger
      project where the goal is to gain knowledge supporting the theory of a &quot;unified airway&quot; in
      patients with COPD.

      Here sinonasal, pulmonary and generic health related quality of life will be studied in a
      group of patients with COPD versus a control group. The severity of nasal airway obstruction
      will be linked to the the severity of pulmonary airway obstruction. Assessment of
      pathological changes in the nose with nasal endoscopy, as well as performing a nasal
      cytological brushing for the identification of nasal inflammatory responses in the nose, will
      be conducted in both the control and study group.
