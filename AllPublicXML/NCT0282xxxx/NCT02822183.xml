  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This online survey presents capnography waveforms and asks the survey participants to give
      feedback about their interpretation of the patient status, both in the form of a score and a
      set of text to describe their interpretation.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The capnography waveforms presented were originally collected from patients in various
      clinical settings, with patients both intubated and non-intubated. The de-identified
      waveforms are presented along with a statement about whether the patients were intubated or
      not, the amount of supplemental oxygen provided, and in some cases, the oxygen saturation of
      hemoglobin in the blood (SpO2). The participants are asked to provide a score between 1 and
      10 to indicate their interpretation of the wellbeing of the patient. The participants are
      also asked to provide up to two sentences of text to describe their interpretation of the
      patient condition based on the information provided.
