  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether the environmental simulation of daytime and
      night time alternation as well as by the nutrition protocol corresponding to the daily rhythm
      are beneficially affect the recovery of patients treated in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU)
      requiring mechanical ventilation.

      The homeostasis of human body is significantly disturbed when organs' work-relax periods are
      not harmonized. Intensive Care Unit (ICU) patient's circadian rhythm is almost inevitably
      upset as a result of their disease and/or medical intervention. There are numerous animal
      studies prove that circadian rhythm and periodic dynamics are directly related to healing
      time and hence, mortality rate. Although, one of the main messengers of circadian
      synchronization is melatonin, it is overridden by temperature, and a number of other factors
      from e.g. the digestive tract. If the circadian rhythm is disturbed, the function of
      different organ systems becomes desynchronized and chaotic.

      ICU environment and patient-care activities brings major drawbacks as well mainly by
      necessary presence of noise and light. It has been shown that ICU settings have an impact on
      patients' sleep, which can easily lead to delirium and circadian disruption. There are
      significant data showing strong correlation between delirium and ICU length of stay/
      mortality.

      The focus of this study is the environmental modulation at the ICU with controlled light,
      noise and nutrition conditions. Controlled light conditions are created with artificial light
      during daytime and sleeping mask during night time. Earplugs are used during night time for
      controlled noise conditions. Nutrition is carried out only during daytime both in case of
      enteral and parenteral feeding.

    <description>The primary efficacy endpoint is the change in MODS scale from baseline to the end of the study treatment period, i.e. deltaMODS. Since the length of ICU stay may be different for subjects, the MODS rate of change per day (deltaMODS/day) will be the primary measure to characterize the treatment effect.</description>

    <description>Purpose: The day-night ratio of the environmental illumination (limit 8 lux) and that of the noise level (limit 20 dBA) must correspond to the necessary value required by a healthy human body as defined by the National Sleep Foundation (USA).
Implementation: Simulation of the daytime period is performed with blue predominant artificial light with colour temperature between 5500 and 8000 K with lux values of 1000-1200 measured at the head of the patient. Simulation of the nighttime period is performed with a sleeping mask and earplugs.</description>

    <description>In compliance with the standard daily nutrition protocol, nutrition is carried out only during daytime both in case of enteral and parenteral feeding in accordance with European Society for Clinical Nutrition and Metabolism 2016 guidelines.
Nutritional regimen should be stopped for 8 hours/24 at night (non-nutritional period may be depending on the work schedule of the actual ICU) , even if the daily energy/protein target is not reached.</description>
