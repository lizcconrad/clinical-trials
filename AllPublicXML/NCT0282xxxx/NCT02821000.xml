  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the safety, tolerability, and objective response
      rate (ORR) of pembrolizumab (MK-3475) in Chinese participants with locally advanced or
      metastatic melanoma, with disease progression following first line chemotherapy or targeted
      therapy. ORR will be based on Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors version 1.1
      (RECIST 1.1).
