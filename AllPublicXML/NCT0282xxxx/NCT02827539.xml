  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to gather information comparing LessRay Enhanced fluoroscopy
      with the current standard of fluoroscopy. This research is being conducted to demonstrate the
      utility and effectiveness of LessRay Enhanced fluoroscopy during surgical placement of a
      spinal cord stimulator epidural array.

      The purpose of this prospective, randomized single center study is to assess the ability of
      LessRay to decrease overall radiation exposure during surgical placement of a spinal
      stimulator. A secondary objective is to analyze the efficacy of utilizing enhanced low
      radiation imaging in a fluoroscopically intensive pain procedure.

      The population group will be 65 patients from Duke University Medical Center and Duke Raleigh
      Hospital who meet the medical criteria for the surgical placement of a spinal cord stimulator
      epidural array. They will be divided equally into 2 arms: Research and Control and randomized
      by a non-surgeon on the study team. That information will be recorded and placed in a sealed
      envelope. On the day of surgery the envelope will be delivered to the OR and opened following
      &quot;time-out&quot;. At the time the envelope is opened in the OR the patient is acknowledged to be
      evaluable for failure or success of LessRay during the surgical procedure if they are in the
      research arm. The control arm cohort will proceed with the surgery as typical without
      LessRay.

      The data from the two groups (Research vs. Control) will be analyzed using a two tailed
      t-test with p&lt;.05. The risks associated specifically with the implementation of this study
      are with respect to loss of confidentiality. Every effort will be made to keep the
      information confidential

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Male or female adults of any ethnicity

          -  At least 18 years-old but without an upper age limit

          -  Subject is willing to provide informed, written consent to participate in this study

          -  Subject meets the medical criteria for surgical placement of a spinal cord stimulator
             epidural array (e.g. not pregnant)

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Less than 18 years of age. For both physicians involved in the study, standard of care
             Spinal Cord Stimulator placement is not done for those patients under 18 years of age
             as the literature does not show that the procedure helps in back pain of this cohort
             of patients

          -  Unable to provide informed, written consent

          -  Pregnant women as pregnancy makes them ineligible to undergo a surgical placement of a
             spinal cord stimulator

          -  Prior placement of a spinal cord stimulator epidural array or previous thoracic spine
             surgery, which could potentially make placement more difficult

          -  Enrollment in another study, which would prohibit participation in this study
