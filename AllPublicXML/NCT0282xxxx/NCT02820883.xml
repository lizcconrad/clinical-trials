        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Healthy volunteers aged 18 to 65 years (aged over 18 and under 66 years).

          -  Able to comply with all clinical trial protocol requirements and willing to complete
             all the visit plan process during the whole clinical trial observation period.

          -  Able to understand the content of informed consent and willing to sign the informed
             consent.

          -  Able to complete the diary card independently.

             practice continuous effective contraception during the study.

          -  Axillary temperature ≤37.0°C.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        First Immunization exclusion standard:

          -  Prior receipt of Staphylococcus aureus vaccine

          -  Any confirmed Staphylococcus aureus infection disease in the past 12 month.

          -  History of asthma, hereditary angioneurotic edema, diabetes, malignancy or other
             serious disease. Participation in the clinical trial is likely to increase the disease
             risk and interfere with the observation of clinical trial index.

          -  Prior blood donation or Blood loss over 400ml in the last 3 months;

          -  Coagulation disorders (coagulation factor deficiency, coagulopathy or platelet
             disorder) diagnosed by doctors, or obvious bruises or blood coagulation noticed.

          -  History of allergic disease likely to be exacerbated by any component of the vaccine,
             including allergy, urticaria, respiratory difficulty, angioneurotic edema or abdominal
             pain.

          -  Any autoimmune disease or immunodeficient state, parents, brother and sister with
             autoimmune disease or immunodeficient disease.

          -  Taking immunoglobulins and/or any blood products within the last 12 months.

          -  Asplenia, functional asplenia or asplenia caused by any situation or splenectomy.

          -  Any acute disease or acute attack of chronic disease in last 7 days.

          -  History of thyroidectomy or thyroid disease requiring treatment in the last 12 months.

          -  Immunosuppressor, cytotoxic therapy, inhaled corticosteroid (excluding corticosteroids
             spray treatment of allergic rhinitis, acute and non-concurrent corticosteroids
             treatment)

          -  Participation in another research study involving receipt of an investigational
             product in the last 30 days.

          -  Woman who is breast-feeding.

          -  Prior administration of attenuated vaccine in last 28 days.

          -  Prior administration of subunit vaccine, inactivated vaccine or allergic therapy in
             last 14 days.

          -  Current anti-tuberculosis prophylaxis or therapy

          -  Any other conditions may compromise the safety or availability of participants in the
             judgment of the investigator.

        Following Immunization exclusion standard:

          -  Any grade 3 or more serious adverse reaction happen since the last vaccination.

          -  Other condition violates the inclusion criteria or meets the exclusion criteria is
             noticed after the first immunization.

          -  Acute or chronic infections at the vaccination day (axillary temperature＞37.0°C).

          -  According to the investigator, the participant should not continue participating in
             the study.
