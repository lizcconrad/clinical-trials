  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the pharmacokinetics (PK), safety and
      tolerability following single oral administration of ascending doses of odalasvir (ODV) in
      healthy Japanese participants (Panel 1) and to investigate the PK, safety and tolerability
      following single oral administration of ascending doses of AL-335 in healthy Japanese
      participants (Panel 2; Sequential Design).

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Participant must be a Japanese participant who has resided outside Japan for no more
             than 5 years and whose parents and grandparents are Japanese as determined by
             participant's verbal report

          -  Participant must have a body mass index (BMI: weight in kilogram [kg] divided by the
             square of height in meters) of 18.0 to 30.0 kilogram per meter square (kg/m^2),
             extremes included and a body weight not less than 50.0 kilogram (kg)

          -  Participant must be healthy on the basis of physical examination, medical history,
             vital signs, and 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) performed at Screening. If there are
             abnormalities, the participant may be included only if the Investigator judges the
             abnormalities or deviations from normal to be not clinically significant. This
             determination must be recorded in the participant's source documents and initialed by
             the Investigator

          -  Participant must have a blood pressure (after the participant supine for 5 minutes)
             between 90 and 140 millimeter of mercury (mmHg) systolic, inclusive, and no higher
             than 90 mmHg diastolic. If blood pressure is out of range, up to 2 repeated
             assessments are permitted

          -  Female participant must agree to not donate eggs (ova, oocytes) for the purpose of
             assisted reproduction during the study and for a period of 60 days (Panel 1) or 30
             days (Panel 2) after study drug administration or until the last follow-up visit,
             whichever occurs later

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Participant has a history of liver or renal insufficiency (estimated creatinine
             clearance below 80 milliliters per minute [mL/min]); significant cardiac, vascular,
             pulmonary, gastrointestinal (such as significant diarrhea, gastric stasis, or
             constipation that in the Investigator's opinion could influence drug absorption or
             bioavailability), endocrine, neurologic, hematologic, rheumatologic, psychiatric,
             neoplastic or metabolic disturbances

          -  Participant has any condition for which, in the opinion of the Investigator,
             participation would not be in the best interest of the participant (for example,
             compromise the well-being) or that could prevent, limit, or confound the
             protocol-specified assessments

          -  Participant with a past history of heart arrhythmias (for example, extra systolic
             beats or tachycardia at rest); risk factors associated with Torsade de Pointes such as
             hypokalemia or family history of short/long QT syndrome or sudden unexplained death
             (including sudden infant death syndrome) in a first-degree relative [for example,
             sibling, offspring, or biological parent])

          -  Participant with any history of clinically significant skin disease such as, but not
             limited to, dermatitis, eczema, drug rash, psoriasis, food allergy, or urticaria

          -  Participant has known allergies, hypersensitivity, or intolerance to odalasvir (ODV)
             or AL-335 or its excipients
