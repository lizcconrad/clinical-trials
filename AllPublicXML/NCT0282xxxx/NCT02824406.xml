  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary aim of this study is to evaluate MRI-based cerebrovascular reserve (CVR)
      measurements in adult patients with Sickle Cell Disease (SCD).

      The primary objective is to assess whether there is a correlation between CVR and silent
      cerebral infarcts (SCIs).

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      CVR is hypothesized to be impaired in SCD patients and could account for the white matter
      hyperintensities seen on MRI in these patients. Cerebral blood flow (CBF) alone is not
      sufficient to provide insight into the hemodynamic status of the brain. CVR allows us to gain
      insight into the capacity of the cerebrovasculature to respond to increased CBF. Vasculopathy
      is common in SCD and the caliber of the vessels can be assessed with 4D Flow MRI in response
      to actue and chronic changes in the velocity and wall shear stress on the intracranial
      arteries in the Circle of Willis.

      This study will be performed as a single center, patient-control, cross-sectional,
      observational study in patients with steady-state SCD and controls. The investigators expect
      that patients with impaired CVR will have a greater number and/or volume of SCIs.

    <description>Cerebral blood flow (CBF mL/100g/min) measurement before, during, and after, an intravenous administration of 16mg/kg acetazolamide. The percentage change in CBF will be used as a measure for CVR (%).</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Cerebral Metabolic Rate of Oxygen in patients and controls</measure>
    <time_frame>2 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>Oxygen extraction fraction and cerebral blood flow are proportional to the cerebral metabolic rate of oxygen. Using the CBF from the primary outcome, and having measured the T2 of blood (which is dependent on oxygen), we can derive the oxygen extraction fraction, which allows us to calculate the cerebral metabolic rate of oxygen (CMRO2) and compare patients with controls.</description>
