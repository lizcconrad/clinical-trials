  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic low back pain (CLBP) afflicts up to 50 million U.S. adults and is a primary cause of
      disability and reduced quality of life. The prescription of opioids for chronic low back pain
      (CLBP) has increased substantially within the past decade in the U.S. As noted by the CDC in
      their recent Guideline (released in March 2016): &quot;Opioids are commonly prescribed for pain.
      An estimated 20% of patients presenting to physician offices with noncancer pain symptoms or
      pain-related diagnoses (including acute and chronic pain) receive an opioid prescription.
      Interestingly, patients scoring very high on measures of psychological distress tend to be
      systematically excluded from RCTs, even though this subgroup of patients is highly prevalent
      within the chronic pain population.

      This study will provide key information on individual differences in the outcomes of opioid
      treatment, and its findings should facilitate more effective tailoring of analgesic regimens
      to individual patient characteristic.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Changes in pain sensitivity will be examined (i.e., OIH) among subgroups of CLBP patients
      prescribed oral opioid therapy.

      Investigators will conduct a moderate-term, double-blind, randomized controlled trial, and
      use quantitative sensory testing (QST) to evaluate whether changes in pain sensitivity and
      pain modulation occur as a result of long-term opioid use. Investigators hypothesize that
      increases in pain sensitivity (i.e., OIH) and maladaptive changes in endogenous pain
      modulation (i.e., enhanced temporal summation of pain) will occur as a result of long-term
      opioid use, but that these changes will be observed predominantly among patients with high
      levels of negative affect and pain-related catastrophizing.
