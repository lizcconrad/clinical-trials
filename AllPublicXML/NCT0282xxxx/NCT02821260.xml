  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Pediatric Neurosurgery Service of the Rothschild Foundation (Paris) is the French leader
      center for surgery of epilepsy in infants and children.

      Postoperative follow-up of these children is performed during medical and neurosurgical
      consultations in order to assess the frequency of attacks and to reduce medication.

      On average, two postoperative consultations are carried out between 3 and 5 months and
      between 12 and 18 months. Beyond 18 months, some children may benefit from long-term
      monitoring at this center, but most children are followed by their neurologist .

      Therefore, the center has no rigorous and systematic collection of standardized data on the
      outcome of these patients.

      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of the epilepsy surgery in children
      with a monitoring of 3 years.
