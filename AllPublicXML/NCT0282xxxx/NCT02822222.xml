  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety of RMJH-111b, including how well it is
      tolerated, and the effect of RMJH-111b on blood pressure in subjects with hypertension. The
      study will also measure the amount of magnesium in the blood and urine before and after
      RMJH-111b administration to evaluate what the body does to RMJH-111b (pharmacokinetics).

    <textblock>
      This is a phase 1/2, single center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of
      RMJH-111b in adult subjects with essential hypertension.

      Subjects will be taken off their anti-hypertensive medications and undergo a 7-day washout
      period. Subjects that remain eligible after the washout period and subjects that do not
      require a washout (recently diagnosed or previously diagnosed and off treatment for &gt; 1 week
      before starting the study) will receive placebo orally twice a day (bid) for a 3-day run-in
      period.

      Subjects that remain eligible after the run-in period will be randomized 15:6 (for at total
      of 21 randomized subjects) to receive either 440 mg of RMJH-111b or placebo orally bid for a
      7-day treatment period. Follow-up assessments will be performed 24 hours and 7 days after the
      last dose of study drug.

      Subjects will remain in the clinical research unit on a low salt (2.5 g/24 hours) diet for
      the run-in period through the 24-hour post treatment assessments.
