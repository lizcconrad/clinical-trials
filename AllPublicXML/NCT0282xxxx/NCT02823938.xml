  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In France, a person consumes an average of 48 boxes of medicines per year (ANSM 2012). Among
      these substances, some, not prescribed in an indication related to cognitive function,
      however, will influence thereon.

      Several drug candidates with potential preventive effects have already been explored with
      little success (statins, antihypertensives, NSAIDs, aspirin, steroid hormones). Other studies
      have suggested the existence of deleterious cognitive effects of certain substances
      (benzodiazepines, anticholinergics, anti-cancer chemotherapy). However, only the effects of a
      limited number of drugs were analyzed, and most drugs have not been specific study in
      epidemiology.

      The study of this research theme has often been restricted by the limited size of the cohort
      of staff, not allowing the study of sometimes rare drug exposures, and poverty of the
      information collected on drug exposures. Thus, most studies focuses on families of molecules
      among the most prescribed. In addition, we now know that the pathophysiological process
      underlying Alzheimer's disease (representing 2/3 of dementia), actually begins more than 10
      years before the diagnosis of dementia. It is therefore essential to have a setback of
      several years between drug exposure and diagnosis of dementia to assess their role in the
      genesis and evolution of the disease.

      The Generalist Sample Beneficiaries (EGB) is a database containing data of health insurance
      and those of medicalization program of information systems (PMSI) for a sample of 550 000
      subjects enrolled in the general scheme of the insurance since 2004 and followed for a period
      of 20 years.
