  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      GSK1358820 is a botulinum neurotoxin A complex that has been approved for the treatment of
      overactive bladder (OAB) in several countries, however, it has not been approved for OAB
      treatment in Japan. This study has been planned to evaluate the efficacy and safety of
      GSK1358820 in Japanese OAB patients with urinary incontinence whose symptoms have not been
      adequately managed with other medications for OAB.

      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the superiority of a single dose treatment
      of GSK1358820 100 units (U) compared with placebo.

      The study comprises a screening phase up to 28 days, followed by a double-blind treatment
      phase of 12 to 48 weeks wherein subjects will receive a single treatment of either GSK1358820
      100 U injection or Placebo injection, in a ratio of 1:1, with further stratification within
      the treatment arms according to the number of urinary urge incontinence episodes during
      screening. Subjects meeting the criteria for re-treatment will receive a second and third
      treatment. Each re-treatment will be with open-label GSK1358820 100 U injection, and will be
      spaced at least 12 weeks from the previous treatment.

      The total duration of participation for any subject will not exceed 52 weeks, including
      screening and the 48-week treatment period.

             and restrictions listed in the consent form and in this protocol (example, using the
             toilet without assistance, complete bladder diaries and questionnaires, is able to
             collect volume voided per micturition measurements over a 24-hour period, and attend
             all study visits in the opinion of the investigator (or subinvestigator).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subject has symptoms of OAB due to any known neurological reason (example, spinal cord
             injury, multiple sclerosis, cerebrovascular accident, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's
             disease, etc.)

          -  Subject has a predominance of stress incontinence determined by subject history.

          -  Subject has a history or evidence of any diseases, functional abnormalities or bladder
             surgery, other than OAB, that may have affected bladder function including but not
             limited to:

               1. Bladder stones (including bladder stone surgery) within 6 months prior to
                  screening or confirmed occurrence of bladder stones at the screening phase

               2. Surgery (including minimally invasive surgery) within 1 year of screening for

               3. Current use of an electrostimulation/neuromodulation device for treatment of
                  urinary incontinence. Note: Use of any implantable device is prohibited within 4
                  weeks prior to initiation of screening phase and throughout the study period. Use
                  of any external device is prohibited within 7 days prior to the start of the

                  subinvestigator)

               5. Past or current evidence of hematuria due to urological/renal pathology or
                  uninvestigated hematuria. Subjects with investigated hematuria may enter the

                  positive result of urine cytology or uninvestigated suspicious urine cytology
                  results at the Screening phase. Suspicious urine cytology abnormalities require
                  that bladder cancer or other urothelial malignancy has been ruled out to the
                  satisfaction of the investigator according to local site practice.

                  practice.

               9. Evidence of urethral and/or bladder outlet obstruction, in the opinion of the
                  investigator (or subinvestigator)

          -  Subject has a history of 2 or more urinary tract infections (UTIs) within 6 months of

             screening.

          -  Subject has current active liver or biliary disease (with the exception of Gilbert's
             syndrome or asymptomatic gallstones or otherwise stable chronic liver disease per
             investigator assessment). Notes:

               1. Stable chronic liver disease should generally be defined by the absence of
                  ascites, encephalopathy, coagulopathy, hypoalbuminemia, esophageal or gastric
                  varices, or persistent jaundice, or cirrhosis

               2. Chronic stable hepatitis B and C (example, presence of hepatitis B surface
                  antigen [HBsAg] or positive hepatitis C antibody [HCVAb] test result within 3
                  months prior to first dose of study treatment) are acceptable if subject
                  otherwise meets entry criteria

          -  QT corrected (QTc) &gt; 450 milliseconds (msec) or QTc &gt; 480 msec in subjects with Bundle
             Branch Block from the result of electrocardiogram (ECG) at screening. Notes:

               1. The QTc is the QT interval corrected for heart rate according to Bazett's formula
                  (QTcB), Fridericia's formula (QTcF), and/or another method, machine-read or
                  manually over-read

               2. The specific formula that will be used to determine eligibility and
                  discontinuation for an individual subject should be determined prior to
                  initiation of the study. In other words, several different formulae cannot be
                  used to calculate the QTc for an individual subject and then the lowest QTc value
                  used to include or discontinue the subject from the trial

          -  Subject has been immunized for botulinum toxin of any serotype.

          -  Subject cannot withhold any antiplatelet or anticoagulant therapy or medications with
             anticoagulative effects for 3 days prior to initiation of Treatment phase 1 (Week 0).
             Some medications may need to be withheld for &gt;3 days, per clinical judgment of the
             investigator (or subinvestigator).

          -  Subject has not initiated appropriate antibiotic medication 1 to 3 days prior to the
