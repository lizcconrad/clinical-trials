  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this observational study is to describe the prevalence of pruritus
      and pemphigoid in nursing home patients. Secondary outcomes are the relationships of
      demographic factors and medical risk factors with pemphigoid, including dementia and
      neuropsychiatric symptoms, medication use and Karnofsky score.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Pruritus or itch is the most common skin symptom in elderly patients and is estimated to
      affect more than 30% of nursing home patients. Clinical and experimental evidence suggests
      pruritus in elderly patients may be linked to pemphigoid. Pemphigoid is the most common
      autoimmune skin blistering diseases and mainly affects the elderly. It is successfully
      treatable with systemic therapy. However, pemphigoid is often missed as a cause of pruritus
      in elderly patients (nonbullous cutaneous pemphigoid). Although nursing home patients and
      patients with dementia in particular have the highest risk for development of pemphigoid, no
      study has been performed in this population so far. Including serological screening for
      pemphigoid in the diagnostic evaluation of chronic pruritus in nursing home patients may lead
      to the diagnosis of pemphigoid. Furthermore, chronic itch may be an unrecognized cause of
      neuropsychiatric symptoms in nursing home patients with dementia.
