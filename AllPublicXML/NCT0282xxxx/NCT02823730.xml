      To compare the incidence of major adverse cardiac events among a series of patients receiving
      the Synergy drug-eluting stent with bioabsorbable polymer to historical controls who have
      received the Promus Premier drug-eluting stent with durable polymer.

      The primary objective of this observational, real-world single-center registry is to compare
      the incidence of major adverse cardiac events among a series of patients receiving the
      Synergy drug-eluting stent with bioabsorbable polymer to historical controls who have
      received the Promus Premier drug-eluting stent with durable polymer. The investigators
      hypothesize that the long-term incidence (each year following implantation, up to 4 years) of
      major adverse cardiovascular events, after propensity matching for stent type, will be
      similar between Synergy and Xience V.

        This is a single-center, observational, retrospective registry of 500 patients who have
        received the Synergy stent. Data will be mined from the DES registry database for the
        identified Synergy patients at the following time points, in-hospital and then at 1 year, 2
        years, 3 years, and 4 years after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI).

        The 500 patients that underwent PCI with a Synergy stent will then be compared to a
        propensity matched Xience V cohort eligible for similar time points of follow up following
        the PCI.
