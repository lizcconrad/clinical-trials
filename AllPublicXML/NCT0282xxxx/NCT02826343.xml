  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      First, the investigators will image patients with hyperpolarized xenon (Xe) magnetic
      resonance imaging (MRI) to develop the technique of hyperpolarized xenon MRI at the
      University of Virginia (UVA). Magnetic Resonance (MR) sequences will need to be developed and
      optimized for the equipment at UVA. These sequences will need to be evaluated in healthy
      adults for comparison with results obtained and in adults with lung diseases to optimize the
      sequences for the detection and evaluation of lung diseases. The MR pulse sequences need to
      be optimized for the parameters of a human MR coil and the gas exchange characteristics in
      healthy and diseased lungs.

      Second, the investigators propose to exploit the power of Xe129 MRI as a diagnostic tool to
      monitor therapeutic responses of a combination inhaler, Advair, which contains a long-acting
      beta-adrenoceptor agonist (LABA) and an inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) - two major classes of
      the current COPD therapeutics. The investigators will characterize the functional changes of
      the lungs with COPD at baseline, and investigate the responses of the lungs to the treatment
      after a three-month trial. Also the investigators will compare corresponding results obtained
      by Xe129 dissolved phase (DP) MRI to the results obtained by gadolinium-based dynamic
      contrast-enhanced perfusion MRI (perfusion MRI) and high resolution computed tomography
      (HRCT) of the lung to indirectly validate the Xe129 DP MRI technique. The investigators
      anticipate that the results from this project will greatly improve the investigators
      understanding of the lung functional responses of COPD subjects to current therapeutics.
      Also, the investigators expect that this project will provide evidence to consider Xe129 MRI
      as a diagnostic strategy to assess and monitor therapeutic responses of existing and new
      pharmaceuticals, and thus Xe129 MRI will stimulate development of novel therapies for COPD in
      the future
