      The purpose of this Phase 2a study is to assess changes in tear volume by the non-invasive
      techniques Ultra High Resolution Optical Coherence Tomography (UHR-OCT) following the
      administration of P-321 Ophthalmic Solution or Placebo in subjects with tear deficient dry
      eye disease.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-center, randomized, cross-over placebo controlled study to evaluate the
      changes in tear volume by P-321 Ophthalmic Solution and Placebo. The study will enroll
      subjects with tear deficient dry eye disease to receive sequentially one of two treatment
      sequences: P-321 Ophthalmic Solution then Placebo or Placebo then P-321. The study will
      consist of two Phases: In each Phase, subjects will be treated with P-321 Ophthalmic Solution
      under the same study design.

      Approximately twenty-four eligible subjects will complete the study with approximately 8
      subjects participating in Phase 1 and the remainder of the 24 subjects participating in the
      phase 2. Decisions on the dose to be used in Phase 2 will be made based on Phase 1 data.

      The study will consist of three study visits: a Screening Visit (Visit 1), and two treatment
      visits (Visit 2 and Visit 3). The primary and secondary outcome measures will be assessed at
      each treatment visit. Safety assessments include adverse events (AEs).

      <desc>An AE was defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a subject or clinical investigation subject administered a pharmaceutical product, which did not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with this treatment. A treatment-emergent AE (TEAE) was an AE that either commenced following initiation of study treatment or was present prior to study treatment but increased in frequency or severity following initiation of study treatment.</desc>
