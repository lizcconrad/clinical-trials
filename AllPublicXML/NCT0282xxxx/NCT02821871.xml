    <textblock>
      All eligible subjects were randomly assigned to group A and group B sequences, each sequence
      has 12 subjects. The SP2086 were given limosis,then after the meal,then limosis.In the study
      ,the investigators collected the blood samples,urine samples and fecal samples to analyze.
