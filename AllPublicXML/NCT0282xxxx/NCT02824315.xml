    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the steady-state pharmacokinetics (PK) of
      simeprevir (SMV), odalasvir (ODV) and AL-335 (and its metabolites ALS-022399 and ALS 022227),
      when these drugs are co-administered in healthy Japanese participants.

             pulmonary, gastrointestinal (such as significant diarrhea, gastric stasis, or
             constipation that in the Investigator's opinion could influence drug absorption or
             bioavailability), endocrine, neurologic, hematologic, rheumatologic, psychiatric,
             neoplastic, or metabolic disturbances

          -  Participant with a past history of heart arrhythmias (example- extra systolic beats or
             tachycardia at rest); risk factors associated with Torsade de Pointes such as
             hypokalemia or family history of short/long QT syndrome or sudden unexplained death
             (including sudden infant death syndrome) in a first degree relative [example- sibling,
             offspring, or biological parent])

          -  Participant with any history of clinically significant skin disease such as, but not
             limited to, dermatitis, eczema, drug rash, psoriasis, food allergy, or urticaria

          -  Participant has known allergies, hypersensitivity, or intolerance to simeprevir (SMV),
             odalasvir (ODV), AL-335 or their excipients
