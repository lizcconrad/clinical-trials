  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Suicide is a major health problem that causes annually a million death worlwide. In the
      stress-vulnerability model, suicidal behavior (SB) results from the interaction between an
      individual's predisposition (personality, family history of SBâ€¦) and stressful conditions
      (early life adversity).

      Studies show that suicide ideations could favour inflammation and that depression is
      associated with an elevated inflammation.

      Recent evidences also suggest that inflammatory mediators play a critical role in SB.

      The aim of the study is to evaluate the inflammatory markers rate on depressed patients with
      or without personal history of SB.

      In the second part of the study, the relations between the rates of inflammatory markers and
      characteristics of SB, impulsivity, psychological pain, childhood abuse and gene expression
      of 5HT2B receptor will be investigated.

      Over one year, we will recruit 280 patients suffering from a major depressive episode with
      (n=140) and without any history of suicide attempt (n=140), from a specialized clinic for
      mood disorders and SB.

      First visit : clinical, biological and neuropsychological assessment

      Second visit, at 6 month : Follow-up visit in the department or interview by telephone in
      order to assess suicidal ideations or suicide attempts since the inclusion.
