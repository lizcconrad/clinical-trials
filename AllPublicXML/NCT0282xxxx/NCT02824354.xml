  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Nalmefene is the first drug to obtain Marketing Authorisation in France for reduction of
      alcohol consumption. It appears to be significantly more effective in the group of heavy
      drinkers, while the mean alcohol consumption in studies conducted in cirrhotic patients is
      greater than 120 g/day.

      No data are available concerning nalmefene in alcohol-dependent patients with alcoholic
      cirrhosis. However, nalmefene could represent an attractive alternative to reduce heavy
      drinking in patients with alcoholic cirrhosis, with potential improvement of liver function.
      No comparator is available for nalmefene, as all other molecules require abstinence prior to
      starting treatment.

    <description>Drug : 'Nalmefene (Selincro®) 18 mg tablet is a white, oval, biconvex, 6.0 x 8.75 mm film-coated tablet engraved with &quot;S&quot; on one side. It contains 18.06 mg nalmefene (in the form of hydrochloride dihydrate).
Nalmefene must be taken as-needed: on each day the patient perceives a risk of drinking alcohol, one tablet should be taken, preferably 1-2 hours prior to the anticipated time of drinking. If the patient has started drinking alcohol without taking nalmefene, the patient should take one tablet as soon as possible.
The maximum dose of nalmefene is one tablet per day. Nalmefene can be taken with or without food.</description>
