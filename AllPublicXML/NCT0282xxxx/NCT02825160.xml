      This study is collecting post-marketing information on the safety and effectiveness of
      Ventavis under the routine clinical practice for patients with PAH

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This local, prospective, non-interventional, company sponsored, multi-center, single-cohort
      study includes patients treated with Ventavis for PAH. A total of 270 patients (valid for
      safety analysis) is planned to be enrolled in 5 years. Target population is patients with PAH
      diagnosis. This study is performed as an all-patient investigation, therefore all patients
      who receive Ventavis treatment for PAH need to be registered. The treatment should be
      performed based on the product label in Japan. The standard observation period will last for
      12 months from starting Ventavis treatment. In addition, the extension observation will be
      carried out as long as Ventavis treatment continues or at most for more 4 years. The standard
      observation points are 3 month and

      1 to 5 years.

        Study population includes PAH patients treated with Ventavis. This study is performed as an
        all-case investigation. Therefore, all patients who have been treated with Ventavis for PAH
        need to be registered in principle, until the target number of patients reached.
