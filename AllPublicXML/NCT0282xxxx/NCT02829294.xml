  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, open-labeled clinical trial. Subjects that qualify for enrollment and
      provide informed consent will be treated with a novel topical cerumen (earwax) removal
      product. The primary goal of this pilot study is to gain an understanding of the safety and
      efficacy of this novel product.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a single center, single-arm, open-label trial. Approximately 30 evaluable ears will
      be enrolled that have at least 50% cerumen impaction. All ears/subjects will receive at least
      a single dose (approximately 1 - 2 mL) of the test product applied topically in the study ear
      canal. The test product will be supplied from a qualified compounding pharmacy that receives
      a by-subject prescription from the investigator. The subject will be dosed with the head
      tilted in order to keep the test product in the ear canal for 15 minutes. At 5 and 10
      minutes, subjects will be instructed to move their jaw up and down (and side to side) a few
      times and, manipulate/massage the ear canal by pressing between jawbone and ear lobe with a
      rotating motion for 10 seconds, which may aid in distribution of the test product in the ear
      canal. Fifteen minutes after product instillation, it will be removed by having the subject
      tilt the head over a disposable container to catch the solution. The ear canal will be
      irrigated (low pressure) with warm water and, the evaluator will try to visualize the
      tympanic membrane using an otoscope (before and after lavage). The amount (change in area,
      volume and depth) of the tympanic membrane that can be visualized and the categorization of
      cerumen impaction (according to a 5 point scale) is the primary efficacy parameter of this
      study. Efficacy will also be assessed using subjective questions (improvement and change in
      symptoms) that will be asked by the study staff and documented prior to the subject having
      any knowledge of the otoscope results (visualization of TP).

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Males or non-pregnant females â‰¥ 40 years of age at enrollment;

          2. Presence of excessive or impacted cerumen [excessive or impacted cerumen is identified
             as causing partial (&gt; 50%) or complete occlusion of at least one ear canal when
             attempting to visualize the tympanic membrane];

          3. Willingness to participate in the study; or

          4. Mental aptitude to provide verbal and/or written informed consent without the aid of
             another.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Pregnant, breastfeeding, or unwilling to practice birth control during participation
             in the study (has been accustomed to birth control and will continue it up to and
             including Visit 2);

          2. Presence of a tympanostomy tube at any time during the previous 12 months;

          3. Presence of a non-intact tympanic membrane (TM);

          4. Presence of a known or suspected ear infection;

          5. Presence of known or suspected mastoiditis;

          6. Use of any ototopical drug or OTC product or earwax-removal product (with the
             exception of water or physiologic saline) during the preceding 3 days; or

          7. Presence of a condition or abnormality that in the opinion of the Investigator would
             compromise the safety of the patient or the quality of the data (e.g. ear eczema or
             seborrhea).
