  <brief_summary>

      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of Radiopaque Microsphere
      (T-ACE Beads) interventional therapy for liver cancer
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will evaluate the safety and tolerability of Taiwan ACE Beads used for
      chemoembolization for the treatment of unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma.

      The investigators will study the overall response rates of lesions with Taiwan ACE Beads. In
      this study, the procedure is similar with conventional TACE (transcatheter arterial
      chemoembolization). At the target vessels, radiologists will inject lipiodol with doxorubicin
      first, then Taiwan ACE Beads instead of Gelfoam or PVA (polyvinyl alcohol). The end point of
      injection is also similar with conventional TACE.

      Determine the complication rates, progression free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS)
      following Taiwan ACE Beads embolization.

        to accept any operation.

        D. Disease can be treated by transarterial chemoembolization, and can be evaluated by
