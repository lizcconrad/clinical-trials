  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Rationale: Regular physical activity and aerobic exercise training are related to decreased
      cardiovascular mortality in healthy individuals, as well as in individuals with
      cardiovascular risk factors and cardiac patients. Unfortunately, no such data is available on
      exercise training in adult patients with congenital heart disease.

      Objective: The objective of the ExTra GUCH trial is to assess whether encouragement of a
      six-month sports participation program in addition to usual care in symptomatic adult
      patients with congenital heart disease improves exercise capacity and quality of life, and
      lowers serum N-terminal prohormone brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) levels.

      Study design: International, multi-centre parallel randomized controlled trial.

      Study population: Adult patients with congenital heart disease, who are in New York Heart
      Association (NYHA) class II or III.

      Intervention (if applicable): The intervention group receives a six-month individualized
      exercise training program, the control group receives usual care.

      Main study parameters/endpoints: The primary outcome is the change in peakVO2 between
      patients in the sports participation group, and the control group. Secondary outcome measures
      are change in NYHA functional class, quality of life, and NT-proBNP levels. The primary
      safety outcome is the composite of all hospitalizations, and all deaths during, or within
      three hours after exercise. The secondary safety outcome is the composite of all exercise
      related injuries for which medical attention is sought.
