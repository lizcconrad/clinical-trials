      Primary objectives:

        -  To assess how dengue vaccine efficacy varies across participant subgroups regarding
           polymorphism in human leukocyte antigen (HLA) alleles of interest.

        -  To assess the association between HLA alleles and, serotype-specific neutralization
           antibody titers and summary neutralization measure in the vaccine and placebo groups.

        -  To assess the association between the polymorphism in HLA alleles of interest and
           susceptibility to Dengue fever and Dengue Haemorrhagic fever.

      Secondary objectives:

        -  To assess whether dengue serotype-specific neutralizing antibody titers and associated
           summary neutralization measure at 28 days post-dose 3 are related to the rate of
           occurrence of symptomatic Virologically-confirmed dengue infection after post-dose 3

        -  To evaluate whether the dengue serotype-specific neutralizing antibody and associated
           summary neutralization measure at 28 days post-dose 3 are related to the level of
           vaccine efficacy against dengue viruses after post-dose 3.

      The enrolled population will include both, virologically-confirmed (VC) dengue cases and
      subjects not having experienced a VC dengue infection (control subjects) from the first Proof
      of Concept efficacy study conducted in Thailand Analyses for correlates will be performed on
      samples collected in the context of the first proof of concept efficacy study. Sequencing of
      dengue viruses will also be done on samples collected within the same context. Immunogenetic
      testing will be performed on saliva samples collected at the study enrollment visit.

      No intervention or vaccine will be provided or administered as part of this study.
