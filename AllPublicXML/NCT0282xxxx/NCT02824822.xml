  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Epilepsy is a common condition which affects over 3 million people in the US. Patients with
      uncontrolled epilepsy have a lifetime risk of sudden unexpected death (SUDEP) of 35%, which
      is greatest in those under 40 years of age. The exact mechanisms and causes are not
      understood but can be due to underlying conditions which affect the heart and brain, which
      may lead to dangerous heart rhythms and death. Some of these conditions which affect heart
      and brain have an identifiable genetic cause. This study aims to identify known genetic
      causes of heart rhythm and sudden death related disorders in patients with epilepsy.

      The overall goals are to determine whether patients with epilepsy who have the highest risk
      of SUDEP have an underlying genetic cardiovascular disorder. The investigators are seeking
      patients with epilepsy who have a high risk of SUDEP identified by using a risk scoring tool
      called SUDEP-7 and/or have blood-relatives with a history of epilepsy, seizure, cardiac
      arrest, sudden death, drowning/near-drowning, syncope or heart rhythm disorder. The
      investigators may also include blood-relatives of patients with epilepsy and invite them to
      participate by providing a blood sample and/or buccal cells (from a swab or saliva) for
      genetic testing.

    <measure>Using Next Generation Whole-Exome Sequencing, determine if an underlying genetic cardiac mutation is present in refractory epilepsy patients who are at highest risk of sudden death.</measure>
    <time_frame>3-5 years</time_frame>
    <description>SUDEP-7 is a risk profiling tool, with a score ranging from 0-12. Generally, a score greater than or equal to 3 is considered high risk. The investigators will select participants with a family history of epilepsy, seizures, cardiac arrest, sudden death, drowning, syncope or arrhythmia, as this markedly increases genetic yield.
Next Generation Whole-Exome Sequencing will be performed with a focus on known genes implicated in sudden unexpected death syndromes (channelopathies, cardiomyopathies and aortopathies) and autonomic control. Where relevant, blood-relatives may be invited for genomic 'trio' analyses.</description>
