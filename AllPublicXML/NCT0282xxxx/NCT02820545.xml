  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study aims to construct and validate a self-administrated questionnaire to assess the
      patients' perception of patient safety in surgical care units. The originality of the study
      is to perform sociological interviews of hospitalized patients to assess their own perception
      on the safety of their care and to create corresponding items which will be included in a new
      questionnaire. In a second step, patients' perception of patient safety will be assessed in
      numerous surgical care units in France, in order to analyze the psychometric properties of
      the questionnaire and consequently to validate the questionnaire. The patients' perception
      will be compared to the healthcare professionals' perception on patient safety and to the
      patient safety strategies in place in the care units.
