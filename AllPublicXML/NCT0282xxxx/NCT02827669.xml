  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The One Drop Experts Program for Type 2 Diabetes Self-Management Impact on A1c trial is a
      12-week long, prospective, intent-to-treat study that aims to evaluate the impact of the One
      Drop app and Experts program on HbA1c levels for individuals with uncontrolled Type 2
      diabetes. A secondary objective will be to evaluate participants who utilize an Apple Watch
      in combination with the One Drop app and Experts program, and assess whether this group is
      more engaged or experiences a different impact as compared to participants who utilized the
      One Drop app and Experts program only.
