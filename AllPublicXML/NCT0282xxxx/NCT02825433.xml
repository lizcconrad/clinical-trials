  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The ventilation (respiratory rate, tidal volume and end-tidal CO2) was monitored for patients
      receiving procedural sedation during endoscopy procedures in order to observe what changes
      commonly occur.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The literature does not currently describe which ventilation changes a clinician should watch
      for to keep a patient safe during procedural sedation provided by fentanyl and propofol. This
      observational study aimed to record the breath-by-breath respiratory rate, tidal volume and
      end-tidal CO2 for each patient during procedural sedation for each endoscopy procedure. Data
      analysis offline will aim to identify any patterns in ventilation which may precede apnea or
      blood oxygen desaturation. The patterns in ventilation preceding apnea or blood oxygen
      saturation will be compared and contrasted with the patterns of ventilation during normal
      ventilation periods.
