    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the efficacy of the endoscopic hemostatic powder for the treatment of
      bleeding from malignant lesions of the upper GI tract. Half of participants will receive
      hemostatic powder and half will be submitted to standard treatment.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Gastrointestinal tumor bleeding is a challenging clinical condition with a high mortality
      rate. Several endoscopic hemostasis techniques have been tested, but results were
      disappointing. Re-bleeding and mortality rates are still high.

      Hemostatic powder is a promising therapy for tumor bleeding, since it can be applied over
      large surfaces. Bleeding from a tumor lesion often occurs diffusely on the surface of the
      tumor rather than from a specific vessel.
