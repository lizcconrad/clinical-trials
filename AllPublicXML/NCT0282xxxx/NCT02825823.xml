  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The ketone body beta-hydroxybutyrate is produced during prolonged fasting or exercise and can
      be used as an alternative fuel source. Exogenous beta-hydroxybutyrate, in the form of a
      ketone salt, is proposed to have ergogenic potential for high-intensity exercise performance
      but this has not been adequately studied. The purpose of this study is to determine whether
      supplementing with an acute dose of ketone salts can alter fuel use during exercise and
      improve exercise performance.
