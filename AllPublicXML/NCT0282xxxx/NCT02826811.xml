  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      BKV nephropathy (BKV) is one of the most frequent complications of kidney transplantation.

      In the absence of specific anti-BKV treatment, pre-emptive reduction of immunosuppression is
      the main strategy that has proven effective in reducing the risk of BKVN. However, it exposes
      a transplant rejection risk estimated between 4 and 14% according to studies.

      Despite the pre-emptive reduction of immunosuppression, a significant number of patients
      continue to progress towards BKVN suggesting that pre-emptive strategy is late. It's
      therefore urgent to develop new prognostic markers to identify earlier and more effectively
      patients with a higher risk of developing BKVN.
