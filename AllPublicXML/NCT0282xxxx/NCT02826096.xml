      The study is to examine the therapeutic effect of a brief version of biofeedback therapy
      (developed bu the research team) on panic disorder. It is a randomized controlled design. The
      severity of panic symptoms of two groups of panic patients (reveiving biofeedback therapy or
      not) were measured before and after the six week duration. Besides, the severity of anxiety,
      depressive, somatic symptoms, and physiological indexes were recorded.

      The purpose of this study is trying to find out whether our newly developed brief version of
      biofeedback is an effective treatment approach for panic disorder. At the same time, the
      investigators want to clarify the change of bio- and psycho- indices present through the
      process. Patient recently experienced panic attacks are recruited in this study. The
      diagnosis of &quot;Panic Disorder&quot; is made by psychiatrists according to The Diagnostic and
      Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders(DSM-5) criteria. Subjects are randomly assigned to
      medication group or biofeedback therapy. The biofeedback therapy is conducted by
      psychologists following the structure way. Every subject will be measured both the bio and
      psycho indices on week 0, 3, and 6 under 6-week observation. In the end of the study, the
      investigators hope to analyze and clarify the treatment effects of our design, and also to
      exam the meanings of these indices, in order to find out an effective treatment approach.
