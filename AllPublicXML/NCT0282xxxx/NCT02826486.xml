      This study will assess the efficacy and safety of BL-8040 as a single agent and in
      combination with pembrolizumab (Keytruda®) in subjects with metastatic pancreatic
      adenocarcinoma.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This will be an open-label, single arm, phase IIa study in subjects with metastatic
      pancreatic adenocarcinoma.

      The study will include 30 subjects with unresectable metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma.

      The study consists of two periods:

        -  Monotherapy period: One week, with BL-8040 administered daily on days 1-5.

        -  Combination therapy: Three week cycles of a combination of BL-8040 administered three
           times a week (TIW) and pembrolizumab administered once every three weeks.

      Subjects with metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma will be enrolled and receive BL-8040
      monotherapy for five days followed by a combination treatment of BL-8040 and pembrolizumab.
      During the monotherapy period, eligible subjects will receive daily subcutaneous (SC)
      injections of BL-8040 (1.25 mg/kg) on days 1 - 5.

      From Day 8 subjects will begin a combination period consisting of treatment with SC BL-8040
      (1.25 mg/kg) three times a week (TIW) and pembrolizumab (200mg) once every three weeks. The
      combination therapy will continue for up to two years, or until progression, clinical
      deterioration or early termination, whichever comes first.

             identical imaging modality for each assessment, either MRI or CT scan, for at least
             four weeks prior to the first dose of trial treatment and any neurologic symptoms have
