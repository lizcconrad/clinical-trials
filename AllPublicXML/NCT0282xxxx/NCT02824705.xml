  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Approximately 40,000 infants are born each year in the United States with congenital heart
      defects (CHD), and heart defects are the leading cause of birth defect-related deaths in the
      United States. While advances in surgical treatment, cardiac bypass, and post-operative
      management have improved mortality for children born with heart defects, these children
      continue to have significant morbidity related to post-operative malnutrition, multiple organ
      dysfunction (MODS), and sepsis. Proposed mechanisms for post-operative sepsis and MODS is via
      loss of intestinal epithelial barrier function (EBF) or intestinal micro biome diversity.

      The purpose of this multi-center observational cohort study is to understand the extent to
      which practice variation for routine post-operative care might worsen intestinal barrier
      dysfunction and reduce diversity of the intestinal microbiome for infants undergoing surgical
      correction of left sided cardiac obstructive defects. We will enroll 80 children with left
      sided obstructive congenital cardiac lesions across several US congenital cardiac centers to
      obtain clinical data and biological specimens. We will leverage existing differences in
      nutritional and antibiotic strategies at these centers to better understand how intestinal
      barrier function and the intestinal microbiome may contribute to post-operative multiple
      organ dysfunction syndrome.

        The study population will consist of infants and young children who are diagnosed with left
        sided obstructive congenital heart disease and are scheduled for corrective surgery.
        Investigators will enroll a total of 80 patients in this multi-center trial. Investigators
        anticipate that local enrollment will be about 1-2 patients per month, or 12-24 per year
        when the cardiac program is active.
