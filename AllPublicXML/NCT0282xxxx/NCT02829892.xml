      Alzheimer's disease and related syndromes (AD) is a disease affecting memory but also the
      relationship with the environment and empower people. Patients with AD present in 90% of
      cases of behavioral disorders and of these behavioral disorders include agitation, apathy but
      also sleep disorders by circadian rhythm impairment.. No study has shown proven efficacy on
      the behavior of patients with AD. The main objective of the study was to assess the influence
      of environmental light nighttime sleep of residents.

      Alzheimer's disease and related syndromes (AD) is a disease affecting memory but also the
      relationship with the environment and empower people. Patients with AD present in 90% of
      cases of behavioral disorders and of these behavioral disorders include agitation, apathy but
      also sleep disorders by circadian rhythm impairment. In 2014, the Cochrane published a
      systematic review of the literature over the last 20 years concerning the use of light
      therapy in patients with a AD. No study has shown proven efficacy on the behavior of patients
      with AD. The main objective of the study was to assess the influence of environmental light
      therapy (from 5 a.m to 10 p.m) on nighttime sleep of residents. Secondary objectives were the
      study of sleep time on the day, anxiety by the COVI scale and behavioral disorders by the NPI
      scale.
