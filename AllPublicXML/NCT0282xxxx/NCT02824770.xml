  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Endogenous melatonin is produced by the pineal gland at night under normal conditions and
      regulates the sleep-wake cycle. Artificial light administered at night suppresses melatonin
      production and sleep disturbances are accompanied by abnormal melatonin secretion such as
      phase delay. Therefore, dramatic disturbances of endogenous rhythms in intensive care unit
      patients have remarkable effects on melatonin production. In addition to its physiological
      roles in regulating sleep patterns, melatonin has been demonstrated to provide
      antiinflammatory effects in experimental models. Although some previous studies have
      investigated the circadian pattern of melatonin in intensive care unit patients, the
      investigators think that the present study is the first one that will assess the effects of
      controlling noise and light on melatonin and inflammatory response after major abdominal
      surgery.

      This study is going to be conducted in accordance with the Helsinki Declaration and has been
      approved by Eskisehir Osmangazi University Ethics Committee. Forty consecutive patients, aged
      18-65, who will undergo elective major abdominal operations will be enrolled in the study
      after obtaining informed consent. All patients will receive adequate postoperative pain
      management with the Pain Buster ® system and patient-controlled intravenous analgesia (PCA).
      The patients will be randomly assigned to either the experimental group or the control group.
      The control group will receive the usual care. The patients in the experimental group will be
      screened in the side-rooms where normally the patients who either have infections or are at
      risk of infection, are nursed. The study intervention will include dimming the lights to 40
      lux and closing the doors of the side-room to decrease the noise level below 40 decibels (dB)
      between 11:00 p.m.-5:00 a.m.
