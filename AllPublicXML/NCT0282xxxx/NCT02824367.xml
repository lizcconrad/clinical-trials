  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Scientific studies show that almost half of the people with Parkinson's Disease (PD) suffer
      of depression and / or anxiety. Also, clinicians reported that they exhibit specific
      personality traits (e.g., rigidity and perfectionism).

      To date, few studies used Cognitive Behavioural Therapies (CBT) in people with Parkinson's
      disease showing promising results. Recently, perfectionism has received particular attention
      because of it association with many emotional disorders. Thus, some psychometric tools have
      been developed in order to evaluate different aspects of perfectionism. Yet, none of them has
      been used in people with Parkinson's disease.

      The objective of this study is to investigate whether there is a direct link between
      Parkinson's disease and perfectionism by using psychometric tools from the CBT literature.
      Identifying such link would allow to justify the use of CBT in people with Parkinson's
      disease with the goal in mind to improve their care and quality of life.
