  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare the efficacy and side effects of topical Loteprendol
      etabonate 0.5% (Lotemax) versus Dexamethasone 0.1% (Sterodex) following strabismus surgery.

    <textblock>
      This is a randomized prospective study that will involve 100 patients (males and females)
      undergoing strabismus surgery. All patients will be randomly assigned to receive one of the
      study drugs (Loteprendol etabonate 0.5% (Lotemax) drops or Dexamethasone 0.1% (Sterodex)
      drops) after undergoing strabismus surgery. In addition to the study drug all patients (in
      both groups) will receive topical Ofloxacin 0.3% (Oflox) eye drops. All patients will undergo
      a complete ophthalmological evaluation before surgery including orthoptic assessment of their
      strabismus and measurement of intraocular pressure (IOP). Topical treatment with the study
      drug and topical Ofloxacin 0.3% (Oflox) eye drops will begin on the evening of the surgery,
      following a schedule that will be the same for both groups: 4 times daily during the first
      week, 3 times daily for the second group, twice daily for the third week, and as needed for
      the fourth week. All patients will be examined at 1 day, 1 week, 2 weeks and 4 weeks after
      surgery by a masked investigator (not the strabismus surgeon).

      The parameters to be checked will include:

        1. Patient pain and discomfort

        2. Conjunctival chemosis

        3. Conjunctival hyperaemia

        4. Conjunctival discharge

        5. Conjunctival gap

        6. Intraocular pressure (IOP)

        7. Number of pain control medications taken

    <description>IOP will be measured by Goldmann applantation tonometry one day before surgery (baseline IOP). In patients in whom Goldmann tonometry is impossible, ICARE tonometer will be used instead. IOP will be measured 1 day, 1 week, 2 weeks, 4 weeks after surgery, at each time point change from baseline IOP will be recorded.</description>

    <description>Conjunctival hyepremia will be measured one day before surgery (basline measurement) using the following scale: 0=no hyperemia, 1=mild (less than one quadrant), 2=moderate (less than half of the conjunctival surface), 3= severe (less than half of the conjunctival surface). Conjunctival hyperemia will be measured 1 day, 1 week, 2 weeks, 4 weeks after surgery, at each time point change from baseline measurement will be recorded.</description>
