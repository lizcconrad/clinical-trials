  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      An intense inflammatory reaction is triggered by the ischemic injury during myocardial
      infarction. The inflammatory processes involved are complex and haven't been explored in
      detail in human patients. This inflammatory response can increase myocardial damage following
      reperfusion, leading to adverse remodeling and adverse events (heart failure, sudden cardiac
      death).

      Cardiac MRI can assess the size of myocardial infarction and many other parameters associated
      with myocardial injury: edema, hemorrhage, micro-vascular obstruction.

      (However the association between biomarkers of inflammation and these imaging parameters is
      not known).

      There is very little data correlating imaging markers of myocardial injury to the biokinetics
      of inflammation biomarkers.

      In this study, the aim is to assess the relationship between the kinetics of specific
      inflammatory biomarkers (interleukin-1beta, interleukin 6, interleukin 17, Tumor Necrosis
      Factor (TNF)-alpha, C reactive protein (CRP), soluble toll-like receptor-2 (ST2),
      neutrophils) and imaging markers of injury measured by cardiac MRI at the acute phase in 20
      acute mycardial infarction (AMI) patients.
