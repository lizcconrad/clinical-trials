  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is an established treatment for advanced complicated Parkinson's
      disease (PD). Several controlled randomized studies have given proof of an advantage for
      operated patients as compared to medically treated patients in terms of motor outcome,
      activities of daily living and health status. However these studies have addressed mostly
      stimulation of the subthalamic nucleus (STN). GPi stimulation has not been compared to best
      medical treatment (BMT) in a prospective randomized controlled trial in patients with
      complicated PD who are not good candidates for STN stimulation. The investigators aim
      assessing GPi-DBS in patients with PD who have contraindications for STN-DBS.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The indication and excellent therapeutic effects of STN stimulation have been sufficiently
      proven in advanced PD, and the contraindications for this treatment are rather well
      established. Also, the observation that patients fulfilling the &quot;STN-profile&quot; but who had
      been operated for pallidal DBS and lost part of the treatment's benefit over time, improved
      when stimulated later in the STN (instead of the GPi) shows that patients qualifying for
      STN-DBS do not have as good a result with GPi-DBS.

      GPi stimulation may be used in patients who do not qualify for STN stimulation. Especially
      postural instability, age over 70 years, and mild to moderate cognitive deficits are commonly
      considered to be exclusion criteria for STN stimulation but not for GPi stimulation.
      Therefore, the investigators propose a prospective randomized controlled trial of GPi
      stimulation in patients with PD and motor complications who have relative or absolute
      contraindications for STN stimulation.

    <description>Patients in the GPi group will be implanted with DBS-electrodes within 6 weeks after randomisation. The stimulation parameters and the medical treatment are adjusted for optimal control of motor and non-motor signs and symptoms according to published guidelines using a specified algorithm. The stimulation parameters are recorded at the beginning and at the end of each post-surgical assessment.
Best medical treatment is applied in combination with GPi-DBS.</description>
