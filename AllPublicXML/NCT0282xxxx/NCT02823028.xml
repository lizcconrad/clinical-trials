    <textblock>
      Tweet2Quit is an innovative smoking cessation intervention that combines real-time online
      peer-to-peer support with auto messaging. In a three-group randomized controlled trial, the
      investigators will compare: 1) usual care, 2) Tweet2Quit-coed, and 3) Tweet2Quit-Women only.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The proposed randomized controlled evaluation (N=960) of the Tweet2Quit intervention will
      biochemically verify abstinence out to 6-months follow-up and will test the personalized
      benefit for women of a women-only versus co-ed Tweet2Quit group. In a 3-arm design, the
      investigators will compare: 1) usual care, 2) Tweet2Quit-coed, and 3) Tweet2Quit-Women only.

      Each Tweet2Quit group will include buddy pairs based on similarity in demographics. Also
      automated pattern detection will identify dips in tweeting and trigger automated alerts and
      engagement strategies.

      The primary aims tests Hypothesis 1: Relative to usual care (n=240), Tweet2Quit-coed groups
      (n=480) will achieve significantly greater bioconfirmed sustained abstinence out to 6-months
      follow-up, and Hypothesis 2: Women in Tweet2Quit will achieve significantly greater
      bioconfirmed 6-months abstinence in woman-only groups (n=240) vs. coed groups (n=240 women).

      Our secondary aims are to test the same hypotheses based on 3-month (end of treatment)
      sustained abstinence and 7-day point prevalence at 1, 3, and 6 months with biochemical
      verification at 3 and 6 months. Exploratory aims will study the Tweet2Quit groups' social
      network structures with a focus on the identification of buddy pairs and social brokers and
      test if these relationships are stronger for women in women-only groups versus women in coed
      groups of Tweet2Quit.

      *Prior to the start of the RCT, the investigators will run one coed pilot group (N=20). Total
      size of the study (including the pilot group) will be N=980.

    <measure>Percentage of participants with a 6-month sustained abstinence</measure>
    <time_frame>6 Month</time_frame>
    <description>Percentage of participants who reported no use of tobacco products by answering the questions: 'How many cigarettes have you smoked', 'How many other tobacco products have you used', and 'How many times have you used e-cigs' since the quit date (assessed at 1, 3 and 6 months post quit date) confirmed by salivary cotinine measurement (assessed at 3 and 6 months post quit date). Note: We will apply the Russell Standard for abstinence, allowing 5 or fewer instances of tobacco use over 6 months.
In our primary (most rigorous) analysis, we will consider a cotinine-positive test, regardless of source, to be non-abstinent. In additional analyses, we will code as abstinent those who assert tobacco abstinence but continue use of FDA-approved nicotine replacement therapy. In other analyses we will report results with ENDS-only users coded first as non-abstinent and then for comparison as abstinent.</description>

A result level of 0 (0-10ng/ml) will be considered abstinent. Additionally if the participant reports living with a heavy smoker, then a result of 1 (10-30ng/ml) or lower will be considered abstinent.</description>

    <description>A fully automated, 90-day quit smoking intervention that provides an online, peer-to-peer support group for quitting and uses twice-daily automessages to encourage and direct the peer-to-peer exchanges. Each group will consist of 12 buddy pairs (matched on key demographics) that will be introduced via automated texts. The program will generate twice-daily programmed contacts (e.g., &quot;what benefits do you hope to get from quitting smoking?&quot;). Automated pattern detection software will identify and address any problematic low tweeting within a group.</description>
