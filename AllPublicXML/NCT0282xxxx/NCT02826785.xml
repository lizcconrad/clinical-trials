    <textblock>
      This study investigates the feasibility of a cognitive strategy training intervention for
      people with Parkinson disease (PD). We plan to recruit 8 non-demented PD participants to
      complete 6 weekly treatment sessions and Pre- and Post-testing (8 sessions total, entire
      study duration per participant = 8 weeks). We will measure participant responsiveness and the
      overall efficiency of the intervention process.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cognitive impairment is common in Parkinson disease (PD) and is a significant source of
      disability and reduced quality of life. Existing rehabilitative interventions, which focus on
      cognitive process training, have not been successful in mitigating its negative functional
      consequences. We have developed a client-centered cognitive strategy training intervention to
      enable people with PD to work around their cognitive deficits and maintain their functional
      performance. This study is an exploratory case series to assess aspects of its feasibility.
      Specifically, we will assess participant responsiveness to the intervention (acceptance,
      engagement, adherence), and we will track logistical information (e.g., scheduling). We will
      also administer an exploratory outcome measure of treatment effect to gain preliminary
      evidence on the effect of the intervention on self-identified cognitive performance problems.
      This information will guide modifications and enhancements in preparation for future clinical
      trials.

    <description>The cognitive strategy training intervention consists of 6 weekly ~1 hour sessions. It is delivered in an individual, face-to-face format in the client's home. It is a behavioral intervention that teaches people metacognitive, problem-solving and other compensatory strategies to address self-identified cognitive performance problems, and it uses practice and homework to promote strategy learning, retention and transfer.</description>

    <description>The intervention teaches strategies in a way that promotes generalization and enhances daily function . It includes four core elements known to enhance learning transfer: (1) self-generation of broadly applicable strategies, (2) practice across multiple contexts and activities, (3) emphasis on metacognition, and (4) use of meaningful everyday activities.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Males and females over age 50 who meet criteria for idiopathic typical PD, are Hoehn &amp;
             Yahr stage I-III (mild to moderate disease; Hoehn &amp; Yahr, 1967) and are treated with
             levodopa/carbidopa. For this early phase of development we will limit enrollment to
             people who can identify at least one daily cognitive performance problem and are
             willing to learn strategies to address it.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Possible dementia, medication change over the study period, other neurological
             disorders, brain surgery (e.g., STN DBS), history of psychotic disorder or significant
             current psychiatric disorder (i.e., moderate to severe anxiety, apathy or depression),
             or any condition that would interfere with participation (e.g., non-English speaking).
             Participants taking benzos will be excluded.
