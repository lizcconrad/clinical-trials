  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      M7583 is an investigational drug that is being evaluated for the treatment of patients with
      B-cell malignancies, which are cancers that form in B cells (cells that are part of the
      immune system). This study has been designed to assess the use of the study drug in patients
      with B-cell lymphomas who have tried and did not respond well (or the B-cell lymphoma came
      back) to at least one but not more than three types of treatment for cancer. This is a Phase
      I/II study, which means that it is looking at several dose levels of an investigational
      medication in terms of its safety and how well it is tolerated in multiple doses. The final
      selected dose will be tested for activity against the tumor in specific populations of
      lymphoma (Mantle cell lymphoma and Diffuse Large B Cell Lymphoma)
