      RATIONALE: Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to damage tumor cells. AGuIX particles
      may increase the effectiveness of radiation therapy by making tumor cells more sensitive to
      radiation.

      PURPOSE: This first-in-man Phase I trial will study the side effects and best dose of AGuIX
      when injected together with whole brain radiation therapy in treating patients with multiple
      brain metastases. The effectiveness of the combination of AGuIX and radiation therapy will be
      also assessed.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The present study will investigate the safety, tolerability and spectrum of side effects of
      AGuIX in combination with whole brain radiation therapy. As such, this study will
      characterize the dose limiting toxicities (DLT) and maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of in
      combination with whole brain radiation therapy in patients with multiple brain metastases.

      On day 1, patients will receive a single intravenous injection of AGuIX. An MRI scan will be
      performed 2 hours after injection to visualize the distribution of AGuIX in brain metastases
      and surrounding healthy tissue, and to evaluate the contrast enhancement in brain metastases.
      Then patients will undergo a whole brain radiation therapy, starting 4 hours after AGuIX
      injection, up to completion of 2 weeks, 5 days a week of treatment (30Gy, 3Gy/fraction).

      During the first 24h after injection, several blood draws will be also performed in order to
      assess the pharmacokinetic of AGuIX.

      After completion of study treatment, patients will be followed periodically.

      Patients will be enrolled in cohorts and will be treated at sequentially rising dose levels
      of AGuIX combined with whole brain radiation therapy. Three subjects will initially enter at
      each dose. If none of the three experiences a dose-limiting toxicity we will proceed to the
      next dose. If one of the three experiences that level of toxicity, we will accrue 3 more
      subjects at that dose. If at any time there are two or more dose-limiting toxicities (in the
      3-6 subjects) on a given dose, we will drop down to a lower dose. Dose escalation will
      continue until the MTD of AGuIX and whole brain radiation therapy is established. The MTD
      will then be one dose below the DLT occurring in at least 1 out of 3 subjects (2 out of 6
      patients).
