      This study is an open label proof of concept study of rilonacept for patients with ANSHL
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Ten (10) patients in total will be enrolled in this study at Metroplex Clinical Research
      Center in Dallas, TX. Patients may be identified and referred by local area audiologist. The
      ANSHL study population will be defined by inclusion and exclusion criteria designed to limit
      enrollment to individuals with idiopathic, progressive, bilateral sensorineural hearing loss,
      to ensure appropriate candidates for treatment with study medications, and to identify those
      with a high likelihood of complying with the study protocol.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. The presence of progressive sensironeural hearing loss greater than or equal to 30 dB
             in both ears at one or more frequencies (250, 500, 1000, 2000, 3000, 4000, 6000 or
             8000 Hz) and idiopathic-based on clinical evaluation, blood tests, and radiographic
             imaging.

          2. Documented improvement in hearing by audiogram after 30 days of treatment with high
             dose prednisone 40-60 mg/d. Improvement is defined by 10 dB improvement in pure tone
             average (500-3000 dB) or an improvement in word identification score of at least 12%
             in either ear (both relative to baseline). Prednisone could be started at screening
             but patients may have received prednisone prior to screening and the pre prednisone
             audiogram will be used as the screening audiogram for this study. It is expected the
             majority of these patients will screen for the study in this fashion as they are
             referred from otoloaryngology after initial treatment.

          3. 18-75 years of age

          4. Able and willing to give written informed consent and comply with the requirements of
             the study protocol

          5. Negative serum pregnancy test (for women of child bearing potential). Males and
             Females of child bearing potential must agree to consistently use 2 forms of highly
             effective birth control (at least 1 of which must be a barrier method) starting at
             screening and throughout the study period and for 3 months after the final study drug
             administration.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Pregnant or nursing, or planning to become pregnant or father a child within 3 months
             after receiving the last dose of study drug

          2. Have a known or suspected current active infection or a history of chronic or
             recurrent infectious disease including, but not limited to, chronic renal infection,
             chronic chest infections, chronic sinusitis, recurrent urinary tract infections, an
             open, draining, infected skin wound.

          3. Within 2 months of first study drug administration, have had a serious infection, have
             been hospitalized for an infection, have been treated with PO antibiotics for longer
             than 2 weeks, or have been treated with intravenous (IV) antibiotics for an infection

          4. Uncontrolled diabetes at the baseline visit (defined as HbA1c ≥9.0%)

          5. Patients requiring dialysis

          7. Treatment with any systemic {non-glucocorticoid} immunosuppressants (e.g.
             methotrexate, azathioprine, cyclosporine, mercaptopurine, mycophenolate mofetil,
             tacrolimus, sirolimus within 4 weeks of baseline rilonacept administration. No
             leflunomide treatment within 8 weeks prior to baseline administration. No etanercept,
             adalimumab, infliximab, tocilizumab, abatacept, or natalizumab, within 2 months prior
             to baseline visit; No rituxan for 12 months prior to baseline and evidence of normal B
             cell count required. Patients previously treated with anakinra for ANSHL cannot be
             enrolled.

          8. Prohibited Medications:

               1. Strong CYP3A4 inhibitors, protease inhibitors or P-gp inhibitors.

               2. Long-acting or extended release forms of opiates.

               3. Live or live-attenuated vaccines are excluded during the course of the study

               4. IA and IM glucocorticoid injections. Long-acting steroid preparations are not
                  allowed during study (this includes suspensions and all forms of dexamethasone).

          9. History of a demyelinating disease or symptoms suggestive of multiple sclerosis

         10. Treatment with a live or live-attenuated virus vaccine during the 3 months prior to

         11. Estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) of &lt;20 mL/min/1.73m2 or patients planning
             to start dialysis within a year from the screening visit

         12. Baseline laboratory test results meeting any of the following criteria:

               1. Hemoglobin (Hgb)&lt;8.5 g/dL (85 g/L)

               2. Neutrophil count&lt;1.5 x 103/μL

               3. Platelet count&lt;100 x 103/μL

               4. Total bilirubin exceeding 1.5 times the upper limit of normal (ULN) unless
                  consistent with Gilbert's syndrome

               5. Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) or alanine aminotransferase (ALT) exceeding 2
                  times the ULN

             testing.

         14. Presence of hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) and/or hepatitis C antibody (HCV) by
             serologic testing

         15. History of active TB prior to screening or chest x-ray showing evidence of malignancy
             or any abnormalities suggestive of prior tuberculosis (TB) infection, including, but
             not limited to, apical scarring, apical fibrosis, or multiple calcified granulomata.

         16. A positive intradermal skin tuberculin test (purified protein derivative [PPD] 5

             lasting &gt;14 days or a change in chronic cough, persistent fever, unintentional weight
             loss, night sweats) upon review of medical history and/or physical examination. If the
             patient is thought to have a false-positive PPD because of prior BCG vaccination and
             it is known that the patient has been negative on testing obtained outside the
             protocol for M. tuberculosis infection using a cell-based interferon gamma assay the
             patient is eligible for enrollment.

         17. Recent close contact with a person with active TB

         18. History of latent untreated TB. Patients who have been adequately treated for latent
             TB are eligible for enrollment.

         19. Any other medical condition that in the opinion of the investigator could adversely
             affect the patient's participation or interfere with evaluations. This includes
             significant concomitant illness such as, but not limited to, cardiac, renal,
             neurological, endocrinological, metabolic, pulmonary, gastrointestinal, or psychiatric
             disease.

         20. History or presence of malignancy within 5 years of the screening visit (other than a
             successfully treated non-metastatic cutaneous squamous cell or basal cell carcinoma
             and/or localized carcinoma in situ of the cervix)

         21. History of a myeloproliferative disorder

         22. History of alcohol abuse within last 5 years or current intake of 21 or more

         24. Patients with previous exposure to rilonacept

         25. Use of any investigational drug within 30 days or within 5 half-lives (whichever is

         26. Sexually active men or women of childbearing potential who are unwilling to practice
             adequate contraception during the study (adequate contraceptive measures are defined
             as the use of two highly effective forms of birth control, include stable use of oral
             contraceptives or other prescription pharmaceutical contraceptives; intrauterine
             device; bilateral tubal ligation; vasectomy; condom plus contraceptive sponge, foam,
             or jelly, or diaphragm plus contraceptive sponge, foam, or jelly)
