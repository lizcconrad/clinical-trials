      The purpose of this study is to farther assess the safety of the Seal-G Surgical Sealant for
      the reinforcement and protection of gastrointestinal anastomosis.

      Pre-Surgery:

      Screening will be performed among adult subjects who are scheduled for an elective colorectal
      surgery. Pre-surgery assessments (after completion of consent process and signed ICF) will be
      according to the routine practice.

      Intra-operative:

      During surgery, an assessment of the intra-operative exclusion criteria will be performed. If
      the subject does not meet any of the exclusion criteria, the subject will be further
      enrolled. Surgery will be performed according to the site standard of care (routine
      practice). Anastomosis will be created either using a stapler device (linear or circular),
      according to manufacture IFU (Instructions for use) or hand suture according to surgeon best
      practice technique. Once anastomosis has been created, surgeon will verify the anastomosis
      and mucosal donuts integrity.

      Device (Seal-G) application on anastomotic site

      Post-operative follow-up: Follow-up evaluations will be performed daily while hospitalized.
      There will be one postoperative follow up at one month - clinic visit
