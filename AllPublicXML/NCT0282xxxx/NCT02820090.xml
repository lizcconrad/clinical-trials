  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Infection and trauma take a important role in the acute respiratory failure.There are
      different causes and degrees of inflammatory reaction in the critically ill patient. The
      inflammatory reaction should also affect patients on mechanical ventilation dependence with
      body physiological response and disease prognosis in patients. Therefore, the investigators
      hypothesize that inflammation may have an important role in the prediction of weaning from
      mechanical ventilation.

      In the process of mechanical ventilation, the patients were divided into two groups according
      to the failure of spontaneous breathing test and spontaneous breathing test.In the index of
      predicting mechanical ventilation, the investigators will take the index of inflammatory
      response, the function index of diaphragm and the amount of exhaled CO2 into account to
      reduce the failure rate of mechanical ventilation.
