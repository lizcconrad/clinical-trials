      The project will test the strategy of integrating 25 hours of relationship education into an
      existing employment program for low-income individuals ages 18-30. It will use a 2-arm
      randomized controlled trial to test the effect of this full package of services on
      participants' employment outcomes and relationship outcomes.

      The study will examine the programming by FWCA, which currently offers the Career Pathways
      Bridge program in three locations in St. Louis County in Missouri. The evaluation will test
      the strategy of integrating relationship education into an existing workforce readiness
      program. FWCA plans to add approximately 17 hours of content from the Within My Reach
      relationship education curriculum to the two-week job readiness workshop it offers as part of
      the Career Pathways Bridge program. Second, FWCA will add up to eight additional one-hour
      relationship skills education sessions that customers can attend in the five weeks after
      completing the initial two-week job readiness workshop.

      The evaluation will use a 2-arm randomized controlled trial to test the effect of this full
      package of services on participants' employment outcomes and relationship outcomes. The
      target population will be low-income individuals ages 18-30 living in St. Louis County,
      Missouri. The study will aim to enroll 1000 individuals over 2 years. The Metropolitan
      Employment and Training (MET) Center will be the primary recruitment and service location.
