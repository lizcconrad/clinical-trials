  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cognitive impairment plays an important role in functional recovery and leads to long-term
      sickness absence. Therefore there is a need of a treatment specifically improving cognitive
      functions. In this pilot study the investigators aim to evaluate the feasibility of using
      cognitive computer training in patients with unipolar depression to enhance cognitive
      performance. Further the investigators investigate whether this intervention shortens sick
      leave.

      This study will evaluate cognitive computer training on patients in remission from depression
      by measuring the compliance and effect, investigating whether patients returned earlier to
      work and examine patients' physical and psychological health. This is done by comparing an
      intervention group and a control group.

      Outpatients from psychiatric department Odense in Denmark will be recruited from December
      2015 to July 2017.

      At enrolment the participants wil be randomized 1:1 to either the intervention group or the
      control group. After the participants will complete a clinical interview and answer the The
      Short Form (36) Health Survey (SF-36) questionnaire. The participants' cognitive function and
      depression severity will be measured at baseline and three months follow-up. At nine months
      follow-up the participants will receive an email with the SF-36 questionnaire and questions
      about their education and work status, which they were required to answer.

      The intervention is a cognitive computer program, consisting of different computer games. The
      intervention will start at enrolment and finish at the three months follow-up. The
      participants in the intervention group will do trainings session lasting 10-20 minutes three
      times a week. Each participant ends up with a total of 36 training sessions.
