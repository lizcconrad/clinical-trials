  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to test the clinical effectiveness of IOE tube using individually
      customized 3-dimentional printed guiding tube as an alternative to Levin tube feeding when
      unconscious patients have no choice but tube feeding.

      According to standard Guideine of videofluoroscopic swallow study(VFSS), Patients referred to
      dysphagia(swallowing dysfunction)who were required to tube feeding and medically stable of
      vital sign, and agreed to participate. Participants with swallowing dysfunction who were
      classified into three groups (nasogastric tube, traditional intermittent (IOE) tube,
      individual 3D printed guiding tube) according to VFSS.

      Both traditional IOE tube and individual 3D printed guiding tube groups will receive training
      about procedure prior to the first feeding. All participants will be evaluated with
      satisfaction for tube feeding (EORTC QLQ-H&amp;N35) in 3 days from the start day of the tube
      feeding. On the day of oral feeding, participants will be evaluated with the questionnaires
      and clinical examination. If the participant is discharged in a state maintain the tube
      feeding, investigated further length stay at leaving the hospital. On the 1 month, 3 month
      from tube feeding, the investigators will follow-up and measure the questionnaires and
      clinical examination.
