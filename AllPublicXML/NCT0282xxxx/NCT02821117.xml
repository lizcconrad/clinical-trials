      The study is designed to determine glycaemic control achieved using the FreeStyle Libre Flash
      Glucose Monitoring System (FreeStyle Libre) versus Self-Monitoring Blood Glucose (SMBG) for
      the self-management of diabetes.

    <description>Subjects will wear the FreeStyle Libre Flash Glucose Monitoring System masked for 14 days followed by 8 weeks unmasked wear.
During the 2 weeks of masked device wear participants will use the BG strip port for self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG). Scanning the sensor at least every 8 hours during this phase.
Followed by 8 weeks of unmasked device wear when participants will use the device (Sensor glucose and SMBG) according to labelling for their day to day management.</description>
