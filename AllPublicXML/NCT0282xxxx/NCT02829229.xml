  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the effect of the community-based obesity treatment
      (PP), compared to usual care (UC), on changes in maternal weight over 12 months.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators propose to randomize overweight or obese, African American postpartum WIC
      participants (n=300) to either usual care (UC) or a community-based obesity treatment (PP)
      arm. Recruitment will occur in 6 of Philadelphia Women Infants Children's (WIC) clinic sites
      in the early postpartum period (â‰¤ 6 months after birth). Once enrolled, participants will
      complete surveys and baseline assessments of their weight, waist circumference, blood
      pressure, and height at The Center for Obesity Research and Education (CORE). Participants
      will also have a fasting blood sample taken. Study staff will administer a number of
      questionnaires assessing demographics, psychosocial factors, contextual factors, and
      behavioral targets via questionnaires prior to randomization. Participants will then be
      randomized to the 12-month postpartum weight loss intervention (PP) or usual care (UC).
      Additional assessments will be conducted at 6 and 12 months post baseline. The PP arm
      includes expanded obesogenic behavior change goals, tailored skills training materials,
      interactive self-monitoring text messages, video testimonials, and interpersonal counseling
      support through health coach calls and Facebook. Data will be analyzed using an
      intent-to-treat (ITT) approach where subjects are analyzed according to their treatment
      assignment at randomization, regardless of level of engagement. The primary outcome is weight
      loss at 12 months. If successful, the expected results could provide a sustainable, low-cost,
      postpartum weight loss intervention model for widespread dissemination to reduce disparities
      in obesity and cardiometabolic comorbidities.
