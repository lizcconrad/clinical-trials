  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sickle cell disease (SCD) is an inherited disorder characterized by recurrent painful crises
      with ischemia resulting from vascular occlusion. Adults with SCD have increased arterial
      stiffness and reduced flow-mediated dilation (FMD), due to impaired release of substances
      such as nitric oxide.

      The present study assess the vascular properties of carotid and brachial arteries in children
      with SCD compared with a control group without cardiovascular risk factors.
