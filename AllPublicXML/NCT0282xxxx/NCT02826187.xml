    <textblock>
      Total replacement of hip joint is one of the most important medical innovations of the
      twentieth century. More than 100,000 hip replacements are being laid each year in France.

      Improved fixation, reduced wear rates and reduced implant dislocation rates remain subjects
      of continuous improvement.

      Hip implants cemented and cementless are part of therapeutic arsenal of orthopedic surgeons
      for joint replacement of the defective hip.

      The anchor and friction torque are both essential to the survival of hip implants. Therefore
      acetabular implants without cement with ceramic insert or polyethylene in a metalback or full
      polyethylene coated with titanium grains without metalback are proposed, but they have their
      own complications (Squeaking, fractures, recovery difficulties, difficult radiographic
      analysis, high cost for ceramics, primary stability defects, instability of the instrument
      set, Titanium residues in absence of metalback. An alternative to these implants may be an
      acetabular component without cement with polyethylene insert with an end metalback to
      increase both polyethylene thickness and size of the head in order to expect a low
      complication rate with important longevity for a lower cost.

      This study was conducted to ensure the safety and effectiveness of the acetabular implant
      &quot;POLYMAX&quot;
