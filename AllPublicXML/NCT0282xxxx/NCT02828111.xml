  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a double-blind, dose escalating, randomized, vehicle-controlled study designed to
      compare the efficacy and safety of patidegib gel 2% and 4% applied once or twice daily in
      comparison with that of vehicle in patients with Basal Cell Carcinoma. One investigational
      center (metasite) in the United States will participate in this study. Approximately 36
      subjects who meet the study entry criteria will be enrolled into one of four sequential
      cohorts. Within each cohort subjects will be randomized in a 2:1 ratio to receive active or
      vehicle gel.

      This is a double-blind, dose escalating, randomized, vehicle-controlled study designed to
      compare the efficacy and safety of patidegib gel 2% and 4% applied once or twice daily in
      comparison with that of vehicle. Approximately 36 subjects who meet the study entry criteria
      will be enrolled into one of four sequential cohorts. As soon as one cohort has been
      completely enrolled, the next cohort will be enrolled. Each subject will treat no more than
      two previously untreated biopsy confirmed treatment-targeted nodular BCCs. If the subject has
      additional non-treatment targeted BCCs they can be treated surgically prior to or during the
      trial. Within each cohort subjects will be randomized in a 2:1 ratio to receive active or
      vehicle gel. The sequential cohorts will be:

        -  Cohort 1: patidegib gel 2% or vehicle, once daily

        -  Cohort 2: patidegib gel 4% or vehicle, once daily

        -  Cohort 3: patidegib gel 2% or vehicle, twice daily

        -  Cohort 4: patidegib gel 4% or vehicle, twice daily

      The study drug will be applied topically to the treatment-targeted BCCs and a rim or adjacent
      skin for 12 weeks. Information on reported and observed adverse events (AEs) will be obtained
      at each visit. An abbreviated physical examination (PE) will be performed at Baseline and
      Week 12. The treatment-targeted BCCs will be identified by the Investigator at the Baseline
      visit and will be circled in ink at Baseline, Weeks 6 and 12 and photographed, and measured
      at all study visits (Baseline, Weeks 2, 6, 8, 10, and 12). Blood samples for complete blood
      count and serum chemistry and urine for urinalysis will be collected from subjects at
      Screening, Week 6, and Week 12. Subjects who terminate study participation early will be
      asked to complete all Week 12 assessments, as appropriate, prior to commencement of any
      alternative therapy for BCCs (if possible). Subjects who discontinue from the study during
      the treatment period will not be replaced.

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. The subject is from 18 to 85 years of age, inclusive.

          2. The subject must provide electronic informed consent prior to any study procedures.

          3. If the subject is a woman of childbearing potential , she is willing to use two
             effective methods of birth control during the duration of the trial and for one month
             after the last application of the gel. The two forms of birth control authorized are
             defined as the use of a barrier method of contraception (condom with spermicide) in
             association with one of the following methods of birth control: bilateral tubal
             ligation; combined oral contraceptives (estrogens and progesterone) or implanted or
             injectable contraceptives with a stable dose for at least 1 month prior to Baseline;
             hormonal intra-uterine device (IUD) inserted at least 1 month prior to Baseline. This
             proscription is based on the key role of the HH pathway in embryogenesis, the known
             preclinical teratogenic effects of systemic cyclopamine, a naturally occurring
             inhibitor of SMO, and the unknown level of systemic exposure following topical
             application of patidegib in humans.

          4. If the subject is a male with a female sexual partner who is of childbearing
             potential, the couple is willing to use two effective methods of birth control during
             the duration of the trial and for one month after the last application of the gel.
             Authorized birth control methods are outlined in Inclusion Criterion #3. Any woman of
             childbearing potential applying the gel to themselves, or assisting a subject, must
             comply with the same birth control measures.

          5. One or two previously untreated BCCs with the clinical features of a nodular BCC
             confirmed by a biopsy done at or prior to screening confirming nodular BCC. These
             tumors must be suitable for surgical excision. The BCCs prior to biopsy must be no
             less than 5 mm or greater than 15 mm in greatest diameter on the face and no less than
             9 mm or more than 20 mm in greatest diameter at sites other than the face. Tumors on
             the nose, periorbital skin, or on or below the knee are excluded.

          6. The subject is willing to abstain from application of non-study topical prescription
             and over the counter medications within 5 cm of a treatment-targeted BCC for the
             duration of the study except as prescribed by the Investigator. Moisturizers and
             emollients are allowable. Subjects will be encouraged to use sunscreen with a
             sunscreen protection factor (SPF 15 or higher) at least once daily on all exposed skin
             sites.

          7. Female subjects must have negative serum pregnancy test at Screening.

          8. The subject is willing to contact the study center after each primary skin care
             physician (PSCP) visit to provide the study center details of the visit and any
             treatment of skin tumors.

          9. The subject is willing to forego alternative treatment of the treatment-targeted
             baseline BCC for the duration of the trial.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Subjects with basal cell nevus syndrome (BCNS, Gorlin syndrome, nevoid basal cell
             carcinoma syndrome; OMIM #109400).

          2. The subject has used topical products within 5 cm of a treatment- targeted BCC or
             systemic therapies that might interfere with the evaluation of the study medication
             during the study. Specifically, these include the use of:

               1. Topical glucocorticoids 30 days prior to screening

               2. Retinoids (e.g., etretinate, isotretinoin, tazarotene, tretinoin, adapalene)
                  systemically or topically, or &gt; 5% of an alphahydroxy acid (e.g., glycolic acid,
                  lactic acid), photodynamic therapy (PDT), or 5-fluorouracil or imiquimod (except
                  as topical treatment to discrete BCCs) systemically or topically to the skin
                  during the six months prior to entry.

               3. Systemic chemotherapy within one year prior to screening. (Note: field therapy
                  with topically applied treatments can be done as long as they are not applied
                  within 5 cm of a treatment-targeted tumor).

               4. Known inhibitors of the HH signaling pathway (e.g., vismodegib, patidegib,
                  sonidegib, and itraconazole) topically or systemically within 6 months of entry
                  into the study.

          3. The subject has a history of hypersensitivity to any of the ingredients in the study
             medication formulation.

          4. The subject is unable or unwilling to make a good faith effort to be present for all
             follow-up visits and tests.

          5. The subject is a woman who is currently nursing.

          6. The subject has any systemic disease that in the Investigator's opinion would
             interfere with the subject's ability to participate.

          7. The subject has a clinically significant history of liver disease, including viral
             hepatitis, current alcohol abuse, or cirrhosis, that in the investigator's opinion
             would interfere with the subject's ability to participate.

          8. The subject has any condition or situation which in the Investigator's opinion may put
             the subject at significant risk, could confound the study results, or could interfere
             significantly with the subject's participation in the study. This includes history of
             other skin conditions or diseases, metabolic dysfunction, physical examination
             findings, or clinical laboratory findings giving reasonable suspicion of a disease or
             condition that contraindicates use of this investigational drug or that might affect
             interpretation of the results of the study or render the subject at high risk from
             treatment complications.

          9. The subject has a history of invasive cancer within the past five years excluding
             non-melanoma skin cancer, Stage I cervical cancer, ductal carcinoma in situ of breast,
             or chronic lymphocytic lymphoma (CLL) (Stage 0).

         10. The subject is currently participating in an experimental drug study, (within 4 weeks
             of Baseline visit), or plans to participate in an experimental drug study while
             enrolled in this study.

         11. The subject is on a concomitant medication that is a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor. These
             include, but are not limited to: larithromycin, telithromycin, nefazodone,
             itraconazole, ketoconazole, atazanavir, darunavir, indinavir, lopinavir, nelfinavir,
             ritonavir, saquinavir, and tipranavir.
