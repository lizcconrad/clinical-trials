  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the effects of vibration stimuli to contra
      lateral neck muscles on Contraversive Pusher Syndrome, function and neglect in stroke
      patients.

      12 post-stroke subjects will be recruited from neurological rehabilitation department at
      Loewenstein rehabilitation hospital, Raanana, Israel. The patients will be randomly assigned
      to one of two groups: 1) Experimental group. 2) Control group. The 2 weeks intervention (10
      sessions) in each group will include vibration stimuli (frequency of 1 Hz and amplitude of 20
      mm) for 20 minutes and structured standard physiotherapy for 45 minutes. The vibration
      stimuli in the experimental group will be done to the contralesional neck muscles, whereas
      the vibration stimuli in the control group will be done in the contralesional hand. Different
      assessments will be done before the intervention, after the first day of intervention, after
      two weeks of intervention and one months post-intervention. The tests will include: Clinical
      Scale for Contraversive Pushing, Lateropulsion Scale, Subjective Straight Ahead, Postural
      Assesment Scale for Stroke Patients, Anterior and Lateral Functional Reach Test,
      Posturography, Behavioral Inattention Test, Mesulam Cancellation Test, Line Bisection Test,
      Dynamic Starry Night and sensation.

      Differences between groups will be calculated using t-tests or Mann-Whitney, depending on
      distribution of normality with corrections for multiple comparisons. Smallest Real Difference
      (SRD) will be calculated for detecting the minimal detectable change.
