    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to evaluate prospectively the clinical benefits of 2 different
      flow with High flow nasal canula (HFNC: 2l/kg/min) versus (HFNC: 2l/kg/min) in the initial
      management of bronchiolitis in infants.

      Design: Prospective, controlled, randomized, multi-center.

      Design: Infants less than 6 month admitted in pediatric intensive care unit for respiratory
      distress (mWCAS &gt;3) secondary to bronchiolitis but not requiring mechanical ventilation will
      be randomized in two groups:HFNC &quot;2l/min/kg&quot; or HFNC &quot;3l/min/kg&quot; during 24 hours.

      Conditions of measurements:

      Primary endpoint: Proportion of failure in both arms during the first 24 hours.

      Failure criteria: A raise of the Clinical score for respiratory distress (mWCAS) (1 point) or
      respiratory rate (10/min /H0 and above 60/min) or discomfort (EDIN) (1point /H0 and above 4)
      or apnea.

      Secondary outcomes: Assessment at H1, H12, H24 of mWCAS, respiratory and heart rate, EDIN
      score, skin lesions, FiO2 required to achieve an oxygen saturation between 94 and 97%,
      transcutaneous PCO2 (correlated to an initial gas analysis), Report SpO2 / FiO2

      Statistic: Intention to treat Analysis.

      Expected number of patients: 135 per arm: 270 children.
