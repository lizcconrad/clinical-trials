      This prospective, clinical, observational study compares preoperative and intraoperative
      sonographic assessment of lower uterine segment of women who underwent ≥ second cesarean
      section.

      It is the purpose of the study to assess transabdominal (linear/convex ultrasound probe) and
      transvaginal approach versus intraoperative sonographic assessment of lower uterine segment.

    <textblock>
      In 1991, 126.297 (15.3%) women delivered by caesarean section in Germany. Since then, the
      rate of caesarean section increased steadily over the next 20 years, reaching up to 32.2% in
      2011 [https://www.destatis.de]. The absolute risk of uterine rupture in vaginal birth after
      Caesarean section is 1 in 100 deliveries. The risk of perinatal death or the outcome of
      extremely neurological impairment is 1 in 1000 deliveries [Cunningham et al., 2009].

      Statistically more than 300 pregnant women with a prior caesarean delivery visit daily
      ultrasound departments of german hospitals to investigate the C-section scar before delivery.
      They have one important question: Is it possible to predict successful trial of labor after
      cesarean delivery? [AQUA-Institut] The information for the risk of uterine rupture remains
      insufficient based only on ultrasonography assessment [Varner et al., 2012].

      The measurement technique for lower uterine segment (myometrial) thicknesses in the third
      trimester have been described by several authors. Using a combination of preoperative
      transvaginal and transabdominal (linear/convex probe) ultrasound, we compare with
      intraoperative sonographic assessment of lower uterine segment of women who underwent ≥
      second cesarean section.

      The aim of the present study is to assess transabdominal (linear/convex ultrasound probe) and
      transvaginal approach versus intraoperative sonographic assessment of lower uterine segment.

      This will allow the investigators to draw conclusions regarding the best method to assessment
      of lower uterine segment (myometrial) thickness in the third trimester to predict successful
      trial of labor after cesarean delivery.
