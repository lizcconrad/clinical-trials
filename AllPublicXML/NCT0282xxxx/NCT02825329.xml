      This is an open-label, non-controlled trial of standard medical care plus the TORAYMYXIN
      PMX-20R (PMX cartridge), in subjects with endotoxemia and septic shock. Subjects in ICUs will
      be assessed for septic shock using known or suspected infection and hypotension requiring
      vasopressor support as primary criteria. Endotoxemia will be assessed using the Endotoxin
      Activity Assay. Consented eligible subjects will receive two interventions with the PMX
      cartridge approximately 24 hours apart.The status of all subjects will be followed for 28
      days, and long term follow-ups completed at 3 months, 6 months and 12 months.

      This is a continued access study subsequent to the EUPHRATES clinical trial NCT01046669.

    <description>Two (2) PMX cartridges will be administered approximately 24 hours apart. PMX Cartridge is an extracorporeal hemoperfusion device. Each treatment will target 2 hours with a minimum of 1 ½ hours, at a flow rate of approximately 100 ml/minute, (range of 80 to 120 ml/minute).</description>

          3. The subject must have received intravenous fluid resuscitation of a minimum of 30mL/kg
             administered within 24 hours of eligibility

          6. Evidence of at least 1 of the following criteria for new onset organ dysfunction that
             is considered to be due to the acute illness

               1. Requirement for positive pressure ventilation via an endotracheal tube or
                  tracheostomy tube

               2. Thrombocytopenia defined as acute onset of platelet count &lt; 150,000 μ/L or a
                  reduction of 50% from prior known levels

               3. Acute oliguria defined as urine output &lt; 0.5 ml/kg/hr for at least 6 hours

          4. Subject has end-stage renal disease and requires chronic dialysis

          5. There is clinical support for non-septic shock such as:

               1. Acute pulmonary embolus

               2. Transfusion reaction
