  <brief_summary>

      Prospective, multicentric, comparative, non randomised, in current care.

      Primary objective:

        -  To evaluate the incidence of hypothyroidism in breast cancer patients treated by
           radiotherapy including the supra-clavicular area over a period of 5 years (60 months).

      Secondary objectives :

        -  To calculate the dose of irradiation received by thyroid gland during the treatment.

        -  To compare the rate of incidence of hypothyroidism in women who received a
           supra-clavicular irradiation (group 1)and in those who did not (group 2).

        -  To estimate and compare the rate of incidence of chronic thyroid lesions in the 2
           groups.

        -  To look for predictive factors of hypothyroidism de novo in group 1 women particularly
           regarding the dose-volume parameters.

        -  To propose recommendations for the thyroid follow-up after supra-clavicular irradiation.

      Prospective, multicentric, comparative, non randomised, in current care study

      2 patient groups, non randomised, according to the necessity or not to perform a
      supra-clavicular irradiation:

        -  Group 1 : patients receiving a supra-clavicular irradiation

        -  Group 2 : patients not receiving a supra-clavicular irradiation.

      Schedule

      Projected inclusion duration of 18 months (duration to possibly adapt in order to obtain the
      number of required patients)

      Intermediate study of the results in 30 months

      Duration of follow-up of 60 months
