  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an international, multi-center, prospective, randomized, open-label Phase 3 clinical
      trial of the cancer stemness inhibitor napabucasin administered with weekly paclitaxel versus
      weekly paclitaxel alone in patients with advanced non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer who
      have disease progression following systemic treatment with a platinum-based combination
      regimen in the metastatic setting, who have received treatment with an immune checkpoint
      inhibitor if a candidate, additional approved therapies, and for whom weekly paclitaxel is an
      acceptable treatment option.
