  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In brief, this research is a prospective, feasibility study to evaluate the use of Betashot-
      a medium chain triglyceride- based (MCT) food for special medical purposes (FSMP) in children
      and adults diagnosed with epilepsy.

      MCT is a type of dietary fat used in the ketogenic diet.

      This study aims to explore the use of Betashot in a group of children and adults with
      epilepsy who are consuming their normal diets, but limiting intakes of foods high in
      carbohydrate and sugars.

      The participants will be required to drink Betashot to enable the following assessment:

        1. Tolerance (side effects such as bloating or cramps)

        2. Acceptability (flavour, texture, taste)

        3. Compliance (how easy it is to use Betashot at the advised quantity, as part of their
           daily diet)

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Children aged 3-18 years with symptoms of epilepsy continuing despite adequate levels
             of anti-epileptic medication, either with a diagnosis of Dravet syndrome or another
             early onset epilepsy, the result of a genetic mutation.

             anti-epileptic medication.

          2. Participant/Parent/guardian to comply with the study protocol and participate in
             active monitoring of tolerance, acceptability and compliance of Betashot via a written
             record, and to complete questionnaires.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Children &lt; 3 years of age
