    <textblock>
      By use of several questionaires, this study aimed at an investigation of the changes in
      motivation, symptoms, self-esteem and coping style in adolescent patients with anorexia
      nervosa.. The psychometric properties of the Anorexia Nervosa Stages of Change Questionnaire
      (ANSOCQ) and its relation to coping style and self-esteem were assessed. After a treatment
      period of nine months, clinical AN diagnosis and the body mass index (BMI) were re-assessed.
      Besides construct validity of the ANSOCQ, its predictive validity in terms of predicting the
      outcome of AN was assessed.

      N=92 adolescents referred to an eating disorders clinic meeting criteria for anorexia nervosa
      (AN) gave written informed consent to participate in this study and completed the ANSOCQ, the
      Eating Disorder Inventory (EDI-2), the Eating Attitudes Test (EAT), the Body Image
      Questionnaire (BIQ), two questionnaires measuring Self-Related Cognitions (SRC) and the
      Coping Across Situations Questionnaire (CASQ). After a treatment period of nine months,
