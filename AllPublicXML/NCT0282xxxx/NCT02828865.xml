  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Liver cancer including primary hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and metastatic liver cancers is
      one the most common malignancies in the world. Over 10000 new cases per year are diagnosed in
      Taiwan. Despite the many treatment options, the prognosis of HCC remains dismal. More than
      8000 people died of this cancer every year in Taiwan. A majority (70% to 85%) of patients
      present with advanced or unresectable disease. In contrast, small liver cancers can be cured
      with an appreciable frequency. Five-year disease-free survival exceeding 50% has been
      reported for surgical resection, and for the inoperable patients who do not have vascular
      invasion or extrahepatic spread. Radiofrequency ablation (RFA) is recommended as an
      alternative curative therapy. However, the main drawback of RFA is its limitation to tumor
      size and location. The tumors larger than 5 cm in diameter or located adjacent to vessels,
      could not be ablated completely sometimes.

      Irreversible electroporation (IRE), developed and manufactured by AngioDynamics US Ltd, can
      ablate tumor by fenestrating the cancer cell membrane by electric pulse. The anti-tumor
      effect does not result from thermotherapy, so is also not diminished by adjacent vessels.
      Several pre-clinical studies have already demonstrated IRE is a safe and effective treatment
      for live cancers. The system has been approved as safe by the European Union (EU) in 2008 and
      received Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval in 2010. However, there are still few
      experiences in using IRE for tumor ablation in Taiwan. In this study, the investigators will
      perform IRE for 40 inoperable patients with liver cancers adjacent to vessels who are
      suitable to receive radiofrequency ablation (RFA) in the investigators hospital. The
      investigators will evaluate the potential side effect and ablate effect of tumors by
      abdominal computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and the investigators
      will also follow-up this patients for 2 years to evaluate the overall survival and local
      recurrence rate. The investigators will appraisal the clinical feasibility and advantage of
      the system by this study.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        Patients must meet all of the following inclusion criteria to be eligible for this study:

          1. The diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) or metastatic liver cancers with
             pathologic proven, and the diagnosis of HCC will be made by pathology / cytology or
             according to the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD) (2010)
             diagnostic criteria. In brief, Nodules larger than 1 cm found on ultrasound screening
             of a cirrhotic liver should be investigated further with either tri-phase
             multidetector computed tomography (CT) scan or dynamic contrast enhanced magnetic
             resonance imaging (MRI). If the appearances are typical of HCC (i.e., hypervascular in
             the arterial phase with washout in the portal venous or delayed phase), the lesion
             should be treated as HCC. If the findings are not characteristic or the vascular
             profile is not typical, a second contrast enhanced study with the other imaging
             modality should be performed, or the lesion should be biopsied. Biopsies of small
             lesions should be evaluated by expert pathologists. Tissue that is not clearly HCC
             should be stained with all the available markers including cluster of differentiation
             34 (CD34), cytokeratin 7 (CK7), glypican 3, heat shock protein 70 (HSP70), and
             glutamine synthetase to improve diagnostic accuracy.
