  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To compare the clinical outcomes of Endoscopic Lung Volume Reduction using Pulmonx Zephyr
      Endobronchial Valve (EBV) vs. Standard of Care (SoC) in the treatment of heterogeneous
      emphysema patients in a controlled trial design setting.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this prospective, randomized, controlled, one-way crossover study is to assess and
      compare the efficacy of the Zephyr endobronchial valves vs. Standard of Care (SoC) in
      patients suffering from COPD with Heterogeneous Emphysema. Patients will be followed up for 6
      months after randomization. Patients in the SoC arm will crossover to the EBV treatment arm
      after the 6-month visit and will be followed up for 6 additional months.The primary objective
      is the variation of FEV1 between baseline and 3-month follow-up visit. The secondary
      objectives will evaluate quality of life, exercise capacity, dyspnea (including BODE index)
      changes, target lobe volume reduction, as well as safety outcomes.
