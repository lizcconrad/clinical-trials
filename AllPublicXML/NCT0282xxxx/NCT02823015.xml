  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Persistent pain after breast cancer surgery (PPBCS) is a significant clinical problem,
      affecting between 25 and 50% of patients. Several factors are associated with the development
      of PPBCS, including acute postoperative pain. The analysis of pain trajectories through mixed
      model modeling is an alternative to static pain measures, improving precision and providing
      information on the time course of pain resolution. Our aim was to investigate if the
      characteristics of pain trajectories during the first postoperative week are correlated with
      the persistence of pain 3 months after breast cancer surgery.
