      Proteus Discover to lower blood pressure and glycated hemoglobin in patients with
      uncontrolled hypertension and type 2 diabetes.

      &quot;Cardiometabolic diseases&quot; as defined in this protocol refer to diseases that increase risk
      for cardiovascular disease. ProteusÂ® Digital Health is operationally defining cardiometabolic
      (CMB) conditions for this study as including hypertension, type 2 diabetes, and
      hypercholesterolemia. The prevalence of metabolic diseases is growing. Factors contributing
      to this rise include the obesity epidemic and the aging population. In particular, because of
      the costs and risk of complications associated with diabetes and hypertension, many health
      systems and payers are increasing focus on interventions to reduce the burden of these
      diseases.

      The purpose of the study was to evaluate the ability of a new digital health offering,
      Proteus Discover to lower blood pressure and glycated hemoglobin in patients with
      uncontrolled hypertension and type 2 diabetes.

      The study enrolled subjects with uncontrolled hypertension and type 2 diabetes failing at
      least 2 antihypertensives and metformin and/or a sulfonylurea. Subjects were randomized to
      one of 3 arms: use of Proteus Discover for 4 weeks, use of Proteus Discover for 12 weeks, or
      usual care.

      Subjects randomized to the intervention arms, used a digital health offering to (1) provide
      automatic and passive electronic documentation of medication adherence and patterns of
      medication taking, (2) assist providers in distinguishing inadequate medication adherence or
      pharmacologic unresponsiveness as the root cause for uncontrolled hypertension and type 2
      diabetes, and (3) inform management decisions (dose adjustment, medication addition or
      substitution, adherence counseling, referral to a hypertension specialist).

      Subjects randomized to usual care, received usual medical care such as medication changes,
      adherence counseling, and lifestyle coaching. Providers could also schedule additional visits
      without restrictions.

      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Adults (18 to 75 years old) who are diagnosed with essential hypertension and type 2
             diabetes mellitus with or without hypercholesterolemia (defined as taking statin
             therapy).

          -  Both hypertension and diabetes are suboptimally controlled at Screening:

               1. SBP is â¥ 140 mm Hg (and his/her BP goal is &lt; 140/90 mm Hg).

               2. A1C is â¥ 7% and â¤ 11% at Screening (A1C is above goal by â¥ 0.5%).

          -  On a stable anti-hypertensive regimen (on current regimen for at least 30 days) with
             at least 2 anti-hypertensive medications

          -  Ability to manage the subject during the 12-week study with anti-hypertensive
             medication(s) and dose forms (or same drug classes and comparable doses for Usual Care
             subjects) used within the study.

          -  Currently on metformin and/or glipizide for diabetes for at least the past 60 days
             prior to Screening. Subjects can be managed on other noninsulin diabetes medicines
             (including sulfonylureas other than glipizide) during the study.

          -  Subjects must have a Proteus test pill (IS used to test that the Proteus Patch is
             correctly placed on the body and paired with the mobile device) detected as part of
             onboarding on the Proteus device (during the Proteus Onboarding Visit).

          -  In the Investigator's opinion inadequate medication adherence is a potential factor in
             the subject's uncontrolled hypertension or diabetes.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  BMI &gt; 40 kg/m2 as subjects may be more likely to have secondary reasons for out of
             control blood pressure (BP) and/or diabetes.

          -  History of skin sensitivity to adhesive medical tape or metals for subjects in the
             Intervention Arms.

          -  History of acute or chronic dermatitis for subjects in the Intervention Arms.

          -  Any condition that in the investigator's opinion could preclude safe participation in
             the study.

          -  Secondary cause for hypertension (eg, renal impairment or renal artery stenosis) or
             uncontrolled diabetes (eg, corticosteroid use).

          -  Mean SBP â¥ 180 mm Hg and/or DBP â¥ 110 mm Hg, if associated with evidence of
             hypertensive emergency..

          -  Current or recent (within past year) treatment with insulin or other injectables for
             diabetes.
