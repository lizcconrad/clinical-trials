  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multi-center, randomized, open-label, parallel-arm phase IV clinical study, for
      which a total of 300 patients with mild to moderate knee osteoarthritis will be enrolled. In
      the first 4 weeks (run-in period), the subjects will receive on-demand treatment with
      Diclofenac Sodium Sustained Release Tablets (DICL-SR) 75mg, quaque die（QD）. After the run-in
      period, the subjects, if their knee pain has not worsened to a level requiring surgical
      treatment, will be randomized to two groups in 1:1 ratio: one group receiving Artz® via
      intra-articular injection (once weekly, for 5 consecutive weeks) in combination with DICL-SR
      75mg,quaque die（QD）, for 12 consecutive weeks on demand. The other group receiving DICL-SR
      75mg alone,quaque die（QD）, for 12 consecutive weeks on demand. DICL-SR 75mg quaque die（QD）
      may be administered to the subjects of both groups on demand as long as they have a knee
      pain. If the knee pain has disappeared, this drug may be withdrawn. However, if the pain
      occurs again and requires treatment, oral administration of DICL-SR may be resumed. A subject
      is allowed to withdraw from this study prematurely if unable to tolerate the adverse effects.

      A total of 8 visits have been scheduled for this study, including Visit 1/screening period
      (Week -4), Visit 2/baseline (Week 0), Visit 3 (Week 1), Visit 4 (Week 2), Visit 5 (Week 3),
      Visit 6 (Week 4), Visit 7 (Week 8) and Visit 8 (Week 12).

      A total of 300 subjects will participate in this study at 6 to 8 centers in China, and
      patient enrollment is expected to take up to 12 months.

    <description>Each syringe (2.5mL) contains 25mg of sodium hyaluronate, and one Artz® will be administered via intra-articular injection into the target knee at the baseline and Weeks 1, 2, 3 and 4 respectively for the combination group.
From the run-in period to the end of study, both groups will receive DICL-SR 75mg, which is administered on demand for treatment of knee pain. If the knee pain is relieved or has disappeared, DICL-SR may be withdrawn. However, if the pain occurs again and requires treatment, the drug may be resumed. If a dose of 75mg daily fails to control the knee pain, it may be increased to the maximum dose 150mg daily upon the approval of the investigator, that is, 75mg bis in die（BID） daily</description>
