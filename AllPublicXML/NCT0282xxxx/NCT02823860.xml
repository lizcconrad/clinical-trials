  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To access to good quality biological samples is a prerequisite for high level translational
      research. The BIG-RENAPE study has been established by the French hyperthermic
      intraperitoneal chemotherapy centers involved in the management of peritoneal surface
      malignancies.

      The main BIG-RENAPE study aim is to create a large multicentric and prospective repository
      for biological and tissue samples, which will provide a source of materials for a wide array
      of health related research studies - BIG-RENAPE Biobank-based research: i) validating known
      and promising biomarkers; ii) identifying new predictive and prognostic factors; iii)
      evaluating the impact of current health care strategies; iv) standardizing diagnostic and
      therapeutic management through guidelines; v) developing new drugs.

      The BIG-RENAPE Biobank is certified according to NFS 96-900 as a service of processing,
      storage and transfer of high quality biological (plasma, serum, buffy coat) and tissue
      (formalin-fixed-paraffin-embedded) samples. Biospecimens are collected at each stage of
      diagnostic and therapeutic care. The patient and his derivates are anonymized and registered
      in a national web database reporting disease status, treatments, surgical procedures,
      pathological diagnosis, quality of life's assessment and long term follow-up. All
      participants have given their informed consent before any sample. The BIG-RENAPE study was
      approved by the local Ethical Committee, based on the assessed compliance to French
      regulatory rules.

    <description>Resistance to treatments (systemic and intraperitoneal chemotherapy, surgical procedures and targeted therapies) in patients treated for digestive peritoneal carcinomatosis is defined as a change of therapeutic strategy decided during a multidisciplinary meeting.
The biological and tumoral factors related to resistance of oncological treatments will be identified from the laboratory tests results and histological analyses.
Biospecimens types: serum, plasma, buffy coat and formalin-fixed-paraffin-embedded (FFPE).
Biospecimens are collected at various stages of diagnostic and therapeutic care</description>

    <description>The Medical Outcomes Study Social Support Survey (MOS-SSS) is used as a self-administered measure of functional social support for chronically ill persons. The 19 items cover four domains (emotional/informational support, tangible support, positive social interaction, and affection).</description>

    <description>The EORTC QLQ-C30 is a questionnaire developed to assess the quality of life of cancer patients. It incorporates nine multi-item scales: five functional scales (physical, role, cognitive, emotional, and social); three symptom scales (fatigue, pain, and nausea and vomiting); and a global health and quality-of-life scale.
The QLQ-CR29 was administered with the QLQ-C30 core questionnaire. It is meant for use among colorectal cancer patients varying in disease stage and treatment modality. The module comprises 29 questions assessing the colorectal cancer-specific symptom scales (disease symptoms, side effects of treatment) and functional scales (body image, sexuality, and future perspective).
The QLQ-STO22 was administered with the QLQ-C30 core questionnaire. The QLQ-STO22 module contains 22 items regarding dysphagia, pain, reflux, eating restrictions, anxiety, dry mouth, body image, and hair loss.</description>
