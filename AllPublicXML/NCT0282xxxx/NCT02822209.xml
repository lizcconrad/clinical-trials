  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The prognosis of patients with lung cancer is related to the stage of the diagnosis : 73% of
      one-year-survival rate at stage IA and only 13% one-year-survival rate at stage IV.
      Controlling the timelines in a care program seems crucial to improve prognosis of lung
      cancer.

      The project aims to evaluate the impact of a coordinating nurse (CN) in a personalized care
      program for patients of thoracic oncology.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      New strategies therapeutics result in a longer survival rate. However their side effects
      affect the patient's quality of life. Even if these side effects are ambulatory manageable,
      they require to be treated promptly and tends to increase the active list of patients of the
      thoracic oncology.

      Due to the alteration in the care provided to lung cancer patient, there is a need to
      coordinate the available means, inside and outside the hospital, to improve the quality of
      care and the quality of life of the patient.

      Every patient of the thoracic oncology department receives a personalized care program as a
      routine practice. In this study, a coordinating nurse (CN) will be added to the personalized
      care program. Patients newly diagnosed with a lung cancer will be randomized either in the
      group with a CN or in the group without a CN.

      The study will last one year maximum for each participant. Their quality of life, their
      satisfaction of the quality of the personalized care program - and their general
      practitioner's satisfaction - will be evaluated throughout the study.

    <description>The coordinating nurse (CN) is dedicated to the newly diagnosed patient to optimize their personalized care program.
The CN is the connection between the medical team and the patient. They act according to the instructions from the multidisciplinary staff in charge of bronchopulmonary cancer patients.:
e.g. Schedule an exam or an hospitalization, collect and share results of useful information to correct treatment's side effects etc
Main contact of the patient, the general practitioner and the patient's relatives, they give practical information for the patient's case
Quality of life questionnaires - EORTC QLQ-C30 and EORTC QLQ-LC13 - completed by the patient throughout the study.
