      The objective was to identify factors associated with the normalization of the CD4/CD8 ratio
      (&gt;=1) in patients with a history of primary HIV infection (PHI) and long-term combined
      antiretroviral therapy (cART).

    <description>The lymphocytes immunophenotyping were performed from fresh EDTA-anticoagulated blood harvested during a routine follow-up of patients in HIV Lyon centers.
HIV patients with a known history of PHI and a minimum of 2 years of effective cART (&lt; 200 copies/mL) without interruption or virological failure were included in 2 centers in Lyon (Croix-Rousse and Edouard Herriot hospital).
Baseline factors at the time of PHI, delay, type and duration of first and duration of total cART, CMV status, nadir CD4 cells count and level of activation markers on CD4 and CD8 cells (CD38 and HLA-DR) at the time of the study were assessed.
Patients with hepatitis C or B virus co-infection or with a history of neoplasia or immunosuppressive therapy after the date of PIH were excluded.</description>
