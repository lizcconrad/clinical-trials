  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cisplatin and ifosfamide are commonly used drugs in chemotherapy. They are known to involve
      renal toxic threats in children given their immature kidney. This toxicity is increased
      especially after nephrectomy and/or concomitant radiotherapy. In pediatric oncology, the
      available evaluation methods of the renal function could be very restrictive to perform on
      children. In this study, the investigators intend to test the use of the cystatin C as an
      effective and reliable biological marker of renal toxicity in children treated with cisplatin
      and / or ifosfamide.

      Cisplatin and ifosfamide are commonly used drugs in chemotherapy. They are known to involve
      renal toxic threats in children given their immature kidney. This toxicity is increased
      especially after nephrectomy and/or concomitant radiotherapy. In pediatric oncology, the
      evaluation of the renal function is carried out according to the clinical trial protocols and
      to the center practices. To date, the standard methods (eg. creatinine clearance), as well as
      the available predictive formula (eg. Schwartz formula) are not well adapted to monitor
      children renal function. Indeed, the reliability of these methods depends on several
      parameters such as the diet and the muscle mass and could be very restrictive to perform on
      children. To circumvent these practical difficulties, the investigators intend to use the
      cystatin C as a biological marker of renal toxicity in children treated with cisplatin and /
      or ifosfamide. This cysteine protease has witnessed an upsurge of interest as an endogenous
      glomerular filtration rate marker and could be a good candidate to assess tubular toxicity
      when measured in urine.

      This study aims to describe the kinetic of the appearance of the urinary cystatin C and
      explore its proprieties as an early and cost-effective marker for glomerular and tubular
      renal toxicity in children. In addition, this method could allow enhancing the calculation
      models routinely used for glomerular filtration rate.

    <description>Urinary and blood cystatin C are sampled in patient with nephrotoxic risks before the treatment beginning, after the first course of chemotherapy, in the middle and at the end of the treatment. A follow up assessment is also required at 2 and 5 years. The cystatin C measurements are compared to traditional nephrology markers. Their sampling requires additional blood and urinary collection but involve minimal risks for patient.</description>
