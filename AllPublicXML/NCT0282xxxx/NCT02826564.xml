  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of the proposed research project is to assess the safety (dose limiting toxicity,
      DLT) of the combination of pembrolizumab and high-dose stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT)
      in patients with metastatic urothelial cancer. Both the SBRT dose and pembrolizumab dose will
      be fixed, but the timing of the combination will be varied. Secondary objectives include
      response rates, local control, progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS).
      Exploratory endpoints include immunologic responses and response rates in PD-L1- TIL- tumors.
      The combination sequence with the most promising response rates and the best safety profile
      will be selected to continue in a Phase II trial.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        The subject must be excluded from participating in the trial if the subject:

          1. Is currently participating and receiving study therapy or has participated in a study
             of an investigational agent and received study therapy or used an investigational
             device within 4 weeks of the first dose of treatment.

          2. Has had radiotherapy interfering with SBRT.

          3. Has a diagnosis of immunodeficiency or is receiving systemic steroid therapy or any
             other form of immunosuppressive therapy within 7 days prior to the first dose of trial
             treatment.

          4. Has a known history of active TB (Bacillus Tuberculosis)

          5. Hypersensitivity to pembrolizumab or any of its excipients.

             Day 1 or who has not recovered (i.e., ≤ Grade 1 or at baseline) from adverse events
             due to agents administered more than 4 weeks earlier.

          7. Has had prior chemotherapy, targeted small molecule therapy, or radiation therapy
             within 2 weeks prior to study Day 1 or who has not recovered (i.e., ≤ Grade 1 or at

                  may qualify for the study.

               -  Note: If subject received major surgery, they must have recovered adequately from
                  the toxicity and/or complications from the intervention prior to starting

             that might confound the results of the trial, interfere with the subject's
             participation for the full duration of the trial, or is not in the best interest of
             the subject to participate, in the opinion of the treating investigator.

         14. Has known psychiatric or substance abuse disorders that would interfere with
             cooperation with the requirements of the trial.

         15. Is pregnant or breastfeeding, or expecting to conceive or father children within the
             projected duration of the trial, starting with the pre-screening or screening visit
             through 120 days after the last dose of trial treatment.

         16. Has received prior therapy with an anti-PD-1, anti-PD-L1, or anti-PD-L2 agent.

         17. Has a known history of Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) (HIV 1/2 antibodies).

         18. Has known active Hepatitis B (e.g., HBsAg reactive) or Hepatitis C (e.g., HCV RNA
             [qualitative] is detected).

         19. Has received a live vaccine within 30 days of planned start of study therapy. Note:
             Seasonal influenza vaccines for injection are generally inactivated flu vaccines are
