      to evalute if therapeutic alliance is related to adherence in JIA
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The therapeutic alliance is the agreement that is being built between doctor and patient
      during the construction process of care. So active collaboration based on a shared assessment
      of issues and agreement on possible solutions. Initially described in psychiatry, this
      analytical concept has been extended to several chronic diseases in particular requiring more
      often a strong link between doctor and patient. His measure is important since it has been
      demonstrated by several previous studies that the therapeutic alliance is predictive of the
      therapeutic effects of treatment. This alliance, however, was little studied in juvenile
      idiopathic arthritis, its connection with the observance or the quality of life has never
      been evaluated.

      The chronic nature of juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) requires a strong ability of the
      child to follow his treatment, where the role of parents going to be important and where the
      relationship built with the caregiver is also essential.

      Adherence is a complex concept for which there is no ideal measure. Direct evaluation
      criteria such as bioassays prove still incomplete and difficult to implement in observational
      studies. Indirect measures have been developed through self-administered questionnaires and
      literature showed their relatively good correlation with actual catches. The innovative
      hypothesis of this research is that a better therapeutic alliance is associated with better
      adherence child in JIA.

    <measure>Relationship between therapeutic alliance and compliance judged by the child ( CarQ Questionnaire) and parent ( PARQ Questionnaire).</measure>
    <time_frame>at inclusion</time_frame>
    <description>Several questionnaires (6-8) measure the alliance in adults and have shown the link between early alliance and therapeutic efficacy and especially the need to measure not made by the therapist but by the treatment. Then the scores were developed in children where the alliance is special since the role of the adult, the parent is part of the monitoring and assistance to the acceptance of the disease and guarantee the continuity of care . Among them, the HQA I was designed to examine the child-parent-caregiver triad. The HQA-CP score (Helping questionnaires Alliance for Child and Parents) is derived from this score. HQA-CP was validated in French by Kermarrec et al.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Quality of Life (CHAQ Questionnaire )</measure>
    <time_frame>at inclusion</time_frame>
    <description>The quality of life related to health is important to consider in children in JIA. It can be modified by the treatment, and many other non-medical factors, some limit adherence. Research has shown that better adherence to treatment was associated with a better quality of life. The quality of life is typically measured by the validated CHAQ in French since 2001. It includes 30 items divided into eight areas rated from 0 to 3. It has been validated for different age groups.</description>

      <textblock>
        Children with Juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) and aged from 8 to 18 years, that have
        been akready seen more than 2 times in consultation by the same practitioner.

        Treatment is based on the non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, corticosteroids or
        immunosuppressant therapy and due to chronic nature of JIA, it requires a strong ability of
        the child to follow his treatment. The role of parents going to be important and the
        relationship built with the caregiver is essential. As much as in adults, and can be more
        complex way the question of adherence / therapeutic adherence.
