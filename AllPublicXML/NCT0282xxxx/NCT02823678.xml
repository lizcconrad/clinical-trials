      This study will enroll 100 patients scheduled to undergo a pancreatectomy.

      The primary objective is to develop a scoring system using pancreatic volume measured by CT
      scan and intraoperative measurements of the pancreas parenchyma to predict the onset of
      diabetes mellitus after a pancreatectomy. The investigators will also monitor patients with
      pre-existing diabetes to see if their diabetes worsens or improves.
