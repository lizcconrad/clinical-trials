  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The composition and metabolism of human gut microbiota play crucial roles in health.
      Microbial colonisation of the gastrointestinal tract varies widely, with the large intestine
      having not only the highest density of microbes in terms of bacterial cells per gram but also
      the most metabolically active microbial community. Genetics, mode of birth, infant feeding
      patterns, antibiotic usage, sanitary living conditions and long term dietary habits
      contribute towards shaping the composition of the gut microbiome. Diet clearly has a major
      impact on variation in the gut microbiota composition, and this can be detected in faecal
      samples after only a few days. The bacterial metabolism of dietary components produces much
      chemical diversity in the large intestine with protective or detrimental effects on disease
      development.

      Dietary protein levels are relatively high in western European populations, up to 103g/d, as
      reported by Food and Agriculture Organization. This may result in high levels, entering the
      large gut where it can become a substrate for proteolytic bacteria. Protein specifically can
      provide nutrition for microorganisms but metabolites from bacterial protein breakdown can be
      detrimental. Protein intake from the diet might not be the only source of microbial
      proteolysis; the human body also secretes considerable amounts of protein into the digestive
      lumen which can potentially be used by the microflora. On the contrary, end products of
      carbohydrate metabolism can be positive for health. In this context, prebiotics are
      carbohydrates that are resistant to digestion and can become available for bacteria in the
      colon to produce short chain fatty acids and inhibit the production of harmful metabolites. A
      switch towards more carbohydrate metabolism in the colon, at the expense of proteolysis
      therefore has positive capacity through the production of more benign metabolites.

      Rationale for design Prebiotics are dietary ingredients that target carbohydrate digesting
      bacteria only. Given the high intake levels of protein in Western populations, they may be
      useful to modulate the composition/activity of the microbial gut ecology for improved health.

      Among prebiotic nutrients, inulin-type fructans (ITF) are well characterized and their
      administration promotes growth of beneficial microorganisms like Bifidobacterium spp. .These
      microorganisms are involved in the reduction of intestinal endotoxin concentration, improve
      glucose tolerance, exert benefits upon immune function and inhibit pathogens. In healthy
      individuals, ITF intake promotes satiety and modulates gut peptides regulating food intake.

      The aim of the present study is to investigate the effect of inulin-type fructans (ITF) on
      the negative consequences of colonic fermentation in individuals consuming high protein
      diets. The hypothesis to be tested is that their action promotes carbohydrate degrading
      bacteria at the expense of protein utilisers.

    <description>Changes in faecal bacterial populations will be assessed through the use of fluorescence in situ hybridisation with molecular probes targeting 16S rRNA genes. Genotypic probes targeting the predominant components of the gut microflora (Bacteroides, Bifidobacterium, Clostridium, Lactobacillus, Eubacterium, Atopobacterium, sulphate reducing bacteria and enterobacteria) and total bacteria will be tagged with fluorescent markers such that quantifiable changes may be determined.</description>
