    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to determine bioequivalence between two different formulations
      of lamotrigine extended release tablets (one reference product and one generic product) in a
      healthy adult population, following a single oral dose under fed conditions.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a single center, randomized, open-label, single dose, two treatment, four-period,
      two-sequence, fully replicated crossover design in the fed state.

      The study will include two treatments:

        -  Treatment-A: One dose of Lamotrigine extended-release tablet (Test) administered in the
           morning after a 10-hour overnight fast and 30 minutes after the start of a high-fat,
           high-calorie breakfast.

        -  Treatment-B: One dose of Lamictal XR extended-release tablet (Reference) administered in
           the morning after a 10 hour overnight fast and 30 minutes after the start of a high-fat,
           high-calorie breakfast.

      A total of 30 healthy subjects will be dosed to ensure that at least 24 subjects will
      complete the 4-period replicate design. For each treatment period, subjects will be confined
      from the day prior to dosing until approximately 48 hours post-dose. Subjects will return to
      the clinical site for the remaining blood samples. There will be a minimum 14-day washout
      between doses.

      Subject participation from the Screening Visit to the Follow-Up Visit will be approximately
      71 days.

                  childbearing potential.

         10. A male study subject must agree to use one of the accepted contraceptive regimens
             during the study and for at least 90 days after the last dose of the study medication;
