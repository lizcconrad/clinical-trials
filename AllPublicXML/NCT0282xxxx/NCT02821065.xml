  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Modern technology like computers, smartphones and the Internet enable patients to measure
      certain health indicators, like blood pressure and body weight, from the comfort of their own
      homes. This information can also be shared electronically with doctors and other healthcare
      providers to monitor remotely. This is called home health monitoring. In TEC4Home, we are
      developing a home monitoring solution for patients with heart failure to support their care
      and recovery at home after a visit to the emergency department. We hope to show that this
      solution decreases revisits to the emergency department and increases quality of life for
      patients.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        PATIENT PARTICIPANTS:

          -  Have one or more typical symptoms of Heart Failure (i.e. dyspnoea at rest or minimal
             exertion (includes orthopnoea, reduced exercise tolerance)) AND

          -  Have one or more typical signs of Heart Failure (i.e. elevated jugular venous
             pressure, pulmonary crepitations, pleural effusions, peripheral oedema) AND

          -  Have one or more objective measures of heart failure:

        Radiological congestion.

          -  Elevated BNP ≥ 400 pg/mL or NT-proBNP ≥ 1000 pg/mL.

          -  Reduced left ventricular ejection fraction &lt;40% (or &lt;45%) in previous 12 months.

        Diastolic dysfunction including tissue Doppler E/e' ratio &gt; 15 in previous 12 months.

          -  Pulmonary capillary wedge pressure &gt;20 mmHg.

          -  Diuretic therapy. The additional value of diuretic therapy (IV or oral) is debatable,
             as presumably unlikely (or unsafe) that patient with genuine HF will be discharged
             without diuretic.

        CLINICIAN PARTICIPANTS:

        To be eligible to participate, clinician participants (i.e. ED physicians, family
        physicians and monitoring nurse(s)) must have referred or have a patient enrolled in the
        TEC4Home monitoring service.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        PATIENT PARTICIPANTS:

          -  Physical barriers e.g. unable to stand on scales.

          -  Cognitive impairment (e.g. MMSE &lt;20), unless suitable caregiver support.

          -  Language (must be able to read and understand English), unless suitable caregiver
             support.

          -  Documented history of current and active substance misuse (within 3 months).

          -  Lack digital connectivity or landline phone connection.

          -  No regular care provider e.g. GP, or at least regular walk-in clinic.

          -  Existing intensive system of care: LVAD, transplant, dialysis.

          -  Anticipated improvement due to revascularization (PCI/CABG) or valve intervention
             during index hospitalization.

          -  Anticipated survival &lt;90 days. Active palliative care, less-than level III care,
             disseminated malignancy.

        CLINICIAN PARTICIPANTS:

        Clinicians who do not have patients enrolled in the TEC4Home service or who themselves are
        not involved in the implementation or operation of the TEC4Home monitoring service will not
        be eligible to participate.
