  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Many cognitive functions in human are based on asymmetric brain networks. For most adults,
      language is processed largely by the left hemisphere while other auditory treatments, such as
      voice recognition are rather based on the right hemisphere. Many studies helped to highlight
      the presence of anatomical and functional asymmetries both in the first months of life. What
      are the causes of these imbalances? How do they develop? Are they necessary for operation or
      for effective learning?

      The investigators would like in this work, in collaboration with applied mathematics team of
      Compi√®gne and INSERM team, to determine from which period the development of hemispheric
      dominance is set up for recognition of language and in which brain structure it occurs in
      preterm infants whose sound environment is usually very different from that of the fetus. The
      impact of this environment on brain development of infants and their early learning will be
      assessed.
