      Multicenter, open-label, prospective designed study to characterize the performance of brain
      laser interstitial thermal therapy (LITT) ablation using the Monteris NeuroBlate System for
      the treatment of drug-refractory medial temporal lobe epilepsy in subjects who are candidates
      for LITT surgery.

    <textblock>
      Monteris is sponsoring this multicenter, open-label, prospective feasibility study to
      characterize the performance of laser interstitial thermal therapy (LITT) using the Monteris
      NeuroBlate System for the treatment of drug-refractory medial temporal lobe epilepsy in
      subjects who are candidates for LITT surgery.

      The NeuroBlate System uses precise, high-intensity laser light to initiate necrosis of
      abnormal brain tissue through thermal ablation while limiting injury to healthy tissue.
      Unlike traditional brain surgery, LITT does not require a large opening in the skull.

      Subjects who meet the study eligibility criteria and sign the informed consent form will
      undergo the LITT procedure. Subjects, or their caregivers, are required to keep a seizure
      diary throughout the study, beginning after surgery. The study will monitor and record
      subjects' seizure frequency, antiepileptic medications, and physical and emotional health.

      Subjects treated with NeuroBlate will have 2 years of follow-up. Throughout study
      participation, the study investigator will continuously monitor and document both
      effectiveness and safety data at study appointments.
