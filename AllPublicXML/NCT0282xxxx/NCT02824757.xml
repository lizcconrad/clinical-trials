    <textblock>
      This study is aimed at exploring the effects of glucocorticoids on glucose metabolism in
      patients with interstitial lung disease. Patients with interstitial lung disease who is on
      the medication of 15mg prednisolone and 7.5mg prednisolone conduct the continuous glucose
      monitoring (CGM). The data attained from the CGM are used to define the glycemic
      characteristics in patients using glucocorticoids and the difference of glucose features due
      to different doses.

      Patients diagnosed of interstitial lung disease and treating with glucocorticoids could be
      enrolled in this clinical trial. Those who is in an acute inflammatory phase and diagnosed
      with hemorrhagic disease should are excluded, so are those unwilling to carry the continuous
      glucose monitoring (CGM) device. When the dose of prednisolone is applied 15mg per day
      steadily and is going to be decreased, the CGM is conducted. At the same time, blood tests
      evaluating the glucose metabolism are measured, including HbA1c, GA, fasting insulin and
      fasting glucose. After taking 7.5mg prednisolone per day for 3 months, participants do the
      CGM and blood tests again to evaluate the glucose metabolism during this period. The CGM data
      could be used for the glucose evaluation, which can manifest the glucose characteristics in
      the circumstances of glucocorticoid use. By comparing the CGM data and the blood tests, the
      investigators hope to find the different features of the glucose metabolism due to different
      doses.

    <description>A group of interstitial glucose values will be attained by the CGMS, the number of which count up to more than 1000. These data will undergo statistical process.

The difference between the two group of data will be evaluated and discussed.</description>

        Interstitial lung diseases(ILD), also known as diffuse parenchymal lung diseases, are a
        group of lung diseases with similar clinical, radiological and pathological manifestation.
        The causes include connective tissue disease-associated interstitial lung diseases,
        idiopathic interstitial pneumonias, granulomatous lung disorders etc. Most patients with
        ILD are recommended to take the glucocorticoid treatment. The adverse effects of
        glucocorticoids include the glucose metabolism disorder, weight gain, high blood pressure
        and osteoporosis.
