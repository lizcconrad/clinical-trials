  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the effectiveness of an individualized video
      recording in improving adherence in home exercise programs for orthopaedic physical therapy
      patients.

      Specific aims:

      1. Evaluate whether individualized video recordings improve adherence with home exercise
      programs (HEP) as compared with conventional printed instructions measured by a self-report
      exercise log. (1-tail analysis)
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This investigation will focus on the specific issues surrounding adherence to the use of
      individualized video recordings via smartphone versus conventional printed instructions in
      patients with orthopaedic injuries. The data reported will be used to explore the feasibility
      and potential benefits of smartphone usage for home exercise adherence.

    <description>Data will be recorded via a self-reported exercise log that includes number of days exercises were completed per week. Participants will record the number of days participants did &quot;All&quot; of the program (defined as doing 100% of their exercises), &quot;Most&quot; of the program (defined as doing 75% of their exercises), &quot;Some&quot; of the program (defined as doing 50% of their program, and &quot;None&quot; of the program (defined as doing 0% of their exercise program).</description>

    <description>The experimental group participants will be recorded on their personal smartphone performing their prescribed exercises with individualized instruction from the participating physical therapist. The prescribing therapist will record participants on their own smartphones doing the exercise program in the clinic so that participants can have that video recording of the exercises to help remind them how to do the exercises properly at home. Participants will not be asked to record themselves performing future exercise sessions as documentation of improvement. Intervention: Home Exercise Program and Adherence Logs</description>
