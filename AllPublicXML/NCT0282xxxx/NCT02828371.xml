  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Verticalization was reported to improve the level of arousal and awareness in patients with
      severe acquired brain injury (ABI) and to be safe in ICU. The investigators evaluated the
      effectiveness of a very early stepping verticalization protocol on the functional and
      neurological outcome of patients affected by disorder of consciousness due to ABI.

      Consecutive patients with Vegetative State or Minimally Conscious State were enrolled in ICU
      on the third day after an ABI. They were randomized to undergo conventional physiotherapy
      alone or associated to fifteen 30-minute sessions of verticalization, using a tilt table with
      robotic stepping device. Once stabilized, patients were transferred to a Neurorehabilitation
      unit for an individualized treatment. Outcome measures were assessed on the third day from
      the injury (T0), at ICU discharge (T1) and at Rehab discharge (T2).

    <description>Single daily sessions of verticalization, using a tilt table with an integrated robotic stepping device (Erigo. Hocoma AG, Switzerland) located in the ICU room. Sessions were performed five times per week (Monday-Friday) for three consecutive weeks (a total of 15 sessions per patient). On the same days the patients received conventional physiotherapy for 30 minutes a day. Before the verticalization period the experimental group received conventional in-bed physiotherapy for 60 minutes a day.</description>

    <description>After patient positioning, the slope of the tilt table was gradually increased from 0° to 20°, 40° and then 60° in a time span of nine minutes. The stepping frequency was set at 20 steps/min for the entire treatment. Cardiovascular and respiratory parameters were continuously monitored. The net time of the session was 30 minutes</description>
