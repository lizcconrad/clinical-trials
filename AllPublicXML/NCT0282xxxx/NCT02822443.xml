    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of this study is to compare the efficacy of two treatment-as-usual (TAU)
      conditions: TAU with integration of emotion focused components (EFT) and TAU with focus on
      self-regulation (SR). Especially the long-term efficacy is evaluated with a focus on
      differential effects. Moreover, the mechanisms of change of both conditions are investigated.

      Background:

      &quot;General Psychotherapy&quot; postulates an ongoing process of including all interventions and
      concepts relevant for a domain, be they from other approaches to psychotherapy or concepts
      from basic science. &quot;Psychological Therapy&quot; (PT) is a therapeutic approach largely
      corresponding to the ideas of General Psychotherapy. It draws mainly on empirically validated
      interventions from Cognitive Behavior Therapy (CBT) and is based on concepts with a strong
      basis in academic psychology and neighboring fields. PT is based on explicit individual case
      conceptualization, reference to general therapeutic factors, and an explicit prescriptive
      concept for building and maintaining the therapeutic relationship. However the range of
      emotion-related interventions commonly used in PT is limited when compared with an approach
      like Emotion Focused Therapy (EFT). EFT appears thus as a suitable complement and enrichment
      to PT as commonly practiced. However, effects of integrating EFT-based interventions in a way
      that is close to common integrative practice have not yet been studied.

      Objective:

      To compare the efficacy of two treatment-as-usual (TAU) conditions: TAU with integration of
      EFT components and TAU with focus on self-regulation (SR).

      Methods:

      In Switzerland, a randomized-controlled trail will be carried out in secondary care,
      comparing the efficacy of TAU - EFT and TAU - SR for adults with major depressive disorder,
      anxiety disorder or adjustment disorder. Respondents will be followed until 36 months after
      end of therapy (measures will be taken at baseline, after 8 and after 16 weeks, at the end of
      therapy after 25 weeks, 6 months, 12 months and 36 months follow-up).
