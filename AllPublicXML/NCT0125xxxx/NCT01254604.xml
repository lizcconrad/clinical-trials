  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will test the hypothesis that preservative-free tafluprost (MK-2452) is
      non-inferior to preservative-free timolol maleate with respect to the diurnal intraocular
      pressure (IOP) change from baseline after 4 weeks of therapy in participants with open-angle
      glaucoma or ocular hypertension.

    <measure>Mean Diurnal IOP Change From Baseline at Week 4 - Study Eye</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 4</time_frame>
    <description>IOP was measured at baseline, Week 2 and Week 4 using a Goldmann applanation tonometer. At each of these visits, IOP measurement was performed at 0800, 1000 and 1600 hours. At each IOP assessment time point during a visit, 2 consecutive IOP measurements were made. If these 2 measurements differed by ≤2 mmHg, then the average of the 2 IOP values was recorded. If the 2 measurements differed by &gt;2 mmHg, then a third measurement was obtained and the median of these 3 measurements was recorded. The IOP value for a visit (e.g., Week 4) was the mean of the values recorded at the 3 time points during the visit. For each participant, one &quot;study eye&quot; was identified for data summarization and analysis for this primary efficacy outcome measure. The &quot;study eye&quot; was the eye with the higher (i.e., &quot;worse&quot;) IOP at baseline, or if both eyes had the same baseline IOP value, the right eye was designated the &quot;study eye.&quot; Change from baseline in IOP at Week 4 = Week 4 IOP value − baseline IOP value.</description>

    <measure>Number of Participants With an Adverse Event (AE)</measure>

    <description>An AE is any unfavorable and unintended change in the structure, function or chemistry of the body temporally associated with study drug administration, whether or not considered related to the study drug. Participants with one or more AEs during the study are counted once in this summary.</description>

          <title>Intraocular Pressure (IOP) - Study Eye</title>
          <description>Baseline IOP was measured at 0800, 1000 and 1600 hours; 2 values obtained at each time. If the 2 values differed by ≤2 mmHg, average of 2 was recorded; if by &gt;2 mmHg, a 3rd measurement was made and median of 3 was recorded. Baseline IOP was mean of the values recorded at the 3 time points. One “study eye” was identified, which was the eye with the higher (i.e., “worse”) IOP at baseline, or if both eyes had the same baseline IOP value, the right eye was designated the “study eye.” Data are for “Per Protocol” population: N=84, 84 and 168 for tafluprost, timolol and Total groups, respectively.</description>

        <title>Mean Diurnal IOP Change From Baseline at Week 4 - Study Eye</title>
        <description>IOP was measured at baseline, Week 2 and Week 4 using a Goldmann applanation tonometer. At each of these visits, IOP measurement was performed at 0800, 1000 and 1600 hours. At each IOP assessment time point during a visit, 2 consecutive IOP measurements were made. If these 2 measurements differed by ≤2 mmHg, then the average of the 2 IOP values was recorded. If the 2 measurements differed by &gt;2 mmHg, then a third measurement was obtained and the median of these 3 measurements was recorded. The IOP value for a visit (e.g., Week 4) was the mean of the values recorded at the 3 time points during the visit. For each participant, one “study eye” was identified for data summarization and analysis for this primary efficacy outcome measure. The “study eye” was the eye with the higher (i.e., “worse”) IOP at baseline, or if both eyes had the same baseline IOP value, the right eye was designated the “study eye.” Change from baseline in IOP at Week 4 = Week 4 IOP value − baseline IOP value.</description>
