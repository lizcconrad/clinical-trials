  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Entereg (Alvimopan) is a peripherally acting mu-opioid receptor antagonist that has been
      shown to increase postoperative bowel function in patients after open bowel resection
      surgery. It has been proven safe and effective for short-term in-house treatment. At the
      present there are several Drug Use Utilization Evaluation studies reporting results involving
      the use of alvimopan (ENTEREG) in laparoscopic bowel resection patients. However, this study
      will be the first randomized, prospective, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial looking at
      this population. We propose that Entereg will decrease the length of stay by one day in the
      laparoscopic colon resection patient. We wish to perform a voluntary, double-blinded, placebo
      controlled study. We plan an enrollment population of 250 patients. Twelve milligrams of
      Entereg will be administered 30 minutes to 5 hours pre-op followed by 12 mg BID, up to 7 days
      or 15 total doses. The primary endpoint of the study will be length of stay. The time of GI-2
      recovery (toleration of solid food and first bowel movement) and time to GI-3 recovery
      (toleration of solid food, and flatus or bowel movement) will be secondary endpoints.

      Estimated Enrollment = 250, Study Start Date: November 2010, Estimated Study Completion Date:
      May 2012, Estimated Primary Completion Date: Nov 2011.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        Subject is scheduled to undergo laparoscopic (straight or hand assisted) elective colon
        resection with primary anastamosis Subject is &gt;18 years of age Subjects can be either male
        or female Negative pregnancy test (if patient is a premenopausal female) Medically stable
        as determined by the treating surgeon- i.e., subject has an American Society of
        Anesthesiologists Physical Status Score of I to III.

        Subject understands the study procedures, agrees to participate in the study as per the
        study protocol, and has voluntarily provided informed consent Patients who will be
        receiving IV Opioid therapy post surgery for pain management.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Subject is pregnant or lactating Subject is currently using opioids or has taken more than
        3 doses of opioids (oral or parenteral) in the week prior to surgery.

        Subject has complete bowel obstruction Subject is not able to understand the informed
        consent document or is unable to give informed consent Patients who will receive a thoracic
        epidural for pain management post surgery. Subject has any medical instability or any
        condition at screening/enrollment which, in the opinion of the investigator, might confound
        the results of the study or pose additional risk to the subject during the administration
        of study procedures.
