  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The rapid scale-up of HIV care and treatment in resource-limited settings provides the
      opportunity to reach many HIV-positive individuals with prevention messages and interventions
      in care and treatment settings. However, HIV prevention is rarely incorporated into the
      routine care and treatment of people living with HIV, leaving missed opportunities to reach
      patients with critical interventions.

      This study will evaluate an HIV prevention intervention package for health care settings in
      sub-Saharan Africa. The HIV prevention intervention will be delivered to HIV-seropositive
      patients in HIV care and treatment clinics during all routine visits. Health care providers
      (HCPs) will deliver HIV prevention messages on correct and consistent condom use, disclosure
      of serostatus, partner HIV testing, adherence and alcohol reduction. They will also assess
      and treat sexually transmitted infections (STIs) and provide basic contraceptives and safer
      pregnancy counseling.

      Trained lay counselors (LCs) will deliver HIV prevention interventions in the clinics. LCs
      will be persons without medical training, many of whom will be PLHIV, who will be trained to
      provide HIV prevention counseling, promote HIV testing of partners and children (and provide
      HIV testing where allowed by national guidelines), and counsel HIV-positive patients on
      medication adherence and alcohol use.

      The prevention intervention package will be evaluated in HIV clinics in three sub-Saharan
      African countries: Kenya, Namibia, and Tanzania. This project will be a longitudinal
      group-randomized trial with 9 intervention clinics (3 per country) and 9 comparison clinics
      (3 per country). Two hundred patients per clinic (total N = 3600) will be followed for 12
      months. This evaluation will examine the effectiveness of the HIV prevention interventions
      delivered by HCPs and LCs on patient-level outcomes such as risky sexual behavior, disclosure
      of HIV status, partner HIV testing, alcohol use, HIV antiretroviral (ARV) medication
      adherence, STI treatment, pregnancies, and contraceptive use.

      In addition to the patient outcomes, the acceptability of the interventions and materials, as
      well as the feasibility of integrating the interventions into HIV care and treatment
      settings, will be assessed.

      Data will be collected via patient interviews, HCP and LC questionnaires, observations of HCP
      and LC patient visits, patient medical chart review, and review of clinic service data.
