  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Organ transplant patients and staff members at the Transplant Institute have received
      pandemic H1N1 influenza vaccine (Pandemrix) and specific antibody production was measured by
      haemagglutination inhibition according to the clinical guidelines and policy, respectively.
      This study retrospectively assessed the immune response after vaccination.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A total of 100 organ transplant patients and 36 healthy controls were included in the study.
      All individuals were vaccinated between October and November 2009 and received 2 doses of
      Pandemrix. Serum samples were collected at baseline before vaccination and 1 month after the
      first and second vaccination. Individual hemagglutination-inhibiting serum antibody titers
      were measured.Frequency of &gt; 4 -fold increase in antibody titers and seroconversion from
      non-protective prevaccination titers to protective postvaccination titers were recorded.
      Adverse events were reported.
