  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multi-centre non-interventional study of patients who are treated with any HMGCoA
      reductase inhibitor available in Croatia (rosuvastatin, simvastatin, atorvastatin and
      fluvastatin) for at least 6 months. All HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors must be prescribed in
      accordance with SmPCs approved in Croatia. Data collection for each patient will take place
      at a single visit. The investigator will complete a Case Report Form with the patient's
      demographics, the presence of the factors for high cardiovascular risk, current treatment,
      cholesterol values as well as with further treatment decision.
