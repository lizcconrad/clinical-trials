    <textblock>
      Pazopanib is a drug that inhibits proteins thought to be important for new blood vessel
      formation. This drug has been used in other cancer research studies and information from
      those studies suggests that pazopanib may help block proteins that are important for the
      growth, invasion, and spread of cancer cells.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

      - To determine the progression-free survival rate in participants with relapsed or refractory
      small cell lung cancer who have received one prior regimen of systemic chemotherapy at 8
      weeks

      Secondary

        -  To determine the response rate (as measured by RECIST 1.1 criteria and changes in blood
           flow/perfusion as measured by perfusion CT)

        -  To determine median and overall survival

        -  To characterize the toxicity profile of pazopanib in this patient population.

      Exploratory

        -  To analyze levels of circulating biomarkers from blood and urine samples obtained
           serially throughout the study and assess the utility of individual or subsets of these
           proteins to serve as a surrogate marker for treatment effect, treatment efficacy, and
           for tumor progression

        -  To measure and investigate the use of monocytes as surrogate markers of angiogenesis
           inhibition

        -  To analyze the subject population by identification of intra-tumoral biomarkers (such as
           c-kit, VEGF receptors, and microvessel density measured in available tumor biopsies)
           associated with the efficacy, safety and resistance to pazopanib

        -  To assess the utility of perfusion CT scan in evaluating changes in anti-angiogenic
           activity as a measure of treatment efficacy

      STATISTICAL DESIGN: This study uses a two-stage design to evaluate efficacy of cetuximab
      based on progression-free rate (PFR) at week 8 defined as complete response (CR), partial
      response (PR) or stable disease (SD) per RECIST 1.1 criteria. The null and alternative PFR
      are 30% and 50%. If fewer than 4 patients enrolled in the stage one cohort (n=15 patients)
      achieve SD or better than accrual would not proceed to stage two (n=15 patients). If 13 or
      more patients are progression-free of the 30 patients then the null hypothesis will be
      rejected. The probability that the treatment will be considered promising if the true PFR
      rate was 30% is 8.4% and 82% if the true PFR rate was 50%.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>8-Week Progression-Free Rate</measure>
    <time_frame>For this endpoint, disease was evaluated radiologically at baseline and week 8 on treatment; Treatment continued until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Treatment duration was a median of 3 cycles range (1-20).</time_frame>
    <description>The 8-week progression free rate (PFR) was defined as achieving complete response (CR), partial response (PR) or stable disease (SD) based on RECIST 1.1 criteria by the time of the first disease assessment (8 weeks). Per RECIST 1.1 for target lesions: CR is complete disappearance of all target lesions; PR is at least a 30% decrease in the sum of longest diameter (LD) of target lesions, taking as reference baseline sum LD; and SD is neither sufficient decrease to qualify as PR nor sufficient increase to qualify as progressive disease (PD). PD is at least a 20% increase in sum LD, taking as reference the smallest sum on study with at least 5 mm absolute increase. Response needed confirmation within 4 weeks. For non-target lesions, progression-free means no new lesions or unequivocal progression on existing non-target lesions.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Objective Response Rate</measure>
    <time_frame>Disease was evaluated radiologically at baseline and every 8 weeks on treatment; Treatment continued until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Treatment duration was a median of 3 cycles range (1-20).</time_frame>
    <description>The objective response rate (ORR) was defined as achieving complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) based on RECIST 1.1 criteria on treatment. Per RECIST 1.1 for target lesions: CR is complete disappearance of all target lesions and PR is at least a 30% decrease in the sum of longest diameter (LD) of target lesions, taking as reference baseline sum LD. PR or better objective response assumes at a minimum incomplete response/stable disease (SD) for the evaluation of non-target lesions and absence of new lesions.</description>

        <title>8-Week Progression-Free Rate</title>
        <description>The 8-week progression free rate (PFR) was defined as achieving complete response (CR), partial response (PR) or stable disease (SD) based on RECIST 1.1 criteria by the time of the first disease assessment (8 weeks). Per RECIST 1.1 for target lesions: CR is complete disappearance of all target lesions; PR is at least a 30% decrease in the sum of longest diameter (LD) of target lesions, taking as reference baseline sum LD; and SD is neither sufficient decrease to qualify as PR nor sufficient increase to qualify as progressive disease (PD). PD is at least a 20% increase in sum LD, taking as reference the smallest sum on study with at least 5 mm absolute increase. Response needed confirmation within 4 weeks. For non-target lesions, progression-free means no new lesions or unequivocal progression on existing non-target lesions.</description>
        <time_frame>For this endpoint, disease was evaluated radiologically at baseline and week 8 on treatment; Treatment continued until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Treatment duration was a median of 3 cycles range (1-20).</time_frame>
        <population>The analysis dataset is comprised of evaluable patients. Patients who had measurable disease at baseline, received at least 1 cycle of therapy and had their disease re-evaluated were considered evaluable for response.</population>

PR or better objective response assumes at a minimum incomplete response/stable disease (SD) for the evaluation of non-target lesions and absence of new lesions.</description>
