  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Violence and aggression on pediatric psychiatry units has led to staff and patient injuries
      and even deaths around the country. In an effort to improve safety, the investigators have
      developed a method (with the Brief Rating of Child and Adolescent Aggression) of identifying
      children and adolescents at a higher risk for aggression and violence on the units. In order
      to improve this prediction, the investigators plan to study salivary hormones in low risk
      children and high risk children. The salivary hormones to be studied include cortisol,
      testosterone, and dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEAS). The investigators expect to improve
      the investigators current ability to predict the severity and type of pediatric aggression
      and violence on the inpatient units by combining information from the Brief Rating of Child
      and Adolescent Aggression (BRACHA), the Predatory-Affective Aggression Scale (Vitiello et
      al., 1990), and salivary hormones.

        A total of 24 male subjects (ages 7-11) will be recruited to two groups from inpatient
        units at CCHMC:

          1. Inpatient high aggression: Twelve inpatient males (6 African-American and 6 Caucasian)
             will be recruited based on completion of the BRACHA and the Predatory-Affective
             Aggression Scale.

          2. Inpatient low aggression: Twelve inpatient males (6 African-American and 6 Caucasian)
             will be recruited based on completion of the BRACHA and the Predatory-Affective
             Aggression Scales.

          3. Ability of the guardian to give parental permission

          4. Completion of the BRACHA questionnaire

          5. Completion of the Predatory-Affective Aggression Scale (PAAS)

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Viral or bacterial infection or treatment with antibiotics within two weeks of
             screening

          2. Recent surgery (within 8 weeks of screening)

          3. Bleeding gums (within 8 weeks of screening)

             steroids and beta adrenergic agonists that affect hormones

          6. If it is the investigator's clinical judgment that the subject should be excluded if
             it is in the subject's best interest or due to any other factor that may interfere
             with study results

      <pre_assignment_details>Inclusion criteria included boys aged 7 to 9 years, with BRACHA scores, admitted to a psychiatric inpatient unit. Exclusion criteria included presence of infection requiring antibiotics within 2 weeks, recent surgery within 8 weeks, bleeding gums within 8 weeks of admission, current detainment in juvenile detention, and steroid use.</pre_assignment_details>

          <title>Salivary Hormone Correlation With Brief Rating of Aggression by Children and Adolescent (BRACHA) Score</title>
          <description>We collected three saliva samples from each participant over a 24-hour period on one of the initial three hospital days to determine the peripheral concentrations of cortisol, dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), and testosterone. We then compared these levels with the participants BRACHA score. We wanted to determine if hormone concentrations could improve the BRACHA's accuracy of predicting pediatric aggression during psychiatric hospitalization.</description>
          <population>The number of participants for analysis was supposed to be 24 based on Kelsey's sample size calculation (Kelsey et al., Methods in Observational Epidemiology, 2nd Edition, Table 12-15). However, due to funding constraints we only collected samples from 17 participants.</population>
