      The study was conducted in the objective to compare the safety and reactogenecity of BCG
      Vaccine of Green Signal Bio pharma Private Limited India(Test) with BCG vaccine of Serum
      Institute of India(Reference) in 120 healthy children.

      The above study was conducted in multi centers(2 centers - Chennai &amp; Bangalore). The study
      was conducted as per the protocol approved by DCGI and Madras ethical Committee.

      A single dose was administedred to all the subjects and it was inferred that all the 120
      subjects vaccinated were safe. Further, the reactogenecity was confirmed after 90th day by
      PPD administration to all the subjects. Based on the above observations it was well
      identified that test vaccine can be safely administered to children and it is well tolerated
      and accepted by the subjects. More over statistically it is inferred that there is no
      significant variation between the test and reference vaccine.
