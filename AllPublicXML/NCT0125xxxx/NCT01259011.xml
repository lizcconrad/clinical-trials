  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The proposed randomized controlled trial will test the SPIRIT (Sharing the Patient's Illness
      Representations to Increase Trust) intervention designed to improve discussions about
      end-of-life care between patients and their surrogate decision makers. Subjects will be 200
      Caucasian and African-American patients with ESRD (end-stage renal disease) recruited from
      outpatient dialysis clinics and their chosen surrogate decision makers. We hypothesize that
      (1) SPIRIT will lead to significantly less patient decisional conflict and significantly
      greater dyad congruence and surrogate decision making confidence than the standard care
      control at 2, 6, and 12 months post-intervention and (2) SPIRIT will reduce surrogate
      decisional conflict and psychosocial morbidities at 2 weeks after the patient's
      hospitalization requiring surrogate decision making significantly more than the standard care
      control.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Dialysis is central to survival for 450,000 Americans with end-stage renal disease (ESRD).
      Yet patients on dialysis have significant comorbidities and high mortality rates (24%
      annually). One out of four ESRD patient deaths occurs after a decision to stop dialysis.
      However, when persons have lost their decision capacity if there has been no prior discussion
      between the patient and surrogate regarding goals of care, the issue of whether to continue
      dialysis can pose an ethical impasse and cause profound psychological distress for surrogate
      decision makers. Using the representational approach to patient education, we developed and
      pilot tested the SPIRIT intervention (Sharing the Patient's Illness Representation to
      Increase Trust) to improve discussions about end-of-life care between patients and their
      surrogate decision makers. SPIRIT is a 6-step, 2-session, face-to-face intervention presented
      to both patient and surrogate by a trained interventionist in an interview format.

      The proposed randomized controlled trial will test the effects of the SPIRIT intervention in
      improving preparedness for end-of-life decision making among ESRD patients and their
      surrogates and reducing surrogates' conflict during decision making and psychosocial
      morbidities. Subjects will be 200 Caucasian and African-American patients with ESRD recruited
      from outpatient dialysis clinics and their chosen surrogate decision makers. Preparedness
      outcomes (dyad congruence, patient decisional conflict, and surrogate decision making
      confidence) will be measured at 2, 6, and 12 months post-intervention. Surrogate decisional
      conflict and psychosocial morbidities (anxiety, depression, and post-traumatic distress
      symptoms) will be measured 2 weeks after the patient's hospitalization that required
      surrogate decision making. To compare the effects of SPIRIT to those of standard care on
      surrogates after the patient's death, psychosocial morbidities will be measured at 3 and 6
      months after the patient's death. We will also explore the potential impact of race on
      intervention effects and examine mediators and moderators of the intervention effects.

    <description>The Post-Traumatic Symptoms Scale-10 (PTSS-10) was used to assess the presence and intensity of PTSD symptoms during the preceding 7 days. This self-report scale consists of 10 statements that specifically mention symptoms related to PTSD criteria (e.g., sleep problems, nightmares, tension in the body, irritation, startle, etc.) rated on a 7-point Likert scale from 1 (Never/Rare) to 7 (Very often/Always). A total score (range 10 - 70) of &gt; 35 is associated with a high probability that the person meets the diagnostic criteria for PTSD.</description>

    <description>Written information on advance directives and the patient's right to have an advance directive is provided to every patient on the first day of dialysis treatment by a social worker at the clinic. A social worker documents whether the patient has an advance directive, a surrogate decision maker, and/or a Do-Not-Resuscitate (DNR) Order on a Comprehensive Interdisciplinary Assessment form. The social worker encourages patients to complete an advance directive and addresses their questions about life-sustaining treatment options. If completed, the advance directive is placed in the medical record.</description>

        <description>The Post-Traumatic Symptoms Scale-10 (PTSS-10) was used to assess the presence and intensity of PTSD symptoms during the preceding 7 days. This self-report scale consists of 10 statements that specifically mention symptoms related to PTSD criteria (e.g., sleep problems, nightmares, tension in the body, irritation, startle, etc.) rated on a 7-point Likert scale from 1 (Never/Rare) to 7 (Very often/Always). A total score (range 10 - 70) of &gt; 35 is associated with a high probability that the person meets the diagnostic criteria for PTSD.</description>

            <description>Written information on advance directives and the patient’s right to have an advance directive is provided to every patient on the first day of dialysis treatment by a social worker at the clinic. A social worker documents whether the patient has an advance directive, a surrogate decision maker, and/or a Do-Not-Resuscitate (DNR) Order on a Comprehensive Interdisciplinary Assessment form. The social worker encourages patients to complete an advance directive and addresses their questions about life-sustaining treatment options. If completed, the advance directive is placed in the medical record.</description>

            <description>The SPIRIT intervention is a two-session, 1½ hour–long, structured intervention that is composed of six steps (assessing representations, identifying and exploring gaps and concerns, creating conditions for conceptual change, introducing replacement information, summarizing, and setting goals and planning), presented to both patient and surrogate by a trained nurse interventionist in a face-to-face interview format based on the representational approach.

          <title>Change Over Time: Post-traumatic Distress Symptom Score</title>
          <description>The Post-Traumatic Symptoms Scale-10 (PTSS-10) was used to assess the presence and intensity of PTSD symptoms during the preceding 7 days. This self-report scale consists of 10 statements that specifically mention symptoms related to PTSD criteria (e.g., sleep problems, nightmares, tension in the body, irritation, startle, etc.) rated on a 7-point Likert scale from 1 (Never/Rare) to 7 (Very often/Always). A total score (range 10 - 70) of &gt; 35 is associated with a high probability that the person meets the diagnostic criteria for PTSD.</description>
