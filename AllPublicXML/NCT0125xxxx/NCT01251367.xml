    <measure>Assessment of the Long-Term Safety of Dysport® Through the Collection of Treatment Emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to EOS (maximum duration of 52 weeks).</time_frame>
    <description>Adverse events (AEs) were monitored from the time that the subject gave informed consent to the end of the study/early withdrawal (EOS/EW). An AE was reported as a TEAE if it was not present prior to study treatment administration in Study 140, or if it was present prior to study treatment in Study 140 but the intensity increased during the treatment phase of this study. Adverse events of special interest (AESIs) were identified as those assessed as being due to remote spread of effect of Dysport®, or any AE that was assessed as a hypersensitivity reaction. TEAEs, treatment related TEAEs, severe TEAEs, TEAEs leading to death, TEAEs leading to withdrawal, treatment emergent AESIs, and serious adverse events (SAEs) are summarised by treatment cycle.</description>

    <measure>Mean Change From Baseline to Week 4 in Lower Limb Pain</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 4 of each cycle</time_frame>
    <description>The intensity of lower limb pain in the treated limb was evaluated by the subject using the Scale of Pain Intensity (SPIN) which provided a pictorial representation of pain in a 6-point graphic scale with the degree of red shading inside a circle representing the intensity of pain. The bottom and top of the scale are anchored by two extremes: 'no pain' (circle with no red shading and scored as 0) and 'pain as bad as it could be' (circle completely red and scored as 5), marked with either verbal or visual cues. The intervening points are represented by red circles increasing proportionally in size. The subject marks the circle that best indicates their pain intensity. The SPIN assessments were obtained at baseline, Weeks 4 and 12 after each Dysport® injection, at discretionary visits at Weeks 16, 20 and 24 of each cycle and at the EOS/EW. The mean changes from baseline in subjects with a baseline SPIN Score &gt;0 at Week 4 was reported per cycle.</description>

    <measure>Mean Change From Baseline to Week 4 in Short Form (36) Health Survey (SF-36) Quality of Life (QoL)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 4 of each cycle</time_frame>
    <description>Subjects were asked to complete the SF-36 health surveys prior to the study treatment at baseline, at Week 4 and at the EOS/EW visit. The SF-36 is a generic non preference based health status measure. This instrument assessed subject health across 8 variable dimensions, which are specific health domains such as physical functioning, social functioning and vitality. Each variable item score is coded and turned into a 0-100 scale where 0 indicates the worst and 100 indicates the best possible health state for both the Physical Component Summary (PCS) and Mental Component Summary (MCS) of the questionnaire. The mean change in the PCS and MCS from baseline to Week 4 are reported.</description>

    <measure>Mean Change From Baseline in European Quality of Life - 5 Dimensions, 5 Level (EQ-5D-5L) QoL</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 4 of each cycle</time_frame>
    <description>Subjects were asked to complete the EQ-5D-5L QoL questionnaire prior to the study treatment at baseline, at Week 4 and at EOS/EW visit. The EQ-5D-5L index is a generic preference based measure of health related QoL producing utility scores that represent subject preferences for particular health states. This instrument rated subject health state looking at 5 specific dimensions such as mobility, self-care, usual activity, pain/discomfort and anxiety/ depression and scored their general health state. Each dimension has 5 levels of severity: no problems, slight problems, moderate problems, severe problems and extreme problems, rated from 1 to 5 (best to worst). In addition, a visual analogue scale (VAS) ranging from 0 to 100 was also included for the patients to summarize their overall health status, where 0 is the worst and 100 the best possible health state. The mean change in pain and discomfort and VAS scores from baseline to Week 4 are reported.</description>

    <measure>Mean Change From Baseline to Week 4 in Angle of Arrest (XV1), Angle of Catch (XV3) and Spasticity Angle (X) in the GSC (Knee Extended)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 4 of each cycle</time_frame>
    <description>Spasticity in the treated limb was assessed using the Tardieu Scale (TS) for the GSC (knee extended). The TS is administered by applying passive stretch to a muscle group at two velocities. Slow speed of muscle stretch measures the range of passive motion. During a slow stretching movement, the examiner determines the angle of movement arrest, either due to subject discomfort or a mechanical resistance. The same movement is repeated at high velocity (as fast as possible) to determine the angle of catch and release. The angle of movement arrest at slow velocity (XV1) and the angle of catch at fast speed (XV3) were recorded at baseline, at Weeks 4 and 12 after each Dysport® injection, at discretionary visits at Weeks 16, 20 and 24 of each cycle and at EOS/EW. The spasticity angle (X) was calculated as the difference between XV1 and XV3. Mean changes in Angles XV1, XV3 and X from baseline to Week 4 are reported per cycle.</description>

    <description>Spasticity in the treated limb was assessed using the TS for the GSC (knee extended). The TS is administered by applying passive stretch to a muscle group. The spasticity grade (Y) assesses quality of muscle reaction on a 5-point scale (measured at fast speed): 0 =No resistance throughout passive movement, 1=slight resistance throughout passive movement, 2=clear catch at precise angle, interrupting passive movement, followed by release, 3=fatigable clonus (less than 10 seconds when maintaining pressure) occurring at a precise angle, followed by release. 4=unfatigable clonus (more than 10 seconds when maintaining pressure) occurring at precise angle. Spasticity grade (Y) was recorded at baseline, at Weeks 4 and 12 after each Dysport® injection, at discretionary visits at Weeks 16, 20 and 24 of each cycle and at EOS/EW. Mean changes in spasticity grade (Y) from baseline to Week 4 are reported per cycle.</description>

    <participant_flow>
      <recruitment_details>The study was designed as a multicentre study and included 51 sites in Australia, Belgium, the Czech Republic, France, Hungary, Italy, Poland, Portugal, Russia, Slovakia and the United States of America that included at least one subject. The current study (Study 142) was an open label extension to the double blind Study 140 (Y-55-52120-140).</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>A total of 366 subjects completed Study 140, of which 352 subjects were enrolled in Study 142. Of these, 7 subjects entered an observational phase and never received open label treatment with Dysport® in Study 142 and the remaining 345 subjects started treatment and received at least one open label injection of Dysport® in Study 142.</pre_assignment_details>
      <group_list>
        <group group_id="P1">
          <title>Total Dysport®</title>
          <description>Subjects who had completed Study 140 were offered to continue to receive open label treatment with Dysport® in Study 142 for a maximum of 4 additional treatment cycles, with a minimum interval of 12 weeks between treatment cycles. All subjects were administered an appropriate dosage of Dysport® (1500 Units [U] or 1000 U) by intramuscular (i.m.) injection in the lower limb on Day 1 of treatment Cycle 1. In all cases, the administration of the Dysport® injections was limited to a maximum dose of 1500 U every 12 weeks. Follow up visits were timed to assess the onset and progression of treatment response. From treatment Cycle 3 onwards, subjects with co-existing upper limb spasticity were able to receive concomitant injections of Dysport® into at least one upper limb muscle at a dose not exceeding 500 U. Dysport® contains the neurotoxin Clostridium botulinum type A toxin-haemagglutinin complex (abobotulinumtoxinA).</description>

          <description>Subjects who had completed Study 140 were offered to continue to receive open label treatment with Dysport® in Study 142 for a maximum of 4 additional treatment cycles, with a minimum interval of 12 weeks between treatment cycles. All subjects were administered an appropriate dosage of Dysport® (1500 U or 1000 U) by i.m. injection in the lower limb on Day 1 of treatment Cycle 1. In all cases, the administration of the Dysport® injections was limited to a maximum dose of 1500 U every 12 weeks. Follow up visits were timed to assess the onset and progression of treatment response. From treatment Cycle 3 onwards, subjects with co-existing upper limb spasticity were able to receive concomitant injections of Dysport® into at least one upper limb muscle at a dose not exceeding 500 U. Dysport® contains the neurotoxin Clostridium botulinum type A toxin-haemagglutinin complex (abobotulinumtoxinA).</description>

        <description>Adverse events (AEs) were monitored from the time that the subject gave informed consent to the end of the study/early withdrawal (EOS/EW). An AE was reported as a TEAE if it was not present prior to study treatment administration in Study 140, or if it was present prior to study treatment in Study 140 but the intensity increased during the treatment phase of this study. Adverse events of special interest (AESIs) were identified as those assessed as being due to remote spread of effect of Dysport®, or any AE that was assessed as a hypersensitivity reaction. TEAEs, treatment related TEAEs, severe TEAEs, TEAEs leading to death, TEAEs leading to withdrawal, treatment emergent AESIs, and serious adverse events (SAEs) are summarised by treatment cycle.</description>

All subjects were administered an appropriate dosage of Dysport® (1500 U or 1000 U) by i.m. injection in the lower limb on Day 1 of treatment Cycle 1. In all cases, the administration of the Dysport® injections was limited to a maximum dose of 1500 U every 12 weeks. Follow up visits were timed to assess the onset and progression of treatment response. From treatment Cycle 3 onwards, subjects with co-existing upper limb spasticity were able to receive concomitant injections of Dysport® into at least one upper limb muscle at a dose not exceeding 500 U. Dysport® contains the neurotoxin Clostridium botulinum type A toxin-haemagglutinin complex (abobotulinumtoxinA).</description>

            <description>Subjects who had completed Study 140 were offered to continue to receive open label treatment with Dysport® in Study 142 for a maximum of 4 additional treatment cycles, with a minimum interval of 12 weeks between treatment cycles. All subjects were administered an appropriate dosage of Dysport® (1500 U or 1000 U) by i.m. injection in the lower limb on Day 1 of treatment Cycle 1. In all cases, the administration of the Dysport® injections was limited to a maximum dose of 1500 U every 12 weeks. Follow up visits were timed to assess the onset and progression of treatment response. From treatment Cycle 3 onwards, subjects with co-existing upper limb spasticity were able to receive concomitant injections of Dysport® into at least one upper limb muscle at a dose not exceeding 500 U. Dysport® contains the neurotoxin Clostridium botulinum type A toxin-haemagglutinin complex (abobotulinumtoxinA).</description>

            <description>Subjects who had completed Study 140 were offered to continue to receive open label treatment with Dysport® in Study 142 for a maximum of 4 additional treatment cycles, with a minimum interval of 12 weeks between treatment cycles. All subjects were administered an appropriate dosage of Dysport® (1500 U or 1000 U) by i.m. injection in the lower limb on Day 1 of treatment Cycle 1. In all cases, the administration of the Dysport® injections was limited to a maximum dose of 1500 U every 12 weeks. Follow up visits were timed to assess the onset and progression of treatment response. From treatment Cycle 3 onwards, subjects with co-existing upper limb spasticity were able to receive concomitant injections of Dysport® into at least one upper limb muscle at a dose not exceeding 500 U. Dysport® contains the neurotoxin Clostridium botulinum type A toxin-haemagglutinin complex (abobotulinumtoxinA).</description>

All subjects were administered an appropriate dosage of Dysport® (1500 U or 1000 U) by i.m. injection in the lower limb on Day 1 of treatment Cycle 1. In all cases, the administration of the Dysport® injections was limited to a maximum dose of 1500 U every 12 weeks. Follow up visits were timed to assess the onset and progression of treatment response. From treatment Cycle 3 onwards, subjects with co-existing upper limb spasticity were able to receive concomitant injections of Dysport® into at least one upper limb muscle at a dose not exceeding 500 U. Dysport® contains the neurotoxin Clostridium botulinum type A toxin-haemagglutinin complex (abobotulinumtoxinA).</description>

        <title>Mean Change From Baseline to Week 4 in the Modified Ashworth Scale (MAS) Score Measured in the Gastrocnemius-soleus Complex (GSC) (Knee Extended)</title>
        <description>Muscle tone in the treated limb was assessed by MAS in the GSC (with the knee extended) at baseline, at Weeks 4 and 12, at discretionary visits at Weeks 16, 20 and 24 of each cycle, and at EOS/EW. The MAS consists of 6 grades: 0 (no increase in muscle tone), 1 (slight increase in muscle tone, manifested by a catch and release or by minimal resistance at the end of the range of motion (ROM)), 1+ (slight increase in muscle tone, manifested by a catch, followed by minimal resistance throughout the remainder (less than half) of the ROM), 2 (more marked increase in muscle tone), 3 (considerable increase in muscle tone) or 4 (affected part(s) rigid in flexion or extension), and can be applied to muscles of both the upper and lower limbs. Outcome measure is reported per cycle as mean change from baseline at Week 4.</description>

            <description>Subjects who had completed Study 140 were offered to continue to receive open label treatment with Dysport® in Study 142 for a maximum of 4 additional treatment cycles, with a minimum interval of 12 weeks between treatment cycles. All subjects were administered an appropriate dosage of Dysport® (1500 U or 1000 U) by i.m. injection in the lower limb on Day 1 of treatment Cycle 1. In all cases, the administration of the Dysport® injections was limited to a maximum dose of 1500 U every 12 weeks. Follow up visits were timed to assess the onset and progression of treatment response. From treatment Cycle 3 onwards, subjects with co-existing upper limb spasticity were able to receive concomitant injections of Dysport® into at least one upper limb muscle at a dose not exceeding 500 U. Dysport® contains the neurotoxin Clostridium botulinum type A toxin-haemagglutinin complex (abobotulinumtoxinA).</description>

        <description>Muscle tone in the treated limb was assessed by MAS in the soleus muscle (with the knee flexed) at baseline, at Weeks 4 and 12, at discretionary visits at Weeks 16, 20 and 24 of each cycle, and at EOS/EW. The MAS consists of 6 grades: 0 (no increase in muscle tone), 1 (slight increase in muscle tone, manifested by a catch and release or by minimal resistance at the end of the ROM), 1+ (slight increase in muscle tone, manifested by a catch, followed by minimal resistance throughout the remainder (less than half) of the ROM), 2 (more marked increase in muscle tone), 3 (considerable increase in muscle tone) or 4 (affected part(s) rigid in flexion or extension), and can be applied to muscles of both the upper and lower limbs. Outcome measure is reported per cycle as mean change from baseline at Week 4.</description>

All subjects were administered an appropriate dosage of Dysport® (1500 U or 1000 U) by i.m. injection in the lower limb on Day 1 of treatment Cycle 1. In all cases, the administration of the Dysport® injections was limited to a maximum dose of 1500 U every 12 weeks. Follow up visits were timed to assess the onset and progression of treatment response. From treatment Cycle 3 onwards, subjects with co-existing upper limb spasticity were able to receive concomitant injections of Dysport® into at least one upper limb muscle at a dose not exceeding 500 U. Dysport® contains the neurotoxin Clostridium botulinum type A toxin-haemagglutinin complex (abobotulinumtoxinA).</description>

        <title>Percentage of Subjects With At Least a 1 or 2 Grade Reduction in the MAS Measured in the Soleus Muscle (Knee Flexed) at Week 4</title>
        <description>Muscle tone in the treated limb was assessed by MAS in the soleus muscle (with the knee flexed) at baseline, at Weeks 4 and 12, at discretionary visits at Weeks 16, 20 and 24 of each cycle, and at EOS/EW. The MAS consists of 6 grades: 0 (no increase in muscle tone), 1 (slight increase in muscle tone, manifested by a catch and release or by minimal resistance at the end of the ROM), 1+ (slight increase in muscle tone, manifested by a catch, followed by minimal resistance throughout the remainder (less than half) of the ROM), 2 (more marked increase in muscle tone), 3 (considerable increase in muscle tone) or 4 (affected part(s) rigid in flexion or extension), and can be applied to muscles of both the upper and lower limbs. Outcome measure is reported per cycle as the percentage of subjects with at least a 1 grade reduction or 2 grades reduction in MAS score at Week 4.</description>

All subjects were administered an appropriate dosage of Dysport® (1500 U or 1000 U) by i.m. injection in the lower limb on Day 1 of treatment Cycle 1. In all cases, the administration of the Dysport® injections was limited to a maximum dose of 1500 U every 12 weeks. Follow up visits were timed to assess the onset and progression of treatment response. From treatment Cycle 3 onwards, subjects with co-existing upper limb spasticity were able to receive concomitant injections of Dysport® into at least one upper limb muscle at a dose not exceeding 500 U. Dysport® contains the neurotoxin Clostridium botulinum type A toxin-haemagglutinin complex (abobotulinumtoxinA).</description>

        <description>An assessment of overall treatment response was conducted by the investigator at baseline, at Weeks 4 and 12, at discretionary visits at Weeks 16, 20 and 24 of each cycle and at EOS/EW. The investigator rated the response to treatment in the subject’s lower limb after injection of Dysport® relative to the status at the baseline. Answers were made on a nine-point rating scale: -4=markedly worse, -3=much worse, -2=worse, -1=slightly worse, 0=no change, +1=slightly improved, +2=improved, +3=much improved, +4=markedly improved. The mean PGA scores per cycle at Week 4 were reported.</description>

        <title>Percentage of Subjects With a Score of at Least +1 on the PGA Scale at Week 4</title>
        <description>An assessment of overall treatment response was conducted by the investigator at baseline, at Weeks 4 and 12, at discretionary visits at Weeks 16, 20 and 24 of each cycle and at EOS/EW. The investigator rated the response to treatment in the subject’s lower limb after injection of Dysport® relative to the status at the baseline. Answers were made on a nine point rating scale: -4=markedly worse, -3=much worse, -2=worse, -1=slightly worse, 0=no change, +1=slightly improved, +2=improved, +3=much improved, +4=markedly improved. The percentage of responders with a PGA score of +1 or greater are reported at Week 4.</description>

All subjects were administered an appropriate dosage of Dysport® (1500 U or 1000 U) by i.m. injection in the lower limb on Day 1 of treatment Cycle 1. In all cases, the administration of the Dysport® injections was limited to a maximum dose of 1500 U every 12 weeks. Follow up visits were timed to assess the onset and progression of treatment response. From treatment Cycle 3 onwards, subjects with co-existing upper limb spasticity were able to receive concomitant injections of Dysport® into at least one upper limb muscle at a dose not exceeding 500 U. Dysport® contains the neurotoxin Clostridium botulinum type A toxin-haemagglutinin complex (abobotulinumtoxinA).</description>

        <title>Mean Change From Baseline to Week 4 in Lower Limb Pain</title>
        <description>The intensity of lower limb pain in the treated limb was evaluated by the subject using the Scale of Pain Intensity (SPIN) which provided a pictorial representation of pain in a 6-point graphic scale with the degree of red shading inside a circle representing the intensity of pain. The bottom and top of the scale are anchored by two extremes: ‘no pain’ (circle with no red shading and scored as 0) and ‘pain as bad as it could be’ (circle completely red and scored as 5), marked with either verbal or visual cues. The intervening points are represented by red circles increasing proportionally in size. The subject marks the circle that best indicates their pain intensity. The SPIN assessments were obtained at baseline, Weeks 4 and 12 after each Dysport® injection, at discretionary visits at Weeks 16, 20 and 24 of each cycle and at the EOS/EW. The mean changes from baseline in subjects with a baseline SPIN Score &gt;0 at Week 4 was reported per cycle.</description>

            <description>Subjects who had completed Study 140 were offered to continue to receive open label treatment with Dysport® in Study 142 for a maximum of 4 additional treatment cycles, with a minimum interval of 12 weeks between treatment cycles. All subjects were administered an appropriate dosage of Dysport® (1500 U or 1000 U) by i.m. injection in the lower limb on Day 1 of treatment Cycle 1. In all cases, the administration of the Dysport® injections was limited to a maximum dose of 1500 U every 12 weeks. Follow up visits were timed to assess the onset and progression of treatment response. From treatment Cycle 3 onwards, subjects with co-existing upper limb spasticity were able to receive concomitant injections of Dysport® into at least one upper limb muscle at a dose not exceeding 500 U. Dysport® contains the neurotoxin Clostridium botulinum type A toxin-haemagglutinin complex (abobotulinumtoxinA).</description>

        <title>Mean Change From Baseline to Week 4 in Short Form (36) Health Survey (SF-36) Quality of Life (QoL)</title>
        <description>Subjects were asked to complete the SF-36 health surveys prior to the study treatment at baseline, at Week 4 and at the EOS/EW visit. The SF-36 is a generic non preference based health status measure. This instrument assessed subject health across 8 variable dimensions, which are specific health domains such as physical functioning, social functioning and vitality. Each variable item score is coded and turned into a 0–100 scale where 0 indicates the worst and 100 indicates the best possible health state for both the Physical Component Summary (PCS) and Mental Component Summary (MCS) of the questionnaire. The mean change in the PCS and MCS from baseline to Week 4 are reported.</description>

        <title>Mean Change From Baseline in European Quality of Life - 5 Dimensions, 5 Level (EQ-5D-5L) QoL</title>
        <description>Subjects were asked to complete the EQ-5D-5L QoL questionnaire prior to the study treatment at baseline, at Week 4 and at EOS/EW visit. The EQ-5D-5L index is a generic preference based measure of health related QoL producing utility scores that represent subject preferences for particular health states. This instrument rated subject health state looking at 5 specific dimensions such as mobility, self-care, usual activity, pain/discomfort and anxiety/ depression and scored their general health state. Each dimension has 5 levels of severity: no problems, slight problems, moderate problems, severe problems and extreme problems, rated from 1 to 5 (best to worst). In addition, a visual analogue scale (VAS) ranging from 0 to 100 was also included for the patients to summarize their overall health status, where 0 is the worst and 100 the best possible health state. The mean change in pain and discomfort and VAS scores from baseline to Week 4 are reported.</description>

All subjects were administered an appropriate dosage of Dysport® (1500 U or 1000 U) by i.m. injection in the lower limb on Day 1 of treatment Cycle 1. In all cases, the administration of the Dysport® injections was limited to a maximum dose of 1500 U every 12 weeks. Follow up visits were timed to assess the onset and progression of treatment response. From treatment Cycle 3 onwards, subjects with co-existing upper limb spasticity were able to receive concomitant injections of Dysport® into at least one upper limb muscle at a dose not exceeding 500 U. Dysport® contains the neurotoxin Clostridium botulinum type A toxin-haemagglutinin complex (abobotulinumtoxinA).</description>

        <title>Mean Change From Baseline to Week 4 in Step Length</title>
        <description>All WS tests were conducted without walking aids over a distance of 10 metres at both a comfortable WS and at maximal WS. Evaluations of step length were made barefoot and with shoes on, at baseline, at Weeks 4 and 12, at discretionary visits at Weeks 16, 20 and 24 of each cycle, and at EOS/EW. Outcome measure is reported per cycle as mean change from baseline at Week 4.</description>

            <description>Subjects who had completed Study 140 were offered to continue to receive open label treatment with Dysport® in Study 142 for a maximum of 4 additional treatment cycles, with a minimum interval of 12 weeks between treatment cycles. All subjects were administered an appropriate dosage of Dysport® (1500 U or 1000 U) by i.m. injection in the lower limb on Day 1 of treatment Cycle 1. In all cases, the administration of the Dysport® injections was limited to a maximum dose of 1500 U every 12 weeks. Follow up visits were timed to assess the onset and progression of treatment response. From treatment Cycle 3 onwards, subjects with co-existing upper limb spasticity were able to receive concomitant injections of Dysport® into at least one upper limb muscle at a dose not exceeding 500 U. Dysport® contains the neurotoxin Clostridium botulinum type A toxin-haemagglutinin complex (abobotulinumtoxinA).</description>

        <title>Mean Change From Baseline to Week 4 in Cadence</title>
        <description>All WS tests were conducted without walking aids over a distance of 10 metres at both a comfortable WS and at maximal WS. Evaluations of cadence were made barefoot and with shoes on, at baseline, at Weeks 4 and 12, at discretionary visits at Weeks 16, 20 and 24 of each cycle, and at EOS/EW. Outcome measure is reported per cycle as mean change from baseline at Week 4.</description>

            <description>Subjects who had completed Study 140 were offered to continue to receive open label treatment with Dysport® in Study 142 for a maximum of 4 additional treatment cycles, with a minimum interval of 12 weeks between treatment cycles. All subjects were administered an appropriate dosage of Dysport® (1500 U or 1000 U) by i.m. injection in the lower limb on Day 1 of treatment Cycle 1. In all cases, the administration of the Dysport® injections was limited to a maximum dose of 1500 U every 12 weeks. Follow up visits were timed to assess the onset and progression of treatment response. From treatment Cycle 3 onwards, subjects with co-existing upper limb spasticity were able to receive concomitant injections of Dysport® into at least one upper limb muscle at a dose not exceeding 500 U. Dysport® contains the neurotoxin Clostridium botulinum type A toxin-haemagglutinin complex (abobotulinumtoxinA).</description>

        <title>Mean Change From Baseline to Week 4 in Angle of Arrest (XV1), Angle of Catch (XV3) and Spasticity Angle (X) in the GSC (Knee Extended)</title>
        <description>Spasticity in the treated limb was assessed using the Tardieu Scale (TS) for the GSC (knee extended). The TS is administered by applying passive stretch to a muscle group at two velocities. Slow speed of muscle stretch measures the range of passive motion. During a slow stretching movement, the examiner determines the angle of movement arrest, either due to subject discomfort or a mechanical resistance. The same movement is repeated at high velocity (as fast as possible) to determine the angle of catch and release. The angle of movement arrest at slow velocity (XV1) and the angle of catch at fast speed (XV3) were recorded at baseline, at Weeks 4 and 12 after each Dysport® injection, at discretionary visits at Weeks 16, 20 and 24 of each cycle and at EOS/EW. The spasticity angle (X) was calculated as the difference between XV1 and XV3. Mean changes in Angles XV1, XV3 and X from baseline to Week 4 are reported per cycle.</description>

            <description>Subjects who had completed Study 140 were offered to continue to receive open label treatment with Dysport® in Study 142 for a maximum of 4 additional treatment cycles, with a minimum interval of 12 weeks between treatment cycles. All subjects were administered an appropriate dosage of Dysport® (1500 U or 1000 U) by i.m. injection in the lower limb on Day 1 of treatment Cycle 1. In all cases, the administration of the Dysport® injections was limited to a maximum dose of 1500 U every 12 weeks. Follow up visits were timed to assess the onset and progression of treatment response. From treatment Cycle 3 onwards, subjects with co-existing upper limb spasticity were able to receive concomitant injections of Dysport® into at least one upper limb muscle at a dose not exceeding 500 U. Dysport® contains the neurotoxin Clostridium botulinum type A toxin-haemagglutinin complex (abobotulinumtoxinA).</description>

        <title>Mean Change From Baseline to Week 4 in Spasticity Grade (Y) in the GSC (Knee Extended)</title>
        <description>Spasticity in the treated limb was assessed using the TS for the GSC (knee extended). The TS is administered by applying passive stretch to a muscle group. The spasticity grade (Y) assesses quality of muscle reaction on a 5-point scale (measured at fast speed): 0 =No resistance throughout passive movement, 1=slight resistance throughout passive movement, 2=clear catch at precise angle, interrupting passive movement, followed by release, 3=fatigable clonus (less than 10 seconds when maintaining pressure) occurring at a precise angle, followed by release. 4=unfatigable clonus (more than 10 seconds when maintaining pressure) occurring at precise angle. Spasticity grade (Y) was recorded at baseline, at Weeks 4 and 12 after each Dysport® injection, at discretionary visits at Weeks 16, 20 and 24 of each cycle and at EOS/EW. Mean changes in spasticity grade (Y) from baseline to Week 4 are reported per cycle.</description>

            <description>Subjects who had completed Study 140 were offered to continue to receive open label treatment with Dysport® in Study 142 for a maximum of 4 additional treatment cycles, with a minimum interval of 12 weeks between treatment cycles. All subjects were administered an appropriate dosage of Dysport® (1500 U or 1000 U) by i.m. injection in the lower limb on Day 1 of treatment Cycle 1. In all cases, the administration of the Dysport® injections was limited to a maximum dose of 1500 U every 12 weeks. Follow up visits were timed to assess the onset and progression of treatment response. From treatment Cycle 3 onwards, subjects with co-existing upper limb spasticity were able to receive concomitant injections of Dysport® into at least one upper limb muscle at a dose not exceeding 500 U. Dysport® contains the neurotoxin Clostridium botulinum type A toxin-haemagglutinin complex (abobotulinumtoxinA).</description>

        <title>Mean Change From Baseline to Week 4 in Angle of Arrest (XV1), Angle of Catch (XV3) and Spasticity Angle (X) in the Soleus Muscle (Knee Flexed)</title>
        <description>Spasticity in the treated limb was assessed using the TS for the soleus muscle (knee flexed). The TS is administered by applying passive stretch to a muscle group at two velocities. Slow speed of muscle stretch measures the range of passive motion. During a slow stretching movement, the examiner determines the angle of movement arrest, either due to subject discomfort or a mechanical resistance. The same movement is repeated at high velocity (as fast as possible) to determine the angle of catch and release. The angle of movement arrest at slow velocity (XV1) and the angle of catch at fast speed (XV3) were recorded at baseline, at Weeks 4 and 12 after each Dysport® injection, at discretionary visits at Weeks 16, 20 and 24 of each cycle and at EOS/EW. The spasticity angle (X) was calculated as the difference between XV1 and XV3. Mean changes in Angles XV1, XV3 and X from baseline to Week 4 are reported per cycle.</description>

            <description>Subjects who had completed Study 140 were offered to continue to receive open label treatment with Dysport® in Study 142 for a maximum of 4 additional treatment cycles, with a minimum interval of 12 weeks between treatment cycles. All subjects were administered an appropriate dosage of Dysport® (1500 U or 1000 U) by i.m. injection in the lower limb on Day 1 of treatment Cycle 1. In all cases, the administration of the Dysport® injections was limited to a maximum dose of 1500 U every 12 weeks. Follow up visits were timed to assess the onset and progression of treatment response. From treatment Cycle 3 onwards, subjects with co-existing upper limb spasticity were able to receive concomitant injections of Dysport® into at least one upper limb muscle at a dose not exceeding 500 U. Dysport® contains the neurotoxin Clostridium botulinum type A toxin-haemagglutinin complex (abobotulinumtoxinA).</description>

        <description>Spasticity in the treated limb was assessed using the TS for the soleus muscle (knee flexed). The TS is administered by applying passive stretch to a muscle group. The spasticity grade (Y) assesses quality of muscle reaction on a 5-point scale (measured at fast speed): 0 =No resistance throughout passive movement, 1=slight resistance throughout passive movement, 2=clear catch at precise angle, interrupting passive movement, followed by release, 3=fatigable clonus (less than 10 seconds when maintaining pressure) occurring at a precise angle, followed by release. 4=unfatigable clonus (more than 10 seconds when maintaining pressure) occurring at precise angle. Spasticity grade (Y) was recorded at baseline, at Weeks 4 and 12 after each Dysport® injection, at discretionary visits at Weeks 16, 20 and 24 of each cycle and at EOS/EW. Mean changes in spasticity grade (Y) from baseline to Week 4 are reported per cycle.</description>

        <title>Use of Walking Aids/Orthoses at Baseline and Week 4</title>
        <description>Subjects were assessed on their use of walking aids and orthoses at baseline, at Weeks 4 and 12 after each Dysport® injection, at discretionary visits at Weeks 16, 20 and 24 of each cycle and at the EOS/EW visit. Outcome measure is reported per cycle at baseline and Week 4. Number of subjects with no walking aid/orthoses were included in the ‘No Walking Aid’ category and number of subjects with any kind of walking aid/orthosis (including single point cane, tripod cane, ankle foot orthosis or other type of walking aid/orthosis) were combined into the ‘Walking Aid’ category.</description>

            <title>Total Dysport®</title>
            <description>Subjects who had completed Study 140 were offered to continue to receive open label treatment with Dysport® in Study 142 for a maximum of 4 additional treatment cycles, with a minimum interval of 12 weeks between treatment cycles. All subjects were administered an appropriate dosage of Dysport® (1500 U or 1000 U) by i.m. injection in the lower limb on Day 1 of treatment Cycle 1. In all cases, the administration of the Dysport® injections was limited to a maximum dose of 1500 U every 12 weeks. Follow up visits were timed to assess the onset and progression of treatment response. From treatment Cycle 3 onwards, subjects with co-existing upper limb spasticity were able to receive concomitant injections of Dysport® into at least one upper limb muscle at a dose not exceeding 500 U. Dysport® contains the neurotoxin Clostridium botulinum type A toxin-haemagglutinin complex (abobotulinumtoxinA).</description>

          <description>Subjects who had completed Study 140 were offered to continue to receive open label treatment with Dysport® in Study 142 for a maximum of 4 additional treatment cycles, with a minimum interval of 12 weeks between treatment cycles. All subjects were administered an appropriate dosage of Dysport® (1500 U or 1000 U) by i.m. injection in the lower limb on Day 1 of treatment Cycle 1. In all cases, the administration of the Dysport® injections was limited to a maximum dose of 1500 U every 12 weeks. Follow up visits were timed to assess the onset and progression of treatment response. From treatment Cycle 3 onwards, subjects with co-existing upper limb spasticity were able to receive concomitant injections of Dysport® into at least one upper limb muscle at a dose not exceeding 500 U. Dysport® contains the neurotoxin Clostridium botulinum type A toxin-haemagglutinin complex (abobotulinumtoxinA).</description>
