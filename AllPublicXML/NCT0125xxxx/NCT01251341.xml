    <textblock>
      The increasingly widespread use of meditation for stress-related emotional and medical
      conditions highlights the urgent need to rigorously evaluate mechanisms through which the
      benefits of practice might be conferred. Primary challenges in this regard include evaluating
      dose response relationships between practice time and outcomes; clarifying whether
      physiological and behavioral effects of meditation derive primarily from non-specific aspects
      of training or result from specific meditation practices; and identifying molecular
      mechanisms by which meditation might affect physiological responses relevant to
      stress-related illness. Recent findings from a cross-sectional study by our group indicate
      that young adults who are randomized to, and practice, compassion meditation demonstrate
      reduced inflammatory responses, less emotional distress, and reduced autonomic responses to a
      standardized laboratory psychosocial stressor (Trier Social Stress Test [TSST]) when compared
      to subjects randomized to an active control condition. However, as a result of the
      cross-sectional study design and lack of a meditation comparator arm, these results provide
      only partial insight into key issues outlined above regarding the role played by specific
      meditation procedures and/or practice time in observed physiological and behavioral outcomes.
      The primary hypothesis of the proposed work is that practicing a meditation procedure
      specifically designed to enhance empathic concern for others (i.e. compassion meditation)
      will optimize autonomic reactivity to psychosocial stress in a manner that results in
      diminished activation of peripheral inflammatory signaling pathways and reduced behavioral
      distress.
