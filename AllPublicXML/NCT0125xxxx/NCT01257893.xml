      The purpose of this study is to compare the rates of aspirin resistance (high residual
      platelet reactivity) between women with episodic and chronic migraine and women without
      migraine.

      Emerging evidence suggests that migraineurs, especially women &lt; 45 years who have aura, have
      an increased risk of stroke and myocardial infarction (MI, or heart attack). The mechanism
      linking migraine, stroke and MI is unclear although increased platelet activation and
      aggregation observed during and between migraine attacks may be a plausible theory.

      Aspirin is an inexpensive, relatively safe antiplatelet drug that reduces the risk of stroke
      and MI. Preliminary data suggest that aspirin's (325mg) therapeutic effect on platelet
      inhibition may be reduced in migraineurs (i.e., aspirin resistance), thus limiting aspirin's
      effectiveness at preventing stroke and MI risks in persons with migraine. Additional research
      is warranted to confirm these findings in migraineurs because daily, low-dose aspirin 81 mg
      is the recommended first line therapy for primary and secondary prevention of stroke and MI

      The researchers hypothesize that resistance to aspirin 81mg may occur more frequently in
      women with episodic and chronic migraine than in women without migraine. The findings may
      have important implications for women who have migraine and use aspirin to prevent migraine
      symptoms or comorbidities associated with migraine including stroke and MI.

      To test the hypothesis that the rate of aspirin resistance is greater in women with episodic
      and chronic migraine than in women without migraine, a three-group, randomized, double-blind,
      placebo-controlled, crossover design will be used to test the effects of aspirin 81 mg on
      platelet reactivity. Subjects will be randomized to treatment order (A) aspirin 81 mg for
      10-14 consecutive days followed by placebo for 10-14 consecutive days or (B) placebo for
      10-14 consecutive days followed by aspirin 81 mg for 10-14 consecutive days. Other than
      treatment order, subjects will be treated equally. Study procedures will be performed at the
      University of Washington, and the duration of the study per subject will be approximately 28
      days. Endpoints include: a) Aspirin Reaction Units (ARU) using a point-of-care assay
      (VerifyNow Aspirin™; Accumetrics, San Diego, CA); b) serum thromboxane B2; and c) percent
      platelet inhibition on aspirin. Assessment of adherence to study regimen will be assessed by
      serum salicylate, medication diaries, and pill counts. Data will also be collected on
      migraine frequency, burden, disability, and medications used to treat headache. Subjects will
      maintain a migraine diary for the duration of the study (28 days). The target sample will
      include women with episodic migraine (n=40; n=20 MA, n=20 MO), women with chronic migraine
      (n=40) and non-migraine controls (n=40).

      The specific aims of the study are as follows:

        -  Compare the rate of aspirin resistance between women with and without migraine following
           10-14 consecutive days of aspirin 81 mg treatment

        -  Compare the rate of aspirin resistance between women who have episodic migraine and
           chronic migraine following 10-14 consecutive days of aspirin 81 mg treatment

        -  Compare the rate of aspirin resistance between women who have migraine with aura (MA)
           and migraine without aura (MO) following 10-14 consecutive days of aspirin 81 mg or
           placebo treatment

        -  Compare the rate of aspirin resistance between women who have migraine with high monthly
           migraine frequency and low monthly migraine frequency following 10-14 consecutive days
           of aspirin 81 mg treatment
