  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Aim of this trial is to investigate the expression and localisation of different amino acid
      transporters and their regulatory proteins derived from the regulatory proteins of the local
      renin angiotensin system (RAS) in the intestine. This is investigated on one hand in patients
      who do not take any drugs interfering with RAS. On the other hand expression analysis is done
      in patients taking daily RAS-active drugs, like ACE inhibitors or sartanes.

      After obtaining informed consent of patients attending the hospital for clarification of
      gastrointestinal symptoms by gastroduodenoscopy or colonoscopy, 2 biopsies (in addition to
      biopsies needed for clinical diagnostics) will be taken from each duodenum, jejunum, ileum
      and descending colon.

      Biopsies are investigated anonymously at the Institute of Physiology of the University of
      Zurich. The mRNA content of amino acid transporters and regulatory proteins, respectively, in
      the biopsies is analyzed by quantitative PCR. Transport proteins are in addition analyzed
      with immunohistochemistry.

      Furthermore amino acid concentration in plasma and urine samples are analyzed by HPLC. From
      plasma and serum samples RAS parameters like renin, aldosterone, ACE and angiotensin(1-7) are
      measured.
