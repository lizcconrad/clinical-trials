  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare 18F-Fluoride PET bone scans to traditional 99mTc-MDP
      bone scan to determine if one is better for diagnosing bone metastases.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Compare the diagnostic sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of 18F-Fluoride PET bone scans
      versus traditional 99mTc-MDP bone scans for detecting bone metastases.

      Determine if there is a significant change in clinical management between the two types of
      scans.

      Measure and compare the number of equivocal or uncertain findings that would have caused
      additional testing, particularly additional imaging studies, to be performed for confirmation
      when using 18F-Fluoride PET bone scans versus 99mTc-MDP bone scans.

      To quantify any adverse events resulting from either scan.

      To perform subgroup analyses according to cancer cell type.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Accurate identification of bone metastases</measure>
    <time_frame>Upon study completion (2-3 years)</time_frame>
    <description>Individual subjects will be reviewed 6-12 months after their bone scans, utilizing all clinical and imaging data available, to determine diagnostic accuracy of each bone scan.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in clinical management</measure>
    <time_frame>Upon study completion (2-3 years)</time_frame>
    <description>We will be sending out clinical questionnaires to the referring physicians, asking if the bone scan results helped and/or changed their clinical management. Cumulative data for each type of bone scan will be compared.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Determine if F-18 PET bone scans lead to fewer follow-up imaging studies.</measure>
    <time_frame>Upon study completion (2-3 years)</time_frame>
    <description>The Tc-99m bone scans often give equivocal results that require other imaging studies, such as CT or MRI, for further evaluation. F-18 PET bone scans may give more definitive interpretations, and thus may lead to fewer follow-up studies being recommended/obtained.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Quantify any adverse events from either type of scan.</measure>
    <time_frame>Upon study completion (2-3 years)</time_frame>
    <description>Any adverse events related to either type of scan will be recorded. Adverse events would be rare.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Perform subgroup analyses according to cancer cell type.</measure>
    <time_frame>Upon study completion (2-3 years)</time_frame>
    <description>Both types of bone scans may be more or less accurate depending on the cancer cell type. We will attempt to address that question by performing subgroup analyses.</description>
