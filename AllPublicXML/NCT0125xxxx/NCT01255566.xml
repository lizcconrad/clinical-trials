    <textblock>
      This investigation is a prospective, multi-institutional cohort study comparing the
      differences in health-related quality-of-life (HRQoL) improvements between subjects electing
      continued medical management for chronic rhinosinusitis and those electing medical management
      plus surgical intervention.

      Our hypothesis is 3 fold: 1. That patients electing continued medical management will have
      less disease severity as measured by CT and baseline HRQoL scores, 2. Patients undergoing
      medical management plus ESS for chronic rhinosinusitis will experience a larger improvement
      in health related quality of life (HRQoL)compared to patients electing medical management
      alone, and 3. Patients undergoing medical management plus ESS for chronic rhinosinusitis will
      use fewer antibiotics, systemic steroids, and miss fewer days of work/school compared to
      patients electing medical management alone.

    <textblock>
      Chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) is a common health condition in the United States resulting in
      more than 500,000 surgical procedures annually. Since CRS is a disease process that is known
      to adversely affect quality of life, it is important to understand the short-term and
      long-term implications of different treatment options as documented by our patients'
      perception of their quality of life.

    <description>The RSDI is a validated, disease-specific quality-of-life survey designed for patients with sinonasal disease. The RSDI has three separate subscales incorporating 30 questions with a total score range of 0-120. The CSS is a validated, 6 question survey with two separate subscales which measure the impact of sinonasal symptoms and medication use in the preceding 8-week period. Total score range of 0-100 for total and subscale measures.</description>

        Adult subjects (&gt; 18 years) were prospectively enrolled from four tertiary rhinology
        practices including Oregon Health &amp; Science University (OHSU); Northwestern University
        (NWU); Medical University of South Carolina (MUSC); and the University of Pennsylvania
        (UPenn). All patients were diagnosed with chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) as defined by the
        2007 Adult Sinusitis Guidelines.
