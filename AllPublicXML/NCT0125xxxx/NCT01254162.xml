      This is a single-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled proof-of-concept study
      of the investigational product (0.75% (w/w) MTC896 Gel) compared to a placebo control.
      Subjects will be randomized to 1 of 2 treatment groups, 0.75% (w/w) MTC896 Gel or Placebo.
      Approximately 134 subjects will be enrolled to yield 60 completed subjects in each group. One
      group will receive once daily topical applications of 0.75% (w/w) MTC896 Gel to the forehead
      for 28 consecutive days, and the other will receive placebo under the identical regimen.
      Enrollment will be staggered to allow monitoring of safety and tolerability. A lead cohort
      will include approximately 20 subjects (10 in the MTC896 Group and 10 in the Placebo Group).
      Application on additional subjects will not be initiated until the lead cohort has completed
      the study.
