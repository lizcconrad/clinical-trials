    <textblock>
      Diagnostic procedures, such as digital mammography and MRI, may help measure how weight loss
      affects breast density in women who are at increased risk for breast cancer.

      OBJECTIVES: I. To determine if weight loss in patients undergoing Roux en Y gastric bypass
      procedures has any effect on breast density as measured by mammography and breast MRI.
      OUTLINE: GROUP I: Participants undergo mammography and MRI at baseline and 1 year.
      Participants also undergo gastric bypass surgery. GROUP II: Participants undergo mammography
      and MRI at baseline and 1 year. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up
      at 1 year.
