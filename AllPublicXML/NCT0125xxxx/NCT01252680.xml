      This is a randomized, double-blind clinical trial of two inactivated hepatitis A vaccines in
      healthy children, immunogenicity and interchangeability of the two inactivated hepatitis A
      vaccines were evaluated.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This was a monocenter, comparative trial in which healthy children were randomized to receive
      two doses of hepatitis A vaccine 6 months apart. The trial was conducted in accordance with
      the Edinburgh version of the Declaration of Helsinki. The study was approved by the Ethics
      Committee. Parents or legal guardians of all participants gave written informed consent prior
      to study entry. Eligible subjects were between 18m and 6 years of age, When enrolled,
      children were randomized to four equal groups with different intervention. Immunogenicity and
      interchangeability of two inactivated hepatitis A vaccines were evaluated.
