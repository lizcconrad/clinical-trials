  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Anti-VEGF therapy has been proven efficacious for the wet (neovascular) form of macular
      degeneration and may be beneficial for the treatment of choroidal neovascularization (CNV)
      due to other causes. The limitation of this type of treatment is the necessity for frequent
      intraocular injections. The purpose of this study is to determine if using anti-VEGF therapy
      in combination with photodynamic therapy can reduce the number of treatments needed with
      monotherapy while achieving similar visual results. There are ongoing multicenter trials
      evaluating combination therapy in patients with wet AMD but no similar trial for patients
      with CNV due to non-AMD causes. Therefore, in this study the investigators will focus on
      patients with CNV not due to AMD.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Ability to provide written informed consent and comply with study assessments for the
             full duration of the study.

          -  Age &gt; 18 years

          -  Clinical diagnosis of choroidal neovascularization secondary to the following causes:
             ocular histoplasmosis, toxoplasmosis, idiopathic, angioid streaks, choroidal ruptures,
             intraocular inflammation (without signs of active uveitis i.e. multifocal
             choroiditis), central serous retinopathy and pathologic Myopia.

        Only one eye will be assessed in the study. If both eyes are eligible, the investigator and
        patient will determine which eye is to be treated, considering such factors as disease
        duration, and likelihood of response to treatment.

          -  Clear media and dilation to permit good stereo fundus photography

          -  Evidence of active CNV present on OCT images manifest by subretinal fluid,

             contraindicates the use of an investigational drug or that might affect interpretation
             of the results of the study or render the subject at high risk for treatment
             complications.

          -  Current treatment for active systemic infection

          -  History of uncontrolled glaucoma (defined as intraocular pressure &gt;30mmHg despite
