      This is a multi-center, comparative, two-arm, parallel-group, single-blind, phase III study
      to assess immunogenicity and safety of 4th LBVH0101 (Haemophilus influenzae type b tetanus
      toxoid conjugate vaccine) vaccination compared with 4th Hiberix™ vaccination after the same
      vaccination with primary one in healthy toddlers who completed the primary vaccination with
      LBVH0101 or Hiberix™ in LG-VHCL002 study.

      Primary objective: This study was purposed to compare and assess immunogenicity of 4th
      LBVH0101 or Hiberix™ vaccination in toddlers who completed the primary vaccination with
      LBVH0101 or Hiberix™, respectively, in LG-VHCL002 study.

      Secondary objective: This study was purposed to compare and assess safety of 4th LBVH0101 or
      Hiberix™ vaccination in toddlers who completed primary vaccination with LBVH0101 or Hiberix™
      in LG-VHCL002 study. It was also purposed to assess persistence of immunogenicity prior to
      4th vaccination in toddlers who completed the primary vaccination with LBVH0101 or Hiberix™,
      respectively, in LG-VHCL002 study.
