      We designed a study for evaluate the efficacy of Helicobacter pylori eradication for the 1st
      line treatment of immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) patients with moderate
      thrombocytopenia.

      If this eradication treatment is revealed effective on ITP patients with more than 30X109/L
      of platelet, it would be valuable treatment especially for young ITP patients with mild to
      moderate thrombocytopenia.
