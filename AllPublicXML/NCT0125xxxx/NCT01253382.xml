      The primary objective of this study is:

        -  assess the safety and tolerability of ecallantide in paediatric patients for acute
           attacks of HAE

      The secondary objectives are:

        -  evaluate the pharmacokinetic profile of ecallantide in paediatric patients treated for
           acute attacks of HAE

        -  assess the efficacy of ecallantide in paediatric patients treated for moderate to severe
           acute attacks of HAE

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Male or female from 2 years of age and prepubertal

          2. Physician diagnosis and history of HAE (Type I or II) including laboratory results
             showing C1-1NH activity below the lower limit of normal or up to 15% above the lower
             limit of the normal range

          3. Present at the site with moderate to severe signs and symptoms of an acute attack of
             HAE within 8 hours of recognition of the onset of the attack. Spontaneous resolution
             of the attack must not have begun before the administration of study drug.

          4. Must have signed informed consent by parent or caregiver.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. &lt;2 years of age or have reached puberty

          2. Received treatment with ecallantide within previous 72 hours

          3. Received an investigational drug or device, other than ecallantide, within 30 days
             prior to the screening visit

          4. Pharyngeal/laryngeal symptoms

          5. Mild attacks including mild edema of the extremities and mild abdominal attacks

          6. Are unable or unwilling to give informed consent (parent or caregiver)

          7. Any other condition that, in the opinion of the investigator, may compromise the
             safety or compliance of the patient or would preclude the patient from successful
             completion of the study
