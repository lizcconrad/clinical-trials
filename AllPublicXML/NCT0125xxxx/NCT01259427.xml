      The purpose of this study is to determine if Ending Self-Stigma (ESS), a 9-session group
      intervention designed to assist veterans with serious mental illness to develop skills (SMI)
      to effectively cope with stigma and minimize the internalization of stigmatizing beliefs and
      stereotypes, is more effective in reducing internalized stigma and its associated effects
      than an active comparison group.

      Background:

      Stigmatizing beliefs and attitudes about mental illness are prevalent and exposure to stigma
      is common among people with mental illness. The negative effects of stigma are compounded
      when a veteran with Serious Mental Illness (SMI) internalizes these stigmatizing assumptions
      and stereotypes. Internalized stigma refers to the process in which a person with mental
      illness cognitively or emotionally absorbs negative messages or stereotypes about mental
      illness and comes to believe them and apply them to him/herself. Internalized stigma is
      evident among veterans with SMI and can lead to decreased self-efficacy, increased
      depression, social withdrawal, and curtailed pursuit of recovery goals.

      Objectives:

      The investigators developed Ending Self Stigma (ESS), a 9-session group intervention to
      assist veterans with SMI to develop skills to effectively cope with stigma and minimize the
      internalization of stigmatizing beliefs and stereotypes. The primary objectives of this
      project are to compare the effects of ESS to a general health and wellness group in: 1)
      reducing internalized stigma and 2) improving proximal psychosocial outcomes (e.g.,
      self-efficacy, belonging, recovery orientation). Secondary objectives include assessing the
      effects of ESS on improving distal psychosocial outcomes (e.g., quality of life, social
      functioning) and examining if improvements are maintained 6-months post-treatment.

      Methods:

      This study is a randomized trial of veterans with SMI receiving outpatient mental health
      services from three VA Medical Centers. Participants are randomly assigned to ESS or a
      general health and wellness group, which they attend once a week for 9 weeks. ESS focuses on
      teaching strategies/tools to help participants address self-stigma. The health and wellness
      group focuses on providing information/ education to help participants better manage
      health-related concerns (e.g. physical activity, nutrition). Participants complete
      assessments at baseline, post-treatment, and 6-months post-treatment. A two-level mixed
      effects model with adjustment for baseline response will be used to address the primary and
      secondary aims. Qualitative data on veterans' experiences of and strategies for coping with
      internalized stigma are being collected from a subset of veterans from both conditions to
      compare experiences of veterans in both groups and explore any reasons for ESS drop-out.

      Status:

      Data collection for the project is completed. Analysis of 6-month post-treatment assessments
      and qualitative interviews are currently being conducted.

    <measure>Internalized Stigma of Mental Illness Inventory (Internalized Stigma)</measure>
    <time_frame>~3 months (post-treatment)</time_frame>
    <description>The Internalized Stigma of Mental Illness Inventory was used to measure of internalized or self-stigma. A total score is calculated by taking an average of the responses on the items (range=1 to 4). Higher total scores indicate greater internalized stigma.</description>

    <measure>Maryland Assessment of Recovery for Serious Mental Illness Scale (Recovery)</measure>
    <time_frame>~3 1/2 months (post-treatment)</time_frame>
    <description>The Maryland Assessment of Recovery in Serious Mental Illness is a self-report measure of recovery in people with serious mental illness. A total score was calculated by summing item responses (range=25 to 125), with higher total scores indicating greater self-reported recovery.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>General Self-Efficacy Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>~3 1/2 months (post-treatment)</time_frame>
    <description>The General Self-efficacy measure was used to measure of self-efficacy. A total score was calculated by averaging the responses on the items (range=1 to 5), with higher scores indicating greater self-efficacy.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Sense of Belonging Instrument (Belonging)</measure>
    <time_frame>~3 1/2 months (post-treatment)</time_frame>
    <description>The Sense of Belonging Instrument was used to measure perceived belongingness. The measure includes two subscales: the psychological experience of belonging (SOBI-P) and antecedents that foster belonging (SOBI-A). An average of the sum of the items in each subscale were used to calculate the total score for that subscale. The total score of the SOBI-P ranges from 18 to 72, with higher scores indicating less experienced belonging. The total score of the SOBI-A ranges from 14-56 with higher score indicating greater antecedents that foster belonging.</description>

    <measure>Quality of Life</measure>
    <time_frame>~3 1/2 months (post-treatment)</time_frame>
    <description>The Satisfaction with Life in General item from the Brief Quality of Life Scale was used to assess self-reported life satisfaction. The item is rated on a 7-point scale that ranges from terrible to delighted (range=1 to 7), with greater scores indicating more satisfaction.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Social Engagement/Withdrawal</measure>
    <time_frame>~3 1/2 months (post-treatment)</time_frame>
    <description>The total score of the Social Engagement/Withdrawal subscale of the Social Functioning Scale was used to measure social engagement. The total score ranges from 0 to 15 with higher scores indicating greater social engagement.</description>

An average of the sum of the items in each subscale were used to calculate the total score for that subscale. The total score of the SOBI-P ranges from 18 to 72, with higher scores indicating less experienced belonging. The total score of the SOBI-A ranges from 14-56 with higher score indicating greater antecedents that foster belonging.</description>
