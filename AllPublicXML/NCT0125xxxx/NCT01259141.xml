    <textblock>
      Mycoplasma pneumoniae, an important pathogen of community acquired pneumonia,are becoming
      more and more resistant to macrolide. The study aim is to optimize anti-infection therapy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Mycoplasma pneumoniae was one of important atypical pathogens of community acquired
      pneumonia. As lack of cell wall, β-lactam medicines were invalid, however, macrolides,
      tetracyclines and quinolones were effective. But from 2001, many countries reported
      macrolide- resistant Mycoplasma pneumoniae. Typically, erythromycin was first-line antibiotic
      medicine. With the resistance increasing, Mycoplasm pneumonia treatment will become more and
      more difficult. Thus, optimization of Mycoplasm pneumonia antibiotic therapy is very
      important.
