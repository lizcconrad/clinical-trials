      cough as compared to a placebo syrup.

    <textblock>
      Subjects will be asked to take 4 doses of 5 ml containing a mixture of honey and other
      natural ingredients or a placebo syrup everyday, during 8 days. The following outcomes will
      be noted down in a diary: occurence and severity of diurnal and nocturnal cough events (cough
      score) and symptoms, impediment of normal life activities (school, sleeping), the number of
      medical visits and type of medication needed if any.
