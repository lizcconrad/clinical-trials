  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this clinical study is to learn the feasibility of using a single session of
      radiation, known as spine stereotactic radiosurgery (SSRS), to treat metastatic epidural
      spinal cord compression.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Spinal cord compression is often treated with surgery followed by radiation in small doses
      everyday for a number of days. When a patient cannot or will not have surgery, radiation is
      given daily. With increased accuracy and precision, higher doses of radiation can be given in
      a single session. Giving a higher dose in a single session may increase the chance that the
      tumor will stop growing into the spinal canal and will prevent spinal cord injury. This study
      will also help to identify the tolerance of the spinal cord to radiation in a single session.

      Spine Stereotactic Radiosurgery:

      You will lie in the mold that was made for you for 45-120 minutes while you receive your
      radiation treatment.

      Follow-up Visits:

      You will have follow-up visits at Months 3 (+/-2 weeks ), 6 (+/-4 weeks), 9 (+/-4 weeks), 12
      (+/-8 weeks), 18 (+/-8 weeks), and 24 (+/-8 weeks) and then every 6 months after that. At
      each follow-up visit:

        -  Your medical history will be recorded, including any use of steroids.

        -  You will have a neurological exam.

        -  You will complete the 3 questionnaires about health, symptoms you may be having, and
           about pain.

        -  You will have an MRI of the spine (except for Month 1).

      If you are unable to return for follow-up clinic visits, you will be called and asked about
      your medical history, and you will complete the 3 questionnaires about your health, symptoms
      you may be having, and about pain. This call should take about 20 minutes.

      Length of Study:

      Your treatment will last 1 day. You will continue having follow-up visits or phone calls for
      as long as possible.

      This is an investigational study. SSRS is FDA approved. The use of SSRS to treat metastatic
      epidural spinal cord compression is investigational.

      Up to 36 patients will take part in this study. All will be enrolled at M. D. Anderson.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Greater than or equal to 18 years old

          2. Radiographically documented metastatic epidural compression on spine Magnetic
             resonance imaging (MRI) within 4 weeks of registration, defined radiographically,
             ranging from minimal canal compromise and thecal indentation to actual displacement of
             the spinal cord.

          3. Maximum of 3 contiguous vertebral levels involved with metastasis in the spine to be
             irradiated in a single session

          4. Signed Informed consent

          5. Diagnosis of cancer (not one of the more radiosensitive histologies, see exclusion
             criteria) including but not limited to non-small cell lung cancer, breast, prostate,
             renal cell, melanoma, gastrointestinal, sarcoma, thyroid, head and neck primary, and
             unknown primary tumors

          6. Motor Strength &gt;/= 4 out of 5 in extremity or extremities affected by the level of the
             spinal cord compression

          7. Karnofsky performance status (KPS) &gt;/= 40

          8. Patients deemed to be inoperable by patient refusal, by neurosurgical evaluation, or
             for any reason

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Patient with radiosensitive histologies (lymphoma, multiple myeloma, small cell
             carcinoma, germ cell tumors) as conventional radiation is likely to be effective

          2. Prior irradiation of the spine site and level to be treated

          3. Inability to tolerate lying flat on treatment table for greater than 30 minutes.
