  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

        Subjects will be eligible if the following criteria are met:

          1. Age &gt; 18 years

          2. Diagnosis of diabetes mellitus (type 1 or 2)

          3. Residual edema as determined by mean foveal thickness on Spectralis OCT (optical
             coherence tomography) &gt; 300 microns and leakage seen on FA at baseline

          4. Clinical evidence of retinal thickening due to macular edema involving the center of
             the macula, associated with diabetic retinopathy.

          5. Previous history of at least 3-5 or more consecutive 1.25 mg of intravitreal
             bevacizumab injections for the treatment of diabetic macular edema (consecutive
             injections administered no more than 6 weeks apart).

          6. BCVA of 20/32-20/400 using Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS)

          7. Media clarity, pupillary dilation and patient cooperation sufficient to allow OCT
             testing and retinal photography

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Pregnancy (positive pregnancy test) or known to be pregnant; also pre-menopausal women
             not using adequate contraception.

          2. Participation in another ocular investigation or trial simultaneously.

          3. Systemic use of anti-VEGF within 3 months prior to day 0.

          4. Blood pressure &gt; 180/110 (systolic above 180 OR diastolic above 110)

          5. Any condition that, in the opinion of the investigator, would preclude participation
             in the study (e.g. chronic alcoholism, drug abuse).

          6. Evidence of vitreoretinal interface abnormality after ocular exam or OCT that may be
             contributing to the macular edema.

          7. An eye that, in the investigator's opinion, has no chance of improving in visual
             acuity following resolution of macular edema (e.g. presence of subretinal fibrosis,
             ischemic maculopathy or geographic atrophy).

          8. Presence of another ocular condition that may affect the visual acuity or macular
             edema during the course of the study (e.g. Age-related Macular Degeneration, uveitis,
             Irvine-Gass).

          9. Evidence of active neovascularization of the iris or retina.

         10. Evidence of central atrophy or fibrosis in the study eye.

         11. Presence of substantial cataract, one that might decrease the vision by 3 or more
             lines of vision at sometime during the study.

         12. History of vitreous surgery in the study eye.

         13. History of cataract surgery within 6 months of enrollment.

         14. History of YAG capsulotomy within 2 months of enrollment.
