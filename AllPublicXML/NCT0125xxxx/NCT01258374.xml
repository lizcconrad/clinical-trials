    <textblock>
      While 3-drug regimens remain standard of care, concerns exist regarding the safety of
      multi-drug regimens taken for a lifetime. Problems with nucleoside analogue therapy prompted
      successful trials with ritonavir (RTV) boosted PI monotherapy, however long term safety and
      efficacy of such regimens remains unknown. Clinical trials have shown Raltegravir (RAL) to
      have potent activity when patients have few active background drugs; it has a superior lipid
      profile compared with EFV and LPV/RTV. Darunavir/r (DRV) is a potent, well tolerated PI with
      few GI side effects and lipid disturbances and with a high genetic barrier. The investigators
      hypothesized that RAL/DRV would be a well tolerated and effective regimen for those patients
      who are failing nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors based regimens, due to poor
      tolerability or resistance. The investigators also would like to explore the plasma
      pharmacokinetics of Raltegravir combined with Darunavir in a sub-group of 12 HIV-infected
      patients.

      Hypothesis

        -  NRTI-sparing regimens are attractive options to avoid NRTI-associated toxicity and to
           provide a full active regimen in patients with some extent of NRTI resistance.

        -  Raltegravir (RAL) and Darunavir (DRV) are potent &quot;third drugs&quot; and they provide a
           synergistic inhibition of 2 different steps in HIV replication.

        -  DRV has a high genetic barrier, and could be an excellent accompanying drug for
           Raltegravir, providing a potent, safe and well tolerated dual therapy to patients who
           are failing NNRTI based treatments.

      Objectives:

        -  To describe the safety, tolerability and efficacy of the combination of Raltegravir and
           Darunavir after 24 weeks of follow up in HIV infected patients failing a NRTI based
           regimen.

        -  To describe plasma pharmacokinetics of Raltegravir when combined with Darunavir 800mg QD
           in HIV-infected patients.
