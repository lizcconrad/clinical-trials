      Obesity is a risk factor for calcaneal spur (CS) formation which is supposed to originate
      from chronic plantar fasciitis. Diabetes mellitus may contribute to the risk of CS by
      decreased ability of tissue repair and increased reactive ossification. Thus, the
      investigators aimed to determine CS incidence in asymptomatic obese subjects with and without
      type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM).

      OBJECTIVE-Obesity is a risk factor for calcaneal spur (CS) formation which is supposed to
      originate from chronic plantar fasciitis. Diabetes mellitus may contribute to the risk of CS
      by decreased ability of tissue repair and increased reactive ossification. Thus, the
      investigators aimed to determine CS incidence in asymptomatic obese subjects with and without
      type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM).

      RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS—Ninety-three obese patients with T2DM and forty-two obese
      subjects without any metabolic disturbances as control were evaluated with lateral calcaneal
      x-ray in blinded fashion by a radiologist. All participants were informed and written
      consents have been obtained. Control cases were subjected to 75g glucose challenge test and
      glucose intolerant subjects were excluded.

      RESULTS—T2DM and control groups were statistically similar in mean age (59±10.5 vs. 55±8 yrs,
      P=0.196, respectively) and mean body mass index (BMI)(35.1±4.3 vs. 33.1±3.3 kg/m2, P=0.073,
      respectively). Existence of calcaneal spur was 72% in 93 patients (77%) in T2DM group and 24
      in 42 (57%) in control group. Groups were significantly different according to existence of
      CS (P=0.023). Mean age and mean BMI were significantly higher in diabetic patients with
      calcaneal spur than diabetic patients without calcaneal spur (p=0.001 and p=0.015,
      respectively). There was positive correlation between existence of calcaneal spur and
      peripheral neuropathy (p=0,043) in diabetics but no significant relation between existence of
      CS and glycolysed hemoglobin levels or diabetes duration (all P&gt;0.05).

      CONCLUSIONS—Clinicians should pay attention the increased incidence of CS in patients with
      T2DM to avoid foot complications.
