      The purpose of this research is to see if non-drug ingredients in capsules and oral solutions
      affect how well drugs are absorbed. This is called &quot;bioequivalence.&quot; Medications taken by
      mouth, such as capsules and solutions, need to be absorbed into the body in order to do any
      good. Capsules and solutions contain a drug, but also contain non-drug ingredients that are
      called excipients or fillers. Excipients in the capsules and solutions can impact how much
      drug is absorbed into the body. This is called &quot;bioINequivalence.&quot; Capsules and solutions in
      this research contain the drug cimetidine. This drug is being used since it has high water
      solubility (can dissolve in water) and low ability to be absorbed.

      The investigators anticipate that common excipients do not cause bioINequivalence. 1) The
      hypothesize is that commonly used excipients in oral medications change the rate or extent of
      Class 3 drug absorption and result in bioINequivalence. 2) Alternative hypothesis is that
      commonly used excipients in oral medications do not change the rate or extent of Class 3 drug
      absorption and do not result in bioINequivalence.
