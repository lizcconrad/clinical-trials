  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Studies revealed that patients with hereditary persistence of AFP also had persistent
      abnormal AFP. Therefore, this study will recruit the patients and their family with elevated
      AFP (&gt;20 ng/mL) and normal AFP patients being control groups. Then, their AFP genes extracted
      from the blood will be analyzed.

    <textblock>
      Abnormal AFP elevation was usually noted in liver regeneration, HCC, nonseminomatous germ
      cell tumors or other malignant tumors. However, some studies revealed that patients with
      hereditary persistence of AFP also had persistent abnormal AFP. Therefore, we study will
      recruit the patients and their family with elevated AFP (&gt;20 ng/mL) and normal AFP patients
      being control groups. Then, their AFP genes extracted from the blood will be analyzed. The
      hypothesis of this study is that the mutation of AFP gene might be one of the causes of
      abnormal AFP.
