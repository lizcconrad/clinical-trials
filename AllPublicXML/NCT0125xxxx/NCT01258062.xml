  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a double-blind, placebo controlled, safety and immunogenicity study of GelVac™ nasal
      powder H5N1 influenza vaccine. Healthy male and female subjects between 18 and 49 years of
      age who are eligible for study participation will be enrolled in the trial. It is expected
      that 10 subjects will be screened to obtain 7 subjects who will be eligible for study
      participation.

      The primary objective is to determine the frequency and severity of local and systemic
      adverse events of vaccine.

      The secondary objective is to assess the immunogenicity of the vaccine based on geometric
      mean titers (GMT) of serum HAI, serum neutralizing, and nasal wash IgA antibodies.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. able to read and sign Informed Consent Form (ICF).

          2. male or female &gt; 18 and &lt; 49 years of age at the time the ICF is signed.

             barrier method with spermicide.

          6. if female, post menopausal (no menstrual period within the last 12 months), surgically
             sterile (hysterectomy or tubal ligation), or have a negative urine pregnancy test
             within 24 hours prior to the time of vaccination.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. has a known allergy to fruits (e.g., apples, oranges) or pectin and/or pectin
             by-products (including jams or jellies).

          2. has a known allergy to dairy/milk products/lactose.

          3. is breast-feeding or pregnant or planning on becoming pregnant within 1 month of
             vaccination.

          4. has a history of a chronic viral infection (i.e.; Shingles, Herpes Zoster, HIV).

          5. has a history of severe allergic reaction following influenza vaccination, systemic
             hypersensitivity to any of the vaccine components, or history of a life-threatening
             reaction to a vaccine containing the same substances.

          8. immunosuppression as a result of underlying illness or treatment.

          9. use of oral steroids, parenteral steroids, or high-dose inhaled steroids (&gt;800 µg/day
             of beclomethasone dipropionate or equivalent) within 1 month prior to vaccination.

         22. acute respiratory disease at the time of enrollment.

         23. febrile illness with temperature greater than or equal to 38 degrees Celsius (100.4
