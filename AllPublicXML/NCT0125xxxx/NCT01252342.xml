  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Oxytocin use has become routine practice in elective cesarean delivery to promote uterine
      contraction and reduce blood loss. However, there is a lack of consensus regarding the best
      dose of oxytocin and the most effective route of administration. Most dosage and delivery
      systems have been empirically derived.

      It is currently our practice at the Royal University Hospital to start an oxytocin infusion
      (20U/L) once the baby has been delivered. Some anesthesiologists use bolus intravenous
      oxytocin and it is occasionally requested by the obstetrician. A few obstetricians also
      choose to inject bolus oxytocin directly into the uterus (intramyometrial).

      The primary objectives of the study include:

        1. Determine if our standard 'low dose' oxytocin infusion is adequate prophylaxis to
           prevent need for additional uterotonics, including additional oxytocin;

        2. Determine if the addition of prophylactic intramyometrial oxytocin improves both the
           primary outcome (uterine tone) and secondary outcomes (estimated blood loss,
           preoperative to postoperative change in hematocrit, need for additional uterotonics, and
           need for blood pressure support); and

        3. Act as a dose finding study to determine if the intramyometrial dose is sufficient to
           augment uterine contraction.

      The working hypothesis is that the use of intramyometrial oxytocin will not improve primary
      or secondary outcomes compared to the current practice of an oxytocin infusion alone.

  <why_stopped>
    Proposed doses were too large, bolus oxytocin may cause cases of arrythmias, and some even
    advocate slowing down the infusion rates that are currently used.
