  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study investigates the effects of daily use of lithia water on blood tests of neuronal
      oxidative stress, mood, and well-being. Lithia water is a type of pure spring water
      containing trace levels of lithium, which is a naturally occurring mineral. Neuronal
      oxidative stress is caused by normal chemical reactions in the human body that sometimes
      result in damage to brain cells. Participation in this study will last for 8 weeks and
      includes daily use of study water for drinking.

      The primary objective of this pilot study is to test the hypothesis that, in healthy male
      participants, daily use of lithia water will improve neurogenesis and antioxidant capacity as
      measured by serum levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and oxidative stress
      markers. Secondary objectives will include examining self-reported changes in mood,
      cognition, and well-being.

      There is some indication from epidemiological studies that areas with trace concentrations of
      lithium in drinking water have lower rates of suicide. This study will evaluate the effects
      of drinking EDJ (pronounced &quot;edge&quot;) lithia spring water (which comes from a natural spring in
      the Rocky Mountains and contains trace amounts [0.68 mg/litre] of lithium) for 4 weeks,
      compared to drinking commercially available bottled water (which contains no lithium at all)
      for 4 weeks.

      This pilot study has been designed as an 8-week randomized, counterbalanced, crossover study
      in 15 healthy male participants. Eligible participants will use lithia water or control water
      for daily ingestion for 4 weeks, then cross over to the other condition for another 4 weeks.
      At baseline and after each 4-week condition, participants will complete self-report
      questionnaires of mood, cognition and well-being, and blood samples will be assayed for BDNF
      and oxidative stress protein markers.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Male participants aged 19-35 years. [Note: women are excluded in this pilot study
             because the variable effects of female sex hormones on oxidative stress markers and
             neurogenesis];

          -  No current, past or family history (in first-degree relatives) of a major psychiatric
             disorder or alcohol/substance abuse/dependence;

          -  Non-smokers [because smoking is associated with increased oxidative stress];
