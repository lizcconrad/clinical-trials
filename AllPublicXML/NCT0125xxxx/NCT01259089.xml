    <textblock>
      Hsp90 inhibitor AUY922 and erlotinib hydrochloride may stop the growth of tumor cells by
      blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. This phase I/II trial is studying the
      side effects and best dose of Hsp90 inhibitor AUY922 when given together with erlotinib
      hydrochloride and to see how well it works in treating patients with stage IIIB-IV non-small
      cell lung cancer.

      This is a phase I, dose-escalation study of Hsp90 inhibitor AUY922 followed by a phase II
      study. Patients receive Hsp90 inhibitor AUY922 IV over 1 hour once weekly and oral erlotinib
      hydrochloride once daily. Courses repeat every 4 weeks in the absence of disease progression
      or unacceptable toxicity. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up
      periodically.
