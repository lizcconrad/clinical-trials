  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The etiology of schizophrenia remains unclear In recent one decade, hypofunction of
      N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor has been implicated in the pathophysiology of
      schizophrenia. Hence, enhancing NMDA neurotransmission was considered as a new approach for
      schizophrenia treatment.

      To date, refractory schizophrenia (particularly clozapine-resistant) is still a difficult
      clinical issue. However, the effect of NMDA treatment in refractory schizophrenia is still
      unknown. Therefore, the primary goal of this study is to investigate the efficacy and safety
      of NMDA adjuvant therapy in refractory schizophrenia, and to identify the predictors for
      treatment response to NMDA enhancers.

      The etiology of schizophrenia remains unclear. In recent one decade, hypofunction of
      N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor has been implicated in the pathophysiology of
      schizophrenia. Hence, enhancing NMDA neurotransmission was considered as a new approach for
      schizophrenia treatment. To date, there have been a few pilot studies exploring the efficacy
      of NMDA enhancers as adjuvant therapy for schizophrenia, for instance, D-serine (an
      endogenous agonist of the NMDA-glycine site). They were not only well-tolerated but also
      synergistic in improving positive, negative and cognitive symptoms in those receiving typical
      and atypical antipsychotics (except clozapine).

      Refractory schizophrenia (particularly clozapine-resistant) is still a difficult clinical
      issue at present. Previous studies revealed that add-on treatment of D-serine or other
      agonists of NMDA receptor failed to give significant benefits in such patients. The primary
      goal of this study is to investigate the efficacy and safety of glycine transporter(GlyT)-1
      inhibitor adjuvant therapy in refractory schizophrenia, and to identify the predictors for
      treatment response to NMDA enhancers.
