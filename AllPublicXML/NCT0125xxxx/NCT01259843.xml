  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study examined the clinical characteristics and conditions of care for patients with
      acute aortic syndrome (AAS) that will identify patients at risk for increased morbidity and
      mortality and provide a basis for the eventual achievement of specific studies on the optimal
      therapeutic management according to different risk profiles. The aim of the Observatory is to
      provide a photograph &quot;size&quot; of practices in France at present, both in the larger centers
      than in smaller and optimize diagnostic and therapeutic currently available by the activation
      pathways of rational management.

    <time_frame>1 day</time_frame>
    <description>Measure the respective contribution of each of the etiologies of AAS (aortic dissection type A aortic dissection type B aortic wall hematoma, penetrating atherosclerotic ulcer, aneurysm of the thoracic aorta complicated).</description>

    <time_frame>1 day</time_frame>
    <description>Identify and define the specific clinical picture of each of these new entities recently dismembered as part of AAS. Indeed, if the clinical presentation of classic aortic dissection A and B is well known, that of other entities, individualized recently, remains poorly described.</description>

    <time_frame>1 day</time_frame>
    <description>Evaluate the performance and the respective roles of the various diagnostic tests including recent acquisitions little or no invasive; Trans thoracic ultrasound, ultrasound and trans esophageal chest scan.</description>
