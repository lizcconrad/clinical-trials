Following are major elements:
Talk to the subjects to find their main problems; introduce knowledge and medication knowledge about cancer and depression; subjects reporting use of drugs for cancer and depression and a variety of signs and symptoms of the reaction. Encourage patients to adhere to drug treatment and to comply with this research program; The operation of CBT and clinical management should be conducted by the same person as far as possible.</description>

Clinical Management: Clinical management is a clear contrast method of psychological therapy, which is a half-structured interview and lasting for 20-25 minutes each session. Clinical management will be assigned to both experimental group and controlled group in the first stage of intervention.
Following are major elements:
Talk to the subjects to find their main problems; introduce knowledge and medication knowledge about cancer and depression; subjects reporting use of drugs for cancer and depression and a variety of signs and symptoms of the reaction. Encourage patients to adhere to drug treatment and to comply with this research program; The operation of CBT and clinical management should be conducted by the same person as far as possible.</description>
