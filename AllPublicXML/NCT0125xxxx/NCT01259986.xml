      The purpose of this study is the evaluate the efficacy of using a low-energy 635 nm visible
      light laser in the treatment of various recalcitrant forms of vitiligo.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Vitiligo is a pigmentary disorder characterized by depigmented and hypopigmented macules and
      patches. There are forms of vitiligo which are more resistant to treatment, including
      segmental vitiligo and acral vitiligo. Previous studies have shown that a low energy
      helium-neon (633 nm) laser can cause increased proliferation of melanocytes and
      repigmentation in segmental-type vitiligo. The goal of this study is to verify these results
      and show efficacy in other recalcitrant forms of vitiligo including acral vitiligo and post
      melanocyte-keratinocyte transplantation vitiligo.
