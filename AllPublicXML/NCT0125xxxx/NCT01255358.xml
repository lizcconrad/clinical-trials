    <textblock>
      Multi-centre, single arm, open label, 6 months, phase II study to evaluate the effect of
      Ery-Dex in improving Central Nervous System (CNS) symptoms in patients with Ataxia
      Teleangiectasia (AT). The study consists of a screening period (max duration of 30 days) and
      a treatment period (duration 6 months).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study has the aim to evaluate the improvement in CNS symptoms measured by International
      Co-operative Ataxia Rating Scale (ICARS) in patients with AT, during a period of treatment
      with Ery-Dex (dexamethasone sodium phosphate ex vivo encapsulated into human autologous
      erythrocytes).
