  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The current study is a prospective evaluation of the ability of ketosis to shift
      mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) heteroplasmy in subjects harboring a known mutation in their mtDNA
      at position 3243 (A&gt;G). Subjects will be given supplemental medium chain triglycerides (MCTs)
      for a period of 6 months. mtDNA heteroplasmy will be measured 3 months prior to treatment, at
      treatment initiation, and 6 months after initiation.

      The primary objective of the current study is to determine if there is a shift in
      heteroplasmy in patients harboring the 3243 A&gt;G mtDNA mutation to a more favorable (higher
      wild-type) profile while in a state of ketosis.

      The current study is a prospective evaluation of the ability of ketosis to shift
      mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) heteroplasmy in subjects harboring a known pathogenic mutation in
      their mtDNA at position 3243 (A&gt;G). Subjects will be induced in to ketosis by administration
      of supplemental medium chain triglycerides (MCTs) for a period of 6 months. mtDNA
      heteroplasmy will be assessed 3 months prior to treatment, at treatment initiation, and 6
      months after initiation.

      The primary objective of the current study is to determine if there is a shift in
      heteroplasmy in patients harboring the 3243 A&gt;G mtDNA mutation to a more favorable (higher
      wild-type) genotypic profile while in a state of ketosis.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Subject is informed and given ample opportunity to consider his/her participation and
             has given his/her written consent.

          2. Subject is willing and able to comply with all trial requirements.

          3. Subject harbors the 3243 A&gt;G mtDNA mutation at a level detectable in blood.

          4. Female subjects of child-bearing potential must not be pregnant. Female subjects of
             child-bearing potential (not surgically sterile or 2 years post-menopausal) must also
             agree to use appropriate contraceptive methods (abstinence, oral, injectable,
             implantable, or barrier) for the duration of the trial.

          5. Subject must not have diabetes mellitus.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Subject is currently participating or has participated within the last 2 months in any
             clinical trial involving treatment of mitochondrial disorders with MCT supplementation
             or induction of ketosis.

          2. Subject has a medical condition that could reasonably be exacerbated by ketone
             supplementation (including diabetes mellitus).

          3. Subject is unable to give reasonable informed consent/assent.

          4. Subject is a pregnant or nursing female.
