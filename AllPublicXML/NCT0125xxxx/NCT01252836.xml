      Use of AWBAT-D on split thickness skin graft sites will reduce healing time and pain level.

      The study is designed as a randomized-controlled trial to examine split thickness skin graft
      donor wound site healing using AWBAT-D compared to current standard of care: Tegaderm. This
      will involve randomizing subjects to treatment with the AWBAT-D dressing or Tegaderm and
      monitoring outcomes. The AWBAT-D device has collagen and we hypothesize that the wounds
      treated with it will heal faster and with a decreased pain level. The purpose of this study
      is to evaluate if there are differences in outcomes between AWBAT-D and Tegaderm in healing
      split thickness skin graft donor sites.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Subject is 18 years of age or older

          2. Subjects requiring a split-thickness skin graft with a wound size between 5 and 50cm2
             and a depth between 12-18um.

          3. Ability and willingness to understand and comply with study procedures and to give
             written informed consent prior to enrollment in the study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Subjects &lt; 18 years of age

          2. Subjects with an allergy to porcine products.

          3. Subjects undergoing STSG with a wound size less than 5 cm2 or greater than 50cm2.

          4. Subjects undergoing STSG with a wound depth of less than 12um or greater than 18um.

          5. Subjects undergoing repeat skin graft harvesting at the same donor site.

          6. Has active malignant disease of any kind. A subject, who has had a malignant disease
             in the past, was treated and is currently disease-free, may be considered for study
             entry.

          7. Subjects participating in any other trials involving the split-thickness skin graft
             donor site.
