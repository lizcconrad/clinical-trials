    <textblock>
      Emtosecond lasers are used in cutting the flap in LASIK procedures (laser corrective surgery
      for refractive error). Their use has decreased the incidence of serious complications when
      compared to the use of microkeratomes(mechanical blades). The commonest femtosecond laser
      currently used is 'Intralase'. A newer femtosecond laser 'Visumax' (Zeiss) is now available
      and differs from the Intralase in that it does not interfere with the curvature of the cornea
      when creating the flap. The Intralase applanates the cornea flat during flap creation which
      causes the intraocular pressure to be higher. Both Intralase and Visumax lasers are available
      to patients and surgeons to use at SNEC. The aim of the investigators study is to compare the
      two lasers in a randomization of left and right eyes in the same patient. The investigators
      want to measure any difference that the lower intraocular pressure may have during the
      creation of the flap. This will be measured with a questionaire on patient experience during
      the procedure and the outcomes of vision, refraction, contrast sensitivity, wave-front
      analysis, tear function,corneal sensation and flap thickness measured with anterior segment
      OCT during the post-operative follow up period. To date no-one has compared the use of these
      two femtosecond lasers. Both lasers are currently used clinically for flap creation at SNEC.
