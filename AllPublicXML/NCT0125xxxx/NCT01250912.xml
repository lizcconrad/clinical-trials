    <textblock>
      Some patients are at risk for life-threatening fast heart rates. These can frequently be
      treated by using a catheter inside the heart to burn away the cells that create the fast
      heart rates. The purpose of this study is to image the nerves inside the heart of those
      patients. The investigators want to find out if abnormalities in the nervous system in the
      heart can help the physician to find the area that needs to be burnt away.

    <textblock>
      Ventricular tachycardia is the next frontier in cardiology. Patients that have scar in the
      heart (for example after heart attacks) are at an increased risk of developing ventricular
      tachycardia. In these patients ventricular tachycardia represents an electrical wave front
      that circulates in the heart muscle using the scar in the heart. An increasing number of
      patients with ventricular tachycardia require cauterization (burning away) of the tissue to
      treat this life-threatening condition. The goal of this cauterization or ablation is to
      destroy &quot;highways of surviving tissue&quot; inside the scar, that allow ventricular tachycardia to
      exist. However, this can be very lengthy procedure (&gt;5 hours) that has only a moderate
      success in the long run. Therefore, new treatment approaches are needed to make this
      procedure better.

      The purpose of this study is to assess if radio tracers showing the nerve distribution in the
      heart (cardiac innervation) can be used in addition to the current technology (&quot;voltage
      mapping&quot;) to identify the area that needs to be ablated (burnt away) to treat
      life-threatening fast heart rates (ventricular tachycardia)

      Certain patterns of nerve distribution in the heart (sympathetic cardiac innervation) have
      been shown to predict outcome for different heart diseases, like heart transplant, coronary
      artery disease, heart failure, arrhythmias. One substance that allows visualization of the
      cardiac innervation is 123I-metaiodobenzylguanidine (123I-MIBG), which could provide
      additional information to understand and treat ventricular tachycardia.

    <description>FDA Approved for use in Cancer patients. This use is Off Label. For the imaging study, an activity of 370 MBq (10 mCi) 123I-mIBG (GE Healthcare) will be administered intravenously, and a 10-minute planar image of the anterior thorax (128_128 matrix) will be acquired beginning 15 minutes after tracer injection.</description>
