  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Organ transplant patients who participated in a retrospective study and received 2009
      Pandemrix vaccine during autumn 2009 are included in this study.

      The main aim is to determine the H1N1 antibody levels one year after Pandemrix in comparison
      to healthy controls. The secondary aim is to examine the booster effect of 2010 Fluarix in
      patients and controls.Side effects to Fluarix vaccine are registered.

      Organ transplant patients and staff members of the Transplant Institute who were vaccinated
      2009 and received 2 doses of 2009 H1N1 influenza vaccine (Pandemrix) will be asked to
      participate in the study.

      Serum samples will be collected approximately one year after completed vaccination with
      Pandemrix and analysed for haemagglutination -inhibiting antibodies against H1N1.The
      frequency of individuals with remaining protective titers will be examined.

      The same individuals will be vaccinated with Fluarix containing antigen from Influenza A
      California/7/2009(H1N1, A/Perth/16/2009 (H3N2) and B/Brisbane/60/2008. The booster effect
      will be measured one month later.
