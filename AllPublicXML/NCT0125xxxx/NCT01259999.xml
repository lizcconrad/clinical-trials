  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Dietary intake in frail elderly is often lower than estimated needs due to the combined
      effects of the anorexia of ageing, frailty and the presence of acute and chronic disease. The
      objectives of the present study are to assess the effects of an oleic acid rich formula
      fortified with micronutrients on energy intake, vitamin- and mineral status, muscle strength
      and mobility. The investigators have recently performed a similar study in an acute ward
      setting without micronutrients.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Malnutrition has been reported to be present in up to 55% of acutely hospitalised elderly and
      in one third of people living in assisted accommodation. Frail elderly with poor appetite are
      at risk for malnutrition. Rebecca Stratton et al have reviewed effects of oral nutritional
      supplements (ONS) in elderly hospital patients and key findings in hospital trials were that
      ONS can improve intakes of energy, protein and micronutrients without substantially reducing
      food intake which may lead to weight gain or attenuate weight loss.

      Calogen extra is a fat emulsion containing 400 kcal/100 ml, based on canola and sunflower-oil
      which has a good fat composition. Moreover it contains around 30 % of recommended
      micronutrients and 5g protein/100 ml. It has potentially positive effects on energy intake,
      fatty acid profile and constipation.

      The investigators have recently performed a clinical trial in geriatric patients in an
      acute-ward setting to evaluate the effects of a similar fat emulsion, Calogen, without
      micronutrients. The investigators could conclude that this fat emulsion based on MUFA and
      PUFA distributed three times daily at medication rounds may have positive effects on weight,
      appetite and serum lipids. Moreover the approach was well accepted by patients and nurses.
      The intervention period was very short (median 8 days) therefore the investigators plan to
      perform a study with a similar design, for a longer period of time, in a group of elderly
      living in old peoples home.

    <description>The sample size has been estimated upon a minimum difference in daily energy intake between the Control and Calogen group of 200 kcal (4). To detect a significant difference in energy intake at the 5% significance level and with 80% power 27 subjects in each group were needed. To allow for study drop-outs this is increased to 30 subjects in each group.</description>
