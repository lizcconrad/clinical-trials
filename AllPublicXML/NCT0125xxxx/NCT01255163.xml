      Background:

      Exendin-4 (or Exenatide) is a medication currently used to treat diabetes that has shown
      promising results in animal and cellular models of Alzheimer's disease. It is possible that
      Exendin-4 may be a treatment for Alzheimer's disease, which involves the gradual
      deterioration and death of neurons. Researchers are interested in studying the safety and
      comparing the effects of Exendin-4 with placebo on cognitive performance, clinical
      progression of dementia, various chemicals measured in blood and cerebrospinal fluid, and
      brain MRI, in individuals with early-stage Alzheimer's disease or mild cognitive impairment.

      Objectives:

      To determine the safety and tolerability of twice daily administration of Exendin-4, as well
      as to acquire preliminary evidence for effects on cognitive performance, clinical progression
      of dementia, various chemicals measured in blood and cerebrospinal fluid, and brain MRI, in
      individuals with early-stage Alzheimer's disease or mild cognitive impairment.

      Eligibility:

      Individuals at least 60 years of age who have objective evidence of early-stage Alzheimer's
      disease or mild cognitive impairment in screening testing.

      Design:

        -  Participants will be screened.

        -  Following the telephone screening, two in-person screening visits to determine
           eligibility.

        -  The screening visit will involve a medical history and neurological examination, tests
           of memory and cognition, a lumbar puncture, collection of blood and saliva samples, and
           brain Magnetic Resonance Imagine (MRI) studies. Participants will be required to appoint
           a Durable Power of Attorney for research and medical care during this protocol.

        -  Eligible participants will be divided into two groups (double-blind randomization). One
           group will receive Exendin-4 SC twice daily, and the other will receive a placebo.
           Participants will keep a medication diary and will be scheduled for additional study
           visits 1 and 2 weeks after the start of the treatment.

        -  Participants will have regular followup visits with blood tests, cognitive tests,
           imaging studies, and other examinations 6, 12, and 18 months after the start of the
           treatment. Another lumbar puncture may be performed optionally at the 18-month followup
           visit.

      Objective: Exendin-4 (or exenatide) is a medication currently used in the treatment of
      diabetes mellitus (DM). Exendin-4 has generated promising results as an agent protecting
      neurons from a number of assaults both in the laboratory and in studies on animals.
      Specifically, there is pre-clinical evidence that Exendin-4 may be a treatment for
      Alzheimer's disease (AD). Based on these facts, we conducted a pilot Phase II double blind
      randomized placebo-controlled clinical study to assess the safety and provide proof of
      concept for exendin-4 treatment in early Alzheimer's disease (AD), by demonstrating a
      response of disease biomarkers to the intervention. Our main hypothesis is that long-term
      administration of Exendin-4 in participants with amnestic MCI/early AD in FDA-approved doses
      is safe and will induce a change over time in AD biomarkers. Subject population: We intend to
      screen up to 100 potential participants in order to ensure that at least 40 participants
      (enrolled based on a clinical diagnosis of amnestic MCI/early AD and Cerebrospinal Fluid
      (CSF) biomarker evidence of AD) will be enrolled into treatment and complete the study.
      Design: Enrolled participants will be randomly assigned into one of two groups (Exendin-4 vs.
      Placebo) and will be followed at regular intervals for 18 months. Outcome measures: Safety
      and tolerability will be the primary outcomes. In addition, we will measure and assess the
      change over time of a number of exploratory outcomes with the intervention, including CSF and
      plasma biomarkers (such as CSF A42, tau, p181-tau and plasma A42/A40), cognitive performance
      measures (such as the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment scale, cognitive sub-scale, and other
      tests), clinical progression of dementia measures (such as the Clinical Dementia Rating scale
      sum-of-boxes), volumetric changes on structural brain MRI and changes in resting fMRI. All
      research will be performed on the National Institute on Aging (NIA) Clinical Research Unit
      located on the 5th floor of Harbor Hospital.

               -  Participants may take stable doses of antidepressants, chronic anxiolytics or
                  sedative hypnotics, if started at least 4 weeks or longer prior to screening

               -  Cholinesterase inhibitors and/or memantine are allowable, if started at least 4
                  weeks prior to screening

               -  Participants will not be asked to discontinue medications without permission from
                  their primary care provider (PCP) or specialist.

          -  Fluency in English

          -  At the time of enrollment, participants must have the ability to provide informed
             consent and make health care decisions.

          -  An informant or caregiver who has frequent contact with the participant (e.g. an
             average of 10 hours per week or more) must be appointed to serve as Durable Power of
             Attorney (DPA) for research and medical care at NIA, accompany the participant to
             clinic visits and provide historical information regarding the participant s cognitive
             status, and assist participants with/administer injections of the investigational
             medication.

          -  Good general health with no additional disease states that could interfere with the
             study.

             Parkinson s disease, atypical Parkinsons disease, Multi-infarct Dementia,
             Frontotemporal Dementia, Huntington s disease, Normal Pressure Hydrocephalus, brain
             tumor, Progressive Supranuclear Palsy, Epilepsy, Subdural Hematoma or Multiple
             Sclerosis)
