  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This randomized, open-label, parallel-group study will assess the effect on disease remission
      of RoActemra/Actemra (tocilizumab) in combination with disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs
      (DMARDs) versus current best practice non-biologic DMARD therapy in patients with
      moderate-to-severe active rheumatoid arthritis. Patients who are randomly assigned to the
      RoActemra/Actemra treatment group will receive 8 mg/kg RoActemra/Actemra intravenously every
      4 weeks. The anticipated time on study treatment is 12 months.

    <measure>Percentage of Participants Achieving Disease Remission at Month 12 Assessed Using the Disease Activity Score Based on 28-Joint Count (DAS28)</measure>
    <time_frame>Month 12</time_frame>
    <description>The DAS28 is a combined index for measuring disease activity in Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA). The index includes swollen and tender joint counts (SJC and TJC), acute phase response, and general health status. For this study Erythrocyte sedimentation Rate (ESR) was to be used to calculate DAS28 score. The DAS28, which uses a 28 joint count, is derived from the original DAS which includes a 44 swollen joint count. The DAS28 has been validated in RA. The index is calculated using the following formula:
DAS28 equals (=) 0.56 times (×) square root of √(TJC) plus (+) 0.28 × √(SJC) + 0.70 × ln(ESR) + 0.014 × GH Where, TJC28 = tender joint count on 28 joints, SJC28 = swollen joint count on 28 joints, ln = natural log, ESR measured as millimeters per hour (mm/hr), and GH = general health, which is participant's global assessment of disease activity (100-mm Visual Analog Scale [VAS]). DAS28 less than/equal to (≤) 2.6 defined remission.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline to Months 6 and 12 in Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy-Fatigue (FACIT F) Scores</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Months 6 and 12</time_frame>
    <description>The FACIT-Fatigue score was calculated according to a 13-item questionnaire that assesses self-reported fatigue and its impact upon daily activities and function. FACIT-F is a 13-item questionnaire. Participants scored each item on a 5-point scale: 0 (Not at all) to 4 (Very much). The larger the participant's response to the questions (with the exception of 2 negatively stated), the greater the participants fatigue. For all questions, except for the 2 negatively stated ones, the code was reversed and a new score was calculated as (4 minus the participant's response). The sum of all responses resulted in the FACIT-Fatigue score for a total possible score of 0 (worse score) to 52 (better score). Clinically relevant improvement is defined as a ≥5-point change from Baseline.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline to Months 6 and 12 in European Quality of Life-5D (EQ-5D) Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Months 6 and 12</time_frame>
    <description>EQ-5D is a participant rated questionnaire to assess health-related quality of life in terms of a single utility score. Health State Profile component assesses level of current health for 5 domains: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain and discomfort, and anxiety and depression; 1 indicates better health state (no problems); 3 indicates worst health state (confined to bed). Scoring formula developed by EuroQoL Group assigns a utility value for each domain in the profile. Score is transformed and results in a total score range -0.594 to 1.000; higher score indicates a better health state.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline to Months 6 and 12 in Health Assessment Questionnaire - Disability Index (HAQ-DI) Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Months 6 and 12</time_frame>
    <description>HAQ-DI includes 20 questions concerning participant's activities of daily life, grouped in 8 scales of 2 to 3 questions for each activity. To respond to each question, a four-level response (score of 0 to 3 points), with higher scores showing larger functional limitations, was chosen. Overall score was computed as the sum of the domain scores and divided by the number of domains answered. Total possible score range was 0-3 where 0=without difficulties; 1= with some difficulties; 2=with great difficulties; and 3=unable to perform these actions at all.</description>

        <title>Percentage of Participants Achieving Disease Remission at Month 12 Assessed Using the Disease Activity Score Based on 28-Joint Count (DAS28)</title>
        <description>The DAS28 is a combined index for measuring disease activity in Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA). The index includes swollen and tender joint counts (SJC and TJC), acute phase response, and general health status. For this study Erythrocyte sedimentation Rate (ESR) was to be used to calculate DAS28 score. The DAS28, which uses a 28 joint count, is derived from the original DAS which includes a 44 swollen joint count. The DAS28 has been validated in RA. The index is calculated using the following formula:
DAS28 equals (=) 0.56 times (×) square root of √(TJC) plus (+) 0.28 × √(SJC) + 0.70 × ln(ESR) + 0.014 × GH Where, TJC28 = tender joint count on 28 joints, SJC28 = swollen joint count on 28 joints, ln = natural log, ESR measured as millimeters per hour (mm/hr), and GH = general health, which is participant’s global assessment of disease activity (100-mm Visual Analog Scale [VAS]). DAS28 less than/equal to (≤) 2.6 defined remission.</description>

          <title>Percentage of Participants Achieving Disease Remission at Month 12 Assessed Using the Disease Activity Score Based on 28-Joint Count (DAS28)</title>
          <description>The DAS28 is a combined index for measuring disease activity in Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA). The index includes swollen and tender joint counts (SJC and TJC), acute phase response, and general health status. For this study Erythrocyte sedimentation Rate (ESR) was to be used to calculate DAS28 score. The DAS28, which uses a 28 joint count, is derived from the original DAS which includes a 44 swollen joint count. The DAS28 has been validated in RA. The index is calculated using the following formula:
DAS28 equals (=) 0.56 times (×) square root of √(TJC) plus (+) 0.28 × √(SJC) + 0.70 × ln(ESR) + 0.014 × GH Where, TJC28 = tender joint count on 28 joints, SJC28 = swollen joint count on 28 joints, ln = natural log, ESR measured as millimeters per hour (mm/hr), and GH = general health, which is participant’s global assessment of disease activity (100-mm Visual Analog Scale [VAS]).

        <description>The FACIT-Fatigue score was calculated according to a 13-item questionnaire that assesses self-reported fatigue and its impact upon daily activities and function. FACIT-F is a 13-item questionnaire. Participants scored each item on a 5-point scale: 0 (Not at all) to 4 (Very much). The larger the participant's response to the questions (with the exception of 2 negatively stated), the greater the participants fatigue. For all questions, except for the 2 negatively stated ones, the code was reversed and a new score was calculated as (4 minus the participant's response). The sum of all responses resulted in the FACIT-Fatigue score for a total possible score of 0 (worse score) to 52 (better score). Clinically relevant improvement is defined as a ≥5-point change from Baseline.</description>

Health State Profile component assesses level of current health for 5 domains: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain and discomfort, and anxiety and depression; 1 indicates better health state (no problems); 3 indicates worst health state (confined to bed). Scoring formula developed by EuroQoL Group assigns a utility value for each domain in the profile. Score is transformed and results in a total score range -0.594 to 1.000; higher score indicates a better health state.</description>
