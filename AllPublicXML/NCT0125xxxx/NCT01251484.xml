  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      VEGF inhibition by BEV may induce a change in tumor invasiveness and treatment failure is
      often associated with remote metastases. BEV may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking
      blood flow to the tumor. Cediranib, a pan-VEGF inhibitor has shown promising results in
      recurrent GBM.

      VEGF-blocking with small molecules may overcome the mechanism of resistance, and response to
      BIBF-1120 in such circumstances may open a new treatment option in GBM. In additional,
      recurrent glioblastomas have an extremely poor prognosis, so innovative therapies are needed.
