  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It gave a clinical trial which will be included in the 60 infants, aged up to 24 months,
      diagnosed with congenital's population will be divided by simple randomization into three
      groups: 20 infants in the intervention group, 20 infants in the control group, not receive
      the RTA technique and another 20 infants in a placebo group, we just get the support manual
      therapist for 5 minutes. Initially the data will be collected cardio heart rate, respiratory
      rate and oxygen saturation. Then the researcher will apply three specific rating scales,
      based on clinical presentation and behavior of infants. Hypothesis: The RTA improves
      cardiorespiratory parameters and reduces signs of discomfort and pain of infants with
      congenital heart acyanogenic.

    <description>In this group the infants received four handlings thoracoabdominal rebalancing, in order: 1) 5min support thoracoabdominal, in which the therapist leaned one hand on the lower chest and upper abdomen of the newborn, with some of its fingers on the ribs, pulling them gently down and keeping them in that position during inspiration, 2) more than 5 minutes of abdominal support, carried by hand in the lower abdomen of the newborn, applying light pressure during inspiration enough to be beaten by the diaphragm of the newborn and not to increase the use of accessory muscles of inspiration, 3) 5min support ileo-costal, by a slight manual pressure of the physiotherapist on the lateral chest and abdomen of the newborn, maintained throughout inspiration and 4) finally ran up 5min ginga thoracic maneuver slight manual pressure on the lower chest of newborns, directing the costal movement during expiration, now an then the other hemithorax.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Newborns admitted to the nursery without ventilatory support or oxygen therapy, and
             whose parents agree with the child's participation in the study. Will be excluded
             newborns who have some problems during any of the study procedures and those whose
             condition will change after the intervention, with shift in ventilatory support or
             oxygen therapy.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  In case of inability to collect some of the parameters evaluated at the appropriate
             time, the RN also will no longer part of the sample, as well as those who show no
             contraindication to therapy.
