      The purpose of this study is to determine whether there are any difference between supervised
      exercise therapy and homebased exercise when looking at pain and function for patients with
      shoulder pain.

    <textblock>
      Shoulder pain is common in the population. Various treatment modalities are used. According
      to the literature, it is equally good results for home exercises and for guided exercise
      therapy. The purpose of this study is to look at this again and determine whether there are
      any difference between supervised exercise therapy and homebased exercise when looking at
      pain and function for patients with subacromial impingement.
