  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study recruited cigarette smokers under supervision in community corrections (e.g.,
      probation, parole, drug courts, etc.) in the Birmingham, Alabama area. Smokers received 12
      weeks of bupropion treatment and brief physician advice to quit smoking or 12 weeks of
      bupropion treatment and 4 sessions of intensive counseling around smoking cessation. The
      study was stratified on race such that equal proportions of African Americans and Caucasians
      were enrolled in the two study groups. It was hypothesized that smokers receiving intensive
      counseling will have higher quit rates compared to smokers receiving brief advice to quit.
