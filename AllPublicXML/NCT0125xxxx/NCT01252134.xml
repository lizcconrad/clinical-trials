  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Ex Vivo Contact Angle</measure>
    <time_frame>8 hours</time_frame>
    <description>Study lens was removed from the eye according to protocol-specified procedures. The OCA15 Dynamic Contact Angle Instrument was used to observe, record, and calculate contact angle measurements. The measurements from the right eye and left eye were averaged. A lower contact angle measurement indicates a more wettable lens.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Subjective Comfort</measure>
    <time_frame>8 hours</time_frame>
    <description>Subjective comfort was assessed by the participant on a scale of 0 to 100, with 0 being very poor comfort and 100 being excellent comfort. The ratings for the right eye and left eye were averaged.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Corneal Staining Type</measure>
    <time_frame>8 hours</time_frame>
    <description>Five regions of the cornea (central, inferior, temporal, superior, and nasal) were evaluated for staining using cobalt light and a #12 Wratten filter. The type of staining was recorded on a scale of 0 to 100 for each corneal region with 0-none, 25=micropunctate, 50=macropunctate, 75=coalescent, and 100=patch. The five regions for each eye were averaged, and the eyes were averaged.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Corneal Staining Extent</measure>
    <time_frame>8 hours</time_frame>
    <description>Area (extent) of corneal staining was estimated for each of the five regions of the cornea as a percentage i.e., 0%=no staining in the region and 100%=staining covering the entire region). A staining area percentage was calculated for each eye based on the average staining area measured across all five regions, and the eyes were averaged.</description>
