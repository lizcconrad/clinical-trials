    <textblock>
      Near infrared spectroscopy offers the possibility of noninvasive and continuous bedside
      investigation of cerebral oxygenation in newborn infants. Using this technique we
      investigated the effect of positional changes on cerebral oxygenation in preterm infants.

    <textblock>
      The changes in cerebral perfusion have an important role on the development of
      intraventricular hemorrhage and periventricular leucomalacia. Near infrared spectroscopy
      offers the possibility of noninvasive and continuous bedside investigation of cerebral
      oxygenation in newborn infants. Using this technique we investigated the effect of positional
      changes on cerebral oxygenation in preterm infants.

    <description>NIRS device used in this study, the optical field includes a volume of tissue approximately 2 cm deep to the surface probe with a 4-mm source-detector distance, and thus, organ-specific monitoring is feasible in small patients. With informed consent, we applied NIRS probes to the forehead and the lower extremity for cerebral (rSO2C) and peripheric (rSO2P) regional oxygen saturation measurements</description>
