      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of Phase III lots of
      the CYD dengue vaccine in a pediatric population in Malaysia.

      Primary Objectives:

        -  To describe the safety (in terms of solicited and unsolicited adverse events) of the CYD
           dengue vaccine in all subjects after each dose.

        -  To describe the antibody response to each dengue virus serotype post-Dose 2 and
           post-Dose 3
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Healthy participants aged 2 to 11 years will receive 3 vaccinations at pre-determined
      schedules and will be followed-up for at least 6 months after the last vaccination.

          -  For a female subject of childbearing potential, use of an effective method of
