    <textblock>
      13C breath di-peptide tests are an effective non-invasive tool to detect pancreatic exocrine
      function in patients with Chronic Pancreatitis.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to assess the pancreatic exocrine insufficiency using a 13C labeled
      di-peptide breath tests in patients with chronic pancreatitis(CP) and show correlation with
      secretin stimulated endoscopic Pancreatic Function Test (ePFT). Furthermore, a second purpose
      is to assess the ability to differentiate between non patients with chronic pancreatitis and
      those without. Approximately 30 subjects will be tested with both methods within two weeks of
      each other.

    <description>This breath test substrate is new and is hypothesized, based on preliminary studies, that it may be the answer to a much needed non-invasive pancreatic function test. At first stage, it will be compared to the current invasive gold standard: secretin induced ePFT.</description>
