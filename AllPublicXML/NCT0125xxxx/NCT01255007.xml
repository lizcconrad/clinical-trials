  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      1. Primovist-enhanced Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and Diffusion Weighted MRI (DW-MRI)
           is superior to Multidetector Computed axial Tomography (MDCT) in the detection of
           colorectal liver metastases. Fatty changes in the liver after chemotherapy treatment
           likely reduces the chances of seeing metastatic lesions on CT especially when the
           lesions are small (&lt;10 mm). When compared with CT, Primovist-enhanced MRI and DW-MRI
           have the potential to provide higher contrast resolution enabling better detection of
           colorectal liver metastases following chemotherapy.

        2. Primovist-enhanced MRI and DW-MRI are superior to CT in assessing and predicting
           treatment response of patients with colorectal liver metastases to chemotherapy.
           Primovist-enhanced MRI by providing superior resolution may provide improved accuracy in
           metastatic lesion margin detection thereby providing higher accuracy in estimating tumor
           response based on size criteria. DW-MRI provides information indirectly about tumor
           composition and therefore is likely to be superior to MD-CT in assessing treatment
           response.

      Two groups of patients will be analyzed. The second group consists of patients with
      colorectal liver metastases who are to go for chemotherapy prior to surgery for metastases
      resection. This group will be CT and MRI scanned prior to chemotherapy and after
      chemotherapy. The first group of patients will consist of those patients who have already
      received chemotherapy and are likely to have surgery to resect liver metastases. This group
      will have only one set of scans done 4-6 weeks prior to their operation. The pathology of the
      resected metastases and CT and MRI images will be analyzed and compared.

    <description>The first group consists of patients with colorectal liver metastases who have had treatment with chemotherapy and are now awaiting surgery. This group would have had Multidetector Liver CT (MDCT) imaging prior to the chemotherapy, and will now undergo post chemotherapy MDCT as part of standard clinical care in addition to Gd-EOB-DTPA enhanced liver MRI and Diffusion Weighted MRI (DW-MRI). The MRI will be performed as an additional imaging investigation after obtaining informed consent.</description>

    <description>The second group consists of patients with colorectal liver metastases who are due to receive neoadjuvant chemotherapy. This group will be imaged prior to receiving and after receiving chemotherapy. This will all be done prior to surgical resection of their colorectal liver metastases.</description>
