    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to determine the impact of voice therapy on
      voice-related quality of life in children age 6-10 years old with apparent vocal fold
      nodules, as measured by the validated Pediatric Voice-Related Quality of Life Instrument
      (PVRQOL)administered 4 weeks after completion of voice therapy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Voice disorders place over five million school-aged children at increased risk for inferior
      school performance, dysfunctional social development, and higher participation in criminal
      activities. The lesions most commonly associated with pediatric vocal dysfunction are
      reported to be vocal fold nodules, which are present in up to 21% of the general pediatric
      population and are associated with behavioral problems and inferior quality of life. Voice
      therapy with a speech-language pathologist is recommended by 95% of otolaryngologists for
      management of vocal fold nodules. When implemented, this voice therapy requires significant
      time investment and typically results in regular absence from the classroom over a period of
      1-3 months or longer, depending on the protocol and the setting. Regular absence from school
      has been shown to place children at risk for poorer scholastic performance but the benefits
      of this voice therapy have yet to be demonstrated in any rigorous prospective, controlled
      trial. Thus, the most widely used treatment for the most common lesion associated with
      pediatric voice disorders has not been rigorously tested in a randomized controlled trial to
      determine whether it may have benefits.

      A randomized clinical trial addressing whether voice therapy improves voice-related quality
      of life for children with apparent vocal fold nodules is a logical step toward developing an
      evidence-based treatment plan to optimize outcomes for this sizable population of at-risk
      children. There are currently no well-powered, prospective, controlled studies which compare
      voice therapy versus control in children who present with apparent nodules. Our goal is to
      remedy this deficiency through testing of the following primary null hypothesis: There is no
      difference in the change in PVRQOL scores after 3 months of treatment with voice therapy
      versus office instructions.

    <measure>Nodule grade</measure>
    <time_frame>Completed at Baseline and Follow-Up</time_frame>
    <description>A grading system for vocal fold nodules has been validated with established inter-rater reliability for nodule presence and size. The 3-point grading scale for nodule size will be used with grade 1 being small, grade 2 a moderate nodule, and grade 3 a large nodule. The contour of the nodule will also be rated as either discrete or sessile. One secondary objective of the study is to compare nodule grade across baseline and 12 (or 16) weeks. Changes in grade are compared for subjects treated with voice therapy versus office instructions alone.</description>

        Inclusion criteria

          1. Eligibility is contingent on the presence of apparent vocal fold nodules, which are
             defined as bilateral, localized, benign, superficial growths with protrusion on the
             medial surface of the true vocal folds at the junction of their anterior and middle
             thirds. This examination is based on video-stroboscopic examination, or, in rare
             cases, on operative microsuspension laryngoscopy. In addition, strict exclusion
             criteria are applied toward excluding masses that are not nodules. Defining
             characteristics for these inclusion criteria are based upon the evaluations of three
             senior otolaryngologists of each participant's exam. Children evaluated by the senior
             otolaryngologist at each institution suspected to have vocal fold nodules are
             candidates for inclusion to this study. Patient de-identified images of the
             stroboscopy are reviewed by each of the other two laryngologists; only those children
             with confirmed vocal fold nodules by the all three senior otolaryngologists will be
             considered for entry into this study.

          2. Children 6 to10 years of age will be enrolled. The rationale for this age range was
             previously noted. In brief, children in this age range (a) have similar educational
             and social exposures; (b) will likely not yet encounter pubertal changes affecting the
             larynx; and (c) are relatively cognitively homogeneous. Moreover, children in this age
             range have the ability to cooperate with voice therapy and have also been shown to be
             tolerant of stroboscopic examination. Finally, the voice therapy regimen in this
             protocol has been shown to be clinically effective for many children in this age
             range.

          3. Voice-related quality of life must be affected to the extent that baseline PVRQOL
             scores are &lt;87.5 (on a scale of the worst, 0, to the best, 100) at the time of entry
             into the trial. Based on previously published data, this subset of scores will be
             clearly distinct from scores in children with normal voices. In addition, scores &lt;87.5
             represent worse than average scores among children diagnosed with vocal fold nodules.

          4. Dysphonia duration prior to randomization must be at least 12 weeks, in order to
             ensure that vocal dysfunction is chronic in nature.

          5. Hearing in better ear of 35 dB or better.

          6. Agreement by informed consent from the parents and informed assent from the child
             participant with anticipated commitment to compliance throughout the follow up period
             of 3 months is necessary for enrollment which includes time commitment of up to 3
             hours per week to therapy sessions and homework.

          7. Vocal fold nodules are a pathology that predominantly affects males. A number of
             studies and the databases utilized to track this pathology at the clinical sites
             indicate that the male: female ratio is approximately 7:3. Given this background, the
             enrollment plan for the current investigation will seek to have a 30% female
             representation of the patients enrolled in this study to ensure appropriate gender
             representation. Additionally, patients with a diagnosis of pediatric vocal fold
             nodules predominantly are found in Caucasian populations. However, in accordance with
             the National Institute of Health Revitalization Act of 1993 the inclusion of
             minorities in this proposal will be targeted to the representation of minorities in
             the greater Boston, Philadelphia and Milwaukee metropolitan regions.

        Exclusion criteria

          1. Children with non-standard nodules or masses that are not unequivocally nodules are
             excluded, including those with irregular epithelium, concern for malignancy requiring
             biopsy, rapid growth pattern, airway obstruction requiring urgent or operative
             intervention, and prior laryngeal surgery. Furthermore, since there are several
             lesions that can present as bilateral true vocal fold masses (such as unilateral cysts
             or polyps with contralateral fibrovascular reaction, contact granulomas, and Reinke's
             edema), masses with the following characteristics will be excluded: a) yellow or blue
             color suggestive of a mucous- or fluid-filled component, b) pink friable lesions at
             the posterior aspect of the true vocal folds, c) watery edematous expansion without a
             distinct protrusive mass. Defining characteristics for these exclusion criteria are
             determined and corroborated by the evaluations of three senior otolaryngologists of
             each participant's videostroboscopic exam. This examination is based on
             video-stroboscopy, or, in rare cases, on operative microsuspension laryngoscopy. The
             video images will be placed on a password-protected server to which all three senior
             investigators will have access; these video images will not contain any patient
             identifying information but rather a study number that will be assigned to each
             participant. In addition, strict inclusion criteria are applied toward excluding
             masses that are not nodules.

          2. Children who have previously received any form of speech therapy targeting voice
             and/or resonance with the exception of articulation or speech therapy.

          3. Children for whom voice therapy protocols will be problematic are excluded:
             developmental delay, cognitive disorder, behavioral disorder, neurologic disorder,
             articulation disorder, phonological disorder, language disorder, expressive and/or
             receptive language delay, specific language impairment, central auditory processing
             disorder, fluency disorder, prior knowledge of voice therapy principles through
             previous interventions (with the exception of articulation or speech therapy), and
             inability to commit to at least 12 weeks of therapy as determined and evaluated by the
             treating speech language pathologist and confirmed by consensus of all three PIs.

          4. Children whose caregivers cannot complete the primary endpoint are excluded:
             non-English speaking as the PVRQOL instrument is administered in English, and those
             unable to commit to the 3-month treatment and follow-up schedule.

          5. Children whose caregivers are not willing to commit up to 3 hours per week to vocal
             therapy including therapy sessions and homework for up to 12 weeks.

          6. Children who cannot tolerate a conscious video-stroboscopic examination and whose
             parents feel that the diagnostic information gained by a planned examination under
             anesthesia is not valuable for the severity of presenting symptoms are excluded.

          7. Children with significant confounders of voice-related quality of life are excluded:
             vocal fold paralysis, neurologic disorder of the larynx (dystonias, tics, tremors,
             etc), ongoing acute upper respiratory tract infection (defined by at least 2 of the
             following: sneezing, coughing, nasal congestion, runny nose, or temperature greater
             than 100.4° F (38.0° C), and untreated or unsuccessfully treated allergic
             rhinitis/post nasal drip.
