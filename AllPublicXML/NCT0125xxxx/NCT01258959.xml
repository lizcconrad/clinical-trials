  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Ophthalmic surgery on the posterior section of the eye can either be performed under general
      anaesthesia or under local aneasthesia. The local anaesthesia is performed by injecting local
      anaesthetics behind the eye. There are two techniques: Either the needle is placed into the
      muscle cone formed by the four recti muscles - this is called intraconal or retrobulbar
      block, or the needle is placed outside of the muscle cone - this would be called extraconal
      or peribulbar. In our hospital the investigators usually perform the peribulbar block since
      it is easier to perform and has a smaller risk to injure the eye. The investigators however
      realize that the parabulbar block is sometimes very efficient and sometimes not, thus
      requiring a second or third injection. Now investigators are able to visualize where the
      local anaesthetics spreads with the help of ultrasound imaging. The aim of the study is to
      observe and to describe the incidence of intraconal spread of local anaesthetics when a
      peribulbar block is performed.

    <description>During the parabulbar injection the ultrasound operator experienced in ultrasound guided retrobulbar block will assess whether there is spread of local anaesthetic in the central cone just behind the sclera (yes or no). The anaesthesist performing the block will be blinded to the ultrasound visualized spread of local anaesthetic.</description>
