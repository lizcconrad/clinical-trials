      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Meditoxin® in the
      treatment of children with cerebral palsy.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The allocated subject is injected Meditoxin® 4U/kg body weight(for patients with hemiplegia)
      or 6U/kg body weight(for patients with diplegia)in the affected gastrocnemius muscle for the
      treatment of patients who suffer Equinus Foot Deformity with pediatric cerebral palsy due to
      spasticity.

      The efficacy and safety are evaluated for 12weeks through 3 follow up visits.
