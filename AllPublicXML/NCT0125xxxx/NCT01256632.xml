    <textblock>
      The primary objective:

      *To measure the difference in the number of Ranibizumab therapies needed in 12 months in the
      Posterior Vitreous Detachment (PVD) positive and Posterior Vitreous Detachment (PVD) negative
      group.

      Secondary Objective:

        -  To measure the mean change in visual acuity from Baseline to Month 12.

        -  To measure the mean change in central retinal thickness per OCT from Baseline to Month
           12

      This is an open-label study, of intravitreally administered Ranibizumab in eyes with
      Age-related Macular Degeneration (AMD), specifically looking at the correlation between the
      presence of Posterior Vitreous Detachment(PVD) and the number of intravitreal injections of
      Ranibizumab required. 40 subjects from the offices of Vision Research Foundation will be
      enrolled in this study. Subjects will be assigned to either a Posterior Vitreous Detachment
      (PVD) positive group or a Posterior Vitreous Detachment (PVD) negative group based on a
      pre-treatment ultrasound. A maximum of 20 subjects in each group will be enrolled. Subject
      accrual into the trial is expected to be completed within 6 months.

      All study eyes will receive 0.5mg, of intravitreous monthly injections of Ranibizumab, for
      four initial doses,(Day 0, Month 1, Month 2, and Month 3),with scheduled follow-up visits
      monthly for 12 months. Re-treatment after the first 4 injections, will be on an as needed
      basis, based on predefined criteria. Eyes will be evaluated with a full ocular examination,
      visual acuity measurement (ETDRS chart at a distance of 4 meters),OCT,FA,Fundus Photos,
      B-scan Ultrasound and subject adverse event monitoring.
