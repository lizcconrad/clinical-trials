      Study Purpose: To evaluate the safety and performance of Augment Rotator Cuff as a primary
      surgical treatment for full thickness rotator cuff tears. The hypothesis is that Augment
      Rotator Cuff will be easy to deliver as an inter-positional graft placed between the rotator
      cuff tendon and the humeral head providing further enhanced tendon to bone healing without
      adding any additional safety risk to the patient.

      Study Rationale: To evaluate the safety and performance Augment™ Rotator Cuff in surgical
      intervention of a torn rotator cuff and to obtain preliminary data to support the rationale
      for a subsequent pivotal clinical trial.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  The subject has a repairable rotator cuff tear with an estimated full thickness size
             of ≥ 2 cm to &lt; 5 cm confirmed with diagnostic MRI in AP or ML dimension

          -  The subject is independent, ambulatory, and can comply with all post-operative
             evaluations and visits

          -  The subject is at least twenty one (21) years of age and considered to be skeletally
             mature.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  The subject has undergone previous rotator cuff repair surgery to the affected
             shoulder

          -  The subject has a partial thickness rotator cuff tear

          -  The subject requires a concomitant subscapularis repair

          -  The subject requires a concomitant labral repair

          -  The subject has an irreparable rotator cuff tear

          -  The subject has an allergy to yeast-derived products or a known bovine collagen
             allergy

          -  The subject has implanted metallic devices (cardiac pacemakers, insulin pumps, and
             nerve stimulators), medically implanted clips or other electronically, magnetically or
             mechanically activated implants that would contraindicate undergoing an MRI scan of
             the shoulder

          -  The subject has tested positive or has been treated for a malignancy in the past or is
             suspected of having a malignancy or is currently undergoing radiation or chemotherapy
             treatment for a malignancy anywhere in the body, whether adjacent to or distant from
             the proposed Augment Rotator Cuff implantation site

          -  The subject's condition represents a worker's compensation case

          -  The subject is currently involved in a health-related litigation procedure

          -  The subject is pregnant or able to become pregnant but not practicing a
             medically-accepted form of birth control, and/or intending to become pregnant during
             this study period
