  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will compare how well adalimumab works versus methotrexate (MTX) in children with
      moderate to severe psoriasis in the short term. It will also study how safe and how well
      adalimumab works in the long term and how long disease response can be maintained after
      stopping therapy.

      The study had a 30-day screening period and a multi-period study design, as described below:

      Period A - Primary Treatment Phase: Participants were randomized to receive adalimumab 0.8
      mg/kg, adalimumab 0.4 mg/kg, or MTX in 1:1:1 ratio for 16 weeks.

      Period B - Treatment Withdrawal Phase: Responders were withdrawn from active treatment and
      monitored for loss of disease control for up to 36 weeks.

      Period C - Re-Treatment Phase: Participants who had experienced loss of disease control in
      Period B were re-treated with adalimumab for 16 weeks.

      Period D - Long-Term Follow-Up Phase: Participants received adalimumab or were observed
      off-treatment (if disease remained under control) for 52 weeks.

    <measure>Percentage of Participants Who Achieved a Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) 75 Response at Week 16</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 16</time_frame>
    <description>PASI is a composite score based on the degree of effect on body surface area of psoriasis and the extension of erythema (reddening), induration (plaque thickness), desquamation (scaling) of the lesions and area affected as observed on the day of examination. The score ranges from 0 (no psoriasis) to 72 (very severe psoriasis). A PASI 75 response is defined as at least a 75% reduction (improvement) from Baseline in PASI score at Week 16.</description>

    <time_frame>Week 16</time_frame>
    <description>The PGA is a 6-point scale used to measure the severity of disease at the time of the evaluation. The degree of overall lesion severity was evaluated using the following categories:
0 (Cleared): No evidence of scaling, erythema, or plaque elevation;
1 (Minimal): Occasional fine scale over &lt;5% of lesions, faint erythema, minimal plaque elevation;
2 (Mild): Fine scale dominates, light red coloration, mild plaque elevation;
3 (Moderate): Course scale dominates, moderate red coloration, moderate plaque elevation;
4 (Marked): Thick non-tenacious scale dominates, bright red coloration, marked plaque elevation;
5 (Severe): Very thick tenacious scale predominates, dusky to deep red coloration, severe plaque elevation.
The percentage of participants achieving a score of clear (0) or minimal (1) is reported.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 16</time_frame>
    <description>The Children's Dermatology Life Quality Index (CDLQI) is a 10-item questionnaire to measure the quality of life in children aged from 4 to 16 years. Each question is scored from 0 (not at all) to 3 (very much). The CDLQI is calculated by summing the score of each question resulting in a maximum of 30 and a minimum of 0. The higher the score, the more quality of life is impaired.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in the Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory (PedsQL) Score at Week 16</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 16</time_frame>
    <description>The PedsQL Measurement Model measures health-related quality of life (HRQOL) in children and adolescents. The 23-item PedsQL Generic Core Scale includes Physical, Emotional, Social, School Functioning dimensions. Each item is scored from 0 (never) to 4 (almost always). Items are reversed scored and linearly transformed to a 0-100 scale, so that higher scores indicate better HRQOL; the total score therefore ranges from 0 (worst) to 100 (best).</description>

          <description>Participants received 0.1 mg/kg methotrexate at Baseline (Week 0), and up to 0.4 mg/kg weekly (maximum dose of 25 mg/week) in Period A. Participants also received adalimumab placebo as a single subcutaneous loading dose at Week 0, followed by every other week (eow) dosing from Week 1. Participants who were non-responders in period A entered Period D directly and received open-label adalimumab at 0.8 mg/kg eow for up to 52 weeks. Participants who responded in Period A entered the Treatment Withdrawal Phase (Period B) for up to 36 weeks. Participants who experienced a loss of disease control in Period B entered the Re-treatment Phase (Period C) and received blinded adalimumab 0.8 mg/kg eow for 16 weeks. Participants who completed Period B with no loss of disease control entered Period D and were observed off study medication for up to 52 weeks. Participants who completed Period C entered Period D for an additional 52 weeks of treatment with blinded adalimumab 0.8 mg/kg eow.</description>

Participants who were non-responders in Period A entered Period D directly and received open-label adalimumab at 0.8 mg/kg eow for up to 52 weeks. Participants who responded in Period A entered the Treatment Withdrawal Phase (Period B) for up to 36 weeks. Participants who experienced a loss of disease control in Period B entered the Re-treatment Phase (Period C) and received blinded adalimumab 0.8 mg/kg eow for 16 weeks. Participants who completed Period B with no loss of disease control entered Period D and were observed off study medication for up to 52 weeks. Participants who completed Period C entered Period D for an additional 52 weeks of treatment with blinded adalimumab 0.8 mg/kg eow.</description>

          <description>The PGA is a 6-point scale used to measure the severity of disease at the time of the evaluation. The degree of overall lesion severity was evaluated using the following categories: 0 (Cleared): No evidence of scaling, erythema, or plaque elevation; 1 (Minimal): Occasional fine scale over &lt;5% of lesions, faint erythema, minimal plaque elevation; 2 (Mild): Fine scale dominates, light red coloration, mild plaque elevation; 3 (Moderate): Course scale dominates, moderate red coloration, moderate plaque elevation; 4 (Marked): Thick non-tenacious scale dominates, bright red coloration, marked plaque elevation; 5 (Severe): Very thick tenacious scale predominates, dusky to deep red coloration, severe plaque elevation. The percentage of participants achieving a score of clear (0) or minimal (1) is reported.</description>

          <description>The PGA is a 6-point scale used to measure the severity of disease at the time of the evaluation. The degree of overall lesion severity was evaluated using the following categories: 0 (Cleared): No evidence of scaling, erythema, or plaque elevation; 1 (Minimal): Occasional fine scale over &lt;5% of lesions, faint erythema, minimal plaque elevation; 2 (Mild): Fine scale dominates, light red coloration, mild plaque elevation; 3 (Moderate): Course scale dominates, moderate red coloration, moderate plaque elevation; 4 (Marked): Thick non-tenacious scale dominates, bright red coloration, marked plaque elevation; 5 (Severe): Very thick tenacious scale predominates, dusky to deep red coloration, severe plaque elevation.
The percentage of participants achieving a score of clear (0) is reported.</description>
          <population>Non-responder imputation was used, the analysis was conducted in the ITT population.</population>

        <title>Percentage of Participants Who Achieved a PASI 50 Response Over Time</title>
        <description>PASI is a composite score based on the degree of effect on body surface area of psoriasis and the extension of erythema (reddening), induration (plaque thickness), desquamation (scaling) of the lesions and area affected as observed on the day of examination. The score ranges from 0 (no psoriasis) to 72 (very severe psoriasis).
A PASI 50 response is at least a 50% reduction (improvement) from Baseline in PASI score.</description>

Participants who were non-responders in period A entered Period D directly and received open-label adalimumab at 0.8 mg/kg eow for up to 52 weeks. Participants who responded in Period A entered the Treatment Withdrawal Phase (Period B) for up to 36 weeks. Participants who experienced a loss of disease control in Period B entered the Re-treatment Phase (Period C) and received blinded adalimumab 0.8 mg/kg eow for 16 weeks. Participants who completed Period B with no loss of disease control entered Period D and were observed off study medication for up to 52 weeks.

Participants who responded in Period A entered the Treatment Withdrawal Phase (Period B) for up to 36 weeks. Participants who experienced a loss of disease control in Period B entered the Re-treatment Phase (Period C) and received blinded adalimumab 0.8 mg/kg eow for 16 weeks. Participants who completed Period B with no loss of disease control entered Period D and were observed off study medication for up to 52 weeks. Participants who completed Period C entered Period D for an additional 52 weeks of treatment with blinded adalimumab 0.8 mg/kg eow.</description>

          <title>Percentage of Participants Who Achieved a PASI 50 Response Over Time</title>
          <description>PASI is a composite score based on the degree of effect on body surface area of psoriasis and the extension of erythema (reddening), induration (plaque thickness), desquamation (scaling) of the lesions and area affected as observed on the day of examination. The score ranges from 0 (no psoriasis) to 72 (very severe psoriasis).
A PASI 50 response is at least a 50% reduction (improvement) from Baseline in PASI score.</description>

        <description>PASI is a composite score based on the degree of effect on body surface area of psoriasis and the extension of erythema (reddening), induration (plaque thickness), desquamation (scaling) of the lesions and area affected as observed on the day of examination. The score ranges from 0 (no psoriasis) to 72 (very severe psoriasis).
A PASI 75 response is at least a 75% reduction (improvement) from Baseline in PASI score.</description>

            <description>In Period A participants received a single subcutaneous loading dose of adalimumab 0.8 mg/kg (up to a maximum of 40 mg) at Week 0 followed by every other week dosing beginning at Week 1. To maintain the blind, participants also received weekly dosing of methotrexate placebo tablets. Participants who were non-responders in Period A entered Period D directly and received open-label adalimumab at 0.8 mg/kg eow for up to 52 weeks. Participants who responded in Period A entered the Treatment Withdrawal Phase (Period B) for up to 36 weeks. Participants who experienced a loss of disease control in Period B entered the Re-treatment Phase (Period C) and received blinded adalimumab 0.8 mg/kg eow for 16 weeks. Participants who completed Period B with no loss of disease control entered Period D and were observed off study medication for up to 52 weeks. Participants who completed Period C entered Period D for an additional 52 weeks of treatment with blinded adalimumab 0.8 mg/kg eow.</description>

        <description>PASI is a composite score based on the degree of effect on body surface area of psoriasis and the extension of erythema (reddening), induration (plaque thickness), desquamation (scaling) of the lesions and area affected as observed on the day of examination. The score ranges from 0 (no psoriasis) to 72 (very severe psoriasis).
A PASI 100 response is a 100% reduction (improvement) from Baseline in PASI score.</description>

        <title>Percent Change From Baseline in PASI Score Over Time</title>
        <description>PASI is a composite score based on the degree of effect on body surface area of psoriasis and the extension of erythema (reddening), induration (plaque thickness), desquamation (scaling) of the lesions and area affected as observed on the day of examination. The score ranges from 0 (no psoriasis) to 72 (very severe psoriasis).</description>

Participants also received adalimumab placebo as a single subcutaneous loading dose at Week 0, followed by every other week (eow) dosing from Week 1. Participants who were non-responders in period A entered Period D directly and received open-label adalimumab at 0.8 mg/kg eow for up to 52 weeks. Participants who responded in Period A entered the Treatment Withdrawal Phase (Period B) for up to 36 weeks. Participants who experienced a loss of disease control in Period B entered the Re-treatment Phase (Period C) and received blinded adalimumab 0.8 mg/kg eow for 16 weeks. Participants who completed Period B with no loss of disease control entered Period D and were observed off study medication for up to 52 weeks.

        <title>Change From Baseline in CDLQI Over Time</title>
        <description>The Children's Dermatology Life Quality Index (CDLQI) is a 10-item questionnaire to measure the quality of life in children aged from 4 to 16 years. Each question is scored from 0 (not at all) to 3 (very much). The CDLQI is calculated by summing the score of each question resulting in a maximum of 30 and a minimum of 0. The higher the score, the more quality of life is impaired.</description>

        <description>The Children's Dermatology Life Quality Index (CDLQI) is a 10-item questionnaire to measure the quality of life in children aged from 4 to 16 years. Each question is scored from 0 (not at all) to 3 (very much). The CDLQI is calculated by summing the score of each question resulting in a maximum of 30 and a minimum of 0. The higher the score, the more quality of life is impaired and a score of 0 indicates no impairment in quality of life.</description>

            <description>Participants received 0.1 mg/kg methotrexate at Baseline (Week 0), and up to 0.4 mg/kg weekly (maximum dose of 25 mg/week) in Period A. Participants also received adalimumab placebo as a single subcutaneous loading dose at Week 0, followed by every other week (eow) dosing from Week 1. Participants who were non-responders in period A entered Period D directly and received open-label adalimumab at 0.8 mg/kg eow for up to 52 weeks. Participants who responded in Period A entered the Treatment Withdrawal Phase (Period B) for up to 36 weeks. Participants who experienced a loss of disease control in Period B entered the Re-treatment Phase (Period C) and received blinded adalimumab 0.8 mg/kg eow for 16 weeks. Participants who completed Period B with no loss of disease control entered Period D and were observed off study medication for up to 52 weeks.

        <description>The PedsQL Measurement Model measures health-related quality of life (HRQOL) in children and adolescents. The 23-item PedsQL Generic Core Scale includes Physical, Emotional, Social, School Functioning dimensions. Each item is scored from 0 (never) to 4 (almost always). Items are reversed scored and linearly transformed to a 0-100 scale, so that higher scores indicate better HRQOL; the total score therefore ranges from 0 (worst) to 100 (best).</description>
