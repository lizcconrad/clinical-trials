  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background:

      - Recent research has shown that causing an immune response to tumor cells may help slow or
      stop the growth of tumors. One treatment that has come from this research involves collecting
      and modifying a cancer patient's tumor cells in the laboratory, then returning the cells to
      the patient as a vaccine to encourage the immune system to respond to them. Researchers are
      interested in testing tumor cell vaccines with an experimental drug called ISCOMATRIX , which
      can be added to a vaccine in order to elicit a stronger immune response in the body.
      ISCOMATRIX has not been approved for sale and use in any country and its use is still
      experimental, though it has been tested and used safely in other clinical studies.
      Researchers are also interested in determining whether the anti-inflammatory drug celecoxib
      will improve the body's immune reaction if given with the vaccine.

      Objectives:

      - To assess the safety and effectiveness of tumor cell vaccines given with ISCOMATRIX and
      celecoxib in the treatment of lung and esophagus cancers.

      Eligibility:

        -  Individuals at least 18 years of age who have primary small cell or non-small cell lung
           cancer, esophageal cancer, or pleural mesothelioma that can be removed by surgery.

        -  Only individuals whose tumor cells are able to produce a tumor cell line for vaccine
           development will be eligible for treatment.

      Design:

        -  Participants will be screened with a physical examination and medical history, and will
           have tumor tissue collected during their surgery to determine whether the tumor cells
           can be used to produce a vaccine.

        -  Participants will take celecoxib twice daily for 7 days before having the first tumor
           cell vaccination. Participants will also have leukapheresis to collect blood cells for
           testing before the first vaccination.

        -  Participants will receive one vaccine (which may be given in two shots) monthly for 6
           months, and will continue to take celecoxib twice daily. One month after the 6th vaccine
           shot, participants will have another leukapheresis and skin test. If these tests show
           that a participant is responding to the vaccine, additional vaccines will be given every
           3 months for up to 2 years.

        -  Participants will have a physical exam and lab tests before each vaccination, blood
           samples and imaging studies every 3 months, and a skin test every 6 months.

        -  Participants will have regular followup visits with imaging studies and blood samples
           for up to 5 years after the first vaccination, or until a new tumor develops....

      Background:

        -  Cancer-testis (CT) antigens have emerged as attractive targets for cancer immunotherapy.
           Whereas lung and esophageal cancers, thymic Neoplasms, primary thoracic sarcomas, as
           well as malignant pleural mesotheliomas express a variety of CT antigens, primary or
           vaccine-induced immune responses to these antigens appear uncommon in patients with
           these malignancies, possibly due to low-level, heterogeneous antigen expression, and
           inadequate vaccination strategies.

        -  Because numerous CT antigens can be induced in tumor cells by DNA demethylating agents
           and HDAC inhibitors, it is conceivable that vaccination of cancer patients with
           autologous tumor cells exposed to chromatin remodeling agents will enhance anti-tumor
           immunity in these individuals.

        -  In order to examine this issue, patients with resectable primary neoplasms involving the
           lungs, esophagus, or pleura will be vaccinated with autologous tumor cells exposed
           exvivo to decitabine and radiation following completion of appropriate combined modality
           therapy. Vaccine will be administered in conjunction with ISCOMATRIX adjuvant and oral
           celecoxib.

      Primary Objective:

      - To assess the safety of an epigenetically modified autologous tumor cell vaccine in
      conjunction with celecoxib.

      Eligibility:

        -  Patients with histologically or cytologically proven or clinically evident primary
           pulmonary carcinoma or sarcoma, esophageal cancer, thymic carcinoma or malignant pleural
           mesothelioma undergoing resection of their neoplasms.

        -  Patients must be 18 years or older with an ECOG performance status of 0 2, with adequate
           pulmonary and cardiac function and laboratory values within normal limits.

      Design:

        -  Patients with operable lung and esophageal carcinoma/sarcoma, thymoma, thymic carcinoma
           or malignant pleural mesothelioma will undergo resection of their malignancies at the
           NCI.

        -  Portions of the resected tumors will be transferred to the Thoracic Oncology Laboratory
           and cells will be processed to establish a cancer cell line.

        -  Following recovery from surgery and appropriate adjuvant chemotherapy and/or radiation,
           patients will be vaccinated with epigenetically-modified autologous tumor cells
           periodically over 6 months in conjunction with oral celecoxib.

        -  Systemic toxicities and delayed type hypersensitivity responses to autologous tumor
           cells and serologic responses to a variety of CT antigens will be assessed before and
           after vaccination.

        -  Patients will be followed with routine staging scans until disease recurrence.

        -  As the exact set of comparisons and analyses to be performed will be determined
           following completion of the trial, and will be based on limited numbers of patients, the
           analyses will be considered exploratory and hypothesis generating rather than
           definitive.

        -  Approximately 120 patients will be accrued to this trial in order to obtain up to 30
           evaluable patients.
