      To perform a randomized comparison between the Cypher Select+ stent and the Nobori stent in
      the treatment of unselected patients with ischaemic heart disease.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      All patients to be treated with one or several drug-eluting coronary stents at one of the
      four heart centers in Odense, Skejby, Aalborg and Varde can be included in the study. All
      patients enrolled in the study will be hospitalized at one of the heart centers mentioned.
      Patients will not be recruited via advertisements.

      The study is designed as a non-inferiority study, where the objective is to prove that Nobori
      is Δ0 poorer as a maximum than Cypher select+. The nine-month event rate (cardiac death, MI
      and/or TVR) in the Cypher stent group of SORT OUT 3 was 3.0%

      The calculation of power below has been made under the following assumptions:

      P (Cypher) = 0.03

      There is no good estimate for the event rate related to the Nobori stent. α = 0.05 -
      one-sided

      1-β = 0.80

      Based on the various values of Δ0 the necessary number of patients, N, in each group can be
      calculated (StudySize Version 2.0.4, Creostat):

        -  Δ0 *N in each group

        -  0.0025 *57,589

        -  0.005 *14,397

        -  0.010 *3,599

        -  0.015 *1,599

        -  0.020 *900

      According to the above assumptions, a total of 900 patients must be included in each group in
      order to reject a null hypothesis that the event rate in the Nobori group is more than 2
      percentage points (0.02) poorer than the event rate in the Cypher group or that Nobori is
      inferior to Cypher, (H0: pNobori - pCypher ≥ Δ0 = 0.02). The alternative hypothesis (HA: pN -
      pS &lt; Δ0) provides that Nobori is non-inferior to Cypher - with the selected limit for
      non-inferiority.

      Assuming an inclusion rate of 200 patients per month, it will be possible to include 2000
      patients in 10 months.

      Power is almost 0.9 if the inclusion is increased to a little over 2400.

      Organization

      The study is headed by a steering committee, in which PCI operators will participate from
      each of the participating sites.

      Evald Høj Christiansen, Aarhus, will be Principal Investigator. At present, the other members
      of the steering committee are: Jens Flensted Lassen (chairman), Leif Thuesen, Jan Ravkilde,
      Hans-Henrik Tilsted, Per Thayssen and Lisette Okkels Jensen. All members of the steering
      committee will be given full access to the database and will take part in the interpretation
      of data.

      The study secretariat and the randomization computer are localized at the Department of
      Cardiology, [Hjertemedicinsk Afdeling], Aarhus University Hospital, Skejby.

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

        All patients eligible for treatment with one or several drug-eluting coronary stents at one
        of the four heart centers in Odense, Skejby, Aalborg or Varde can be included in the study.

        The patients will be treated in accordance with the criteria applicable at the individual
        sites. The indication for using DES varies slightly between the four sites, as the
        indication for implantation of DES is based on clinical and angiographic criteria with the
        financial constraints applying at the individual site. Basically, DES will be chosen
        instead of BMS in patients with an estimated increased risk of restenosis, in patients with
        the following stenosis types: Long lesions, lesions in small vessels, bifurcations, ostial
        lesions, in-stent restenoses and stenosis in the proximal segment of the anterior
        descending branch. Furthermore, DES will also be chosen for diabetics and in the left main.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  The patient does not wish to participate

          -  The patient is participating in other randomized stent studies

          -  Life expectancy &lt; 1 year

          -  Allergic to Aspirin, clopidogrel, prasugrel or ticlopidin

          -  Allergic to sirolimus or biolimus
