  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this randomized crossover study is to determine the efficacy of participant
      designed medication reminders on asthma control, asthma related quality of life,and
      medication adherence. In addition, this study will provide data regarding the usage,
      usability, acceptability of an online system designed for creating text message reminders. It
      is hypothesized that the teens receiving text message reminders will report having greater
      quality of life related to their asthma, a reported increase in the control of their asthma,
      and increased adherence to their medication regimen compared to those teens that are not
      receiving the text message reminders.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Adolescents are typically less adept at managing chronic illnesses and adhering to treatment
      plans than are parents of younger children. Adolescents are also typically &quot;early adopters&quot;
      to technological solutions and text messages are integral in today's teen culture. Text
      messages are gaining acceptance in health care both as appointment reminders and direct
      inquiries. The purpose of this randomized crossover study is to examine the effect of
      participant designed medication reminders on asthma control, asthma related quality of life,
      and medication adherence. In addition, this study will provide data regarding the usage,
      usability, and acceptability of an online system designed for creating text message
      reminders.

    <description>The teen will complete the Asthma Control Test (ACT), a validated 5-item Likert scale test that asks them to detail their asthma symptoms. These are questions consistent with those that would be asked by a clinician (i.e., how many times have you used your fast-acting inhaler in the past four weeks, how often does asthma limit your activities). The responses to these questions will also be used to calculate the teen's asthma control.</description>

    <time_frame>Change from Baseline on PedsQL at 3 months (1st arm), Change from Baseline on PedsQL at 6 months (2nd arm)</time_frame>
    <description>This assessment measures how much asthma has been a problem for them in the last month (i.e., &quot;It is hard for me to be responsible for my medications.&quot;, &quot;I worry about my asthma.&quot;)</description>

    <description>Adherence to medication regimen will be monitored with the Smartinhaler Tracker developed by Nexus 6 ltd. It will record the adherence to medication administered through metered-dose inhalers, which include medication such as Qvar and Flovent. The Smartinhaler records the time and date medications were taken, whether the canister was shaken appropriately prior to inhalation, and how much the medication was inhaled.</description>
