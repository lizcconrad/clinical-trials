  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study was planned to provide new information regarding the role of aliskiren (with or
      without additional therapy with a diuretic or a Calcium channel blockers (CCB)) in elderly
      individuals (≥ 65 years) with systolic blood pressure (SBP) 130 to 159 mmHg, in preventing
      major cardiovascular (CV) events and on global measures of physical, executive and cognitive
      function.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This was 2x2 factorial design study with 2 strata. As per protocol, the first co- Primary
      analysis as well as secondary analysis were aliskiren based regimen vs non-aliskiren based
      regimen. All aliskiren based arm were combined into the aliskiren based regimen and all
      non-aliskiren based arms were combined into non-aliskiren based regimen.

    <time_frame>Baseline, End of study (209 days [median])</time_frame>
    <description>Decline in ability to perform everyday activities independently was measured primarily by using the Standard Assessment of Global Activities in the Elderly (SAGE) scale. The SAGE comprised of 15 questions, each describing an activity. Patient had to indicate how much difficulty he/she had encountered in performing the activity in last month. Each question's score ranges from 0 (No difficulty) to 3 (difficulty levels were mild (score = 1), moderate (score =2) and severe (score=3)). Part I of SAGE included 4 dimensions:
Community Cognition (maximum of scores of questions 1 to 6);
Instrumental Activities of daily Living (IADL) (maximum of scores of questions 7 to 10);
Mobility (maximum of scores of questions 11 and 12);.
Basic Activities of daily Living (ADL) (maximum of scores of questions 13 to 15) Each dimension's total score ranged from 0 to 3. 0=best, 3=worst A negative change in value from baseline means improvement in the ability to perform everyday activities.</description>

&quot;Mobility Only&quot; if scores of both SAGE questions 11 and 12 are 0</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Mean Sitting Systolic Blood Pressure (msSBP)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (BL), 6 week, 6 month and 12 month</time_frame>
    <description>Mean sitting systolic blood pressure (msSBP) is the average of 2 sitting SBP measurements (2 minutes apart). Since each patient had their final follow-up visit at a different time in the trial, these measurements were classified as falling into the 6 week, 6 month, or 12 month measurement period. All available blood pressures were sorted within these periods and the last value within each time range used for analysis. At each timepoint, a patient must have both baseline and postbaseline values to be included in the analysis.</description>

    <description>Mean sitting diastolic blood pressure (msDBP) is the average of 2 sitting DBP measurements (2 minutes apart). Since each patient had their final follow-up visit at a different time in the trial, these measurements were classified as falling into the 6 week, 6 month, or 12 month measurement period. All available blood pressures were sorted within these periods and the last value within each time range used for analysis.

        <description>The composite CV endpoint is based on the following first adjudicated events: CV death, non-fatal MI,non-fatal stroke, significant heart failure</description>
        <time_frame>End of study (209 days (median))</time_frame>
        <population>Full Analysis set. 1759 patients were randomized as against the originally planned 11,000. A total of 25 primary CV composite endpoints had accrued during median follow-up of 209 days versus planned 2000 primary endpoints during planned follow-up of average 5 years. These low numbers significantly limit interpretation of the results.</population>

        <description>Decline in ability to perform everyday activities independently was measured primarily by using the Standard Assessment of Global Activities in the Elderly (SAGE) scale. The SAGE comprised of 15 questions, each describing an activity. Patient had to indicate how much difficulty he/she had encountered in performing the activity in last month. Each question’s score ranges from 0 (No difficulty) to 3 (difficulty levels were mild (score = 1), moderate (score =2) and severe (score=3)). Part I of SAGE included 4 dimensions:
Community Cognition (maximum of scores of questions 1 to 6);
Instrumental Activities of daily Living (IADL) (maximum of scores of questions 7 to 10);
Mobility (maximum of scores of questions 11 and 12);.
Basic Activities of daily Living (ADL) (maximum of scores of questions 13 to 15) Each dimension’s total score ranged from 0 to 3. 0=best, 3=worst A negative change in value from baseline means improvement in the ability to perform everyday activities.</description>

        <description>Mean sitting diastolic blood pressure (msDBP) is the average of 2 sitting DBP measurements (2 minutes apart). Since each patient had their final follow-up visit at a different time in the trial, these measurements were classified as falling into the 6 week, 6 month, or 12 month measurement period. All available blood pressures were sorted within these periods and the last value within each time range used for analysis. At each timepoint, a patient must have both baseline and postbaseline values to be included in the analysis.</description>

    <limitations_and_caveats>Due to early termination, 1759 patients were randomized as against 11,000. Only 25 primary endpoints had accrued during median follow-up of 209 days as against planned 2000 in 5 years. These low numbers significantly limit interpretation of results.</limitations_and_caveats>
