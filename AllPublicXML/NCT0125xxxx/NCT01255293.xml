      The purpose of this study is to assess the retinal redetachment rates with 1000 centistoke
      versus 5000 centistoke silicone oil tamponade for repair of complex retinal detachments.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      As part of retinal detachment surgery, the eye is typically filled with a gas bubble or
      silicone oil bubble. This bubble acts like a balloon inside the eye and helps to keep the
      retina pushed back against the eye wall so it can heal in its proper place. Gas bubbles
      spontaneously dissolve over a few weeks whereas silicone oil remains in the eye until removed
      with another surgery. When retinal detachments are associated with significant scar tissue on
      the retinal surface, silicone oil is often used since it can remain filling the eyeball for
      as long as necessary to help the retina to heal properly in place. Currently, two different
      types of silicone oil (1000 centistoke and 5000 centistoke) are commercially available and
      have been approved for use in the eye by the Food and Drug Administration. The goal of the
      study is to compare the outcomes using these two different types of silicone oil.

      The retinal detachment will be repaired in a standard fashion. There will be no difference
      between the way retinal detachments are repaired in this study compared to those not in this
      study. Patients will be randomly assigned (like a flip of a coin) to receive one of the types
      of silicone oil. Both types of oil have very similar characteristics. The primary difference
      is that one type is thicker (more viscous) than the other, analogous to honey in comparison
      with maple syrup.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Presence of rhegmatogenous retinal detachment or tractional retinal detachment due to
             grade C or worse proliferative vitreoretinopathy or proliferative diabetic
             retinopathy.

          -  Judgment by the investigator that silicone oil tamponade is surgically indicated for
             appropriate repair of the complex retinal detachment.

          -  Visual acuity of light perception or better.

          -  Ability to provide written informed consent and comply with study assessments for the
             full duration of the study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Inability to re-attach the retina at the time of surgery.

          -  Prior trabeculectomy or tube shunt surgery.

          -  Corneal opacity which limits visualization of the trabecular meshwork.
