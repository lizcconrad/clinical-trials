  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research is to measure the endotracheal tube cuff pressure in patients
      who have been endotracheally intubated emergently in the emergency department or in the field
      by prehospital personnel. Overinflation of ETTc pressure is associated with injury, and we
      seek to determine if the phenomenon of excessively inflated ETTc can be detected in
      endotracheally intubated patients in the ED.

      There is no experimental aspect to this study, it is only descriptive. Measurement of ETTc
      pressure is already performed by respiratory therapy/respiratory care. We simply seek to
      assess these measurements to determine if any patients in fact have high ETTc pressure. If it
      is found that patients do have ETTc with high pressures, this might allow emergency
      department staff or prehospital personnel such as paramedics or EMTs to use this information
      to seek methods by which endotracheal intubation can be improved and patients can be
      intubated without excessive ETTc pressure.

      This is a pilot study. We have conducted several in vitro studies, which have all
      demonstrated that paramedics, EMTs, and emergency department physicians practice endotracheal
      intubation in a method that might result in excessively inflated ETTc.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patient emergently endotracheally intubated with a cuffed endotracheal tube.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Endotracheal intubation procedure performed in a setting other than the prehospital
             (field) or emergency department of participating institution. This specifically
             excludes endotracheally intubated patients transferred from another hospital, chronic
             care facility, or other location.

          -  Non-emergent or elective endotracheal intubation.
