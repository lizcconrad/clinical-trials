  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Photodynamic therapy (PDT) uses a combination of a drug, porfimer sodium, and a light from a
      non heated laser. The activation of the drug is done by illuminating abnormal areas using a
      fiber optic device. The fiber optic device is a very fine fiber (like fishing line) that
      permits transmission of light. By itself, porfimer sodium is inactive. However it becomes
      active when it is put in the presence of a light source such as sunlight, very intense indoor
      light, or laser. Therefore, the main risk with this therapy is that the skin will be more
      sensitive to light, and this sensibility can last up to 90 days. The skin reaction is similar
      to sunburn and is called phototoxicity.

      To date, no product on the market has shown protection against visible light, and therefore,
      no product has been demonstrated to protect against the skin phototoxicity to visible light.
      A sunscreen sold under the brand name Solar Protection Formula® SPF 60 in the United States
      contains ingredients that provide maximum ultraviolet (UV) protection, as well as a
      formulation that could provide visible light protection. The product could potentially
      prevent the skin phototoxicity due to visible light, the most frequently reported side effect
      in patients receiving PDT with porfimer sodium. Therefore, this study is designed to assess
      the efficacy of topical application of Solar Protection Formula® SPF 60 as skin protector
      against visible light-induced skin redness and swelling following injection of porfimer
      sodium. It will involve 17 to 20 human subjects in the United States for whom PDT with
      porfimer sodium is planned for the treatment of high-grade dysplasia in Barrett's esophagus
      (pre-cancerous change in the food pipe tissue), lung cancer, or cancer of the esophagus (food
      pipe).

      Human subjects with planned PDT course will be evaluated to confirm eligibility. Prior to
      enrollment, all inclusion and exclusion criteria will be verified. Medical procedures
      including demographic information (age, sex, race, smoking and drinking habits),
      medical/surgical history, physical exam (including vital signs, body weight, height, and skin
      color), clinical laboratory testing, concomitant medication intake and other therapy uses
      will be collected. The study procedures will begin after the intravenous injection of
      porfimer sodium.

      Skin photobiological testing will consist of four 2-day periods performed over three months
      after the injection of porfimer sodium at a dose of 2 mg/kg of body weight. Each period will
      include a Skin Illumination session and a Skin Evaluation session. During the Skin
      Illumination session, the Solar Protection Formula® SPF 60 will be randomly applied at a dose
      of 2 mg/cm² on a skin subunit area of the back 30 minutes before illumination. A second skin
      subunit will be used as a &quot;no-treatment&quot; observational area. Therefore, each subject will be
      her/his own control. Illumination will be performed using a visible light source. During the
      Skin Evaluation session, skin reactions will be scored by an outcome assessor 24 hours after
      illumination according to a pre-determined rating scale. The outcome assessor will be blinded
      to the active treatment sequence applications. All subjects will be followed for three
      months.
