  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators have developed an online database called 'Synthesized HIV/AIDS Research
      Evidence' (SHARE), which is designed to support the use of research evidence by those working
      in the HIV/AIDS sector. This study will evaluate whether a &quot;full-serve&quot; version of SHARE
      increases the use of research evidence by community-based organizations as compared to a
      &quot;self-serve&quot; version. The &quot;full-serve&quot; version of SHARE consists of several components: 1) an
      online searchable database of synthesized research evidence relevant to HIV/AIDS , 2)
      periodic emailed updates, 3) access to user-friendly summaries and 4) peer-relevance
      assessments. The self-serve version consists only of a listing of relevant synthesized
      research evidence . The investigators will also interview participants in the study to obtain
      feedback about SHARE, how helpful it was in their work, why it was helpful (or not helpful),
      what aspects were most and least helpful and why, and recommendations for improving it.

      Background To support the use of research evidence by community-based organizations the
      investigators have developed 'Synthesized HIV/AIDS Research Evidence' (SHARE), which is an
      evidence service for those working in the HIV sector. SHARE consists of several components:
      1) an online searchable database of HIV-relevant systematic reviews (retrievable based on a
      taxonomy of topics related to HIV/AIDS and open text search), 2) periodic email updates, 3)
      access to user-friendly summaries, and 4) peer relevance assessments. The objective is to
      evaluate whether this &quot;full serve&quot; evidence service increases the use of research evidence by
      community-based organizations as compared to a &quot;self-serve&quot; evidence service.

      Methods/design The investigators will conduct a two-arm randomized controlled trial (RCT),
      along with a follow-up qualitative process study to explore the findings in greater depth.
      All community-based organizations affiliated with Canadian AIDS Society (n=120) will be
      invited to participate and will be randomized to receive either the &quot;full-serve&quot; version of
      SHARE or the &quot;self-serve&quot; version (a listing of relevant systematic reviews with links to
      records on PubMed and worksheets that help community-based organizations find and use
      research evidence) using a simple randomized design. All management and staff from each
      organization will be provided access to the version of SHARE that their organization is
      allocated to. The trial duration will be 10 months (two-month baseline period, six-month
      intervention period, and two month cross-over period), the primary outcome measure will be
      the mean number of logins/month/organization (averaged across the number of users from each
      organization) between baseline and the end of the intervention period and the secondary
      outcome will be intention to use research evidence as measured by a survey administered to
      one key decision-maker from each organization. For the qualitative study, one key
      organizational decision-maker from 15 organizations in each trial arm (n=30) will be
      purposively sampled. One-on-one semi-structured interviews will be conducted by telephone on
      their views about and their experiences with the evidence service they received, how helpful
      it was in their work, why it was helpful (or not helpful), what aspects were most and least
      helpful and why, and recommendations for next steps.

    <description>The investigators will use the theory of planned behaviour to measure participants' intention to use research. Using a manual designed to construct measures based on the theory, colleagues have developed and sought preliminary feedback on a data-collection instrument by first assessing face validity through interviews with key informants and then pilot testing it with 28 policymakers and researchers who completed it after participating in a knowledge translation intervention. In addition, colleagues found the data-collection instrument to have moderate test-retest reliability.</description>

    <description>The full-serve evidence service consists of:
an online searchable database of HIV-relevant systematic reviews;
monthly email updates highlighting new reviews;
access to user-friendly summaries produced by us or by others (when available);
links to scientific abstracts;
peer relevance assessments, which involves periodic requests to complete a brief assessment of how useful the information in the newly added review is with the average score posted once an assessment is completed;
an interface for participants to leave comments in the records of systematic reviews in the database;
links to full-text articles (when publicly available); and
