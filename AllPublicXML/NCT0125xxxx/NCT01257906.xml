      ZIANA® (clindamycin phosphate 1.2% and tretinoin 0.025%) gel, marketed by Medicis, The
      Dermatology Company®, is a safe and effective topical therapy used for the treatment of acne
      vulgaris. Actavis Mid-Atlantic LLC has developed a generic formulation of clindamycin
      phosphate (1.2%) and tretinoin (0.025%) topical gel and the current study is designed to
      evaluate the bioequivalence of this formulation to ZIANA®.

        inclusive. 2. Patients who are 18 years of age or older must have provided IRB/IEC approved
        written informed consent. Patients between the ages of 12 to 17 years of age must have
        provided IRB/IEC approved written assent; this written assent must be accompanied by an
        IRB/IEC approved written informed consent from the patient's legally acceptable
        representative (i.e., parent or guardian). In addition, all patients or their legally
        acceptable representatives (i.e., parent or guardian) must sign a HIPAA authorization, if
        applicable. 3. Patients must have a definite clinical diagnosis of mild to severe acne
        vulgaris (Grade 2, Grade 3 or Grade 4 on the IGE). 4. Patients must have a minimum of 20
        and a maximum of 100 facial inflammatory lesions at baseline. Patients must also have a
        minimum of 25 and a maximum of 100 non-inflammatory lesions (i.e., open and closed
        comedones) at baseline. Patients may have no more than two (2) nodulo-cystic lesions at
        baseline. For the purposes of study treatment and evaluation, these lesions should be
        limited to the facial treatment area. Lesions involving the eyes, angles of the nose (i.e.,
        the lines around your nostrils and under the nostrils) and scalp should be excluded from
        the count. Patients may have acne lesions on other areas of the body (e.g., on the back).
        5.Female patients of childbearing potential must have been using accepted methods of birth
        control or must agree to continue to practice abstinence, from 30 days prior to study entry
        to 30 days after the last administration of study drug. All female patients are considered
        to be of childbearing potential unless they have been surgically sterilized or have been
        postmenopausal for at least 1 year. Abstinence is an acceptable method of birth control.
        Alternatively, any of the following methods of birth control are acceptable: oral
        contraceptives, contraceptive patches/implants (e.g., Norplant®) Depo-Provera®, double
        barrier methods (e.g., condom and spermicide) or IUD. Female patients must have a negative
        urine pregnancy test at baseline. A negative result of a pregnancy test having a minimum
        sensitivity of at least 50 mIU/ml for hCG should be obtained. 6. All male patients must
        agree to use accepted methods of birth control with their partners, from the day of the
        first dose administration to 30 days after the last administration of study drug.
        Abstinence is an acceptable method of birth control. Alternatively, any of the following
        methods of birth control are acceptable: oral contraceptives, contraceptive
        patches/implants (e.g., Norplant®), Depo-Provera®, double barrier methods (e.g., condom and
        spermicide) or IUD. 7. Patients must be willing and able to understand and comply with the
        requirements of the protocol, including attendance at the required study visits. 8.
        Patients must be willing to refrain from using any treatments for acne vulgaris, including
        antibiotics, other than the investigational product, for acne present on the face. Patients
        may use other topical acne treatments that do not have significant or measurable systemic
        absorption for treatment of acne of the back, shoulders and chest (e.g., benzoyl peroxide,
        salicylic acid). 9. Patients must be in good health and free from any clinically
        significant disease. 10. Patients who use make-up must have used the same brands/types of
        make-up for a minimum period of 14 days prior to study entry and must agree to not change
        make-up brand/type or frequency of use throughout the study.
