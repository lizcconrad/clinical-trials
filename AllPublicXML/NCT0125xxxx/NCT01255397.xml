      The purpose of this experiment is to test the feasibility of a minimally interventionist
      protocol for young couples with male factor infertility, which addresses the cause of
      infertility for these couples which is the inability of the sperm to fertilize the
      egg.Ultrasound monitoring of natural follicular development utilizing rFSH, GnRH antagonist
      and rHCG only for the final maturation. Single follicle aspiration and IUI or IVF/ICSI based
      on sperm charcteristics on the day of fertilization. Fertilized eggs transfered to the uterus
      on the same day as the aspiration.

    <description>Healthy women with a regular cycle between 28 and 35 days. For the man, an abnormal sperm exam.
Daily US examinations from day 8 of the menstrual cycle. Excluding weekends.
When the leading follicle is 14 mm she will be given 100 units puregon and orgalutran,once daily until the leading follicle is at least 16 mm at which point she will be given ovitrelle at 21:00.
35 hours after Ovitrelle at 8:00 the husband will present a sperm sample for analysis. A pelvic US will be done to the wife.
If the follicle has collapsed than IUI will be performed
It the total motile sperm count is above 5 million sperm/ml then IUI will be done
If the total motile sperm count is below 5 million and the follicle has not collapsed, proceed to oocyte aspiration and ICSI
6) ICSI and embryo transfer performed on the same day. 7) Luteal support: Endometrin 100 mg twice a day following IUI\ET until 6 weeks gestation Protocol can be repeated for up to 3 cycles per couple.</description>
