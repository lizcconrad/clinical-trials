      The aim of this study is the evaluation of two usual care strategies after stroke or TIA :
      achieved target LDL-C of 100 mg/dL (+/-10 mg/dL) or less than 70 mg/dL. Investigators will
      use the statin and titrate the dosage to achieve the target assigned by randomization in
      monotherapy or in combination with ezetimibe or other drugs.

      The primary end-point is the occurrence of recurrent non fatal stroke, non fatal MI, and
      vascular death in each group.

      3760 patients will be recruited and followed for eight and a half years maximum.

      The aim of this study is the evaluation of two usual care strategies after stroke or TIA :
      achieved target LDL-C of 100 mg/dL (+/-10 mg/dL) or less than 70 mg/dL. Investigators will
      use the statin and titrate the dosage to achieve the target assigned by randomization in
      monotherapy or in combination with ezetimibe or other drugs.

      Inclusion criteria:

        -  Recent (less than 3 months) ischemic stroke As soon as possible after the event, once
           the neurologic deficit is stabilized (investigator judgment). These ischemic strokes
           include TIA with ischemic lesion documented by CT or MRI.

        -  Or recent TIA (less than 15 days) without documentation of ischemic lesion on CT/MR
           imaging. Must be limb weakness or aphasia lasting more than 10 min.

        -  And documented atherosclerotic stenosis in carotid artery (investigator judgment) (based
           on the results of Duplex echography, CTA, MRA or X ray- angiography), Or in the aortic
           arch (investigator judgment) (based on TEE or CTA), Or in other brain artery: vertebral,
           basilar or other intracranial artery (based on CTA, MRA, XRA), Or in coronary arteries
           (past history of acute coronary syndrome, coronary revascularization or positive
           coronary angiography)

        -  And statin treatment is indicated, following ANSM guidelines (French drug agency), age
           &gt;18 years, rankin score ≤ 4, patient or a legal representative signs consent, patient is
           affiliated to social security system

      Exclusion criteria :

        -  Ischemic stroke/TIA du to arterial dissection (investigator judgment)

        -  Cardiac source of embolism (e.g., mitral stenosis, endomyocardial fibrosis) without
           documented atherosclerotic stenosis : a patient with atrial fibrillation or a past
           history of recent myocardial infarction or calcified aortic stenosis can be randomized
           if he otherwise fulfils inclusion criteria

        -  Symptomatic hemorrhagic stroke : Presence of microbleeds on gradient echo imaging (T2*)
           is not an exclusion criteria. Hemorrhagic transformation of an ischemic stroke is not an
           exclusion criteria

        -  Uncontrolled hypertension (investigator judgment)

        -  LDL-C &lt;100 mg/dL or patients for whom treatment intensification is impossible

        -  F/U impossible or bad observance anticipated.

        -  Co-morbid condition that may interfere with the F/U or with the evaluation of primary
           endpoint

        -  Participation to another clinical trial

      The primary end-point is:

      Occurrence of recurrent non fatal stroke, non fatal MI, vascular death in each group, urgent
      coronary revascularization following an acute coronary syndrome; and carotid or intracranial
      revascularization following a transient ischemic or retinal accident.

      Secondary endpoints:

        -  Fatal and non fatal stroke

        -  Stroke and TIA

        -  Major coronary event (MI, sudden death, coronary revascularization for an ACS)

        -  Any coronary endpoints (MI, hospitalization for ACS, coronary revascularization)

        -  Any revascularization procedures (coronary, carotid, peripheral)

        -  Carotid revascularization (either surgical or endovascular)

        -  Vascular death

        -  Total death

      Hypothesis :

        -  Follow-up of three years

        -  Risk of primary end-point in the control group (Target LDL &lt;100 mg/dL) : 4% per year (12
           % at 36 months)

        -  5% Alpha, 80% power, total number of subject is :

        -  3068 patients with a RRR 25%

        -  20% drop-out: 3760 patients (385 primary EP)

      Study specifications Follow-up : eight and a half years Follow-up visit : every 6 months
      Number of centers (French Stroke Units, under the auspice of the French Neurovascular
      Society) : 60-100

      Ancillary study As an ancillary study, 800 patients (400 in each arm in 4 centers) will
      participate in the TST-PLUS (Plaque Ultrasound Study), in which they will have three
      ultrasound examination (baseline, 1 year and 3 years) and baseline blood sampling. The
      primary endpoint of this substudy will be the rate of occurrence of new carotid plaque, with
      the hypothesis that Rate of plaque occurrence in the &lt;100 mg/dL group will be 25% after 3
      years (45% in EVA when atherosclerosis was present at baseline) RRR of plaque of 25% in the
      &lt;70 mg/dL group Alpha 5%, power 80%

      As an ancillary study, 1000 patients will participate in the TST-PGS (Pharmacogenetics)
      Study, in which they will have 1 blood sampling either at baseline or during one of the
      follow-up visits of TST. The aim of this study is to show that the benefit (risk of ischemic
      stroke, myocardial infarction, and vascular death) observed with a strategy of LDL-C &lt;0.7 g /
      l compared to a strategy of LDL-C to 1 ± 0.1 g / l is higher in carriers of polymorphism
      719Arg of the gene KIF-6 than non-carriers of this polymorphism.
