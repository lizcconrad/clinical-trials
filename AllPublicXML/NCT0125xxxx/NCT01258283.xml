  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main objective of this study is to determine among the patients included a subpopulation
      that does not need a defibrillator.

      This will be done by comparing the number of discordant segments (mismatch) between patients
      who have a severe arrhythmia (ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation) with
      appropriate electrical therapy within 3 years of monitoring and others. &quot;Mismatch&quot; in the
      definition of this objective is the usual definition: score 3.4 in I123-MIBG (Iodine 123
      metaiodobenzylguanidine) and PET at 0,1,2.
