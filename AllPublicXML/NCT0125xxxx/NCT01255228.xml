  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Excessive body weight and obesity have reached epidemic proportions over the last few
      decades, which may cause many chronic diseases. Maintaining a healthy life style could
      decrease the risk for obesity, metabolic syndrome and cardiovascular disease. The study aimed
      to evaluate long-term low glycemic index (GI) diet intervention on lipid profile, body
      composition and the mechanism of obese women. The pilot study will recruit twenty healthy
      subjects, and served test food to determine low GI food. In the experiment period, twenty
      women age from 20-50 years will be recruited. To be included in the study, subjects should
      have a BMI above 24 kg/m2, or the either one (fat mass ≧ 30% or waistline &gt; 80 cm). Before
      dietary intervention, participants will receive food choice table and dietary questionnaires
      to record their dietary intake.

      The study will be a randomized, crossover, controlled clinical trails. The experiment period
      have six weeks, each participants will provide low GI diet (lunch and dinner). On the 0, 3, 6
      week, subjects will measurement their body composition (body weight, body mass, waist and hip
      circumferences) and collect fasting blood samples to analysis the lipid profile, free fatty
      acid, blood sugar, insulin, adiponectin, leptin and fatty acid synthesis enzymes. Statistical
      analysis will be performed by paired t-test. The study expect that long-term low GI diet
      intervention have beneficial effects on regulate body composition of obese women.
