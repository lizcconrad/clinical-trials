      The efficacy and safety of Cilostazol and Probucol in combination on patients with diabetic
      nephropathy is better than the single use.

      The objectives of this study is:

        1. To evaluate the efficacy of Probucol on deferring nephropathy development of the
           patients with diabetic nephropathy (including: the change value of urine albumin from
           the baseline, the rate of the patients with serum creatinine reaching a doubling of the
           base-line serum creatinine, the rate of the hemodialysis-free survival).

        2. To evaluate the efficacy of Cliostazol and Probucol in combination on deferring
           nephropathy development of the patients with diabetic nephropathy

        3. To evaluate the efficacy of Cilostazol and Probucol in combination on atherosclerosis
           related biomarkers change. Atherosclerosis related biomarkers include:(a)Endothelium
           parameter: ICAM-1, vWF, VCAM-1,and McP-1. (b)Finolysis parameter: TM. (c)Inflammation
           parameter: Hs-CRP; IL-6. (d)Oxidation parameter: Ox-LDL, 8-OHdG. (e)Lipid parameter: TC,
           LDL-C, HDL-C, TG.

        4. To evaluate the efficacy of Cilostazol and Probucol in combination on the progress of
           carotid intima-media thickness (IMT) on patients with diabetic nephropathy.

        5. To evaluate the safety of Cilostazol and Probucol in combination on the patients with
           diabetic nephropathy.
