  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In the last decade, the number of dental implantations continuously increases. However, at
      the same time, the prevalence of peri-implantitis increases, too. Although both surgical and
      non-surgical interventions are available for the therapy, there is no efficient and
      satisfying therapy option resulting in an adequate improvement of this disease.

      An innovative, low abrasive powder has been introduced for the therapy of periodontitis.
      However, the powder might be suitable for the peri-implantitis therapy, also, and could
      improve the effectiveness of the therapy. The usage of this powder in peri-implantitis
      patients has not been assessed in a clinical trial although the effectiveness in natural
      teeth has been demonstrated.

      The aim of this prospective, randomised, multi-centre trial is to assess the effectiveness of
      the aforementioned powder in peri-implantitis patients.

    <description>Test treatment will be performed using the low abrasive powder in a standard air-polishing unit, which will be set up according to the manufacturer's instructions. The unit will be set to a medium water and powder setting, and the powder chamber will be filled to the indicated maximum powder level before treatment to ensure reproducible treatment conditions. The jet will be directed to the periodontal pocket for 5 s per surface (vestibular, lingual, mesio and distal) for subgingival plaque removal.</description>
