  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>End of Day Comfort</measure>
    <time_frame>5 days of wear, lenses replaced daily</time_frame>
    <description>End of day comfort was interpreted and reported by the participant on a questionnaire as a single, retrospective evaluation of 5 days of wear. End of day comfort was measured on a 10-point scale, with 1 being poor and 10 being excellent.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>End of Day Dryness</measure>
    <time_frame>5 days of wear, lenses replaced daily</time_frame>
    <description>End of day dryness was interpreted and reported by the participant on a questionnaire as a single, retrospective evaluation of 5 days of wear. End of day dryness was measured on a 10-point scale, with 1 being very dry and 10 being not dry.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Handling at Removal</measure>
    <time_frame>5 days of wear, lenses replaced daily</time_frame>
    <description>Handling at removal was interpreted and reported by the participant on a questionnaire as a single, retrospective evaluation of 5 days of wear. Handling at removal was measured on a 10-point scale, with 1 being poor/difficult and 10 being excellent/easy.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Overall Vision</measure>
    <time_frame>5 days of wear, lenses replaced daily</time_frame>
    <description>Overall vision was interpreted and reported by the participant on a questionnaire as a single, retrospective evaluation of 5 days of wear. Overall vision was measured on a 10-point scale, with 1 being poor and 10 being excellent.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Overall Fit</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 5, lenses replaced daily</time_frame>
    <description>Overall lens fit was assessed by the investigator at study visit using a biomicroscope, which magnifies the appearance of the contact lens on the participant's eye. Lens fit was assessed by eye and graded on a 5-point scale, with 2=unacceptably loose, 1= acceptably loose, 0=optimal, -1=acceptably tight, and -2=unacceptably tight</description>
