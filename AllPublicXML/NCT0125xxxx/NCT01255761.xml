      Phase 4 study to evaluate a routine patient completed assessment (RAPID3) compared to a
      physician completed assessment (CDAI) to predict treatment success with subjects with
      moderate to severe rheumatoid arthritis

      RA0064 is a Phase 4, multicenter, randomized, 52-week study. All eligible subjects will
      receive open label Cimzia 400 mg at Weeks 0, 2 and 4, followed by Cimzia 200 mg every 2 weeks
      at Weeks 6 to 50 for the treatment of moderate to severe rheumatoid arthritis. All subjects
      will be assessed using the 2 assessment tools: the subject-based Routine Assessment of
      Patient Index (RAPID3) and the investigator-based Clinical Disease Activity Index (CDAI)

    <description>For subjects randomized to CDAI, response is defined as CDAI ≤10 or 20% improvement from Baseline. For subjects randomized to RAPID3, response is defined as RAPID3 ≤6 or 20% improvement from Baseline.
CDAI is the sum of tender joint count, swollen joint count, Patient's Global Assessment of Disease Activity as assessed by Multi-dimensional Health Assessment Questionnaire (MDHAQ) subscore, and Investigator's Global Assessment of Disease Activity - VAS (VAS in cm). 28 joints are examined.
RAPID3 is the sum of the MDHAQ subscores of physical function, pain, and patient's global status.</description>

    <participant_flow>
      <recruitment_details>Enrollment began in November 2010. Overall study completion occurred in December 2012.
The Participant Flow consists of the Randomized Set (RS). The RS consists of all subjects randomized into the study.
The Baseline Characteristics consists of the Safety Set (SS). SS consists of all subjects that received at least 1 dose of study medication.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>The Full Analysis Set (FAS) consists of all randomized subjects who had a valid Baseline and valid Post-Baseline efficacy measurement.
FAS-NRI: For all binary efficacy endpoints assessing response, subjects who withdrew early or had a missing assessment were considered nonresponders at that visit. This is known as nonresponse imputation (NRI).</pre_assignment_details>

        <description>For subjects randomized to CDAI, response is defined as CDAI ≤10 or 20% improvement from Baseline. For subjects randomized to RAPID3, response is defined as RAPID3 ≤6 or 20% improvement from Baseline.
CDAI is the sum of tender joint count, swollen joint count, Patient's Global Assessment of Disease Activity as assessed by Multi-dimensional Health Assessment Questionnaire (MDHAQ) subscore, and Investigator's Global Assessment of Disease Activity - VAS (VAS in cm). 28 joints are examined.
RAPID3 is the sum of the MDHAQ subscores of physical function, pain, and patient’s global status.</description>

          <description>The DAS28(ESR) score is a measure of the subject's disease activity.
DAS28(ESR) is calculated from the tender joint count (28 joints), swollen joint count (28 joints), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR in mm/hour), and the Patient's Global Assessment of Disease Activity as assessed by Multi-dimensional Health Assessment Questionnaire (MDHAQ) subscore using this formula: 0.56 x √(TJC) + 0.28 x √(SJC) + 0.70 x lognat (ESR) + 0.014 x Global Assessment of Arthritis where 28 joints are examined. Lower scores indicate less disease activity.</description>

        <description>CDAI is calculated as the sum of tender joint count (TJC), swollen joint count (SJC), Patient's Global Assessment of Disease Activity as assessed by Multi-dimensional Health Assessment Questionnaire (MDHAQ) subscore, and Investigator's Global Assessment of Disease Activity - Visual Analog Scale (VAS in cm). 28 joints are examined.
The range for the CDAI is 0 - 76 with a negative change in CDAI score indicating an improvement in disease activity and a positive change in score indicating a worsening of disease activity.</description>
