      The objective of this study is to evaluate the potential inhibitory effects of HP802-247
      Vehicle on wound closure (healing), by comparing mean days to closure of superficial
      (partial-thickness) thermal wounds against similar wounds treated with white petrolatum.

          -  Have been treated within the last three months for uncontrolled diabetes mellitus,
             peripheral vascular disease, vitamin C deficiency, connective tissue disorders, or any
             other disease process that impedes wound healing.

          -  Are taking concomitant medications at doses which are known to interfere with healing,
             such as non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, anti-neoplastic drugs, or
             immunosuppressive drugs.

          -  Are using topical glycolic acid products, alpha-hydroxy acid products, retinoids, or
             chemical peel agents in the treatment areas.

          -  Are using systemic steroids or immunosuppressant agents, or have used these drugs
             within the past three months.

          -  The Principal Investigator may declare any subject ineligible for a valid medical
             reason.

          <description>The original protocol (Version 1) called for weekly application of HP802-247 Vehicle alone to the appropriate wound and application of White Petrolatum once weekly to the other wound. After enrollment of the first 15 subjects, scabbing was noted over both wounds, making it impossible to determine the day of wound closure. It was conjectured that the wound environment was becoming too dry. Version 1 of the protocol was stopped and it was amended to Version 2, in which White Petrolatum as applied daily to both wounds. On the days that HP802-247 Vehicle was applied, the White Petrolatum was applied 5 min later to allow the fibrin matrix to mature. 25 subjects were enrolled under Version 2. All 40 subjects enrolled in the study were assessed for safety and the 25 subjects enrolled under Version 2 were assessed for wound closure.</description>
