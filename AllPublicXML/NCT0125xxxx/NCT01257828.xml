  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      CSM (Cervical spondylotic myelopathy) is the most common cause of spinal cord injury
      worldwide. While there is evidence from the recently completed SpineNet prospective study
      that surgical decompression is an effective treatment for CSM, it is clear that many patients
      have remaining neurological impairment. While surgery is relatively safe, approximately 3% of
      patients maintain a neurological problem. Given this background and data from preclinical
      models of non-traumatic and traumatic spinal cord injury, there is strong evidence to
      consider the potential benefit of adding a neuroprotective drug which aids in the treatment
      of patients with CSM whom are undergoing surgical decompression. Riluzole is FDA-approved for
      the treatment of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, which has some similar clinical features to
      CSM. Riluzole is currently under investigation for traumatic spinal cord injury. Given this
      background, there is a strong basis to consider studying the potential neurological benefits
      of Riluzole as a treatment to surgical decompression in patients with CSM.
