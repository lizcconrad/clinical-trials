  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Event-related potentials (ERPsï¼‰has the advantage of excellent temporal resolution on
      measuring real-time neural activities that reflect to higher level cognitive processes. A
      research project related to lesion studies in which patients with cognitive function
      impairment and communication disorder will be recruited as participants to examine their
      impairment as well as residual abilities by using ERPs. Hopefully, expected findings will
      provide further analysis based on the patterns of neural activities revealed by both patients
      and normal controls should be able to provide important evidence toward building the
      cross-linguistic theory. The findings also have applications on diagnostic and evaluation for
      patients with brain lesions for clinical application with communication disorder.
