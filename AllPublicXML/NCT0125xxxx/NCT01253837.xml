  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The recombinant human fusion protein L19TNFα was created with the intention to overcome the
      systemic toxicity of TNFα by directly targeting it to tumor tissues. Tumor-targeted L19TNFα
      would result in high and sustained intralesional bioactive TNFα concentrations.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of this Phase I/II study is to define a safe and potentially active
      treatment regimen of L19TNFα as a monotherapy and to evaluate the antitumor activity of this
      regimen in relapsed metastatic colorectal cancer subjects, for whom standard treatment
      options are exhausted. L19TNFα is an investigational drug that specifically and effectively
      binds to ED-B, which is abundantly expressed in cancer tissue. Accordingly, treatment should
      result in a high and long-lasting intratumoral accumulation of biologically active rh-TNFα.
      Although combined therapies of TNFα with cytotoxic drugs (e.g. melphalan) seem to be
      strikingly more active against sarcoma and melanoma than with TNFα alone - at least for the
      ILP setting it seems possible that the repeated intratumoral delivery of TNFα via L19TNFα
      might produce additional biologic effects, such as the induction of an immunologic antitumor
      response or the sustained inhibition of tumor-associated angiogenesis (Lejeune, 2006), that
      potentially could benefit advanced cancer subjects.
