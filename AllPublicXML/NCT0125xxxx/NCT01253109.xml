  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study monitors the intraocular pressure (IOP) over 4 to 6 hours using the SENSIMED
      Triggerfish® device and Goldmann Applanation Tonometry (GAT) in pigment dispersion syndrome
      and pigmentary glaucoma patients. The aim of the study is to detect SENSIMED Triggerfish®
      output signal peak after induced fluctuation by physical exercise or pupil dilation.

  </brief_summary>
  <overall_status>Terminated</overall_status>
  <why_stopped>
    Law agreement between Triggerfish signal and GAT IOP during both sessions. However, an increase
    in the Triggerfish signal was observed during jogging phase.

          -  Phakic eyes

          -  Patients who accept signing an informed consent approved by the Ethics Committee.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Pigmentary glaucoma already treated with peripheral laser iridotomy (PLI), argon laser
