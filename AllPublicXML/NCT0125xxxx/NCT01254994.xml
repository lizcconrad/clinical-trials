    <textblock>
      To evaluate therapeutic efficacy and predicting factors of entecavir for treating patients
      with acute on chronic hepatitis B liver failure (ACHBLF). A total of 108 patients with ACHBLF
      were allocated into either a treatment group (ETV group, n=53) or a control group (n=55). The
      HBV DNA level, liver function and survival condition of the patients were observed for 48
      weeks after enrollment. The factors possibly related to entecavir treatment efficacy were
      also identified.
