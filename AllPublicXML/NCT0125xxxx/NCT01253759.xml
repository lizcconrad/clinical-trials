      This is a report of 10 years results of combined Transpupillary thermotherapy (TTT) treatment
      with Indocyanine green (ICG) in controlling small and medium-sized choroidal melanomas.

    <textblock>
      The study was done in a Clinical practice setting. Forty six eyes of 46 patients with small
      or medium-sized choroidal melanomas were treated with i-TTT using infrared light delivered
      from a diode laser. All patients were evaluated to rule out systemic metastasis and underwent
      a complete ophthalmological evaluation including: Slit lamp biomicroscopy, dilated fundus
      examination, Fluorescein angiography, Optical coherence tomography and A/B ultrasonography.
      Main outcome measures were: Changes in visual acuity, complications associated with the
      treatment and local control of the tumor.
