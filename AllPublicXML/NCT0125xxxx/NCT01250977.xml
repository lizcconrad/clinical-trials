  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this proof-of-concept pilot study is to evaluate Donepezil HCL (Aricept),
      for adherence, side effects and effects on smoking behavior in a population of dependent
      smokers.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Nicotine dependence is a major public health problem and currently available treatments are
      ineffective for the majority of smokers. Thus, there is a need to develop and test novel
      medications to assist smokers to quit smoking. Recent evidence from two genetic studies by
      our group implicates the endogenous cholinergic system in smoking cessation and nicotine
      dependence, Pre-clinical investigations have also demonstrated an important role for the
      endogenous cholinergic system in nicotine addiction. The proposed proof of concept pilot
      study is a randomized Phase 2a trial designed to study the effects of Donepezil hydrochloride
      (HCL) (Aricept), compared to placebo, on smoking behavior in 24 smokers. Key outcomes
      include, adherence, side effects, smoking rate, and smoking topography.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Smoking Topography</measure>
    <description>At each visit, the participant will smoke a cigarette using a portable, hand held smoking topography device. The topography machine which will measure number of puffs, puff volume, puff velocity, interpuff interval, and peak velocity for each puff. The primary outcome measures will be the number of puffs and total puff volume.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Smoking Rate</measure>
    <time_frame>4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Will assess cigarettes smoked in during the medical screening, baseline session, and throughout the medication period. A standard timeline follow-back method will be used to assess self-reported smoking rate. Participants will also be asked to return their used cigarette butts during each in-person session to verify their smoking rate.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Pill Counts/Adherence</measure>
    <description>Medication adherence will be assessed by pill count. Self-reorted adherence by pill count will be assessed prior to each study visit.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Withdrawal Symptoms</measure>
    <description>Will assess nicotine withdrawal including dysphoria or depressed mood, insomnia, irritability/frustration/anger, anxiety, decreased heart rate, difficulty concentrating, restlessness, and increased appetite/weight gain.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Smoking Urges</measure>
    <description>The 10-item brief QSU questionnaire will be used to assess smoking urges at medical screening, baseline session and testing days. The QSU contains 2 subscales (anticipation of reward, relief from negative affect).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>First Cigarette Smoking Questionnaire</measure>
    <description>This 13-item questionnaire will assess if there is any change in the rewarding value of the first cigarette of the day as compared to the remaining cigarette smoked by the participants throughout the day. This will be asked at the baseline session and 4 testing days.</description>

  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Side Effects</measure>
    <description>A checklist of side effects based on the Aricept product insert will be administered to participants at the observation and testing days. Participants will receive written instructions to call the study physician should they experience any severe side effects or adverse events between study visits.</description>
