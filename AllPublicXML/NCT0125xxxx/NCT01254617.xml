    <textblock>
      This phase I trial studies the side effects and the best dose of lenalidomide when given
      together with cetuximab in treating patients with colorectal cancer or head and neck cancer
      that has spread to other places in the body and usually cannot be cured or controlled with
      treatment. Biological therapies, such as lenalidomide, use substances made from living
      organisms that may stimulate the immune system in different ways and stop tumor cells from
      growing. Monoclonal antibodies, such as cetuximab, may block tumor growth in different ways
      by targeting certain cells. Giving lenalidomide together with cetuximab may be a better
      treatment for colorectal cancer or head and neck cancer.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the maximum-tolerated dose of lenalidomide when given in combination with
      cetuximab in patients with advanced colorectal or squamous cell head and neck cancer.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate response in refractory V-Ki-ras2 Kirsten rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog
      (KRAS) wild-type colorectal and head/neck cancers as monitored by measurable disease by
      Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST) criteria.

      II. To measure antibody-dependent cytotoxic activity (ADCC) in patients receiving
      lenalidomide plus cetuximab.

      III. To measure natural killer cell cytokine production in patients receiving lenalidomide
      plus cetuximab.

      IV. To describe fragment c gamma receptor polymorphisms. (Exploratory) V. To describe
      baseline immune cell function. (Exploratory)

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of lenalidomide.

      Patients receive lenalidomide orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-21 and cetuximab
      intravenously (IV) over 1-2 hours on days 1 and 15. Courses repeat every 28 days in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 6 weeks.
