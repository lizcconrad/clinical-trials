    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of a photopneumatic therapy
      for the treatment of acne and concomitant symptoms associated with the disease, including
      erythema.

      The primary aims of the study will be to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of using a
      photopneumatic system for treatment of mild to moderate acne on the face or body - including
      neck, chest, and back - of up to 24 subjects. To support this clinical assessment, the
      affected areas to be treated will be documented at baseline, at each subsequent treatment
      visit (up to 6 treatments), and at one (1) month and three (3) months following final
      treatment.
