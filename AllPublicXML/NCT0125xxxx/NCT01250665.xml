  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a cross sectional study of patients diagnosed with clinically isolated syndrome
      (CIS) and RRMS, who will undergo a series of tests to assess cognitive impairment, fatigue
      severity and depressive symptoms. Cognitive impairment will be assessed with Multiple
      Sclerosis Inventory Cognition (MUSIC) and symbol digit modalities test (SDMT), fatigue
      severity will be measured with the Fatigue Scale for Motor and Cognitive Functions (FSMC) and
      depressive symptoms with the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI). All tests mentioned above are
      validated for MS patients. In the second step we will use our large longitudinal database of
      serial MRI examinations from which a linear measurement of CCI will be retrospectively
      calculated.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Multiple Sclerosis Inventory Cognition (MUSIC)</measure>
    <description>MUSIC is a cognitive screening instrument. It assesses the cognitive core deficit in MS (mental flexibility, attention, information processing speed, memory and inhibitory control) and includes 3 items derived from a factorial analysis to examine cognitive, motor and psychosocial fatigue, respectively.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Annual Corpus Callosum Index decrease</measure>
    <description>Corpus callosum index (CCI) is an easy to use MRI marker for estimating brain atrophy in patients with MS. Demonstrated correlation of CCI and atrophy has been measured with brain parenchymal fraction.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Corpus callosum Index at baseline</measure>
    <description>The CCI at baseline will be measured from MRI findings acquired at diagnosis of clinically isolated syndrome.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Time to clinically definite MS</measure>
    <description>This is the time in months then patients diagnosed with CIS go on to develop clinically definite MS (CDMS). CDMS will be diagnosed if patients fulfill the criteria for remitting relapsing MS according to Poser (Poser 1983) or McDonald (McDonald 2001).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>The Symbol Digit Modalities Test (SDMT)</measure>
    <description>SDMT is an easily administered brief cognitive performance tests. This test emphasizes working memory and speed processing.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Ratio treatment duration to disease duration</measure>
    <description>The ratio of duration of treatment (DT) to duration of disease (DD): DT/DD. Duration of treatment is the cumulative time of treatment with interferon-beta 1b. Duration of disease starts from the first presentation of MS symptoms</description>

    <description>In this study the term clinically isolated syndrome (CIS) is defined according to the Task Force on Differential Diagnosis in MS, as a monophasic presentation of neurological symptoms with suspected underlying inflammatory demyelinating disease (Miller 2008).</description>
