  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      UC San Diego researchers conducted a study to develop and evaluate an internet and text
      message based weight loss study for childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) survivors.
      We hypothesized that those study participants randomized to the intervention will demonstrate
      greater reduction in BMI-z score as compared to the control group.

      The PACE CALL or Fit4Life study, sponsored by the American Cancer Society , was a 4-year
      research project aimed at developing and testing the efficacy of a web &amp; cell phone based
      weight loss program. The purpose of the intervention was to promote weight loss and
      management and improve physical activity, diet and sedentary behaviors among preadolescent
      and adolescent youth (7-18) who are survivors of childhood ALL (defined as being off therapy
      for at least 2 years without disease relapse). Fit4Life was based on and adapted from notable
      prior successful adolescent weight control interventions, and physical activity and diet
      behavioral promotion interventions in the preadolescent and adolescent age group. Particular
      sensitivity to issues experienced by cancer survivors and their families were incorporated
      into this newly developed intervention based on systematic cancer survivor input and feedback
      as well as mentor/collaborator input regarding cancer survivor research.

    <description>Fit4Life intervention activities:
Website: Provides weekly nutrition, physical activity, and weight loss information.
Counseling Calls: Participants and their parents will get phone calls from their Health Coach to assess progress &amp; problems.
Health Coach Question &amp; Answer: Participants will be assigned a Health Coach that they can contact at any time to ask questions or express any concerns.
Text &amp; Picture Messages: Participants will receive daily text messages to help remind them of being healthy. Messages will relate to the weekly topics and general checking in questions.
Parent Materials: Parents will receive a packet of printed materials that relate to parenting skills regarding being a healthy role model for their child and healthy eating and exercise tips.</description>

    <description>The Fit4Life E intervention will be designed to promote weight loss and subsequent weight loss maintenance through the adoption and maintenance of improved eating, physical activity and sedentary behaviors in at risk for overweight and overweight adolescent survivors of ALL and their parent/guardian. the Fit4Life intervention will incorporate elements of the Chronic Care Model, including frequent phone and mail interactions, an initial in-person encounter to provide encouragement and initial patient-tailored counseling for obesity management, family-centered skill development to achieve healthy behavioral modification via goal setting, self-monitoring, and problem solving.
