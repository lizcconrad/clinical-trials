             higher

          -  Has a QoL score of 3 or higher

          -  Has a urine volume of 120mL or greater and a Qmax of below 15mL/sec

          -  Has a PRV of below 100mL

          -  Voluntarily decides to participate in this trial and sign with informed consent form

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Has been administered silodosin

          -  Has been administered an α1A-adrenoceptor blocker within one month

          -  Has been prescribed antiandrogens except 5α-reductase inhibitors within a year

          -  Has had phytotherapy within 3 months

          -  Has had prostatectomy

          -  Has had intrapelvic radiation therapy

          -  Has had transurethral microwave hyperthermia of transurethral needle ablation

          -  Is suspected to have implications that are likely to affect urine passing such as
             neurogenic bladder, bladder calculus or active urinary tract infection (UTI).

          -  Is conducting self-catherterization

          -  Has a renal impairment with a serum creatinine of 2.0mg/dL or greater

          -  Has severe hepatic disorders (hepatic insufficiency, cirrhosis, jaundice, hepatoma) or
             has a total bilirubin of 2.5mg/dl or higher or has AST/ALT 2.5 times higher than the
             normal (upper) level

          -  Has suffered from a severe arrhythmia, cardiac failure, cardiac infarction, unstable
             angina, cerebral infarction within 6 months

          -  Has experienced allergy to α1 receptor blockers

          -  Has orthostatic hypotension around the time of Screening Visit

          -  Has participated in other clinical trials within 8 weeks prior to Screening Visit

          -  Has a Prostate specific antigen(PSA) of higher 10ng/mL or has been diagnosed with
             tumor identified by a biopsy even though he has a PSA of lower 10ng/mL (Patient who
             has been administered 5α-reductase inhibitors for more than 3 months are presumed to
             have 2 times higher than their actual PSA levels)

          -  Has been taking unstable dosing of 5α-reductase inhibitors like finasteride or
             dutasteride for the past 3 months or is expected to change the dosage during the
             trial.
