  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study will be a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, single-center, 2
      treatment,3-way crossover to investigate the pharmacodynamics, i.e. the flush-symptom of a
      single oral repeated dose of 500 mg nicotinic acid in healthy subjects. Subjects will be
      randomly allocated to a treatment sequence - AAB, ABA or BAA. The two treatments will be:

        -  Treatment A: 500 mg nicotinic acid

        -  Treatment B: Placebo

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Body weight between 50 and 90 kg with a body mass index between 19 and &lt;30 kg/m2

          -  No clinically relevant findings in the medical history, laboratory examinations and
             physical examination, especially with regard to cardiovascular system, liver function
             test, bilirubin values and the skin

          -  No clinical relevant pathological findings in electrocardiogram (ECG)

          -  Normal blood pressure (BP, syst. 100 to 140 mmHg, diast. 60 to 90 mmHg) and pulse rate
             (between 50 and 90 beats/min) in sitting position

          -  Voluntarily signed informed consent after full explanation of the study to the
             participant

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Treatment with any other investigational product in the last 60 days before the day of
             randomization into the study

          -  Regular use of medication in the last 60 days before the day of randomization into the
             study except of oral contraceptives in female participants

          -  Treatment in the 60 days before the day of randomization into the study with any drug
             known to have a well-defined potential for toxicity to a major organ, or any substance
             which is known to induce or inhibit hepatic drug metabolism (including general
             anesthetics)

          -  Any drug intake (including over-the-counter remedies) in the 2 weeks before the day of
             randomization into the study, unless the investigator considers a drug intake to be
             clinically irrelevant for the purpose of this study

          -  Any acute or chronic illness or clinically relevant findings in the pre-study
             examination

          -  Presence, history or sequelae of gastrointestinal (e.g. peptic ulcer), liver or kidney

          -  History of allergy or hypersensitivity to other drugs or to food constituents

          -  History of other allergic diseases or hypersensitivity, unless the investigator
             considers it to be clinically irrelevant for the purpose of this study

          -  Blood donation of &gt;400 ml in the 60 days before the day of randomization into the
             study

          -  Smoking

          -  Positive result in urine screen for drugs of abuse or in alcohol breath test
