      ADHD is one of the largest diagnostic groups in psychiatric health care for children and
      adolescents in Norway. In the guidelines laid out by the central authorities, ADHD is to be
      prioritized. As can be seen by the attention this topic is given in the media, good
      diagnostics and treatment for this group are important for society as well as the individuals
      who suffer from this. Early diagnosis, proper organization and appropriate treatment have a
      positive effect on the self-esteem and development of the person diagnosed as well as
      probable socio-economic benefits for society.

      ADHD population shows significant pattern in socio-demographic relations and comorbidity
      according to the population that is referred to community Mental Health Clinic due another
      types of psychiatric conditions.

      In terms of comorbid states ODD and OCD are most associated with ADHD . The study indicates
      prevalence of ADHD children (74%) who met criteria for ADHD, Combined Type (ADHD-C, both
      inattention and hyperactivity-impulsivity symptoms) and the existence of generally low IQ
      measures with mean value of 85 points. In terms of comorbid states generally were found in
      almost whole ADHD group (93 %) compared to half of the non-ADHD group. Disruptive Behaviour
      Disorder, Anxiety /Stress related disorder and Encopresis /Enuresis shows significant
      difference between the groups. Other comorbid conditions show no significant differences.
      Social dysfunctions were found in four of five children.
