  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      HIV is increasing among adolescents and young adults in the US. Antiretroviral medications,
      when taken correctly (≥90% of prescribed doses taken), can vastly improve life expectancy.
      However, adherence among HIV-infected young people is suboptimal, and few interventions are
      available to help adolescents adhere to treatment.

      The first phase of the study is an intervention development phase, which includes conducting
      interviews with 40 HIV-infected youth for input on the adaptation of the approach. The
      information obtained from the qualitative interviews is used to adapt the Life-Steps
      intervention (designed by our group for HIV-infected adults) to be responsive to the needs of
      HIV-infected adolescents, with acceptability of topics and content, and feasibility of
      intervention delivery to be tested in an open pilot trial.

      This phase of the protocol focuses on setting up the infrastructure necessary for conducting
      the study, including hiring and training activities with study staff. This time will be spent
      conducting interviews and using these data to inform the development of the intervention
      protocol and adaptation of all Life-Steps intervention materials, including study assessment
      instruments, for HIV-infected youth.

      The interview is a one-time event and will last for 1.5-2 hours. It has two components: a
      quantitative assessment and a qualitative discussion. After all participants have completed
      the informed consent and assent (if under the age of 18) processes, the research staff will
      administer a brief quantitative assessment that will ask questions related to demographics,
      medication adherence, sexual risk, substance use, and psychosocial condition. The second part
      of the interview will be an open discussion. The interviews will be conducted by a trained
      member of the research staff. The interviews will be informed by a pre-determined qualitative
      topic guide.
