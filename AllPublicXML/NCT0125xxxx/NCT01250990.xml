  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study looks at whether niacin improves reverse cholesterol transport (RCT) in healthy
      volunteers. 3H-Cholesterol will be used to measure RCT by analyzing changes in the tracer
      activity in total plasma, lipoproteins, red blood cells (RBCs) and stool. The hypothesis is
      that niacin augments reverse cholesterol transport.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will use 3H-cholesterol bound to albumin (particulate cholesterol) to assess the
      ability of high density lipoprotein (HDL) to transport cholesterol to the liver to be
      eliminated. This process is called Reverse Cholesterol transport and is one of the main
      mechanisms by which HDL protect against atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. The
      availability of a method to assess RCT is important for the development of new drugs which
      affect RCT and may result in useful treatments for atherosclerosis.

      This study will evaluate the use of radiolabeled particulate cholesterol administered
      intravenously in association with albumin, as a method to study reverse cholesterol transport
      (RCT) in humans before and after treatment by niacin by analyzing changes in the tracer
      activity in total plasma and lipoproteins. The study population is healthy volunteers.

    <measure>Rate of Appearance of 3H Cholesterol in the Total HDL Fraction Before and After 12 Weeks of Treatment With Niacin</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Subjects were injected with a bolus of 3-H cholesterol mixed with human serum albumin as an intravenous bolus. This injected labelled cholesterol is taken up by macrophages. The rate of appearance of labelled cholesterol in plasma HDL- cholesterol is a measure of reverse cholesterol transport. We assessed HDL cholesterol enrichment as percent of injected tritiated tracer appearing in plasma total HDL cholesterol between 60 and 240 minutes post-injection expressed as percent 3-H cholesterol/mol HDL cholesterol/hour. The tracer study was performed at baseline and after 12 weeks of niacin or placebo.</description>

        <title>Rate of Appearance of 3H Cholesterol in the Total HDL Fraction Before and After 12 Weeks of Treatment With Niacin</title>
        <description>Subjects were injected with a bolus of 3-H cholesterol mixed with human serum albumin as an intravenous bolus. This injected labelled cholesterol is taken up by macrophages. The rate of appearance of labelled cholesterol in plasma HDL- cholesterol is a measure of reverse cholesterol transport. We assessed HDL cholesterol enrichment as percent of injected tritiated tracer appearing in plasma total HDL cholesterol between 60 and 240 minutes post-injection expressed as percent 3-H cholesterol/mol HDL cholesterol/hour. The tracer study was performed at baseline and after 12 weeks of niacin or placebo.</description>
