  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Ovulation disorders are a common cause of infertility in women. Most of these women can be
      classified as World Health Organization (WHO) Group II anovulatory patients as they have
      irregular or absent menstrual cycles but normal serum concentrations of follicle stimulation
      hormone (FSH) and estradiol.

      The purpose of this study is to optimize the low-dose-step-up protocol traditionally used for
      ovulation induction with follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) in women with anovulatory
      infertility WHO Group II.

      Previous studies have established that menstrual cycle history, mean ovarian volume and BMI
      are significant predictors of FSH threshold dose in women with anovulatory infertility WHO
      Group II undergoing ovulation induction (Nyboe Andersen et al., 2008). A FSH dosage nomogram
      has been constructed based on these variables.

      The aim of this study is to evaluate the clinical use of the nomogram in order to test the
      use of the variables to determine whether an individualized starting dose of FSH can be used
      for ovulation induction in anovulatory patients.

      It is the hypothesis that an individualized starting dose of gonadotrophin will minimize the
      disadvantages of the treatment and that the stimulation period of the individualized
      nomogram-based treatment will be 25% shorter than observed in the standard protocol.

      The primary endpoint is the proportion of patients who reach the criteria for
      hCG-administration within 14 days of Menopur stimulation. The results of the study will be
      compared with the data obtained in the Menopur Ovulation Induction Trial (Platteau et al.,
      2006).

    <description>The HCG-criteria is defined as:
One follicle with a diameter of &gt;17 mm or two or three follicles &gt; 15 mm (verified by transvaginal ultrasound).
HCG should not be given if there is no response after 35 days or &gt; 4 follicles &gt; 15 mm (unless converted to IVF/ICSI).
If a patient is seen with one to three follicles of 15 - 16 mms HCG can be administered on the same or on the next day due to a presumed growth of follicles of + 2 mm/day.</description>

    <description>The medication used in this study is the follicle-stimulating hormone &quot;highly purified human menopausal gonadotrophin&quot; (HP-HMG), Menopur, (Ferring a/s).
Stimulation with HP-hMG (Menopur) is started on day 2-5 of menstrual bleeding.The HP-hMG starting dose is calculated based on the nomogram predicting the threshold dose. The dose-range is from 75 IU/day to 187.5 IU/day.</description>
