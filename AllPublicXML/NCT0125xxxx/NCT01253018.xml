  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Robotic devices are capable of providing therapy to the arm of patients with weakness due to
      stroke. Robotic therapy improves some aspects of stroke related arm weakness, but the use of
      the weak arm for real life situations often remains limited. The goal of this study is to
      determine the best way to use robotic devices and functional task training to improve the use
      of the stroke affected arm for real life situations. A secondary goal of this study is to
      determine how or if specific areas of the brain are excited before and after training. The
      use of a safe and painless magnetic field directed at the brain called transcranial magnetic
      stimulation (TMS) will be used at set intervals to gain a better understanding of brain
      activity during recovery.

      After obtaining informed consent, participants will undergo 3 sessions of baseline testing
      using upper extremity motor assessments of the shoulder, elbow, wrist, thumb and grip. Upper
      extremity kinematic and strength testing will be performed with the rehabilitation robots in
      measurement mode. The rehabilitation robot modules include the wrist, the planar
      (shoulder-elbow), and alternating wrist and shoulder-elbow robot. These robotic devices are
      cleared for marketing as a registered medical device under U.S. FDA regulations and are
      listed with the FDA both as an evaluation devices and as therapy devices.

      Patients will be randomized to receive 12 weeks of robotic therapy sessions or 12 weeks of
      robot therapy combined with transition to task therapy. Study interventions will occur 3
      times a week for 12 weeks. Robot therapy will consist of a progression through three robot
      modules: wrist, planar, and alternating wrist and shoulder-elbow robot. The progression will
      be sequential with four weeks of training on each robotic device. All participants will
      complete a motor activity log during this intervention phase.

      TMS is being used for physiological measurement and evaluations will be conducted with each
      participant at baseline, week one, week five, eight, and final. TMS will also occur during
      the follow-up on week twenty-four.

      Disability and depression questionnaires, upper extremity measures and evaluations of
      functional performance will be conducted during the study at baseline, and at training
      completion (visit 36). Patients will return twelve weeks after the end of the training period
      to determine whether any observed improvements persist.

    <measure>Fugl-Meyer Motor Upper Extremity Assessment</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 12 week, and 24 week retention</time_frame>
    <description>This is a stroke-specific measure of impairment of the upper extremity that has been shown to be valid and reliable with high inter-rater and test-retest reliability. It provides a direct-observational assessment of volitional movement and motor impairment related to reflexes, sensation, and abnormal synergies. Each item on the FM is rated on a three-point ordinal scale (0 = cannot perform, 1 = performs partially, 2 = performs fully). The scale ranges from 0-66 with higher scores representing less motor impairment.</description>

    <measure>Wolf Motor Function Test (WMFT)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 12 week, and 24 week retention</time_frame>
    <description>The Wolf Motor Function Test (WMFT) examines UE function based on task performance time, quality of movement, and ability to hold a weight. Functional use and speed of movement are based on fifteen timed activities and two strength activities. It has high inter-rater reliability, internal consistency, and test-retest reliability. Timed tasks that cannot be completed default to a time score of 120 seconds. Faster times or a lower score in seconds represent better function. Improvement is represented by a decreased time to complete the tasks therefore a negative change score from baseline to follow-up indicates improvement.</description>

    <measure>Stroke Impact Scale: Hand Subscale</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 12 week and 24 week retention</time_frame>
    <description>The Stroke Impact Scale (SIS) is a self-report structured interview consisting of eight domains designed to assess changes in impairment, disabilities, and handicap following stroke that contribute to quality of life. It has been tested and found to be reliable, valid, and sensitive to change in the stroke population. There are four physical domains that that can be analyzed separately. The hand domain was analyzed for this study and the scores for this domain range from 0-100. Higher scores indicate greater function.</description>

        <description>This is a stroke-specific measure of impairment of the upper extremity that has been shown to be valid and reliable with high inter-rater and test-retest reliability. It provides a direct-observational assessment of volitional movement and motor impairment related to reflexes, sensation, and abnormal synergies. Each item on the FM is rated on a three-point ordinal scale (0 = cannot perform, 1 = performs partially, 2 = performs fully). The scale ranges from 0-66 with higher scores representing less motor impairment.</description>

        <title>Wolf Motor Function Test (WMFT)</title>
        <description>The Wolf Motor Function Test (WMFT) examines UE function based on task performance time, quality of movement, and ability to hold a weight. Functional use and speed of movement are based on fifteen timed activities and two strength activities. It has high inter-rater reliability, internal consistency, and test-retest reliability. Timed tasks that cannot be completed default to a time score of 120 seconds. Faster times or a lower score in seconds represent better function. Improvement is represented by a decreased time to complete the tasks therefore a negative change score from baseline to follow-up indicates improvement.</description>
