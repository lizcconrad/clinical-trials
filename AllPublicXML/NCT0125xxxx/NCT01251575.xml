      This phase II trial studies how well sirolimus, cyclosporine and mycophenolate mofetil works
      in preventing graft-vs-host disease (GVHD) in patients with blood cancer undergoing donor
      peripheral blood stem cell (PBSC) transplant. Giving chemotherapy and total-body irradiation
      before a donor peripheral blood stem cell transplant helps stop the growth of cancer cells.
      It may also stop the patient's immune system from rejecting the donor's stem cells. When the
      healthy stem cells from a donor are infused into the patient they may help the patient's bone
      marrow make stem cells, red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets. Sometimes the
      transplanted cells from a donor can make an immune response against the body's normal cells.
      Giving total-body irradiation together with sirolimus, cyclosporine, and mycophenolate
      mofetil before and after transplant may stop this from happening.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine whether the incidence of acute GVHD grades II-IV can be reduced to less than
      the historical rate of 70% with the triple-immunosuppressant combination of cyclosporine
      (CSP)/mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) with sirolimus in human leukocyte antigens (HLA) class I or
      class II mismatched related or unrelated donor hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) using
      nonmyeloablative conditioning. The evaluation will be carried out separately among class I
      and class II mismatched patients.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the incidence of non-relapse mortality before day 100.

      II. To evaluate the incidences of grades III-IV acute GVHD.

      OUTLINE:

      CONDITIONING: Patients receive fludarabine phosphate intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on
      days -4 to -2. Patients also undergo total-body irradiation on day 0.

      TRANSPLANTATION: Patients undergo allogeneic peripheral blood stem cell transplantation.

      IMMUNOSUPPRESSION: Patients receive sirolimus orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days -3 to 180
      with taper to day 365; cyclosporine PO twice daily (BID) on days -3 to 150 with taper to day
      180; and mycophenolate mofetil PO thrice daily (TID) on days 0-30 and then BID to day 100
      with taper to day 150.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 6 months and every year
      thereafter.

          -  Patients with related or unrelated donors for whom the best available donor is: a)
             mismatched at antigen level for any single class I locus (HLA-A, -B, -C) +/- an
             additional class I mismatch at the allele level OR mismatched at the allele level for

             progression while HLA typing and results of a preliminary search and the donor pool
             suggests that a 10/10 HLA-A, B, C, DRB1 and DQB1 matched donor will not be found; c)
             there is no HLA-A, -B or -C one locus allelic mismatched donor available

          -  DONOR: Related or unrelated volunteer donors who are mismatched with the recipient
             within one of the following limitations:

               -  Mismatch for one HLA class I antigen with or without an additional mismatch for
                  one HLA-class I allele, but matched for HLA-DRB1 and HLA-DQ, OR

               -  HLA class I HLA-A, -B, -C allele matched donors allowing for any one or two DRB1
                  and/or DQB1 antigen allele mismatch

             -C, -DRB1, and -DQB

          -  DONOR: If the patient is homozygous at the mismatch HLA class I locus or II locus, the
             donor must be heterozygous at that locus and one allele must match the patient (i.e.,
             patient is homozygous A*01:01 and donor is heterozygous A*01:01, A*02:01); this
             mismatch will be considered a one-antigen mismatch for rejection only

          -  DONOR: Donors are excluded when preexisting immunoreactivity is identified that would
             jeopardize donor hematopoietic cell engraftment; this determination is based on the
             standard practice of the individual institution; the donor should be excluded if any
             of the flow cytometric B and T cell cytotoxic cross match assays are positive

          -  DONOR: Only filgrastim (G-CSF) mobilized PBSC only will be permitted as a
