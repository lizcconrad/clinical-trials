      The purpose of this study is to determine a safe dose of LY573636-sodium to be given in
      combination with sunitinib to patients with metastatic Renal Cell Carcinoma (RCC) and to
      determine any side effects that may be associated with LY573636-sodium and sunitinib
      combination in this patient population. The tumor response rate will also be assessed.

    <description>Patient specific dose based on height, weight and gender to target a specific exposure range, administered intravenously on day 4 of a 42 day (6 week) cycle.
Dose will be escalated to reach the maximum tolerated dose (MTD). A cohort of patients enrolled after MTD will receive albumin-tailored doses.
Patients may continue on treatment until clinical or objective disease progression.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients must have a histologically confirmed diagnosis of metastatic RCC

          -  Patients must have received no prior treatment with a cytotoxic-based chemotherapy
             regimen

          -  Patients must have measurable disease as defined by the Response Evaluation Criteria
             in Solid Tumors (RECIST) guidelines

          -  Have adequate hematologic, hepatic and renal function

          -  Have a serum albumin level greater than equal to 3.0 g/L

          -  Patients with reproductive potential should use medically approved contraceptive
             precautions during the trial and for 6 months following the last dose of study drug

          -  Exhibit patient compliance and geographic proximity that allow for adequate follow-up

          -  Have given written informed consent approved by Lilly and the ethical review board
             (ERB)/institutional review board (IRB) governing the site

             radiotherapy, cancer-related hormonal therapy, or other investigational therapy, for
             at least 4 weeks (6 weeks for mitomycin-C or nitrosoureas) prior to study enrollment
             and recovered from the acute effects of therapy (except alopecia). Patients who have
             received whole-brain radiation must wait 90 days before starting study therapy

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Have received treatment within the last 30 days with a drug that has not received
             regulatory approval for any indication at the time of study entry

          -  Have received a prior cytotoxic chemotherapy-based systemic therapy for metastatic RCC

          -  Have had any of the following within 12 months prior to study drug administration:

          -  Have uncontrolled hypertension (greater than 150/100 mm Hg despite optimal medical
             therapy), or history of poor compliance with antihypertensive treatment

          -  Patients with documented central nervous system or leptomeningeal metastasis (brain
             metastasis) at the time of study entry. Patients with signs or symptoms of
             neurological compromise should have appropriate radiographic imaging performed before
             study entry

          -  Patients with serious concomitant OR pre-existing disorders, including active
             bacterial, fungal, or viral infection, incompatible with the study (at the discretion
             of the investigator)

          -  Patients receiving warfarin therapy for treatment of venous thrombosis or other
             prothrombotic conditions

          -  Patients with a second primary malignancy that could affect interpretation of the
             results. NOTE: Patients with adequately treated carcinoma of the skin (excluding
             melanoma) and patients with a prior history of malignancy who have been disease-free
             for greater than 2 years are eligible

          -  Patients who have previously completed or withdrawn from this study or any other study
             investigating LY573636

          -  Patients who have previously received sunitinib

          -  Patients who are unable to swallow capsules

          -  Patients who require concomitant use of potent CYP3A4 inducers or inhibitors

          -  Women who are pregnant or lactating
