  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Despite the use of highly effective anti-malarial medications, 10-30% of African children
      with severe malaria will die, underscoring the need for adjunctive therapies that can be
      applied in endemic areas. A clinical trial of adjunctive inhaled nitric oxide (iNO) in severe
      malaria is warranted on the basis of firm proof of concept from animal studies and a human
      study using the NO donor L-arginine, together with evidence of safety from clinical
      experience and trials of iNO for other conditions. Our objective is to determine whether
      supplemental iNO (80 ppm) in addition to Ugandan Standard of Care treatment reduces levels of
      Angiopoietin-2 (Ang-2), a quantitative biomarker of malaria severity, in children with severe
      malaria compared to Standard of Care treatment alone. We will conduct a randomized
      placebo-controlled trial among children 1-10 years of age admitted to Jinja Hospital (Uganda)
      with severe malaria to test the efficacy of inhaled nitric oxide in severe malaria.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Severe malaria remains a major cause of global morbidity and mortality. While the use of
      artemisinin-based antimalarial therapy has improved outcomes in severe malaria, the mortality
      rate remains high. Adjunctive therapies that target the underlying pathophysiology of severe
      malaria may further reduce morbidity and mortality. Endothelial activation plays a central
      role in the pathogenesis of severe malaria, of which the angiogenic factors angiopoietin-1
      (Ang-1) and angiopoietin-2 (Ang-2) have recently been shown to function as key regulators.
      Nitric oxide (NO) is a major inhibitor of Ang-2 release from endothelium and has been shown
      to decrease endothelial inflammation and reduce the adhesion of parasitized erythrocytes.
      Low-flow inhaled nitric oxide gas (iNO) is a US FDA-approved treatment for hypoxic
      respiratory failure in neonates. Based on compelling data on the efficacy of iNO in
      experimental cerebral malaria in animal models, coupled with the documented safety of iNO in
      clinical practice and trials for other diseases, we propose a randomized clinical trial of
      iNO for the adjunctive treatment of severe malaria in Ugandan children.

    <description>Daily Ang-2 measurements over the first 72 hours of hospital admission will be the primary efficacy outcome. Elevated Ang-2 levels are associated with poor clinical outcome in severe malaria and Ang-2 has been used to follow disease progression and recovery in previous studies of malaria. Thus, Ang-2 is an objective, quantitative surrogate marker of disease severity, validated for longitudinal follow-up of patients with malaria.</description>

    <description>Biomarkers and genetic determinants of severe malaria pathogenesis may provide additional insight into the pathways and processes altered in cerebral malaria and affected by iNO delivery. We plan to examine biomarkers of endothelial activation, inflammation including cytokines, and coagulopathy which are central to the pathophysiology of severe malaria. In addition, genetic pathways involved in severe malaria and response to iNO will be investigated.</description>
