  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Subjects will be randomly assigned to 1 of 2 groups to receive the following vaccines: Group
      1: 7-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (7vPnC) and diphtheria, tetanus, and accelular
      pertussis vaccine (DTaP), Group 2: DTaP alone. Group 2 subjects will also receive catch-up
      doses of 7vPnC. The study vaccines will be open-label. The main purpose of the study is to
      demonstrate that the immune responses as measured by serum antibody responses to diphtheria
      toxin, tetanus toxin, pertussis toxin (PT) and filamentous haemagglutinin (FHA) induced by
      DTaP given concomitantly with 7vPnC are comparable to the immune responses induced by DTaP
      given alone. In addition, the study aims to evaluate the side effects (safety profile) after
      vaccination of 7vPnC when given with DTaP in healthy Japanese infants.

        <description>Local reactions were reported using an electronic diary. Tenderness was scaled as Any (tenderness present); Significant (present and interfered with limb movement). Erythema and induration were scaled as Any (erythema and induration present); Mild (0.5 to 2.0 centimeters [cm]); Moderate (2.5 to 7.0 cm); Severe (&gt; 7.0 cm). Participants may be represented in more than 1 category. Injection site being evaluated for local reactions was catch-up 7vPnC injection site in the DTaP (Catch-up 7vPnC) group.</description>
