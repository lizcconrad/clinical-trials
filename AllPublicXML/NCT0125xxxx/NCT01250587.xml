  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine a safe and effective dose range for intravenous
      administration (infusion) of PDC31 by determining the maximum tolerated dose of PDC31 in
      patients with primary dysmenorrhea.

    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, multi-centre, dose-escalating first-in-human Phase I study of PDC31 in
      patients with primary dysmenorrhea aimed at determining the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of
      PDC31 in this patient population.
