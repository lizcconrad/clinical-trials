  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this clinical research study is to learn if the study drug, Pasireotide LAR can
      shrink or slow the growth of Metastatic Neuroendocrine Carcinomas. The safety of this drug
      will also be studied. The patient's physical state, changes in the size of the tumor, and
      laboratory findings taken while on-study will help us decide if Pasireotide LAR is safe and
      effective.

      This is a multi-institutional, prospective phase II open-label trial.

      The investigational drug used in this study is pasireotide LAR 60mg. Pasireotide will be
      administered as an intramuscular injection at the beginning of every cycle which is defined
      as 28 days (+/- 3 days). Study treatment should begin within 14 days following enrollment
      into the study and continue until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or withdrawal
      of consent. Safety and efficacy will be assessed throughout the treatment period.

    <description>Complete response (CR): complete disappearance of all target lesions, confirmed by repeat assessments at no less than 4 weeks after the criteria for response are first met. Partial response (PR): at least a 30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum longest diameter. This must be confirmed by repeat assessment at no less than 4 weeks after the criteria for response are first met. Stable Disease (SD): neither sufficient decrease to qualify for partial response nor sufficient increase to qualify for progressive disease, taking as reference the smallest sum longest diameter since the treatment started.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Locally unresectable or metastatic carcinoid or pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors

          -  Tumors must be considered well or moderately differentiated (or low to intermediate
             grade). Patients with poorly differentiated neuroendocrine carcinomas or small cell
             carcinomas are excluded from the study.

          -  No prior systemic antineoplastic neuroendocrine tumor treatment (including prior
             somatostatin analogs). However patients who have received a short course of
             subcutaneous (SQ) octreotide (&lt;10 days) in the past are eligible if &gt; 1 week has
             elapsed from their last octreotide injection.

          -  Minimum of four weeks since any major surgery

          -  Measureable disease by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST)

             transaminases (&lt; 3 x ULN) if the patient has liver metastases
