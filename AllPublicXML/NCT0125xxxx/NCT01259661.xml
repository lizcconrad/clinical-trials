  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hormonal changes associated with menopause, chronological aging, and lifestyle, especially
      physical inactivity, may increase the risk of metabolic syndrome in postmenopausal women.
      Women exhibiting &quot;the metabolic syndrome&quot; have multiple coronary artery disease risk factors,
      including insulin resistance, hyperlipidemia, and hypertension. This study will be conducted
      to test the hypotheses: (1) physical activity and physical fitness levels may have effects on
      individual risk factors of the metabolic syndrome in postmenopausal women; (2) endurance
      exercise training may have a favorable effect on components of the metabolic risk variables
      in these women.

      In this study, the associations among physical activity (including daily energy expenditure
      and energy expenditure from moderate to vigorous activity), cardiopulmonary fitness level,
      and metabolic risk profile of the women will be assessed. The investigators will perform a
      randomized trial to compare the effects of moderate-intensity aerobic exercise training
      regimens on metabolic risk factors. Postmenopausal women who exhibit at least one risk factor
      for metabolic syndrome will be randomized in the exercise group or control groups. Metabolic
      risk factors (e.g., body mass index, waist-to-hip ratio, glucose, insulin, blood pressure,
      lipid profile and adiponectin level) will be measured at baseline, and 12 weeks of the study.
      Differences from baseline to follow-up will be calculated and compared across groups.

      Results of this study may help health care providers providing advice to postmenopausal women
      for life style changes to reduce risk of insulin resistance, coronary heart disease, and
      diabetes.

    <description>In our longitudinal intervention study, all eligible subjects will undergo a physical examination by a physician to rule out obvious secondary causes of hypertension and contraindications to exercise. Randomization will be performed by random member generation. The exercise participants will attend three sessions per week at the facility during the study period. Training intensity is initially set at heart rate equivalent to 60% and progress to 80% of each subject's maximal heart rate reserve for 30 min/day with a frequency of 3 days/wk. Facility-based exercise sessions will consist of treadmill walking.</description>
