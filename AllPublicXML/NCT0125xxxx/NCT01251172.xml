      This phase II clinical trial is studying how well gamma-secretase/Notch signalling pathway
      inhibitor RO4929097 (RO4929097) after autologous stem cell transplant works in treating
      patients with multiple myeloma. Giving chemotherapy, such as melphalan, before autologous
      stem cell transplant stops the growth of cancer cells by stopping them from dividing or
      killing them. Before treatment, stem cells are collected from the patient's blood and stored.
      After chemotherapy, the stem cells are returned to the patient to replace the blood-forming
      cells that were destroyed by the chemotherapy. RO4929097 may stop the growth of cancer cells
      by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Giving RO4929097 after autologous
      stem cell transplant may kill more cancer cells.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the efficacy of RO4929097 in eradicating residual/persistent disease
      (conversion of VGPR to CR or sCR status) in multiple myeloma patients status post single
      high-dose melphalan/autologous stem cell rescue with residual/persistent disease
      post-transplant.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the safety of single agent RO4929097 post-autologous stem cell transplant in
      multiple myeloma patients.

      II. To analyze Notch receptor and ligand protein expression in pre-transplant, pre-treatment
      with RO4929097, and post-treatment bone marrow biopsy samples.

      III. To isolate and identify clonogenic multiple myeloma progenitor cells from bone marrow
      aspirate and/or peripheral blood at the following time points: pre-transplant, day 100
      post-transplant, and post-treatment staging bone marrow biopsy.

      IV. To analyze Notch receptor and ligand protein expression on isolated clonogenic progenitor
      myeloma cells.

      V. To characterize the tumor xenograft-initiating potential of clonogenic myeloma cells in
      adult Casper zebrafish and SCID-hu model and evaluate the drug toxicity and therapeutic
      potential of RO4929097 with this model.

      VI. To analyze anti-angiogenic effects of RO4929097 as measured by reduction in microvessel
      density and VEGFR-1 expression in pre-treatment and post-treatment bone marrow biopsy
      samples.

      VII. To determine whether measurement of soluble surrogate markers of angiogenesis prior to
      and following treatment with RO4929097 provide an early marker of disease response to Notch
      inhibition.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      STEM CELL TRANSPLANTATION AND CHEMOTHERAPY: Patients undergo standard mobilization and
      collection of autologous peripheral stem cells (&gt;= 4.0 x 10^6 CD34+ cells/kg). Patients then
      receive high-dose melphalan IV on days -3 and -2 and undergo autologous stem cell transfusion
      on day 0. Patients with progressive disease, stable disease, partial response, stringent
      complete response, or complete response are taken off study; patients with
      residual/persistent disease (very good partial response [VGPR]*) continue to therapeutic
      treatment.

      NOTE: *Patients who meet the criteria for VGPR but have findings of abnormal bone marrow
      cytogenetic study demonstrating &gt;= 10% metaphase cells positive for either high-risk
      chromosomal abnormalities or persistent disease-related chromosomal abnormalities (e.g.,
      chromosome del 13; del17p, t(4;14), t(14;16), t(6;14) or complex cytogenetics) will have a
      repeat bone marrow biopsy assessment with cytogenetics within 2-3 weeks. If the repeat biopsy
      findings suggest persistent high-risk cytogenetic findings, then the patient is considered
      eligible to receive RO4929097 to eradicate residual disease.

      THERAPEUTIC TREATMENT: Beginning 100-110 days after transplantation, patients receive oral
      RO4929097 once daily on days 1-3, 8-10, and 15-17. Courses repeat every 21 days in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for at least 4 weeks.
