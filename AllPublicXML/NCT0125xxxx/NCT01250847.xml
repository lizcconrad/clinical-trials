    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to assess the effects of 'Seroquel-XR' on the verbal
      learning ability in people with at-risk mental state (ARMS) over a 12 week period. The verbal
      learning ability will be indexed by delayed free recall score of CVLT(California Verbal
      learning Test), a standard neuropsychological verbal memory tests.

      The secondary objective is to assess the effects of 'Seroquel-XR' on other cognitive function
      and psychiatric symptoms including psychotic, anhedonic symptoms, and impulsivity. The
      cognitive function abilities will be measured by standard neuropsychological tests as
      follows;

        -  Working memory: verbal &amp; spatial 2-back test

        -  Attention: Digit Span, 3-7 CPT(Continuous Performance Test)

        -  Executive function: WCST (Wisconsin Card Sorting Test)

        -  Visuo-spatial ability: Rey Complex Figure Task copy

        -  Visuomotor speed and planning: Trail making test A &amp; B

        -  Verbal fluency: Controlled Oral Word Association Test(COWAT) The scales of psychiatric
           symptoms which will be used are as follows;

        -  Psychotic symptoms: Scales of Prodromal scales (SOPS), Positive and negative syndrome
           scale (PANSS)

        -  Anhedonia: Social Anhedonia Scale (SAS), Physical Anhedonia Scale (PAS)

        -  Social cognition: Ambiguous Intention Hostility Questionnaire (AIHQ)

        -  Impulsivity: Barrett Impulsivity Scale (BIS)
