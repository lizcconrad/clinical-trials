    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine which group exercise one should choose when hip
      osteoarthritis patients have undergone hip replacement surgery. To determine this, we want to
      answer the following research question:

      Are there differences in function and muscle strength in osteoarthritis patients who conduct
      group training either on land or in water in the rehabilitation phase following hip
      replacement surgery?

    <description>Each session lasts 50 minutes and consists of warm-up, mobility training, strength training, balance training and endurance training. Mobility training is conducted to increase range of motion in the operated hip, strength exercises are conducted to strengthen muscles around the operated hip, balance training are conducted to improve stability around the operated hip and endurance training are conducted to increase patients' physical capacity. This is in line with current guidelines for the exercise of osteoarthritis patients.</description>
