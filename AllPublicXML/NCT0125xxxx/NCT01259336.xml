      The purpose of this study is to determine whether there itraconazole is effective in the
      treatment of chronic cavitary pulmonary aspergillosis

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The role of itraconazole is still not clear in the treatment of chronic cavitary pulmonary
      aspergillosis(CCPA). Some studies have shown a beneficial role of itraconazole in reducing
      hemoptysis. So the present study is aimed at analyzing the role of itraconazole in CCPA.

    <measure>clinical improvement in cough and hemoptysis</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Clinical response- assessed by a decrease in frequency &amp; intensity of hemoptysis &amp; cough. Significant clinical response will be considered if there is no recurrence of episodes of moderate-massive hemoptysis. Number of interventions required to control hemoptysis will also be taken as a measure of clinical response</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Radiological response of CCPA to itraconazole</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Complete response- It is defined as complete disappearance of the aspergilloma.
Partial response- It is defined as 30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameters of all the lesions.
Progressive disease- It is defined as appearance of any new lesions or &gt;20% increase in the sum of the longest diameters of all measurable lesions.
Stable disease- Shrinkage or growth of CCPA that does not meet any of these criteria</description>

        1. Inclusion Criteria:

               1. Clinical symptoms: -presence of chronic pulmonary/systemic symptoms lasting â‰¥ six
                  weeks.

               2. Radiological findings:

                    -  Evidence of slowly progressive pulmonary lesions over weeks-months including
                       cavities with surrounding inflammation.

                    -  presence of intracavitary mass with a surrounding crescent of air,and
                       presence of pleural thickening in peripheral lesions.

               3. Microbiological/Immunological findings: Positive results in the aspergillus
                  precipitin test, demonstration of aspergillus hyphae in sputum or BAL fluid or
                  cultures of BAL/sputum growing aspergillus species.

          2. The diagnosis of CCPA will be made if

               1. Patient satisfies at least 1, 2a or 2b and/ or any of the 3rd criteria.
