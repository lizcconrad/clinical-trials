    <measure>Dose-Normalized Area Under the Concentration-time Curve From Time 0 to 12 Hours (AUC0-12h) at Steady State</measure>
    <time_frame>Days 14 and 28: Predose and at 0.5, 1, 1.5, 1.75, 2, 3, 4, 8 and 12 hours after dosing.</time_frame>
    <description>Dose-normalized area under the concentration-time curve from time 0 to 12 hours (AUC0-12h) at steady state after 14 days of treatment with each study drug.
Geometric mean and 95% confidence intervals were determined from an analysis of variance (ANOVA) model for the dose-normalized log transformed values with treatment, period and sequence as fixed factors and patients nested within sequences as a random factor.</description>

    <description>Maximum (peak) plasma drug concentration after drug administration at steady state (after 14 days of treatment with each study drug).

    <measure>Intra-patient Variability of Tacrolimus Pharmacokinetic Parameters</measure>
    <time_frame>Days 7 and 14, and Days 21 and 28.</time_frame>
    <description>The intra-patient variability of tacrolimus pharmacokinetics of each formulation was evaluated by comparing AUC0-12h, maximum drug concentration (Cmax) and trough drug concentration (C0) at Days 7 and 14, and Days 21 and 28. Intra-patient variability was assessed by a calculation of the coefficient of variation, by patient, using the repeated measurements within each Period, where the coefficient of variation (%) = standard deviation/mean*100.</description>

    <measure>Trough Plasma Drug Concentration (C0) at Steady State</measure>

    <measure>Number of Participants With Adverse Events (AE) and Serious Adverse Events (SAE)</measure>
    <time_frame>28 Days</time_frame>
    <description>An AE was defined as the appearance or worsening of any undesirable sign, symptom, or medical condition occurring after starting the study drug even if the event was not considered to be related to study drug. An SAE was an event which: was fatal or life-threatening; resulted in persistent or significant disability/incapacity; constituted a congenital anomaly/birth defect; required or prolonged inpatient hospitalization; was medically significant, i.e., an event that jeopardized the patient or required medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above.</description>
