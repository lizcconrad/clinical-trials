  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess whether it is possible and acceptable to monitor
      patients at a distance who experience a condition called atrial fibrillation after their
      cancer surgery. Some patients have no other clinical reason for staying in the hospital after
      cancer surgery except in order to control their heart rhythm. Being able to send these
      patients home earlier and monitor them at a distance from their home can be good for their
      quick recovery. Studies have shown greater quality of life and patient satisfaction when
      patients are monitored at a distance for conditions like atrial fibrillation, however cancer
      patients have not been studied.

    <description>This small study aims to assess the feasibility and acceptance of remote cardiac monitoring of postoperative cancer patients experiencing atrial fibrillation and will collect continuous data on heart beat over a period of 4-6 weeks upon discharge.</description>

    <intervention_name>questionnaire about the use of ECG device</intervention_name>
    <description>Patients will be fitted with a continuous ECG monitor and blood pressure device. Data on every heart beat, including episodes of atrial fibrillation, for 4-6 weeks of continuous monitoring will be collected and transmitted wirelessly. Based on this information and blood pressure readings performed by patients in their home setting, clinicians can adjust oral coagulant dosage. Participants will attend 2 follow-up outpatient visits at the MSKCC outpatient cardiology practice upon the cardiologist's recommendation. Upon completion of the study, 4-6 weeks, a questionnaire will be sent via mail, including a pre-paid envelope, to participants to assess feasibility, acceptance, and overall experience with remote cardiac monitoring.</description>

        Two cardiology attending physicians, Dr. Michelle Johnson and Dr. Carol L. Chen, who are
        members of this research team, will identify post-operative patients whose primary
        attending has made a decision to discharge.
