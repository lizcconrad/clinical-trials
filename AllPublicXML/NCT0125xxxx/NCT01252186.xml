    <measure>Change From Baseline to End of Month 6 in Activated Partial Thromboplastin Time (APTT) Based Activated Protein-C Resistance (APC)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to Month 6</time_frame>
    <description>The APC resistance assay is a clotting test that measures the ratio of APTT clotting times in the presence and absence of a standard amount of exogenous APC. APC resistance is calculated as the ratio of the clotting time after APC addition over the clotting time with no APC addition.
APC resistance is defined as a poor anticoagulant response of plasma to APC (minimal prolongation of the APTT) and a correspondingly low ratio.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline to End of Month 6 in Endogenous Thrombin Potential (EPT) Based Activated Protein-C Resistance (APC)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to Month 6</time_frame>
    <description>This assay is based on measurement of the effect of activated protein C on the endogenous thrombin potential, the time integral of thrombin generation initiated in plasma through the extrinsic coagulation pathway.
The APC resistance assay measures the ratio of endogenous thrombin potential in the presence and absence of a standard amount of exogenous APC.
APC resistance is calculated as the ratio of EPT after APC addition over the EPT with no APC addition.
APC resistance is defined as a poor anticoagulant response of plasma to APC (less inhibition of thrombin formation) and a correspondingly higher ratio.</description>

        <description>The APC resistance assay is a clotting test that measures the ratio of APTT clotting times in the presence and absence of a standard amount of exogenous APC. APC resistance is calculated as the ratio of the clotting time after APC addition over the clotting time with no APC addition.
APC resistance is defined as a poor anticoagulant response of plasma to APC (minimal prolongation of the APTT) and a correspondingly low ratio.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline to End of Month 6 in Endogenous Thrombin Potential (EPT) Based Activated Protein-C Resistance (APC)</title>
        <description>This assay is based on measurement of the effect of activated protein C on the endogenous thrombin potential, the time integral of thrombin generation initiated in plasma through the extrinsic coagulation pathway.
The APC resistance assay measures the ratio of endogenous thrombin potential in the presence and absence of a standard amount of exogenous APC.
APC resistance is calculated as the ratio of EPT after APC addition over the EPT with no APC addition.
APC resistance is defined as a poor anticoagulant response of plasma to APC (less inhibition of thrombin formation) and a correspondingly higher ratio.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline to End of Month 6 in Free Protein S</title>
        <description>Protein S helps to regulate blood clot formation. Protein S exists in two forms: a free form and a complex form. Free protein S combines with Protein C to degrade coagulation factors VIIIa and Va, slowing down the generation of new thrombin and inhibiting further clotting.
Results are reported as a percent of the amount expected in normal plasma. By definition, the mean value in normal plasma is 100%. The reference range is approximately 70% to 140%; lower for women than for men.</description>
