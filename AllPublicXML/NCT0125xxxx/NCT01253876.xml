  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Soymilk components such as isoflavones, essential fatty acids, phytoesterols, good fats,
      inositols might have beneficial effects on weight control and blood pressure management. Most
      studies in this regard have been conducted on postmenopausal or premenopausal women and there
      are few studies on female youths. Therefore, we are going to determine the effects of soy
      consumption on the weight, waist circumference and blood pressure in overweight and obese
      female youths. This was a cross-over randomized clinical trial which was conducted in 2010 in
      Isfahan on overweight or obese young female youths. After three weeks run-in, females were
      randomly assigned to consume a diet containing caw's milk or a diet in which only one glass
      of soy milk was substituted; each one for six weeks. Random sequencing generated in SPSS was
      used for allocating females in different group randomly. Patients were not blinded because
      they had to use soy milk in one period of trial and use caw's milk in another period.
