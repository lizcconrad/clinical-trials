    <textblock>
      The purpose of the protocol is to determine the effect of BN83495 on the progression of
      endometrial cancer with estrogen receptor in post menopausal women who had previously
      received chemotherapy.

    The futility analysis of study NCT00910091 in patients with endometrial cancer shows that the

    <measure>Determination of Clinical Benefit (CB), Defined as Sum of Patients Who Present Complete Response (CR), Partial Response (PR) or Stable Disease (SD) ≥12 Weeks (CB=CR+PR+SD≥12 Weeks) Using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST Version1.1)</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>CR defined as: Disappearance of all target lesions. Any pathological lymph nodes (whether target or non-target) must have reduction in short axis to &lt;10 mm.
PR defined as: At least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum diameters.
SD defined as: Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for Progressive Disease (PD), taking as reference the smallest sum diameters while on study.
PD defined as: At least a 20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum on study (this includes the baseline sum if that is the smallest on study). In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum must also demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 5 mm. (Note: the appearance of one or more new lesions is also considered progression).</description>

        <description>CR defined as: Disappearance of all target lesions. Any pathological lymph nodes (whether target or non-target) must have reduction in short axis to &lt;10 mm.
PR defined as: At least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum diameters.
SD defined as: Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for Progressive Disease (PD), taking as reference the smallest sum diameters while on study.
PD defined as: At least a 20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum on study (this includes the baseline sum if that is the smallest on study). In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum must also demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 5 mm.
