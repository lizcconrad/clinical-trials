      Tuberculous paradoxical reactions (PR) are immune reactions occurring during the course of
      antituberculous treatment and leading to a worsening of tuberculous symptoms after an initial
      improvement. This phenomenon has very extensively studied in HIV infected patients where it
      corresponds to the so called IRIS (immune reconstitution syndrome). However, it laso occurs
      in non immuno-compromized patients, especially those with extra-pulmonary localization of
      tuberculosis. The aim of the study is to look for risk factors of paradoxical reaction in non
      immuno-compromized patients with extra-pulmonary tuberculosis. The investigators will
      consider clinical, radiological and biological variables, including specific immune and
      genetic markers. Our secondary goals are to estimate the incidence of PR, describe their
      natural history; characterize the type of immune response they correspond to, and look for
      better diagnostic tools.The immunological characterization and the finding of predictive
      factors of PR, especially the genetic ones will allow a better understanding of biological
      mechanisms that lead to their occurrence during extra-pulmonary tuberculosis treatment. The
      establishment of predictive criteria could permit a better surveillance of at risk patients
      for a rapid treatment, or even a prevention of PR. The establishment of new diagnostic
      criteria at the time of PR could avoid numerous invasive diagnostic procedures, surgery
      and/or useless prolongation of antibiotic treatment.

      Primary objective :

      Search for predictive factors of tuberculous paradoxical reaction (PR), with assessment of
      clinical, radiological and biological factors.

      Secondary objectives :

        -  Descriptive study of PR : incidence, clinical and radiological presentation, clinical
           course ; characterization of mycobacteria strains- Search for genetic predictive factors
           of PR

        -  Characterization of the specific immune antigene response during PR et analysis of
           different cell subsets implicated in peripheral blood and locally- Characterization of
           the anti-bacterial immune response before and after antituberculous treatment

        -  Preliminary search for new diagnosis criteria including clinical, biological (immune and
           genetic) and radiological factors.Methodology : Multicentric cohort study for a total of
           5 years (4 years of enrolment and one year of follow-up, with biological collection for
           scientific purpose

      Inclusion Status of patients (determined by a validation comity at M6)

        -  PR+ : PR with clinical symptoms

        -  rPR : pure radiological PR

        -  PR- : absence of RP after 6 months of treatment Development of the study

      Primary outcome :

      - Association between PR+ occurrence and clinical, biological and radiological factors
      harvested at the diagnosis of tuberculosis..

      Secondary outcomes :

        -  Association between PR+ and rPR

        -  occurrence and the above quoted factors.- Descriptive study : clinical, biological, and
           radiological presentation of PR+ and rPR, characterization of isolated BK strains in PR+
           patients

        -  Immunological study in 20 PR+ patients and 20 RP- : 20 patients per group will allow a
           80% power to detect, by means of bilateral Mann-Whitney test with alpha=5%, any
           difference in the count of specific cells corresponding to at least one standard
           deviation of the primary immunological outcome

        -  controls: variation between tuberculosis diagnostic and either PR time or M2 (in absence
           of PR), of the specific cells, macrophages, dendritic cells, gamma-delta lymphocytes, NK
           et CD4 cells counts

        -  Preliminary search for diagnostic criteria that can be used at the time of PR
           occurrence: variation between D0 and the PR of clinical, biological, radiological
           immunological et genomic of PR+ patients.

        -  Evolution specific and non specific immune response of mycobacterial antigen at
           tuberculosis diagnosis during tuberculosis treatment and after. Sample size calculation

        -  prognostic study : Patients will be recruited and followed until the achievement of a 20
           PR+ sample. The investigators will have to analyze 200 patients.
