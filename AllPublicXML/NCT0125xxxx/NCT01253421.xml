  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effects of a single low dose of the D2/D3
      antagonist amisulpride on reward processing. More generally, this study will test the role of
      dopamine (a naturally occurring brain chemical) in depression.

      Hypotheses:

      Administration of a single low dose of the D2/D3 antagonist amisulpride will (1) improve
      performance in a behavioral task assessing learning from feedback and (2) boost activation in
      reward-related brain regions.

      Through an integration of a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) approach coupled
      with a pharmacological challenge, the goal of the current study will be to investigate the
      role of dopamine in MDD. Participants in this research will include 36 MDD subjects and 36
      demographically matched healthy participants recruited from the community by Dr. Pizzagalli's
      laboratory at McLean Hospital's Center for Depression, Anxiety and Stress Research. This
      study will include two sessions:

        -  The first session will involve a diagnostic interview, and a series of questionnaires
           and assessments.

        -  The second session will take place at the McLean Hospital's Neuroimaging Center, and
           include the administration of a low-dose of amisulpride (50 mg capsule) or placebo,
           followed by an fMRI brain scan and administration of two behavioral tasks.

The study was advertised using flyers, and on a number of internet bulletin boards available to the general public. Study visits were conducted in research facilities at McLean Hospital.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>An assessment visit was conducted prior to the drug-challenge visit. Subjects had a diagnostic interview (SCID) and preliminary physical exam, provided a blood sample for lab tests, and completed surveys, to determine eligibility.
