  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The rationale of the present clinical trial is to study whether an invasive strategy in
      clinical stable patients over 80 years with NSTEMI/UAP may improve rates of death,
      reinfarction, stroke, need of urgent revascularisation, myocardial function and quality of
      life. The invasive approach involves coronary angiography with immediate evaluation for three
      different treatment options; 1. Percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), 2. Coronary artery
      bypass graft (CABG) or 3. medical treatment. Clinical practice shows that older patients are
      commonly treated less vigorously than younger patients and the present guidelines are based
      on a considerably younger population.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Age ≥ 80 years.

          -  Acute coronary syndrome (NSTEMI/UAP) with chest pain &gt; 10 minutes, with or without
             ST-segment depression in ECG, and normal or elevated levels of troponin T or I.
             Elevated troponin levels are defined as values exceeding the 99 percentile of a normal
             population at the local laboratory at each participating site.

          -  Clinical stable

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Age &lt; 80 years.

          -  ST-segment elevation in ECG (STEMI)

          -  Clinical unstable with ongoing chest pain or other ischaemic symptoms/signs.

          -  Cardiogenic shock.

          -  Short life expectancy due to extra cardiac reason, ie. COPD, disseminated malignant
             disease, or other reason.

          -  Anamnestic indications for significant mental disorder, including dementia.

          -  Any condition which interferes with patients possibility to comply with protocol.
