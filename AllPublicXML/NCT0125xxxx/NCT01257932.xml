  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators have developed imaging protocols to monitor and predict breast cancer
      response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy, both prior to and as early as possible during the
      course of treatment.

      The efficacy and practicality of conventional imaging approaches in the neoadjuvant
      chemotherapy setting varies and identifies the need for alternate functional imaging
      strategies. Diffuse optical spectroscopic imaging is an experimental imaging method that
      allows patients to be followed from baseline through treatment and surgery with a
      cost-effective, bedside, handheld scanning probe. The researcher evaluates a harmonized
      diffuse optical spectroscopic imaging technology platform that has been standardized for
      neoadjuvant chemotherapy monitoring. Diffuse optical spectroscopic imaging is an academic
      research platform that is non-invasive. Studies will be performed in five clinical sites on
      approximately 60 neoadjuvant chemotherapy patients.

    <textblock>
      The investigators are testing the effectiveness of an experimental imaging technology known
      as Diffuse Optical Spectroscopy Imaging in predicting the success of chemotherapy treatment
      (shrinkage of tumor).

      Diffuse optical spectroscopic imaging measurements are made with a laser breast scanner. This
      bedside-capable system combines frequency-domain photon migration with steady-state tissue
      spectroscopy to measure complete(broadband) near-infrared absorption and reduced scattering
      spectra of breast tissue in vivo. Diffuse Optical Spectroscopy Imaging measurements are made
      by placing the hand-held probe on the tissue surface and moving the probe to discrete
      locations along a grid pattern at 1.0 cm intervals. The portable high-bandwidth
      Frequency-Domain Photon Migration instrument employs intensity-modulated diode lasers and
      conventional steady-state lamps as sources and an avalanche photodiode as the detector. The
      time required to perform an Frequency-Domain Photon Migration measurement depends on the
      desired precision and number of sweeps.
