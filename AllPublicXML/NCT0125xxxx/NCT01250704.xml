    <textblock>
      Neuromyotonia (NMT), so called Isaac's syndrome, is a rare disorder in which
      hyperexcitability of peripheral motor nerves leads to intermittent muscle contractions. It is
      characterized by muscle twitching at rest (visible myokymia), cramps, hyperhidrosis,
      paraesthesiae, mild muscle weakness. and impaired muscle relaxation, or pseudomyotonia.
      Electromyographic recording is a key diagnostic tool in detecting myokymia and neuromyotonia.
      Pathophysiology of neuromyotonia is claimed to be related immune disorder, autoimmune
      anti-voltage-gated potassium-channel antibodies and genetic mutation in potassium channel.
      KCNA1 (Kv1.1) mutation was mostly reported in a autosomal dominant trait. In the present
      study, we report a family affected with myokymiaï¼Œworsening with elevated body temperature,
      febrile illness or spicy food. How the change in temperature influence clinical features of
      channelopathies is an interesting topic. Variant clinical severity of family members are
      recorded. The index patient has possible autoimmune mechanism involvement because of his
      clinical feature of myasthenia gravis with thymoma and hyperthyroidism. Further analyzing the
      genetic mutation in potassium channelopathy may provide researchers some pathophysiological
      insight into the Isaac's syndrome.

      Genomic DNA was extracted from each patient's peripheral blood leukocytes using Genomaker DNA
      extraction kit (Blossom, Taipei, Taiwan). The complete KCNA1 coding region, including the
      intron/exon boundaries, was amplified according to the procedure reported by Imbrici et al
