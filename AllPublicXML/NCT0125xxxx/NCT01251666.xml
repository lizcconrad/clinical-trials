  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Colorectal cancer screening by faecal occult blood test (FOBT) is a high public health
      priority. The interest of guaiac tests (G-FOBT) is limited by their poor sensitivity, while
      the superiority of I-FOBT in comparison with G-FOBT is now established. Nevertheless
      automated quantitative I-FOBTs have not been compared, and the optimal number of samples and
      threshold is not yet fixed. The aim of this study is to compare the performances of the 2
      more well-known I-FOBTs with automated analyzers (magstream by Fujirebio, and OC Sensor by
      Eiken) for different positivity thresholds and numbers of samples in general average risk
      population. Patients will performed a two samples Magstream, a two samples OC Sensor and
      Hemoccult II. In case of a positive test, a colonoscopy will be performed. Sensitivity and
      specificity for detection of cancer and advanced neoplasias will be compared between tests
      using ratio of sensitivities (RSN) and ratio of false positives (RFP) according to number of
      samples and positivity threshold.

    <description>Advanced neoplasias included invasive cancers and high-risk adenomas (larger than 1 cm or with high grade dysplasia).
RSN is the ratio of the true positives of two tests. True positives for one test are patients positive for the test, with targeted lesion (here advanced neoplasias).
RSN will be calculed between immunochemical tests, and for each immunochemical test in reference to gaiac test.</description>

    <description>Each patient will perform all three tests:
Magstream: 2 samples (each on a different stool)
OC Sensor: 2 samples (each on a different stool)
Hemoccult II: 6 samples (2 samples per stool, on 3 different stools)
Each test will be considered as positive if at least one sample is positive (cutoff for Magstream 55 ng/ml and for OC Sensor 150 ng/ml).
Screening will be considered as positive if at least one of the three tests is positive, leading to a colonoscopy</description>
