  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Annual incidence of severe traumatic brain injuries (TBI) varies from 180 to 300 out of
      100.000. Mortality or severe sequelae risk is increased 8 fold after a TBI. Studies in adults
      showed an ante-hypophyseal deficit in 28 to 68 % of patients with a TBI. The most common
      deficit is Growth Hormone Deficit (GHD); followed by gonadotropic and corticotropic
      (AdrenoCorticoTropic Hormone (ACTH)) insufficiencies. Thyrotropic deficits
      (Thyroid-Stimulating Hormone (TSH)) are less frequent. From a pathophysiological point of
      view, the lesional mechanism responsible for hypopituitarisms would be a damage of
      hypophyseal vessels or hypothalamic-pituitary vessels. The frequency of pituitary deficits
      and the potential beneficial effects of replacement therapy on quality of life, tiredness,
      loss of energy and productivity, justify the systematic detection of the deficits in patients
      with moderate to severe TBI.

      Study hypotheses :

      At the present time, the lack of data in children does not give us the opportunity to affirm
      that one part of the symptoms showed by children with post-TBI neuropsychological sequelae,
      are linked to pituitary deficiency and that they can be improved with a replacement therapy.

      Firstly, it is essential to better understand the natural history of post-TBI pituitary
      deficiencies, studying the connexion between observed deficiencies in acute and late phase of
      sequelae.
