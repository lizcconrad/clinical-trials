  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Multiple Myeloma (MM) is the second diagnosed malignancy of hematological malignancies. The
      previous study pointed out that the dosage and course of Bortezomib including the dose of
      concomitant drugs used to treatment MM patients did not get the preferred treatment program,
      so we are going to determine the optimal doses and course of Bortezomib through the
      prospective, multicenter clinical trial and evaluate the efficiency and safety of different
      program.

    <description>Induction therapy: The treatment will continue for 3-4 cycles and each cycle will be last 21 days.
Bortezomib 1.3mg/m2, twice weekly for two weeks (days 1, 4, 8, and 11) of each cycle + Dexamethasone 20mg/m2, on days 1-4 of each cycle.
Bortezomib 1.0mg/m2, twice weekly for two weeks (days 1, 4, 8, and 11) of each cycle + Dexamethasone 20mg/m2, on days 1-4 of each cycle.
Bortezomib 1.6mg/m2, once weekly for two weeks (days 1, 8) of each cycle + Dexamethasone 20mg/m2, on days 1-4 of each cycle and on days 9-12 of the first and second cycles.
ASCT therapy:
Melphalan 200mg/m2 +Bortezomib 1.0mg/m2 for four times. Melphalan 200mg/m2 +Bortezomib 1.0mg/m2 for two times.</description>
