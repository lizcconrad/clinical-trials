  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study includes two sub-trials.

      In trial 1 patients suffering from insomnia but not meeting the criteria for depression are
      randomised to either therapist guided Internet-based CBT for insomnia or to a control group
      with a non-guided, brief self-help program that acts as a placebo control. The primary
      purpose is to evaluate reduction in Insomnia severity (compared to placebo) after treatment
      and at follow-ups at 6-month, 1 year and 3 years. Secondary purpose is to evaluate the
      costeffectiveness of the treatment and to evaluate if the insomnia treatment has a preventive
      effect on future depressive episodes. Recruitment is done through mass media and includes all
      regions of Sweden. Initial assessment based on questionnaires and telephone interviews.

      Trial 2 includes patients suffering from both Insomnia and depression. Randomization is done
      between either CBT for insomnia or CBT for depression (both Internet-based) to evaluate each
      respective treatment's effect on both insomnia and depression. The patients need for further
      treatment after the initial one will be measured and used as a secondary outcome. Recruitment
      is done through mass media but only citizens in the Stockholm area are included since the
      initial assessment are based on both questionnaires and telephone interviews as well as a
      visit at a psychiatrist located at the Internet psychiatry clinic in Stockholm.

      Both trials will include health economic data and analysis. For the longer follow-up periods
      (1 and 3 years), registers will be used to analyse consumption of sleep medication and
      antidepressants as well as general health care utilization.

    <description>The use of two primary outcomes are motivated since the purpose is to look at effects on both insomnia and depression. In trial 1 the former is used to predict the latter, and in Trial 2 the patientents suffer from both conditions.
The MADRS-S is a 9-item self-rated measure of depression severity and screens for suicidality.
