      The choice of a preferred first-line treatment requires balancing the desire for optimal
      disease control with the occurrence of early and late treatment-related effects. To fully
      assess this balance, the treatment decision process should ideally take into account the
      outcome following a consistent second-line therapy, in particular when tolerated, widely
      applicable and highly effective salvage regimens exist, like in Hodgkin lymphoma failing
      initial chemotherapy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      During the last two decades ABVD (doxorubicin, bleomycin, vinblastine, dacarbazine) has been
      considered as the standard of care for advanced HL, however 20-30% of the patients fail to
      achieve a durable complete remission and need a salvage treatment. After a state-of-the
      art-salvage program including high-dose chemotherapy and autologous hematopoietic stem cell
      support (ASCT) at least half of these patients achieve a durable disease control. Recently
      the German Hodgkin Study Group (GHSG) has developed a new regimen, BEACOPP (bleomycin,
      etoposide, doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide, vincristine, procarbazine and prednisone),
      administered with or without dose escalation. In an interim analysis after 23 months
      follow-up, BEACOPP demonstrated a higher activity compared to COPP/ABVD with a superior
      freedom from treatment failure (84% versus 75%, P=.034). Despite the improved efficacy a
      substantial proportion of patients receiving escalated BEACOPP experienced severe acute
      hematologic toxicity (grade 3-4 leucopoenia, thrombocytopenia and anemia occurred in 78% ,
      36% and 27% of the cycles administered, respectively) and 1.8% fatal acute toxicities were
      reported. Moreover of greater concern is the incidence of almost fatal secondary acute
      leukemia and myelodysplastic syndrome (3 cases in 323 patients). The choice of first-line
      treatment requires balancing the desire for optimal disease control with the occurrence of
      early and late treatment-related toxicities. Long-term outcome following an optimal salvage
      treatment, consisting in high-dose chemotherapy with ASCT should also be taken into
      consideration. In the present study we plan to compare the efficacy and toxicity of two
      therapeutic strategies consisting in two different first-line treatments followed by a
      pre-planned salvage program, when indicated
