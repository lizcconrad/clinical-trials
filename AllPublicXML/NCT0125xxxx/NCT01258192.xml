      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of neoadjuvant chemotherapy
      with nab-paclitaxel plus cisplatin for stage Ⅱ-Ⅲ esophageal squamous cell carcinoma patients.

    <textblock>
      A surgical resection is currently the preferred treatment for esophageal cancer if the tumor
      is considered to be resectable without evidence of distant metastases.A higher percentage of
      radical resection is reported in studies using neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by surgery
      versus surgery alone.The neoadjuvant chemotherapy may improve overall survival. Neoadjuvant
      chemotherapy with administrations of paclitaxel combined with cisplatin or carboplatin has
      shown effectively.Nanoparticle albumin-bound (nab)-paclitaxel has better efficacy and
      practically eliminates the risk of hypersensitivity reactions associated with solvent-based
      paclitaxel.We try to evaluate the efficacy and safety of neoadjuvant chemotherapy with
      nab-paclitaxel plus cisplatin for stage Ⅱ-Ⅲ esophageal squamous cell carcinoma patients.
