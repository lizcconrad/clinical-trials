  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      15 mg dextromethorphan hydrobromide will be better than placebo with respect to reducing the
      number of coughs over 6 hours and reducing the subjective severity of cough over 6 hours.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In light of protocol changes required due to methodological and operational issues, including
      background noise in cough recordings which could impact data interpretation, the study has
      been terminated.

    <time_frame>Baseline, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 hours post-dose</time_frame>
    <description>Perceived verbal cough severity score was assessed on a 5-point categorical rating scale in accordance to the question &quot;How much have you coughed in the last hour?&quot;, where 0 = not at all, 1 = a tiny bit, 2 = a little, 3 = some and 4 = a lot. The change from baseline over the 6-hour post-dosing period calculated as the average of change from baseline [that is (i.e.) baseline value minus the post baseline value] measurements of Hour 1 to Hour 6, thus the change from baseline ranged from -4 to 4; higher score indicated a better improvement.</description>

    <description>Verbal cough severity score was assessed on a 5-point categorical rating scale in accordance to the question &quot;How much have you coughed in the last hour?&quot;, where 0 = not at all, 1 = a tiny bit, 2 = a little, 3 = some and 4 = a lot. The change from baseline values were derived by subtracting each post baseline value from the baseline value, and ranged from -4 to 4; higher score indicated a better improvement.</description>

    <description>Perceived numerical cough severity score was assessed on an 11-point categorical rating scale in accordance to the question &quot;How much have you coughed in the last hour?&quot;, where 0 = did not cough at all and 10 = cough a lot. The change from baseline for the 6-hour post-dosing period was calculated as the average of change from baseline (i.e. baseline value minus the post baseline value) measurements of Hour 1 to Hour 6, thus the change from baseline values ranged from -10 to 10; higher score indicated a better improvement.</description>

        <description>Perceived verbal cough severity score was assessed on a 5-point categorical rating scale in accordance to the question “How much have you coughed in the last hour?”, where 0 = not at all, 1 = a tiny bit, 2 = a little, 3 = some and 4 = a lot. The change from baseline over the 6-hour post-dosing period calculated as the average of change from baseline [that is (i.e.) baseline value minus the post baseline value] measurements of Hour 1 to Hour 6, thus the change from baseline ranged from -4 to 4; higher score indicated a better improvement.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Perceived Numerical Cough Severity Scale for 6 Hour Post-Dose Period</title>
        <description>Perceived numerical cough severity score was assessed on an 11-point categorical rating scale in accordance to the question “How much have you coughed in the last hour?”, where 0 = did not cough at all and 10 = cough a lot. The change from baseline for the 6-hour post-dosing period was calculated as the average of change from baseline (i.e. baseline value minus the post baseline value) measurements of Hour 1 to Hour 6, thus the change from baseline values ranged from -10 to 10; higher score indicated a better improvement.</description>
