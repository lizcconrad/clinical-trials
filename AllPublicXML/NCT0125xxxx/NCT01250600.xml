  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Although a lot of evidence and guidelines recommend that patients have cardiac
      rehabilitation, in reality, the actual rate cardiac patients entering cardiac rehabilitation
      program is low, usually less than one third. One of the main hindrances of patients
      participating cardiac rehabilitation program is insufficient number of medical institutions
      that can provide rehabilitation services. Patients usually cannot perform exercise program
      under medical professionals monitoring without having to go far. This spatial and temporal
      difficulty led to the low rate of patients taking cardiac rehabilitation program. The risk of
      patients to do exercise is higher than healthy adult.

      This project will develop the intelligent portable remote care system for cardiopulmonary
      exercise to provide an instant ECG monitoring service through the integration of front-end
      wireless ECG measuring devices, expert system, and back-end tele-care platform. Many patients
      are inconvenient to go to large hospital regularly for cardiac rehabilitation training. This
      project will help them to exercise at home after once or twice rehabilitation training in
      clinic for each month and the medical professional will supervise remotely to see how much
      exercise they did. For that reason the project can help to break through spatial and temporal
      difficulty of having cardiac rehabilitation, so that cardiac rehabilitation can be help more
      patients. Patients have this tele-care system while they are doing exercise at home, the
      built-in heart rate and cardiac rhythm warning function will remind them to take a break,
      even to take medical treatment. More importantly, the ECG signal can be almost immediately
      (real time) uploaded by network to the chest pain unit of hospital. The cardiology expert
      will be aware of the warning at the first moment. This is an important protection to
      patients' safety of doing rehabilitation sports at home.

      This randomized control trial will recruit 80 patients who had myocardial infarction within 6
      weeks, and are not able to attend a hospital based cardiac rehabilitation program regularly.
      All patient will undergo a three-month home exercise program under the instruction provided
      by the physiatrists and physiotherapists. Forty of them (the remote-care group) will use the
      intelligent portable remote care system for cardiopulmonary exercise to monitor their
      exercise intensity and cardiac rhythm during exercise. The other 40 patients (the control
      group) undertake the exercise program at home without using the remote care system. The
      efficacy and safety of exercise program will be compared between the two groups.
