    <textblock>
      The study drug LY2393910 is being evaluated as a possible treatment for diabetes. The primary
      purpose of a patient's participation in this study is to help answer the following research
      question(s), and not to provide treatment for diabetes:

        -  The safety of LY2393910 and any side effects that might be associated with it following
           2 weeks of doses

        -  How long it takes the body to absorb and remove LY2393910 following dosing over 2 weeks

        -  How daily dosing of LY2393910 affects blood levels of sugar (glucose), insulin and other
           naturally occurring substances in your body

        -  How daily dosing of LY2393910 affects the cells that produce insulin

        -  Any differences in the above between LY2393910 taken as daily doses in the morning or in
           the evening
