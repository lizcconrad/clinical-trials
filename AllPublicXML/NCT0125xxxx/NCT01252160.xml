  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study all patients will be treated with the same medicine, the QUTENZA patch.
      Subjects will receive up to 6 QUTENZA patch applications over 12 months.

      The rationale for the current study is to evaluate the safety of repeated QUTENZA
      applications, including the effect of QUTENZA on sensory function in subjects diagnosed with
      different types of Peripheral Neuropathic Pain (PNP). In order to adequately assess the
      long-term safety QUTENZA in well defined patient populations the current study will enroll a
      minimum of 100 patients each with HIV-Associated Neuropathy (HIV-AN) and Postherpetic
      Neuralgia (PHN).

             is allowed)

          -  Evidence of cognitive impairment including dementia that may interfere with subject's
             ability to complete study evaluations and recall pain levels in the past 24 hours

          -  Planned elective surgery during the trial

          -  Neuropathic pain areas located only on the face, above the hairline of the scalp,
