             history and physical examination.

          -  Have clinical laboratory test results within normal reference range for the
             investigator site, or results with minor deviations not considered to be clinically
             significant by the investigator.

        Hepatic Impaired Subjects

        •Have stable hepatic impairment (alcoholic, posthepatitis, biliary cirrhosis, cryptogenic)
        classified as Child-Pugh class A, B, or C (mild, moderate, and severe impairment) who are

        Exclusion Criteria:

        All Subjects

          -  Are currently enrolled in, or discontinued within the last 90 days from the last
             dosing occasion in a clinical trial involving an investigational drug or device, or

             LY2624803.

          -  Have an abnormality in the 12-lead ECG that, in the opinion of the investigator,
             increases the risk associated with participating in the study.

             screening.

          -  Are liver transplant subjects or have taken immunosuppressants following any organ
             transplant.

          -  Have shown signs of variceal bleeding during the last 2 weeks prior to screening.
