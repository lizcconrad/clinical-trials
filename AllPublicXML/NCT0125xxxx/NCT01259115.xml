    <measure>CYP3A4 Inhibition by Observation of Plasma Nor-buprenorphine Production Assessed by the Erythromycin Breath Test.</measure>
    <time_frame>One time at screening and one time during ketoconazole treatment</time_frame>
    <description>As part of subject screening, Erythromycin Breath Tests (EBT) were done on all potential subjects (enrolled population). CYP 3A4 inhibition was calculated by taking the difference of the baseline 14C erythromycin metabolism, subtracting the 14C erythromycin metabolism during ketoconazole treatment, dividing this difference by the baseline 14C erythromycin metabolism, and multiplying by 100 to express results in the form of percent inhibition. CYP3A4 inhibition was only done when subjects were on ketoconazole.</description>

        <description>As part of subject screening, Erythromycin Breath Tests (EBT) were done on all potential subjects (enrolled population). CYP 3A4 inhibition was calculated by taking the difference of the baseline 14C erythromycin metabolism, subtracting the 14C erythromycin metabolism during ketoconazole treatment, dividing this difference by the baseline 14C erythromycin metabolism, and multiplying by 100 to express results in the form of percent inhibition. CYP3A4 inhibition was only done when subjects were on ketoconazole.</description>
