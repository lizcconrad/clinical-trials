    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to assess the safety and efficacy of a monthly regimen of ozarelix
      administered subcutaneously (SC) versus Goserelin depot administered subcutaneously in men
      with Prostate Cancer. This is an international, multi-center, randomized, open label 84 days
      study. Men who are at least 18 years of age or older, with histologically proven prostate
      cancer of all stages, in whom endocrine treatment is indicated will be eligible for study
      entry.

      Prospective study subjects will undergo screening procedures. Approximately 214 eligible
      patients will enter the study. Patients will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to one of two
      treatment arms (Ozarelix or Goserelin). Eligible patients randomized to the ozarelix group
      will receive two SC injections of ozarelix 65 mg in the abdomen on Day 1 (left lower
      quadrant, LLQ and right lower quadrant, RLQ), followed by a SC injection of 65 mg of Ozarelix
      (abdomen LLQ) on day 8 and will receive 2 additional SC injections of Ozarelix on days 28 and
      56 (alternating injection sites). Eligible patients randomized to Goserelin will receive one
      3.6 mg SC injection in the abdomen (LLQ or RLQ), followed by a 3.6 mg SC injection on Days 28
      and 56 (alternating injection sites). Ozarelix will be reconstituted and administered as a 65
      mg injection. Patients will receive two Ozarelix 65 mg subcutaneous injections (SC) on Day 1,
      and one 65 mg SC injection on day 8, followed by one 65 mg injection on days 28 and 56. The
      patients will receive one Goserelin 3.6 mg SC injection at baseline, Day 28 and Day 56.
