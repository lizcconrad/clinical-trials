  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patent ductus arterious(PDA)is frequently seen and potentially pathologic in preterm infants.
      Near-infrared spectroscopy is a simple bedside tool to analyse the changes in the renal and
      splanchnic tissue oxygenation index and fractional tissue oxygen extraction and may be
      helpful to measure effects of ibuprofen treatment for PDA in preterm infants.

    <textblock>
      Patent ductus arterious (PDA) is the most common cardiovascular abnormality in preterm
      infants.There are clear associations between a PDA and decreased renal and splanchnic blood
      flow. The aim is to monitor, using near-infrared spectroscopy, the effect of ibuprofen on the
      fractional tissue (renal and mesenteric) oxygen extraction (FTOE) in preterm newborns during
      ibuprofen of the treatment PDA.
