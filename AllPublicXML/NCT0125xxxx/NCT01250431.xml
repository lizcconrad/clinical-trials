  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to measure the change in psychological symptoms and gene
      expression in war veterans after a series of 10 EFT coaching sessions. Outcome studies have
      shown statistically significant reductions in depression, anxiety, and PTSD in veterans after
      EFT, and this study extends earlier research using biological sampling. EFT is a form of
      Energy Psychology (EP) that is sometimes referred to as &quot;emotional acupuncture.&quot; It involves
      self-stimulation of 14 acupuncture points at the end of meridians with the fingertips, while
      recalling an emotional event such as a combat trauma. It is typically effective in 6 to 15
      coaching sessions, making it an efficient clinical technique for reducing affect.

      There is peer-reviewed published experimental evidence showing that (a) acupuncture reduces
      the fear response in the brain, especially the limbic system, and most particularly the
      amygdala; that (b) tapping or rubbing acupuncture points (acupressure) can be as effective as
      needling them; that (c) EFTs use of such acupressure is efficacious in reducing anxiety, PTSD
      and other mood disorders; that (d) EFT reliably reduces emotional intensity associated with
      traumatic memories, is safe and low-risk; that (e) all EP studies that included a long-term
      follow-up show that patient gains are maintained over time; that (f) the psychological
      questionnaires used in this study are validated and safe; and that for all these reasons (g)
      EP is a treatment of choice among therapists when dealing with the traumatic memories of
      clients. This study extends these findings by noting changes in gene expression associated
      with the remission of PTSD symptoms.
