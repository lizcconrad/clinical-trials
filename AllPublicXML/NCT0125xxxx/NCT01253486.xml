    <textblock>
      This study will determine whether the psychological and physical benefits of expressive
      writing extend to obese in-patients with Ischemic Heart Disease (IHD)referred to cardiac
      rehabilitation

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Expressive writing, for as little as 3-5 sessions of 20 minutes, has been found to improve
      both physical and psychological health based on health outcome measures such as number of
      doctor's visits and hospital days, blood pressure control, lung and immune function, pain,
      anxiety and depression. Given its simplicity and obvious advantages in terms of
      cost-effectiveness, expressive writing has great potential as a therapeutic tool or as a
      means of self-help, either alone or as an adjunct to traditional therapies. This modality has
      not been studied in obese patients with Ischemic Heart Disease.
