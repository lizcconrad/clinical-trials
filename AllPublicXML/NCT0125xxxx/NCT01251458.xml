        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Histologically confirmed hepatocellular carcinoma that is not amenable to curative
             resection

          -  measurable disease

          -  Age &gt;=18 years.

          -  Life expectancy of greater than 12 weeks.

          -  ECOG performance status &lt;= 2

          -  Prior systemic therapy for HCC is allowed

          -  Adequate haematologic, renal and hepatic function

          -  Absence of cirrhosis or Child's A cirrhosis

          -  Fasting total cholesterol &lt;9.1 mmol/liter and fasting triglyceride level &lt;4.5
             mmol/liter)

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients who have had systemic therapy or radiotherapy within 3 weeks prior to
             entering the study or those who have not recovered from adverse events due to agents
             administered more than 3 weeks earlier.

          -  Patients receiving any other investigational agents concurrently.

          -  Patients with known brain metastases should be excluded from this clinical trial
             because of their poor prognosis and because they often develop progressive neurologic
             dysfunction that would confound the evaluation of neurologic and other adverse events.

          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent diseases such as, but not limited to, ongoing or active
             infection, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with
             study requirements.

          -  Pregnant women.
