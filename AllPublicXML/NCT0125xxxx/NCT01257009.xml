    <textblock>
      Hypertensive chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients often have sympathetic hyperactivity which
      appears to contribute to the pathogenesis of hypertension and cardiovascular organ damage.
      Experimental studies and some clinical studies have shown that statin therapy can reduce
      central sympathetic activity. Blockade of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS), which is
      standard treatment for CKD, is known to lower sympathetic activity.

      The investigators hypothesize that adding a statin for 6 weeks to RAS blockade would further
      lower sympathetic activity in hypertensive stage 2-4 CKD patients.

      Methods: In ten stable CKD patients who are on chronic treatment with renin-angiotenis
      blockers, blood pressure and sympathetic activity (quantified by assessment of muscle
      sympathetic nerve activity, MSNA) will be assessed at baseline and 6 weeks after atorvastatin
      20mg/day added.

      Ten other CKD patients will serve as time control and will be studied twice with an interval
      of 6 weeks without any change in medication, to quantify within subject reproducibility.
