  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Despite the common use of oral steroids in the management of chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS),
      the natural history and efficacy of this treatment modality has not been fully elucidated.
      Specifically, patients who have undergone prior ESS and have recalcitrant CRS, the natural
      history of endoscopic improvement and quality of life (QoL) outcomes, following an oral
      steroid taper, is poorly defined. The purpose of this non-randomized single-arm clinical
      trial is to evaluate the effectiveness of an oral steroid taper in improving endoscopic
      grading, QoL, and olfactory function as well as defining the duration of improvement, in
      patients with recalcitrant CRS with prior endoscopic sinus surgery (ESS).

    <description>The two main outcome measures to evaluate changes in QoL include the Sinonasal Outcome Test-22 (SNOT-22) and Nasal Obstruction Scoring Evaluation (NOSE) instruments. The SNOT-22 is a validated, 22-item outcome measure applicable to both sinonasal conditions and surgical treatments (score range: 0-110). Lower total scores on the SNOT-22 imply better QoL. The SNOT-22 will be administered by the Study Coordinator to study participants at baseline, as well as 2 week, 1 month, 3 month, and 6 month follow-up appointments.</description>
