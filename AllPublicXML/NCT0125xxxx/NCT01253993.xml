  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There is clear evidence that aggressive behavior and disruptive behavior disorders (DBD) in
      middle childhood are associated with an increased risk for substance abuse in adolescence.
      However, the exact underlying mechanism of this increased risk is unknown. It is likely that
      a biopsychological vulnerability in some aggressive children and children with DBD makes them
      liable to substance use and abuse. The investigators hypothesize that deficient decision
      making is such a biopsychological factor. In this study the investigators aim to test the
      latter hypothesis by investigating the decision making ability in a group of adolescents with
      DBD with and without substance use disorders. Decision-making is assessed with the IOWA
      Gambling Task (GT). This task mimics real-life situations in the way it factors uncertainty,
      reward and punishment. The GT is specifically designed to assess impaired decision-making in
      individuals who are unable to learn from their mistakes and make decisions that repeatedly
      lead to negative consequences. This characteristic may be common to individuals with
      externalizing disorders such as DBD, psychopathy, and substance use disorders.

      This study consists of two substudies with adolescents in the age of 14-21 years. The first
      study group consist of adolescents with DBD with (n=30) and without (n=30) substance use
      disorders. These adolescents are recruited from orthopsychiatric, forensic psychiatric, and
      judicial institutions.

      The second study group consists of a) ex-patients of the Utrecht Coping Power Program
      (UCPP)who previously participated to a follow-up study, and b) ex-patients who were treated
      as a child at an outpatient clinic of the UMC Utrecht. These latter groups were taken
      together and subdivided into a group with (n=30) and without (n=30) substance use problems.

      For both studies healthy controls (n=80) are recruited. The investigators will start with
      healthy controls from earlier studies, and those are extented and will serve as control group
      for both studies.
