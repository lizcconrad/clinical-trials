      The aim of this study is to determine if using a behavioural replacement for smoking
      (de-nicotinised cigarettes; DNCs), in addition to standard treatment during the first two
      weeks after the target quit date, can reduce urges to smoke over the first 4-weeks of
      abstinence. Two hundred smokers who want to quit will be recruited from the community. They
      would all receive standard smoking cessation treatment from the NHS Stop Smoking Service (NHS
      SSS), which uses a combination of stop smoking medication (e.g. nicotine replacement therapy,
      Champix) and motivational support. On their target quit date, participants would be
      randomised to receive behavioural replacement ( i.e. use of de-nicotinised cigarettes) plus
      standard treatment for the first two weeks of their quit attempt, or to continue with
      standard treatment alone. De-nicotinised cigarettes are similar to standard cigarettes except
      that they do not deliver nicotine to the smoker. Participants will rate their urges to smoke
      at each week. Standard NHS SSS measures will also be taken in addition to user acceptability
      ratings and reactions to smoking cues.

      The hypothesis is that complementing current NHS SSS treatments with de-nicotinised
      cigarettes, to address the non-nicotine factors associated with smoking and to help
      extinguish smoking behaviour, would result in lower urges to smoke than standard treatment
      alone.

    <description>Differences in urges to smoke in the first week of abstinence between participants who receive a behavioural replacement (DNCs) plus standard NHS SSS treatment, with those who receive standard NHS SSS treatment alone, will be measured by the Mood and Physical Symptoms Scale (MPSS; West &amp; Hajek, 2004).</description>

    <description>Participants will receive de-nicotinised cigarettes to use as required for 2 weeks after their quit day. These cigarettes are intended to provide a replacement for the behavioural and sensory aspects of smoking without supplying nicotine.
Participants will also receive standard NHS Stop Smoking Service treatment. This is a combination of weekly behavioural support and medication (e.g. nicotine replacement therapy/varenicline).</description>
