  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of V503 in Japanese
      girls between the ages of 9 and 15 and will determine whether V503 induces an acceptable
      immune response to all human papillomavirus (HPV) strains contained in the vaccine. The
      success criterion for the primary analysis requires that point estimates for seroconversion
      rate be greater than 90% for all 9 HPV types.

    <description>Serum antibody titers for HPV virus-like particles (VLPs), Types 6, 11, 16, 18, 31, 33, 45, 52 and 58 were determined 4 weeks post-vaccination 3 using competitive luminex immunoassay (cLIA). The serostatus cutoffs (milli Merck U/mL) for HPV types were as follows: HPV Type 6: ≥30, HPV Type 11: ≥16; HPV Type 16: ≥20, HPV Type 18: ≥24, HPV Type 31: ≥10, HPV Type 33: ≥8, HPV Type 45: ≥8, HPV Type 52: ≥8, and HPV Type 58: ≥8.</description>

    <measure>Percentage of Participants With an Injection-site Adverse Event (AE)</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 5 days after any vaccination</time_frame>
    <description>An AE is defined as any unfavorable and unintended change in the structure, function, or chemistry of the body temporally associated with the use of the study vaccine, whether or not considered related to the use of the vaccine. Any worsening of a preexisting condition which is temporally associated with the use of the study vaccine is also an AE. AEs such as redness, swelling, and pain/tenderness/soreness at the injection site were recorded.</description>

    <description>An AE is defined as any unfavorable and unintended change in the structure, function, or chemistry of the body temporally associated with the use of the study vaccine, whether or not considered related to the use of the vaccine. Any worsening of a preexisting condition which is temporally associated with the use of the study vaccine is also an AE. Adverse experience that is judged by the Investigator to be &quot;definitely related,&quot; &quot;probably related,&quot; or &quot;possibly related&quot; to the study drug is defined as a vaccine-related AE.</description>
