  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Characterize the pharmacokinetics of AMG 337 when administered orally. PK parameters will include, but are not limited to, area under the plasma concentration versus time curve (AUC) and Peak Plasma Concentration (Cmax).</measure>

             tumor

          -  Subjects with primary central nervous system (CNS) tumors or metastases resected or
             have received radiation therapy ending at least 4 weeks prior to study day 1 are
             eligible providing they meet all of the following criteria: a) residual neurological
             symptoms grade ≤ 1; 2) no dexamethasone treatment; and c) follow-up MRI shows no new
             lesions appearing

          -  Measurable disease per RECIST guidelines (subjects with non-measurable, but evaluable
             disease are also eligible for the dose escalation portion of the study)

          -  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Performance Status of ≤ 2

          -  Competent to sign and date an Institutional Review Board approved informed consent
             form

          -  Adequate hematologic and renal function as determined by laboratory blood and urine
             tests

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Men and woman of reproductive potential, unwilling to practice a highly effective
             method of birth control for the duration of the study and continuing for 2 weeks (for
             women) and 12 weeks (for men) after receiving the last dose of study drug.

          -  Women who are lactating/breastfeeding or planning to become pregnant during the
             duration of the study

          -  History of bleeding diathesis

          -  Myocardial infarction within 6 months of study day 1, symptomatic congestive heart
             failure (New York Heart Association &gt; class II), unstable angina, or unstable cardiac
             arrhythmia requiring medication, or uncontrolled hypertension

          -  A baseline ECG QTc &gt; 470 ms

          -  Active infection requiring (IV) antibiotics within 2 weeks of study enrollment

          -  Significant gastrointestinal disorder(s), in the opinion of the investigator, that may
             influence drug absorption

          -  Known positive test for HIV

          -  Known acute or chronic hepatitis B or hepatitis C infection as determined by serologic
             tests
