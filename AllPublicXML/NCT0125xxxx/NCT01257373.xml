      The goal of this study is to assess the long-term efficacy and safety of Firebird2
      Cobalt-Chromium（CoCr）-alloyed sirolimus-eluting stent in treatment of complex lesions in
      diabetes.

      This clinical trial is an international multi-center prospective clinical registry research,
      for evaluating the efficacy and safety of Firebird 2 cobalt-chromium alloyed
      sirolimus-eluting stent in treatment of complex coronary lesions in diabetes. As planned,
      about 57 research centers all over China, Latin America and Asia-Pacific areas will be
      involved and, 1300 patients will be enrolled into this research. The implanted stents must
      all be Firebird2 cobalt-chromium alloyed sirolimus-eluting stent. The patient enrollment will
      last for 12 months. Clinical follow-up will be done respectively for 30 days, 6 months, 12
      months, 18 months, 24 months, 30 months and 36 months. All quitted patients during the study
      will not be replaced with any substitutes, but categorized in the enrollment failure column.
      The researcher must state clear the reason of nonenrollment.

    <description>Firebird2 CoCr-alloyed sirolimus-eluting stent system is the 2nd generation of drug-eluting stent(DES). It was registered successfully on Jan. 16, 2009 in China. This stent is based with a CoCr alloyed metal platform. The length is from 13-33mm, the diameter is from 2.5mm-4.0mm.</description>

        This registry study will be conducted in 56 centers in which Firebird 2 stent is
        implemented. The data of 1300 patients, in which only Fireibrd2 stent is implanted, will be
        collected. All inclusive patients should be definitely diagnosed type 2 DM, either before
        or during the present hospitalization and with complex coronary lesions. The diagnosis
        criteria is the World Health Organization(WHO) recommended criteria 1999 version. I.e.,
        fasting blood glucose ≥7.0mmol/L，random blood glucose ≥11.1mmol/L，or OGTT 2h blood glucose
        ≥11.1mmol/L. Impaired fasting glucose (6.0mmol/L～7.0mmol/L) or Impaired glucose tolerance
        (oral glucose tolerance test(OGTT) 2h blood glucose 7.8mmol/L～11.1mmol/L) can not be
        enrolled. The stress-induced hyperglycemia of acute coronary syndrome is illegible.
