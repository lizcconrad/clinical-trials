  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Laparoscopic distal pancreatectomy (LDP) for benign and borderline pancreatic lesions has
      recently becoming the treatment of choice in experienced centres. No data have been published
      about learning curve so far. The purpose of this study was to identify the learning curve
      period for performing LDP.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Between March 2009 and August 2010 all patients with lesion of body or tail of pancreas were
      assessed for eligibility for LDP. Exclusion criteria were: major vessels contact in cancer
      patients, severe organ dysfunction, BMI &gt; 35, and refusing laparoscopic approach. All
      laparoscopic procedures were carried out by the same surgical team with large experience in
      open pancreatic surgery. All patients were treated according to an early recovery after
      surgery protocol. Primary endpoint was conversion rate. Secondary endpoints were operation
      time, operative blood loss, postoperative morbidity, and length of stay.
