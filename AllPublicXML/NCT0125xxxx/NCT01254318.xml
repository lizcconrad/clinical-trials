    <textblock>
      This will be a retrospective study that includes retrospective chart reviews at major
      institutions across Canada. The intent of the study is to generate both regional and national
      incidence data for non-Candida invasive fungal infections (IFI) in high risk participants.
      The study will include participants receiving stem cell transplant and high dose chemotherapy
      treatment for leukemia.

          <title>Percentage of Participants With Invasive Fungal Infections in Canada</title>
          <description>Data were to be extracted from participant hospital records from 5-9 centers across Canada starting from the time of initiating chemotherapy or conditioning regimen for their stem cell transplant (index date) until one year post-index date, in order to determine the percentage of high risk participants with non-Candida invasive fungal infections.</description>
          <population>Whereas enrollment at 5-9 centers in Canada was planned, this was not accomplished, as data were only collected from a single institution in Canada.</population>

          <title>Participants at High Risk for IFI</title>
          <description>Participants were considered high risk for IFI if they were undergoing high dose chemotherapy for leukemia. This includes, but is not limited to participants with acute myelogenous leukemia, acute lymphoblastic leukemia, or myelodysplastic syndrome. Participants were also considered to be at high risk for IFI if they had undergone allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.</description>
