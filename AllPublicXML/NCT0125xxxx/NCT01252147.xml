    <measure>Overall Inter-Rater Reliability of Assessing Overall Eyelash Prominence Using the Japanese Global Eyelash Assessment Scale (GEA-J) at Day 1</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1</time_frame>
    <description>Inter-rater agreement (among raters) of the GEA-J scores (1=minimum,2=moderate, 3=marked, 4=very marked) to assess eyelash prominence was evaluated using Kendall's coefficient of concordance (Kendall's W). Each of 7 raters who scored 68 subjects' eyelashes using GEA-J Scale with photonumeric guide at 2 different time points at day 1. The overall inter-rater agreement for Kendall's W for all raters combined was estimated based on the average of the scores from those 2 different time points. The degree of agreement of the point estimates of Kendall's W was interpreted according to the reference range scale that was pre-defined as: &lt;=0: poor, 0.00-0.20: slightly, 0.21-0.40: fair, 0.41-0.60: moderate, 0.61-0.80: substantial, 0.81-1:00: almost perfect. The 95% confidence interval for Kendall's W is provided.</description>

    <measure>Overall Intra-Rater Reliability of Assessing Overall Eyelash Prominence Using the Japanese Global Eyelash Assessment Scale (GEA-J) at Day 1</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1</time_frame>
    <description>Intra-rater (within raters) agreement of the GEA-J scores (1=minimum, 2=moderate, 3=marked, 4=very marked) to assess eyelash prominence was evaluated by weighted Kappa statistics. Weighted Kappa statistics were calculated for each of 7 rater who evaluated 68 subjects using GEA-J scale with photonumeric guide, assessing agreement between 2 different time points at day 1. The overall intra-rater agreement for Kappa statistics for all raters combined was estimated by pooling Kappa statistics for each rater using a chi-square statistic. The degree of agreement of the point estimates of Kappa statistics was interpreted according to the reference range scale that was pre-defined as: &lt;=0: poor, 0.00-0.20: slightly, 0.21-0.40: fair, 0.41-0.60: moderate, 0.61-0.80: substantial, 0.81-1:00: almost perfect.
