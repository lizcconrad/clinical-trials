    <textblock>
      This is a pilot study that will allow investigators to collect data related to early and
      potentially more accurate response assessments using a chemotherapy protocol that eliminates
      methotrexate to maximize the dose intensity of doxorubicin. The pilot data will be used to
      seek funding to more fully address the hypotheses in a multi-institutional, Phase II or Phase
      III trial. The primary and secondary objectives are as follows:

      Primary:

        1. To evaluate the feasibility and potential usefulness of measuring early changes in tumor
           metabolic activity, assessed by Fludeoxyglucose-Positron Emission Tomography (FDG-PET)
           imaging and alkaline phosphatase activity, as early predictors of histological response
           rate at 12 weeks in osteosarcoma patients.

        2. To explore whether histological response can be assessed by a computer algorithm using
           virtual microscopic images of pathology material, and whether quantifying necrosis in
           this way correlates with microscope slide-based review.

      Secondary:

      1. To gather pilot data on the histological response rate, 3-year event-free survival, and
      toxicity when children and young adults with resectable osteosarcoma are treated using a
      chemotherapy regimen of alternating courses of doxorubicin/cisplatin (DC) and
      doxorubicin/ifosfamide/etoposide (IDE).

      All patients will receive 4 courses of preoperative chemotherapy courses. With the exception
      of high-dose methotrexate, which is given weekly, preoperative and postoperative chemotherapy
      courses are planned to begin every 21 days.

      Patients with good histological response (those patients with &gt; 90% tumor necrosis at time of
      definitive resection) will receive three postoperative chemotherapy courses. The 1st will
      consist of doxorubicin, dexrazoxane, cisplatin and Granulocyte-Colony Stimulating Factor
      (G-CSF)(or Polyethylene Glycol filgrastim). The 2nd course will consist of doxorubicin,
      dexrazoxane, ifosfamide, MESNA, etoposide, G-CSF (or PEG-filgrastim). The 3rd course will
      consist of ifosfamide, MESNA, etoposide, G-CSF (or PEG-filgrastrim). The total doxorubicin
      dose will be 450 mg/m2.

      Patients with poor response (those patients with &lt; 90% tumor necrosis found on pathology at
      time of definitive resection) will receive five postoperative chemotherapy courses. High
      Dose-Methotrexate will be administered during the 1st and 3rd postoperative chemotherapy
      courses as 4-weekly and 2-weekly doses, respectively. The 2nd course will consist of
      doxorubicin, dexrazoxane, cisplatin and G-CSF (or PEG-filgrastim). The 4th course will
      consist of doxorubicin, dexrazoxane, ifosfamide, Mesna, etoposide, G-CSF (or PEG-filgrastim).
      The 5th cycle will consist of ifosfamide, Mesna, etoposide, G-CSF (or PEG-filgrastrim). The
      total doxorubicin dose will be 450 mg/m2.
