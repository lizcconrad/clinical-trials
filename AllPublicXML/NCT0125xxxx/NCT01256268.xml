      The purpose of this study is to:

        -  Test the safety of a new investigational drug called MK-8669 (ridaforolimus)

        -  Determine the maximum tolerated dose of MK-8669

        -  Determine the effectiveness of the maximum tolerated dose of MK-8669

      This is a phase 1A/1B study. Phase 1A is designed to determine the maximal tolerated dose
      (MTD) and toxicity of ridaforolimus in combination with paclitaxel and carboplatin in
      patients with advanced or recurrent solid tumors. The MTD determined in this study will be
      the recommended dose to study in the phase 1B or in future phase 2 trials.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Must have measurable disease or evaluable disease. Measurable disease is defined as at
             least one lesion that can be accurately measured in at least one dimension (longest
             dimension to be recorded). Each lesion must be a minimum size of 10 mm by CT scan (CT
             scan slice thickness no greater than 5 mm), 10 mm caliper measurement by clinical exam
             or 20 mm by chest X-ray. Lymph node must be ≥ 15 mm in short axis when assessed by CT
             scan. Evaluable disease is disease evident on imaging that does not meet Response
             Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) criteria 1.1, however, meets tumor marker
             evaluation, e.g., Gynecologic Cancer Intergroup (GCIG) criteria. Notes: i) If the
             patient's only disease is confined to a solitary lesion, its neoplastic nature must be
             confirmed by histology or cytology unless it is accompanied by GCIG criteria or can be
             clearly be shown as new disease when compared to prior imaging. ii) Disease in a
             previously irradiated field is acceptable as the only site of measurable disease only
             if there has been clear progression since completion of radiotherapy.

          -  Age &gt; 18 years and competent to give informed consent.

             serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase (SGOT) and alkaline phosphatase less than or
             equal to 2.5 x ULN (CTCAE v4.0 grade 1).; Neurologic function: Neuropathy (sensory and
             motor) less than or equal to CTCAE v4.0 grade 1.; No chemotherapy, radiotherapy,
