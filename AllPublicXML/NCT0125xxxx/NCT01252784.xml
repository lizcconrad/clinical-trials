      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the feasibility and efficacy of reduced-intensity
      conditioning allogeneic HCT followed by prophylactic dose-escalating DLIs in patients with
      higher risk MDS.

      This clinical trial will use busulfan, fludarabine, thymoglobulin and methylprednisolone for
      conditioning therapy, and cyclosporine and methotrexate for prevention of GVHD. All drugs had
      been previously accepted for administration to human in respective indication and there is no
      need to further evaluate the efficacy and the safety of each drug separately. Dose-escalating
      DLI is also widely accepted procedure after allogeneic HCT.
