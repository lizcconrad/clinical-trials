      The purpose of this study is to compare the ability of two peripheral and non invasive
      devices to detect hypoxic events during one-lung ventilation and during the early
      postoperative period. One device measures regional cerebral oxygenation and the other
      muscular oxygenation. These two devices are compared to non invasive arterial saturation
      (SpO2), which is the gold standard.

      Lung surgery is often complicated by hypoxic evants :

        -  during one-lung ventilation which leads to changes about ratio in ventilated and
           perfused lung areas. This blood flow redistribution promotes shunt with a decreased
           arterial oxygenation and possible hypoxemia.

        -  during the postoperative period.

      Common measure of arterial saturation through SpO2 may miss a great number of hypoxic events
      with regional impact because a significant decrease in SpO2 occurs for an arterial pressure
      in oxygen below 60 mmHg. Currently, cerebral and somatic saturation can be monitored
      non-invasively and continuously via optical sensors applied to the right and left forehead
      and to the thenar eminence. These devices may help clinicians in the detection of such
      hypoxemic events.
