  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Lung transplant recipients have the highest rate of Invasive Aspergillus (IA)infection among
      solid organ transplant recipients. The most important risk factor for the development of IA
      (which is associated with disease and death) is colonization of the organism in the
      respiratory tract.

      Azoles are used to prevent the development of IA. Puffers containing antifungal medication
      can be used to treat the lungs without the need to worry about the medication interactions &amp;
      side-effects in the blood. An example of this is the aerosolized amphotericin B. Its use is
      limited by the patients' tolerating this medication that may cause cough, nausea &amp;
      contraction of the air pathways.

      The lipid preparation is better tolerated and has longer dosing interval than inhaled
      amphotericin B. The investigators propose a pilot study to determine the long-term safety of
      inhaled AmBisome administration of drug and generate the preliminary data on the
      effectiveness of this drug to prevent aspergillus colonization.

      In this pilot study, our main aims are:

        1. To determine the safety of once weekly Inhaled AmBisome prophylaxis in preventing the
           development of Aspergillus colonization in lung transplant recipients at one year of
           prophylaxis.

        2. To generate the preliminary data on the efficacy of Inhaled AmBisome (Astellas) loading
           dose (1mg/kg/day for four days) initially followed by q weekly dosage to complete 1 year
           in lung transplant recipients as compared to no prophylaxis by assessing the rate of
           fungal colonization/infections between the groups.
