      The purpose of this is to determine the impact of intermittent preventive treatment (IPT)
      with sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP) on the morbidities associated with malaria in pregnant
      women and newborns in rural peri-urban areas of Bobo-Dioulasso, 5 years after its
      implemented.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Malaria in pregnant women is a crucial issue in Burkina Faso. Faced with this problem, a
      strategy based on the use of treated nets and intermittent preventive treatment (IPT) based
      on sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP) was adopted in 2005. Five years after its implementation,
      the investigators will check whether this strategy is still effective in the preventing
      maternal and congenital malaria on the one hand and maternal anemia, low birth weight and
      prematurity on the other hand.

    <description>The investigators will check pregnant women haemoglobin level.A level&lt; 11g/dl will be considered as anemia.
Congenital malaria will be assessed through cord blood smear. Birth weight &lt;2500g will be considered as low birth weight. Prematurity designs any birth before 37 gestation weeks.</description>
