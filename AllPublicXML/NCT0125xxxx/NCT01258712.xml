        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients diagnosed with history of moderate-to- severe rheumatoid arthritis for more
             than 6 months according to the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) 1987 revised
             criteria for the classification of RA.

          -  Patients who failed to achieve clinical response to treatment of at least 2
             DMARDs(disease modifying anti-rheumatic drug) (including MTX) for at least 12 weeks
             within 12 months prior to screening, of which MTX must have been at a stable dose of
             10-20 mg/wk for at least 12 weeks prior to screening. All other DMARDs should be given
             at standard therapeutic dose.

          -  Patients who satisfy swollen joint count (SJC) ≥ 6 (66 joint count) and tender joint
             count (TJC) ≥ 8 (68 joint count) at screening and baseline.

          -  C-reactive protein (CRP) level ≥ 1 mg/dl or an erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) ≥
             28 mm/hour at screening and at baseline.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients who have received a major surgery including joint surgery 8 weeks prior to
             the screening or are scheduled to be operated within 6 months after the enrolment.

          -  Patients with rheumatoid autoimmune disease other than RA, including but not limited
             to SLE(system lupus erythematosus), or significant systemic involvement secondary to
             RA.

          -  Patients who belong to the Class IV of the ACR classification criteria for functional
             status of RA. (ACR Amended Criteria for the Classification of Functional Capacity in
             Rheumatoid Arthritis; Class IV: Largely or wholly incapacitated with patient bedridden
             or confined to wheel chair, permitting little or no self-care).

          -  Patients with a history of hypersensitivity to human, humanized or murine monoclonal
             antibodies or patients with contraindication for them.

          -  Patients who currently have or have a history of recurrence of bacterial,
             viral,fungal, or mycobacterial infections or other infectious diseases;
             tuberculosis(TB),atypical mycobacterial disease, clinically significant granulomatous
             disease on chest radiograph, hepatitis B, hepatitis C, or herpes zoster and etc.
             However, a patient with hand &amp; foot fungal infections can participate.
