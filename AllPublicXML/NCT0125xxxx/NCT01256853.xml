    <description>The starting dose will be 5 x 107 plaque forming units (pfu) given by intradermal vaccination. Cohorts of three patients will receive escalating doses of the vaccine (100%, 100%, 67% and 50%). The dose escalation scheme is 5 x 107 pfu, 1 x 108 pfu, 2 x 108 pfu, 3.3 x 108 pfu, 5 x 108pfu. This will be dependant on toxicity.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Histologically confirmed NPC, in which the presence of EBV within the malignant cells
             has been demonstrated by (1) EBER (EBV early RNA) in situ hybridisation in more than
             50% of the malignant cells, or (2) undifferentiated or poorly differentiated carcinoma
             histology in association with a raised serum titer of IgA to EBV VCA.

               -  calculated creatinine clearance &gt; 50ml/min Female patients of child-bearing
                  potential are eligible, provided they have a negative pregnancy test prior to
                  enrolment and agree to use appropriate medically approved contraception during
                  the study up to six months after the last vaccination.

          -  Male patients must agree to use appropriate medically approved contraception during
             the study up to six months after the last vaccination.

        Exclusion Criteria:

             entry.

          -  Pregnant and lactating women.

          -  Ongoing toxic manifestations of previous treatment. Exceptions to this are alopecia or
             certain Grade 1 toxicities which in the opinion of the Investigator and Cancer
             Research UK should not exclude the patient.

          -  Major thoracic and/or abdominal surgery in the preceding four weeks from which the
             patient has not yet recovered.

          -  Patients with any other condition which in the Investigator's opinion would not make
             the patient a good candidate for the clinical trial.
