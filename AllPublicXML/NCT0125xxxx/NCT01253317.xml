  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators are recruiting children for a research study using a medication known as
      IGF-1 (mecasermin or INCRELEX) to see if it improves the health of children with Rett
      syndrome (RTT). To participate in the study your child must be female, between the ages of 2
      to 12 and have a genetic diagnosis (MECP2 deletion or mutation) of Rett Syndrome. As you may
      know, there is no treatment for this illness. Currently, the standard management of Rett
      syndrome is supportive, which means attempting to prevent complications and treatment of
      symptoms.

      This study involves testing an investigational drug, which means that even though IGF-1 is
      approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for use in children, it has not been used
      before to treat Rett syndrome specifically. Information from this research will help
      determine whether the drug should be approved by the FDA in the future for the treatment of
      Rett Syndrome.

      There are five major goals to this study:

        1. As one of the features of Rett Syndrome is unstable vital signs, the investigators are
           trying to determine if IGF-1 has any effect on normalizing your child's pulse, blood
           pressure and breathing pattern.

        2. The safety of IGF-1 in children with Rett syndrome. The study personnel will ask you to
           complete a medication diary and side effect reporting form on a regular basis. They will
           assist you in completing this by telephone interviews. Your child will undergo 2 lumbar
           punctures performed at the bedside in the clinical research facility. In addition,
           laboratory tests will be performed throughout the study to evaluate the safety of IGF-1.
           These will be blood tests similar to those provided in routine clinical care. Your child
           will undergo regular non-invasive comprehensive physical examinations including
           neurological and eye examination, tonsil evaluation, electrocardiograms (ECG),
           measurement of height, weight and head circumference.

        3. IGF-1 may improve your child's behavior, communication and speech. In order to measure
           this, the investigators will evaluate your child once during each month of treatment
           with neurodevelopmental assessments and a neurological exam. Investigators will also ask
           you about her behavior and day-to-day functioning through a structured parental
           interview and questionnaires.

        4. We will examine your child's cortical function through use of electroencephalography
           (EEG) in conjunction with presentation of visual and auditory stimuli. EEG is a
           non-invasive way of recording the electrical activity of your child's brain.

        5. Children with Rett Syndrome sometimes experience &quot;flushing&quot; in their cheeks or have
           exceptionally cold hands or feet and/or abnormal perspiration. The Qsensor® is a
           non-invasive device worn on a fabric bracelet that continually measures your child's
           perspiration level and body temperature. We would like to use the Qsensor® to determine
           whether or not IGF-1 improves these symptoms.

      There are two treatment periods in the trial. The multiple ascending dose (MAD) period is an
      intensive 4-week pharmacokinetic study which will require 3 inpatient stays and 4 half-day
      outpatient visits. During in-patient sessions, an IV line will be placed for frequent blood
      samples. A lumbar puncture will be performed by a physician at the beginning and again at the
      end of the MAD. The primary goal of the MAD is to determine the safety of IGF-1 therapy for
      girls with RTT. As such, the investigators will ask that you monitor your child's blood sugar
      levels using a glucometer. At the end of the MAD, you will have the option of enrolling your
      daughter in an additional 20 weeks of open-label IGF-1 treatment.

    <description>Apnea indices were compared from pre-MAD (prior to initiating treatment) to post-OLE (after 20 weeks of IGF-1 therapy). A negative value indicates a reduction in apnea index; representing an improved outcome. Apnea Index is defined as the number of apneas (≥ 10 seconds in length) occuring within one hour. The Apnea Index is calculated by dividing the number of qualifying apneic events by the number of hours in which they occurred. An apnea index greater than or equal to 5 is considered clinically significant by the American Academy of Sleep Medicine (AASM).</description>

          <title>Open-label IGF-1 Treatment</title>
          <description>Twelve girls with MECP2 mutations participated in the 4-week multiple ascending dose (MAD) period of open-label treatment with IGF-1 (mecasermin). The MAD focused on obtaining PK data, determining cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) penetration, evaluating safety and tolerability, and estimating feasibility of automated cardiorespiratory measures as biomarkers. Mecasermin was escalated over a 4-week period, beginning with twice daily injections of 40 mcg/kg the first week, 80 mcg/kg the second week, and 120 mcg/kg during the third and fourth weeks. CSF samples were obtained prior to initiating treatment and after completing the fourth week.
10 of these subjects went on to complete the open label extension (OLE). The OLE was designed to obtain additional information on safety, tolerability, and cardiorespiratory measures after 20-weeks of treatment, as well as preliminary data on neurologic and behavioral parameters. During the 20-week OLE subjects were evaluated every 5 weeks.</description>

            <description>Twelve girls with MECP2 mutations participated in the 4-week multiple ascending dose (MAD) period of open-label treatment with IGF-1 (mecasermin). The MAD focused on obtaining PK data, determining cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) penetration, evaluating safety and tolerability, and estimating feasibility of automated cardiorespiratory measures as biomarkers. Mecasermin was escalated over a 4-week period, beginning with twice daily injections of 40 mcg/kg the first week, 80 mcg/kg the second week, and 120 mcg/kg during the third and fourth weeks. CSF samples were obtained prior to initiating treatment and after completing the fourth week.
10 of these subjects went on to complete the open label extension (OLE). The OLE was designed to obtain additional information on safety, tolerability, and cardiorespiratory measures after 20-weeks of treatment, as well as preliminary data on neurologic and behavioral parameters. During the 20-week OLE subjects were evaluated every 5 weeks.</description>

        <description>Apnea indices were compared from pre-MAD (prior to initiating treatment) to post-OLE (after 20 weeks of IGF-1 therapy). A negative value indicates a reduction in apnea index; representing an improved outcome. Apnea Index is defined as the number of apneas (≥ 10 seconds in length) occuring within one hour. The Apnea Index is calculated by dividing the number of qualifying apneic events by the number of hours in which they occurred. An apnea index greater than or equal to 5 is considered clinically significant by the American Academy of Sleep Medicine (AASM).</description>
