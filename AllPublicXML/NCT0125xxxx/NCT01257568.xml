      This study will be an evaluation of the Rejuvenate® Modular Hip System for primary total hip
      replacement (THR) with a cementless application in a consecutive series of patients who meet
      the eligibility criteria. Subjects will be evaluated for freedom of hip revision at 5 years
      and clinical outcomes for up to 10 years after surgery.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patient has signed an IRB approved, study specific Informed Patient Consent Form.

          -  Patient is a male or non-pregnant female age 18 years or older at time of study device
             implantation.

          -  Patient has primary diagnosis of Non-Inflammatory Degenerative Joint Disease (NIDJD).

          -  Patient is a candidate for a primary cementless total hip replacement.

          -  Patient is willing and able to comply with postoperative scheduled clinical and
             radiographic evaluations and rehabilitation.

          -  Patient's operative femur templates to Rejuvenate® Modular Stem size 7-12.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patient has a Body Mass Index (BMI) ≥ 40.

          -  Patient has an active or suspected latent infection in or about the affected hip joint
             at time of study device implantation.

          -  Patient has a neuromuscular or neurosensory deficiency, which limits the ability to
             evaluate the safety and efficacy of the device.

          -  Patient is diagnosed with a systemic disease (e.g. Lupus Erythematosus) or a metabolic
             disorder (e.g. Paget's Disease) leading to progressive bone deterioration.

          -  Patient is immunologically suppressed or receiving steroids in excess of normal
             physiological requirements (e.g. &gt; 30 days).

          -  Patient requires revision surgery of a previously implanted total hip replacement or
             hip fusion to the affected joint.

          -  Patient has a known sensitivity to device materials.

          -  Patient is a prisoner.
