    <textblock>
      The most important prognostic indicator for the breast cancer patient is the axillary lymph
      node status. With the introduction of the sentinel lymph node biopsy, many women were spared
      the morbidity of a full axillary lymph node dissection(ALND) while having the axillary nodes
      assessed with a low false negative rate. Approximately 30% of women who undergo ALND
      experience shoulder/arm morbidity including numbness, pain, weakness and decreased range of
      motion. In addition, the sentinel lymph node dissection (SLND) held the promise that women
      with early stage breast cancer would be able to avoid the dreaded morbidity associated with
      axillary lymph node dissections including lymphedema, decreased range of motion and pain.
      Since the adoption of SLN, numerous papers have documented that SLN is superior to ALND.
      However, patients who undergo SLN still have a significant amount of pain with this
      procedure. There are few published studies which objectively assess the subjective and
      objective symptoms of SLND.

      Pulsed electromagnetic fields (PEMF) have been shown to be effective in the treatment of
      fractures and spinal fusion, relief of pain in acute sprains and whiplash injuries,
      improvement of skin blood flow, healing of venous stasis ulcers, and reduction of
      postmastectomy lymphedema. Indeed, radiofrequency PEMF devices are FDA approved for pain and
      edema relief. PEMF devices are economical and disposable, and can be incorporated
      unobtrusively in standard post-op dressings. We have recently reported, in a double-blind,
      placebo-controlled study on breast reduction, that post-op PEMF therapy produced a
      significant decrease in pain and pain medication use, along with a concomitant decrease in
      IL1-beta in the wound bed.1 The current pilot study will be designed to determine if PEMF
      treatment, given in addition to standard of care, can reduce post-operative discomfort and
      morbidity after lumpectomy and SLND, or lumpectomy and ALND. Lumpectomy and ALND/SLND
      patients enrolled in the double-blind, placebo-controlled study will undergo standard
      surgery, but will be randomized to one of two groups: the treatment group with a PEMF coil
      placed around the arm and the control group with a coil that delivers no PMF. We expect
      postoperative pain to be reduced in the PEMF-treated patients as well as improved arm
      mobility and strength. The use of PEMF might reduce the need for narcotic pain medications
      and their side effects of sedation, nausea, and vomiting. It may also reduce costs related to
      arm morbidity.

      In the treatment arm, the PEMF would be automatically delivered for 15 minutes every two
      hours for one month. The manufacturer (Ivivi Technologies, Inc., Northvale, NJ) has already
      designed a lightweight, disposable device that can be placed around the patient's arm and
      taped in place. The patient would keep the device in place for two weeks, when they return
      for a followup visit and receive a fresh device to wear for an additional two weeks.

    <description>Pain will be the primary outcome measured by patient level of pain as quantified by a visual analog scale with written descriptions, and amount of pain medication used hourly until the patient is discharged (up to a maximum of six hours post-op), then daily for a total of two weeks post-op. The VAS pain scale ranges from 0 (no pain) to 10 (worst possible pain).</description>

    <description>No participants were assessed for this secondary outcome measure: patient self-assessment of shoulder and arm symptoms before and after PEMF. No data was collected/calculated, and hence the data cannot be summarized to include in the data tables. Patients did not complete the necessary surveys assessing their shoulder and arm symptoms; therefore, no meaningful results could be derived since there were no surveys to compare before and after PEMF data points.</description>

    <measure>Clinical Assessment of Shoulder and Arm Symptoms Before and After PEMF</measure>
    <time_frame>Pre- and Post-Operative Period</time_frame>
    <description>No participants were assessed for this secondary outcome measure: clinical assessment of shoulder and arm symptoms before and after PEMF. No data was collected/calculated, and hence the data cannot be summarized to include in the data tables. There was a lack of post-clinical assessment data as well as poor patient compliance with the 14 day mark follow up. Therefore, no meaningful results could be derived since there was no quantifiable means to compare before and after PEMF data points.</description>

    <description>No participants were assessed for this secondary outcome measure: lymphedema. No data was collected/calculated, and hence the data cannot be summarized to include in the data tables. No meaningful quantifiable data could be obtained on degree of lymphedema, and thus effect of PEMF intervention could not be analyzed.</description>

    <description>No participants were assessed for this secondary outcome measure: narcotic pain medications. No data was collected/calculated, and hence the data cannot be summarized to include in the data tables. Patients were instructed to complete logs at home indicating narcotic pain medications, and patients did not submit necessary logs assessing need for pain medications and level of nausea and vomiting; therefore, no meaningful data could be analyzed.</description>

        <description>Pain will be the primary outcome measured by patient level of pain as quantified by a visual analog scale with written descriptions, and amount of pain medication used hourly until the patient is discharged (up to a maximum of six hours post-op), then daily for a total of two weeks post-op. The VAS pain scale ranges from 0 (no pain) to 10 (worst possible pain).</description>

        <population>Only 7 patients completed the study by quantifying the level of their pain post-operatively on a visual analog scale from 0-10. The medication logs and two week post-op analogs could not be utilized for the analysis since all 7 patients did not complete these logs.</population>

The manufacturer (Ivivi Technologies, Inc., Northvale, NJ) has already designed a lightweight, disposable device that can be placed around the patient's arm and taped in place. The patient would keep the device in place for two weeks, when they return for a followup visit and receive a fresh device to wear for an additional two weeks.</description>
