  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Retinitis pigmentosa is a genetically determined disease consisting of progressive
      centripetal retinal degeneration starting in the rods outer segments. Its prevalence is
      1:4000 people and is the fourth most common blinding disease in Israel in 2004 [7% of all
      blindness]. The investigators tried to treat a non-progressive form of the disease [Fundus
      Albipunctatus] by oral therapy of the food supplement made from alga Dunaliella bardawil
      composed of approximately 50% 9-cis β-carotene. The alga Dunaliella bardawil accumulates high
      concentration of β -carotene when grown under appropriate conditions. The β -carotene of the
      alga is composed of approximately 50% of all-trans - β carotene and 50% 9-cis β -carotene.

      The 9-cis β -carotene has shown to be a precursor of 9-cis retinoic acid both in-vitro in
      human intestinal mucosa and in-vivo in a ferret, perfuse with 9-cis b-carotene. The night
      vision, as measured objectively by electroretinography (ERG) more than doubled in six
      patients tested. The visual field was also improved significantly.

    <description>Using the protocol of the International Society for Clinical Electrophysiology of Vision and the UTAS 3000 system (LKC Technologies, Gaithersburg, MD), we recorded full-field electroretinographic responses from both eyes of each patient. The scotopic conditions, after 30 minutes of dark adaptation we recorded the maximal scotopic response. The b-wave amplitude responses will be messured in each eye.</description>
