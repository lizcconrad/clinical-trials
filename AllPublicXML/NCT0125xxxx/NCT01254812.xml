    <textblock>
      TAP-block (Transverse Abdominal Plane) block is a method of regional anesthesia used after
      abdominal surgery. The method is often applied ultra-sound guided.

      In our department, the so-called bilateral dual TAP-block (BD-TAP-block) has been developed.
      This includes injection of local anesthetics at four sites on the abdominal wall, aiming at
      the best possible spread of the nerve block.

      Clinical experience shows satisfying results on pain relieve using the nerve block, i.e the
      sensory nerves of the abdominal wall are successfully blocked. However, to our knowledge,
      clinical investigations regarding the effect on the muscles of the abdominal wall has never
      been executed.

      Patients with chronic lung diseases, who are prone to catch pneumonia post surgery, may have
      to be able to use accessory muscle groups to prevent pulmonary phlegm stagnation. Therefore
      it would be inappropriate if the motor nerves supplying these muscles were too, affected by
      the nerve block.

      Our clinical experience has so far not given us suspicion or indication that the motor nerves
      become blocked, although these nerves are situated in the same muscle layer as the sensory
      branches.

      Hence the investigators would like to examine on healthy, male subjects, whether application
      of a bilateral-dual TAP-block effects their ability to perform peak-flow and inspiratory and
      expiratory pressure. Our study hypothesis is:

      There is no clinically relevant difference in the spread of results of pulmonary tests (peak
      flow et.c.) before and after application of bilateral dual TAP-block.
