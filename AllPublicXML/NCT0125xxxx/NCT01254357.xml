    <textblock>
      As part of Clinical Trials.Gov ID:NCT00253292 a psychometrically sound outcomes instrument
      was developed to study the outcomes of burn survivors in the 19-30 year old age group. This
      workgroup has come together to re-examine the data collected during the previous study and
      determine next steps in understanding the recovery for this population.

      This study looks to understand previously collected outcomes scores. Identifying young adult
      burned patients at risk for poor outcomes remains an under-published field of study. We
      strive to identify problem areas for this population before they adversely effect their
      quality of life. How are these 19-30 year olds different from their non-burned counterparts
      and what interventions can we provide to equalize the balance?
