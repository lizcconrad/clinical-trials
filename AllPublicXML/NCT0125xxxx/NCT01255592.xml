    <measure>Transition Dyspnea Index (TDI) at End of Treatment (Day 28)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to end of treatment (Day 28)</time_frame>
    <description>TDI measures changes in dyspnea severity from the baseline as established by the Baseline Dyspnea Index (BDI). TDI is an interviewer-administered rating of severity of dyspnea that assesses Change in Functional Impairment, Change in Magnitude of Task, and Change in Magnitude of Effort domains on a 7-point scale ranging from -3 (major deterioration) to +3 (major improvement). Total score ranges from -9 to +9. The lower the score, the more deterioration in severity of dyspnea.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline for the Morning PEF and Evening PEF of the Bronkotest Diary Card</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Last 7 days on treatment</time_frame>
    <description>The Bronkotest diary card is a paper based diary card that was filled out by patients daily, recording values from morning and evening peak expiratory flow (PEF) measurements and answering 8 questions on signs and symptoms. Summary statistics for baseline (mean of the last 7 days prior to first dose) and change (mean of the last 7 days on treatment - baseline) only contain patients included in the analysis. For symptom scores a decrease is an improvement, for PEF an increase is an improvement.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline for the Symptom Scores of the Bronkotest Diary Card</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Last 7 days on treatment</time_frame>
    <description>The Bronkotest diary card is a paper based diary card that was filled out by patients daily, recording values from morning and evening peak expiratory flow (PEF) measurements and answering 8 questions on signs and symptoms. Symptom scores were recorded for night-time symptoms, breathing, sputum colour, sputum amount, sputum type, wellbeing, number of puffs of inhalers, and cough, generally scored on a scale from 0 (no symptoms) to 4 (worst symptoms). Summary statistics for baseline (mean of the last 7 days prior to first dose) and change (mean of the last 7 days on treatment - baseline) only contain patients included in the analysis. For symptom scores a decrease is an improvement, for PEF an increase is an improvement.</description>

    <description>SGRQ-C total score shows the impact of COPD on patient's health status, and expressed as a percentage of impairment with scale from 0 (best health status) to 100 (worst possible status). The SGRQ-C contains 3 domains:
Symptom (distress due to respiratory symptoms), Activity (disturbance of physical activity) and Impact (overall impact on daily life and well being). All three domains with scale from 0 (best health status) to 100 (worst possible status).</description>

        <title>Transition Dyspnea Index (TDI) at End of Treatment (Day 28)</title>
        <description>TDI measures changes in dyspnea severity from the baseline as established by the Baseline Dyspnea Index (BDI). TDI is an interviewer-administered rating of severity of dyspnea that assesses Change in Functional Impairment, Change in Magnitude of Task, and Change in Magnitude of Effort domains on a 7-point scale ranging from -3 (major deterioration) to +3 (major improvement). Total score ranges from -9 to +9. The lower the score, the more deterioration in severity of dyspnea.</description>

          <title>Transition Dyspnea Index (TDI) at End of Treatment (Day 28)</title>
          <description>TDI measures changes in dyspnea severity from the baseline as established by the Baseline Dyspnea Index (BDI). TDI is an interviewer-administered rating of severity of dyspnea that assesses Change in Functional Impairment, Change in Magnitude of Task, and Change in Magnitude of Effort domains on a 7-point scale ranging from -3 (major deterioration) to +3 (major improvement). Total score ranges from -9 to +9. The lower the score, the more deterioration in severity of dyspnea.</description>

        <description>The Bronkotest diary card is a paper based diary card that was filled out by patients daily, recording values from morning and evening peak expiratory flow (PEF) measurements and answering 8 questions on signs and symptoms. Symptom scores were recorded for night-time symptoms, breathing, sputum colour, sputum amount, sputum type, wellbeing, number of puffs of inhalers, and cough, generally scored on a scale from 0 (no symptoms) to 4 (worst symptoms). Summary statistics for baseline (mean of the last 7 days prior to first dose) and change (mean of the last 7 days on treatment - baseline) only contain patients included in the analysis. For symptom scores a decrease is an improvement, for PEF an increase is an improvement.</description>

        <description>SGRQ-C total score shows the impact of COPD on patient's health status, and expressed as a percentage of impairment with scale from 0 (best health status) to 100 (worst possible status). The SGRQ-C contains 3 domains:
Symptom (distress due to respiratory symptoms), Activity (disturbance of physical activity) and Impact (overall impact on daily life and well being). All three domains with scale from 0 (best health status) to 100 (worst possible status).</description>
        <time_frame>Baseline and end of treatment (Day 28)</time_frame>
        <population>The efficacy analysis set included all patients who were randomized (defined as having a randomization code recorded on the demography case report form), received at least one dose of study medication, and contributed sufficient data for at least one efficacy endpoint.</population>
