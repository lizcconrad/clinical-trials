  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      LY2216684 is being studied as adjunctive treatment for MDD in patients who are partial
      responders to SSRIs. Sertraline is a medication that is widely used to treat MDD and it is a
      known substrate of CYP450s, including CYP2D6, CYP2C19 and CYP3A4, and a modest inhibitor of
      CYP2D6. Based on the diversity of hepatic metabolic clearance pathways for LY2216684 and its
      elimination by the kidney, it is expected that CYP2D6 inhibition by sertraline will not
      result in a substantial change in the PK profile of LY2216684. LY2216684 is only known to be
      a moderate inhibitor of CYP2C19 so it is unlikely that coadministration of sertraline with
      LY2216684 will result in a clinically meaningful change in the PK of sertraline. This study
      is being conducted to test these hypotheses.
