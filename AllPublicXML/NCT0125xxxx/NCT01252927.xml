    <textblock>
      The main objective of the proposed study is to evaluate the efficacy of a gatekeeper training
      suicide intervention program, Applied Suicide Intervention Skills Training (ASIST), in
      improving medical students' knowledge about suicide intervention, impact of attitudes on
      someone at risk for suicide and competent use of intervention skills to recognize risk and
      intervene effectively compared to medical education as usual. This research project will be
      undertaken using a randomized-controlled trial design. Questionnaires and objective
      structured clinical examinations using simulated patients will be completed at three time
      points: 1) before training, 2) after training, and 3) at one year following the training.
      Medical students' clinical skills in recognizing risk and intervening with simulated
      patients, as well as knowledge about suicide intervention and the impact of attitudes on
      someone at risk for suicide will be evaluated.

      The current proposal plans to implement and evaluate a secondary suicide intervention skills
      training program (gatekeeper training) in medical school students in Winnipeg, Manitoba,
      Canada. The main objective of the current proposal is to evaluate the effectiveness of a
      gatekeeper training program, Applied Suicide Intervention Skills Training (ASIST), in
      improving medical students' intervention skills with suicidal patients compared to training
      as usual. Secondary aims include comparisons of changes in knowledge, perceived competence
      and attitudes around suicide.

      Findings from previous studies have demonstrated a significant positive effect of gatekeeper
      training on suicide prevention attitudes, skills and knowledge. As well, general studies in
      medical education reveal that students who have been able to practice, observe, and receive
      feedback in small groups showed an improvement in skills and confidence over those who were
      given didactic teaching only. Therefore, the investigators anticipate that the ASIST training
      program will significantly improve medical students' knowledge about suicide intervention,
      and will increase their recognition and response to suicide risk compared to education as
      usual. The investigators also expect that ASIST training will help them to understand the
      impact of attitudes on suicide prevention, and will increase their perceived competence and
      ability to recognize and treat a suicidal individual compare over training as usual. It is
      hypothesized that medical students trained in ASIST will differ significantly in their
      ability to correctly recognize and intervene with suicidal individuals based on their use of
      a standardized suicide intervention model and objective assessment using standardized
      patients.

    <description>Four Objective Structured Clinical Examinations (OSCEs) stations were developed for each time point in the study. All student-patient interactions were videotaped. Raters blind to the student's group assignment rated the videos according to a checklist of desired gatekeeper behaviors based on the key components of the ASIST program. A total score was the sum of all behaviours performed.</description>

    <description>The Suicide Intervention Response Inventory (SIRI-2) is a self-administered questionnaire designed to measure competence in choosing appropriate responses to a series of clinical scenarios with suicidal individuals. It contains 25 items, each of which consists of a &quot;client&quot; remark and two &quot;helper&quot; responses. Respondents were instructed to evaluate the appropriateness of each of the two helper responses on a 7-point Likert scale, ranging from +3 (highly appropriate response) through 0 (neither appropriate nor inappropriate response) to -3 (highly inappropriate response). Ratings by a group of expert suicidologists and crisis interventionists provided a mean expert response criterion against which individual respondents are compared. The sum of the absolute value of the differences between the students' rating and the mean response from experts was calculated to obtain an overall score of how well the student performed with respect to expert responses.</description>

    <description>Four Objective Structured Clinical Examinations (OSCEs) stations were developed for each time point in the study. All student-patient interactions were videotaped. Raters blind to the student's group assignment rated the videos. Raters were asked to give a global rating score according to the performance of each student in each of the 3 key areas trained by the ASIST program, and a global rating of the student's performance on the station in general. The sum of all global ratings was used to determine a total score.</description>

The IPS Rating Scale used 13 items to evaluate communication skills in the OSCE setting between patient and student from the patient's perspective, and included concepts such as empathy, respect, sensitivity, and listening skills. Each item was scored on a 7-point Likert scale from strongly agree to strongly disagree. The sum score of all 13 items was used for analysis.</description>

    <description>The gatekeeper training intervention group received the Applied Suicide Intervention Skills Training (ASIST) 10.0 in addition to TAU. ASIST is a two-day (fourteen hour), intensive, interactive and practice-dominated course aimed at enabling people to recognize risk and learn how to intervene immediately to prevent suicide. The intervention was offered to students on a weekend and was conducted by three senior ASIST trainers and one junior trainer, with two trainers assigned to each training group.</description>
