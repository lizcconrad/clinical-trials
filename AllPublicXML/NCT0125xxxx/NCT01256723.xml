      The main purpose of this study is to observe the incidence of major adverse cardiac and
      cerebrovascular events (MACCE), target vessel failure (TVF), target vessel revascularization
      (TVR) and stent thrombosis out to 5 years after the procedure in patients who underwent
      percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with everolimus-eluting stents for unprotected left
      main coronary artery (ULMCA) disease and lesions involving the ULMCA in Japan. The
      investigators will also establish a method of adjustment to the Japanese version of the
      SYNTAX score by conducting an assessment using the SYNTAX score recently reported in the US
      and Europe as well as the EuroSCORE, and by clarifying the differences of PCI procedures and
      treatment results in Japan with those reported in the US and Europe.
