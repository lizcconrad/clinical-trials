  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a National, Multicentre, Observational Registry to study Adherence and Long Term
      Outcomes of Therapy in paediatric subjects using easypod™ electromechanical device for growth
      hormone treatment from hospital in Korea in order to assess the level of adherence of
      subjects receiving SAIZEN® via easypod™.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Subjects will be enrolled in a multicenter, longitudinal, observational registry.
      Parents/subjects will provide their Informed Consent/assent to upload their data for
      population-based analyses and optionally to adhere to a patient adherence support program
      designed to improve their adherence and, ultimately, clinical outcomes. Adherence data will
      be primarily derived from the easypod™ device combined with physician data entry of outcome
      measures. Data will be collected retrospectively and prospectively. This will allow the
      establishment of adherence profiles and explore the hypothesis that patient adherence support
      programs improve adherence and subsequent clinical outcomes. Collected data will be also
      analyzed in a multinational pooled analysis of comparable national studies.

      Primary Objective:

      To assess the level of adherence of subjects receiving SAIZEN via easypod™

      Secondary Objectives:

        -  To describe the impact of adherence on clinical outcomes for subject receiving SAIZEN
           via easypod™

        -  To identify adherence subject profiling

        -  To assess the impact of adherence on Insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) (i.e. above,
           below or within normal ranges)

        -  Temporal profile of IGF-1 and IGFBP-3 levels

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Administered growth hormone via the easypod™ electromechanical device according to
             Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC)

          -  Over the age of &gt;2 years

          -  Under &lt;18 years of age, or over 18 without fusion of growth plates

          -  Parent's or guardian's written informed consent, given before entering data into the
             registry, with the understanding that the subject or parent/guardian may withdraw
             consent at any time without prejudice to future medical care. If the child is old
             enough to read and write, a separate assent form will be given as defined in the
             appropriate jurisdiction of each country.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects taking growth hormone in whom growth plates have fused (i.e. for taking
             growth hormone for it's metabolic effects)

          -  Contra-indications to SAIZEN® as defined in the Summary of Product Characteristics
             (SmPC)

          -  Use of an investigational drug or participation in an interventional clinical study
