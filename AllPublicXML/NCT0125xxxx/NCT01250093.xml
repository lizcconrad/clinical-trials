      In order to investigate the therapeutic effect of acupuncture on chronic neck myofacial pain
      syndrome, the investigaotrs designed a pilot study of a single-blind randomized controlled
      trial. A total of 34 chronic neck myofacial pain syndrome patients were selected from
      Department of Neurology of Nantou Hospital, Department of Health. The age ranged from 18 to
      85, and all subjects were full informed consent and volunteers. They were divided into two
      groups of 17 subjects randomly as follows: acupuncture group, acupuncture stainless needles
      were inserted into bilateral Fenhchi, Jianliao and Houxi acupoints, respectively. The
      acupuncture needles then were manual twist and de Qi, and remain for 20 min; sham acupuncture
      group, the methods were identical the acupuncture group, but acupuncture stainless needles
      were inserted into subcutaneous tissue only. All the subjects were treated with acupuncture
      two times per week and continuously three weeks, i.e. Six times acupuncture treatment. The
      therapeutic effect of acupuncture was assessed before and finishing six times acupuncture
      treatment, and four weeks and twelve weeks after stopping acupuncture, respectively. The
      index of acupuncture therapeutic effect was according to the range of motion (ROM) of the
      cervical spine, the intensity of pain (Short-Form McGill Pain Questionnaire; SF-MPQ) and
      quality of life (SF-36). The investigators expect acupuncture apply to bilateral Fenhchi,
      Jianliao and Houxi acupoints may relief the pain and motion of chronic neck facial pain
      syndrome patient, and also improves the life quality.
