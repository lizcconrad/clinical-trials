  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It is particularly important that thorough gut cleansing is achieved prior to the colonoscopy
      for the procedure to be successful. Polyethylene glycol plus electrolyte (PEG+E) solutions
      are well established as safe and effective agents for gut cleansing and Norgine has
      successfully developed a low volume (2 litre) PEG+E gut lavage solution. The efficacy and
      safety of this solution is similar to the standard 4 litre PEG+E, but with improved patient
      acceptance.

      Tolerance, acceptability and satisfaction with the cleansing agent plays an important role in
      subjects' compliance with gut preparation procedure. The study medication NRL0706 is
      identical to the PEG+E-containing gut lavage solution commonly used in clinical practice,
      with the exception that the flavour has been modified from lemon to orange. This study is to
      investigate the tolerability, acceptability, safety and efficacy of a single dose of NRL0706
      (MOVIPREP Orange) in subjects without gastrointestinal symptoms undergoing colonoscopy for
      colon cancer screening.
