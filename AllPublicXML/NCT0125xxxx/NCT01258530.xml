      This is a study in healthy adult volunteers to assess the bioequivalence of over-encapsulated
      oseltamivir capsules to commercially available oseltamivir capsules. Both formulations will
      be administered in the fasting state.

             of cholecystectomy, peptic ulceration, inflammatory bowel disease or pancreatitis
             should be excluded.

          -  The subject's systolic blood pressure is outside the range of 90-140 mmHg, or

        ventricular ectopic beats).sinus pauses &gt; 3 seconds, or other significant arrhythmia which,
        in the opinion of the principal investigator and GSK medical monitor, will interfere with
        the safety of the individual subject.
