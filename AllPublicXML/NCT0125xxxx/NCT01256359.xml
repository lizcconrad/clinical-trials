  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomised, double-blind placebo controlled phase 2 trial. Patient will be randomly
      assigned 1:1 between 2 treatment arms. They will receive either docetaxel 75mg/m2 IV and
      placebo given bd, or AZD6244 75mg bd daily with docetaxel 75mg/m2 IV. Docetaxel will be
      administered every 3 weeks for a maximum 6 cycles, but AZD6244/placebo may be continued
      beyond this, until disease progression. The objective is to assess whether the combination of
      AZD6244 with docetaxel is worthy of evaluation in a definitive randomised study, with the
      null hypothesis being that the combination has activity similar to that of docetaxel alone in
      this population. After consent has been obtained mutational analysis of tumour BRAF will be
      performed on archival tumour tissue, where this information is not already known, to assess
      eligibility for the study. If there is no archival tissue a fresh biopsy will be requested
      from the patient. A blood sample will also be taken for future genetic analysis. Once taking
      part in the trial patients will need to attend their oncology unit regularly for monitoring
      and the delivery of treatment. Patients will undergo complete physical examination at
      screening, on C1D1, C1D8, C1D15, C2D1, C2D8 and day 1 of every subsequent cycle. Blood for
      haematology, biochemistry and clotting will be taken at each of these visits. A 12 lead ECG
      will be performed at screening . Disease assessment will be by CT scanning using modified
      RECIST criteria after 9 and 18 weeks, then every 3 months until disease progression.
