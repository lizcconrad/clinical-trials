      The objective of this study is to determine the safety and effectiveness of the AQUACEL® Ag
      Surgical Dressing (treatment group) as compared to prepackaged island wound dressings
      consisting of traditional tape and gauze (control group) for total hip and total knee
      arthroplasty.
