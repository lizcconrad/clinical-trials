      Background:

      - An important new area of brain tumor research is the development of tumor and brain stem
      cell lines. Successful growth of these cell lines requires obtaining large volumes of fresh
      tumor and brain tissue, which is best accomplished by harvesting whole brains from recently
      deceased patients. These cell lines will help researchers understand how these tumors develop
      and will also help identify new targets for treatment. Researchers are interested in
      conducting a pilot study of planned inpatient hospice care with timely brain tumor tissue
      harvest at the time of death.

      Objectives:

        -  To provide high-quality end of life inpatient hospice care for patients with untreatable
           brain tumors.

        -  To procure brain and tumor tissue shortly after time of death in order to derive viable
           tumor and neural stem cell lines for research purposes.

      Eligibility:

        -  Individuals at least 18 years of age who have an untreatable primary brain or central
           nervous system tumor, are able to give informed consent (either their own or through a
           designated power of attorney), and have agreed to a Do Not Resuscitate order and Consent
           for Autopsy as part of the end-of-life care plan.

        -  HIV-positive individuals or those suspected of having infectious cerebritis are not
           eligible because of the potential for contamination of brain tissue.

      Design:

        -  Participants will be enrolled in inpatient hospice admission to the National Institutes
           of Health Clinical Center either from home or from an outside hospital once a study
           investigator estimates an expected survival of less than 2 weeks.

        -  Participants will receive palliative care at the Clinical Center. Care will be tailored
           to each participant depending on the information provided in the individual's
           end-of-life care plan.

        -  Supportive medications such as antiseizure medications and pain relievers will be
           administered as appropriate.

        -  At the time of death, researchers will follow standard procedures for notifying next of
           kin and will collect brain tissue and tumor samples from the deceased.

        -  Following tissue collection, the deceased will be released for autopsy and funeral
           procedures.

      BACKGROUND:

      - Patients treated by the Neuro-Oncology Branch (NOB) for their brain tumors unfortunately
      and commonly succumb to their disease. They and their loved ones often seek a way of adding
      meaning and utility to their death by agreeing to donate brain tumor tissue for laboratory
      research that may serve the medical community, and ultimately other patients, through better
      understanding of these rare diseases. Important new avenues of brain tumor research includes
      the molecular characterization of tumor tissue, and the development of tumor and neural stem
      cell lines. Successful growth of these cell lines requires acquisition of large volumes of
      fresh tumor and brain tissue that can best be accomplished by harvesting whole brains from
      recently deceased patients. In an effort to provide high quality end of life care, with the
      additional intent of facilitating efficient donation of brain tumor tissue at the time of
      death, we are conducting a pilot study of planned inpatient hospice care incorporating timely
      brain tumor tissue procurement at the time of expiration.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Provide high quality end of life inpatient hospice care for patients dying with
           untreatable brain tumors.

        -  Procure brain and tumor tissue shortly after time of death in order to derive viable
           tumor and neural stem cell lines for research purposes.

      ELIGIBILITY:

      - Adult patients with primary brain tumors.

      DESIGN:

      - This is a pilot study to assess feasibility of procuring viable brain and tumor tissue
      proximal to the time of death. Target accrual is 10 patients for brain harvest.

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:

               1. Patients with primary brain tumors including glioblastoma multiforme (GBM),
                  gliosarcoma (GS), anaplastic astrocytoma (AA), anaplastic oligodendroglioma (AO),
                  anaplastic mixed oligoastrocytoma (AMO), low grade astrocytoma, low grade

                  deemed by the treating physician to be impaired or questionably impaired in such
