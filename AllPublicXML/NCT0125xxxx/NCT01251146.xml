  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 4, prospective, multi-centric and randomized controlled study to compare the
      effects of bisoprolol and atenolol on resting heart rate (RHR) and sympathetic nervous
      system's (SNS) activity in subjects with essential hypertension.

    <description>Baroreflex sensitivity (BRS) is an important characteristic of baroreflex control and often noninvasively assessed by relating heart rate (HR) fluctuations to blood pressure (BP) fluctuations. Heart rate goal was defined as attainment of heart rate less than or equal to 65 beats per minute (bpm).</description>

          <title>Bisoprolol</title>
          <description>Bisoprolol was administered at a dose of 5 milligram (mg) once daily for 2 weeks. If the heart rate was less than or equal to 65 beats per minute (bpm) at Week 2, then the initial dose was administered for another 2 weeks (up to Week 4). If the heart rate was greater than 65 bpm at Week 2, then the dose was further increased to 7.5 mg once daily for 2 weeks (up to Week 4). If the heart rate was less than or equal to 65 bpm at Week 4, the increased dose was administered for another 2 weeks (up to Week 6). If the heart rate was still greater than 65 bpm at Week 4, then the dose was further increased to 10 mg once daily for 2 weeks (up to Week 6). If the heart rate was less than or equal to 65 bpm at Week 6, the increased dose was administered for another 2 weeks (up to Week 8). If the heart rate was still greater than 65 bpm, then the treatment was ceased.</description>

If the heart rate still greater than 65 bpm at Week 4, then the dose was further increased to 100 mg once daily for 2 weeks (up to Week 6). If the heart rate was less than or equal to 65 bpm at Week 6, the increased dose administered for another 2 weeks. If the heart rate was still greater than 65 bpm, then the treatment was ceased.</description>
