      BACKGROUND: Adaptation to noninvasive ventilation (NIV) is a critical step for acceptability
      and efficacy of this treatment during sleep in patients with chronic respiratory failure.

      AIM: To study the variability of patient-ventilator interactions during the first nights
      after initiation to NIV. Recorded data will be analyzed in part by dedicated tools from the
      non-linear dynamics theory.

      PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with chronic respiratory failure at stable state and indicated
      to home NIV will be included. All patients will perform three polysomnographies (under
      spontaneous breathing at D1 and under NIV at D2 and D15 after NIV initiation). All
      ventilatory physiological data (pressure, flow, patient-ventilator interactions, oxygen
      saturation, non intentional leaks) will be recorded during sleep under NIV in the Sleep
      Laboratory of the Department and secondarily related to sleep architecture and quality of
      sleep.

      EXPECTED RESULTS: This study will identify objective parameters that are associated to a
      satisfactory adaptation to nocturnal NIV.
