    <textblock>
      This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of veliparib when given together
      with carboplatin and to see how well they work in treating patients with human epidermal
      growth factor 2 (HER2)-negative breast cancer that has spread to other parts of the body.
      Carboplatin kills cancer cells by damaging the deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) that lets the
      cancer cell survive and reproduce. The body has proteins that try to repair the damaged DNA.
      Veliparib may prevent these proteins from repairing the DNA so that carboplatin may be able
      to kill more tumor cells. Giving veliparib with carboplatin may kill more tumor cells than
      carboplatin alone.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the recommended phase II dose of veliparib along with carboplatin on a 14-day
      and 21-day schedule in patients with Her2 negative metastatic breast cancer that are estrogen
      receptor (ER)/progesterone receptor(PR) negative or ER and/or PR positive with defects in
      Fanconi Anemia (FA) pathway repair genes.

      II. To determine the safety and tolerability of combining veliparib on a 14-day and 21-day
      schedule with carboplatin in this patient population.

      III. To determine the preliminary efficacy of this combination in this patient population.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the pharmacodynamic endpoints of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP)
      inhibition in the tumor by using, A) 3'-[F-18]fluoro-3'-deoxythymidine positron emission
      tomography (FLT-PET) of the target lesions, B) circulating tumor cells to detect the
      induction of the histone variant gamma H2AX, and C) peripheral blood mononuclear cells to
      assess poly ADP-Ribose (PAR) levels.

      II. To determine biomarkers in the primary tumor that may predict antitumor responses to PARP
      inhibition such as breast cancer 1/2, early onset (BRCA)1/2 protein, Fanconi anemia,
      complementation group D2 (FANCD2) nuclear foci formation and expression of micro-ribonucleic
      acid (RNA) 155 (miR 155).

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of veliparib.

      Patients receive carboplatin intravenously (IV) over 1 hour on day 1 and veliparib orally
      (PO) twice daily (BID) on days 1-7 or 1-14. Courses repeat every 21 days in the absence of
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 12 weeks.

    <description>Number and severity of toxicity incidents will be tabulated. Non-hematologic toxicities will be evaluated via the ordinal Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 5.0 standard toxicity grading. Hematologic toxicity measures of thrombocytopenia, neutropenia and leukopenia will be assessed using continuous variables as the outcome measures (primarily nadir and percent change from baseline values) as well as categorization via CTCAE standard toxicity grading. Frequency distributions and other descriptive measures will form the basis of the analysis of these variables.</description>
