    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether a mindfulness-based stress reduction and
      mindful eating program will lead to reductions in abdominal fat and total weight and improve
      cell aging in overweight and obese women compared to a waitlist control group.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Obesity is the largest growing epidemic, with about 65% of Americans overweight (Flegal,
      Carroll et al. 2002). Obesity, in particular, abdominal obesity, confers increased risk for a
      host of diseases, including hypertension, Type 2 diabetes, and coronary heart disease,
      resulting in shortened life span (Fontaine, Redden et al. 2003). Psychological stress is
      widely cited anecdotally as a factor that causes people to engage in overeating, and studies
      provide strong evidence that stress can promote obesity. Stress induces selective preference
      of sweet, high-fat food and increases visceral fat depots. The telomere maintenance system
      (telomerase activity and telomere length)are markers of cellular aging and predict mortality
      (Cawthon et al, 2003)and have been linked to both psychological stress and components of the
      metabolic syndrome. The proposed study adapts a program called Mindfulness-Based Stress
      Reduction (MBSR) that has been shown to be effective in a variety of other stress-related
      conditions. Fifty overweight, pre-menopausal women at risk for the Metabolic Syndrome will be
      randomized in a 1:1 distribution to either a 3-month intervention to reduce stress and
      overeating [Craving and Lifestyle Management with Mindfulness (CALMM)] or wait list control
      group. The primary outcome measures include amounts of abdominal fat, weight, and telomerase
      activity. Data from this study are intended to provide pilot data for use in planning a
      larger randomized, controlled trial that will investigate the effects of the CALMM
      intervention on the metabolic and psychological processes assessed in this pilot study.

    <description>Whole-body dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) scans were performed to assess body fat distribution. The DEXA densitometry (GE Healthcare Lunar Prodigy, Madison, Wis, USA) was adjusted to the fan beam mode and EnCore software version 9.15 was used. The primary region of interest was fat tissue from a rectangular region in the abdominal area defined by the upper boundary of the second lumbar vertebra to the lower edge of the fourth lumbar vertebra. The vertical sides were defined as the continuation of the lateral sides of the rib cage.</description>

    <description>Cryopreserved peripheral blood nuclear cells (PBMCs) were thawed and live cells counted using a hemocytometer by the Trypan blue exclusion method. For each sample, an extract of 5000 cells per microliter was made and two concentrations, corresponding to 5000 and 10,000 cells, were assayed for each sample to ensure the assay was in the linear range. Telomerase activity was assayed by the Telomerase Repeat Amplification Protocol (TRAP) using a commercial kit (TRAPeze, Telomerase Detection kit, Upstate/ CHEMICON, Temecula, CA). Baseline and post-intervention samples for the same participant were assayed in the same batch and run on the same gel to eliminate any differences caused by reaction or procedural batch-to-batch variations. Technicians were blind to group assignment. Telomerase activity is defined as 1 unit = the amount of product from one 293T cell/10,000 PBMCs, and was quantified using the software ImageQuant 5.2 (GE Healthcare, Piscataway, NJ).</description>

    <description>The 10-item Perceived Stress Scale was used to evaluate perception of stressful events over the past month by using a 5-point Likert scale (0 = never to 4 = very often) (Cohen et al., 1983). The mean of the ten items was used in analysis. Higher scores indicate greater perceived stress.</description>

    <description>A preliminary, novel intervention was developed drawing on components from Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR), Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy (MBCT), and Mindfulness-Based Eating Awareness Training (MB-EAT). The intervention program consisted of nine 2.5-hour classes and one 7-hour silent day of guided meditation practice after class 6.</description>

        <title>Change in Abdominal Fat</title>
        <description>Whole-body dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) scans were performed to assess body fat distribution. The DEXA densitometry (GE Healthcare Lunar Prodigy, Madison, Wis, USA) was adjusted to the fan beam mode and EnCore software version 9.15 was used. The primary region of interest was fat tissue from a rectangular region in the abdominal area defined by the upper boundary of the second lumbar vertebra to the lower edge of the fourth lumbar vertebra. The vertical sides were defined as the continuation of the lateral sides of the rib cage.</description>

        <population>Intent-to-treat analyses were conducted. Assuming participants lost to followup did not change over time, missing data at postintervention were imputed using preintervention values.</population>

        <title>Telomerase Activity</title>
        <description>Cryopreserved peripheral blood nuclear cells (PBMCs) were thawed and live cells counted using a hemocytometer by the Trypan blue exclusion method. For each sample, an extract of 5000 cells per microliter was made and two concentrations, corresponding to 5000 and 10,000 cells, were assayed for each sample to ensure the assay was in the linear range. Telomerase activity was assayed by the Telomerase Repeat Amplification Protocol (TRAP) using a commercial kit (TRAPeze, Telomerase Detection kit, Upstate/ CHEMICON, Temecula, CA). Baseline and post-intervention samples for the same participant were assayed in the same batch and run on the same gel to eliminate any differences caused by reaction or procedural batch-to-batch variations. Technicians were blind to group assignment. Telomerase activity is defined as 1 unit = the amount of product from one 293T cell/10,000 PBMCs, and was quantified using the software ImageQuant 5.2 (GE Healthcare, Piscataway, NJ).</description>

        <description>The 10-item Perceived Stress Scale was used to evaluate perception of stressful events over the past month by using a 5-point Likert scale (0 = never to 4 = very often) (Cohen et al., 1983).
