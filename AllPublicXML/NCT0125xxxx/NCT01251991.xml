  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Despite improved treatment, cardiovascular disease remains one of the most common diseases
      and causes of death in the Western world. Hypercholesterolemia is a well known risk factor
      for developing cardiovascular disease. Prevention and treatment are based in part on lowering
      LDL cholesterol. Dietary and lifestyle changes always play an important part of the treatment
      and preventive effort, and conversion to a heart-healthy diet reduces LDL cholesterol by a
      mean 10%. Further lowering of LDL cholesterol by means of food supplements have been
      demonstrated in numerous studies. Cholesterol lowering food supplements include isolated soy
      protein and water soluble dietary fibre such as psyllium husks. Postulated mechanisms of
      action responsible for the cholesterol lowering in these two food supplements are different,
      so there is a reason to expect an additive cholesterol lowering effect during concomitant
      treatment with both substances. The investigators want to investigate whether concomitant
      treatment with psyllium husks and isolated soy protein in addition to a heart-healthy diet
      results in a significantly greater reduction of LDL cholesterol in hypercholesterolemia, than
      single treatment with each of the substances.
