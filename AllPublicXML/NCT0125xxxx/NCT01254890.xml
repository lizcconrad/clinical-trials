      The goal of this clinical research study is to learn if 5-azacitidine and sorafenib can
      control the disease in patients with AML or MDS. The safety of this drug combination will
      also be studied.

      The Study Drugs:

      Sorafenib is designed to block the function of important proteins in cancer cells. These
      proteins, when active, are partly responsible for the abnormal growth and behavior of cancer
      cells.

      5-Azacytidine is designed to activate (&quot;turn on&quot;) certain genes in cancer cells whose job is
      to fight tumors.

      Study Drug Administration:

      If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, you will receive 5-azacytidine
      either under the skin or by vein on Days 1-7 of each 28-day cycle. If by vein, the infusion
      will take about 10-40 minutes.

      You will take sorafenib by mouth 2 times a day about 12 hours apart, with water on empty
      stomach, every day.

      Each study cycle may last a little longer than 28 days, depending on how you are doing.

      Study Visits:

      Every week, blood (about 1 tablespoon) will be drawn for routine tests.

      Every week for the first 6 weeks, and then as often as your doctor thinks it is needed, you
      will have your blood pressure measured.

      Before each cycle:

        -  Your performance status will be recorded.

        -  You will have a physical exam, including measurement of your blood pressure and weight.

      Before every 2-4 cycles, you will have a bone marrow aspirate to check the status of the
      disease.

      Length of Study:

      You may continue taking the study drugs for as long as the doctor thinks it is in your best
      interest. You will no longer be able to take the study drugs if the disease gets worse or
      intolerable side effects occur.

      Your participation on the study will be over once you have completed the end-of-treatment and
      follow-up visits.

      End of Study Drug Administration Visit:

      After you have stopped taking the study drugs, the following tests and procedures will be
      performed:

        -  Your medical history will be recorded.

        -  Your performance status will be recorded.

        -  You will have a physical exam, including measurement of your blood pressure and weight.

        -  You will have a bone marrow aspirate collected to check the status of disease.

      This is an investigational study. Sorafenib is FDA approved and commercially available for
      kidney cancer and liver cancer. 5-Azacitidine is FDA approved for the treatment of MDS, but
      its combination with sorafenib is investigational.

      Up to 60 patients will take part in this study. All will be enrolled at MD Anderson.

    <measure>Phase I: Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) of Sorafenib Given With Azacitidine</measure>
    <time_frame>28 day cycle</time_frame>
    <description>MTD is defined as highest dose level in which 6 patients treated with at most 1 experiencing a dose limiting toxicity (DLT) during 1st cycle. One cycle of therapy is 7 days of azacitidine (AZA) and 28 days of sorafenib. Starting dose of Sorafenib is 200 mg twice a day azacitidine</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Phase II: Number of Participants With Response</measure>
    <time_frame>90 days</time_frame>
    <description>Response according to International Working Group response criteria for Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) (JCO 2003; 21: 4642-9): CR defined by presence of &lt;5% blasts in the bone marrow (BM), with &gt;1 X 10^9/L neutrophils and &gt;100 x 10^9/L platelets in the peripheral blood (PB) with no detectable extramedullary disease. Participants who met the above criteria but had neutrophil or platelet counts less than the stated values were considered to have achieved CRi (CR with incomplete recovery of PB counts) or CR with incomplete platelet recovery (CRp) if CR but platelets &lt; 100 x 10^9/L but ≥ 50 x 10^9/L and platelet transfusion independent. Partial response (PR) required all of the hematologic values for a CR but with a decrease of &gt;/= 50% in the percentage of blasts to 5% to 25% in the BM aspirate.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients with MDS, CMML or AML, who have failed pror therapy (including low and
             intermediate risk patient who have required prior therapy).

          2. Patients with MDS or CMML should have failed prior therapy with a hypomethylating
             agent and/or with lenalidomide. Patients who have received prior azacitidine are

             after prior therapy.

          4. Patients with MDS or CMML who received therapy with hypomethylating agent and progress
             to AML are eligible at the time of diagnosis of AML regardless of any prior therapy
             for AML.

          5. Patients with any of the eligible diagnoses who have received no prior therapy are
             eligible if not candidates to receive or refuse standard therapy.

          9. Patients must provide written informed consent.

         10. Patients must have been off chemotherapy for 2 weeks prior to entering this study,
             unless there is evidence of rapidly progressive disease, and must have recovered from
             the toxic effects of that therapy to at least grade 1. Use of hydroxyurea for patients
             with rapidly proliferative disease is allowed before the start of study therapy but
             should be stopped for 24 hours prior to initiation of azacitidine.

         11. Women of childbearing potential should be advised to avoid becoming pregnant with an
             adequate method of contraception (barrier or hormonal methods) and men should be
             advised to not father a child while receiving treatment with azacytidine. All men and
             women of childbearing potential must use acceptable methods of birth control
             throughout the study as described below: Women of childbearing potential must have a
             negative serum pregnancy test performed within 7 days prior to the start of treatment.
             Men should use adequate birth control for at least 30 days after the last
             administration of sorafenib. Post-menopausal women (defined as no menses for at least

             is for male and partner to use at least 2 effective contraceptive methods, as
             described above, during the study.

         14. Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent. A signed
