    <description>Forty-two girls with thoracic AIS; mean age - 14.5y. Cobb - (range 12-40) The group was divided into two randomized subgroups. DoboMed was applied in group &quot;D&quot; only. DoboMed and manual therapy (Kaltenborn) were applied in group &quot;DK&quot;. The spirometry, the strength of respiratory muscles (maximal inspiratory and expiratory pressures- MIP, MEP), kyphosis (plurimeter-V) and the angle of trunk rotation (ATR) in thoracic part (Bunnell scoliometer) were estimated twice - before and after therapy.</description>

    <description>Control DoboMed group - only specific active exercises: symmetrical positions for exercising; asymmetrical active movements; thoracic spine kyphotization; transverse plane derotation; apical area involvement; concave ribs mobilization; exteroceptive facilitation; respiration-directed movements of the thorax and spine; three-dimensional displacement of vertebra; active autocorrection.</description>

    <description>Experimental DoboMed and Kaltenborn manual therapy. Suitable techniques were chosen according to manual examination: cervical spine; thoracic spine; lumbar spine; costovertebral articles; pelvis position. During the 15 sessions in group &quot;DK&quot; we used:derotational manual terapy techniques in selected segments of spine in preparation for the exercises according to the DoboMed method; the manual techniques used in continuation study were different from techniques in pilot study.</description>
