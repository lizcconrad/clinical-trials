    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subject has a solid tumor of a type known to either over-express wild-type EGFR or to
             express variant III mutant EGFR (e.g., head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, non
             small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), colorectal carcinoma) or a tumor known to be EGFR
             positive.

          -  Subject must have disease that is not amenable to surgical resection or other approved
             therapeutic options with curative intent.

          -  Subject has an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Performance Status of 0 to 2.

          -  Subject must have measurable disease per Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors
             (RECIST) version 1.1.

          -  Inclusion criteria for Expand Safety Cohort B - subject has histologically confirmed
             supratentorial glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) .

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subject has uncontrolled metastases to the central nervous system. Subjects with brain
             metastases are eligible provided they have shown clinical and radiographic stable
             disease for at least 1 month after definitive therapy. Subjects with glioblastoma
             multiforme (GBM) are excluded from the dose escalation portion of the study, but may
             be enrolled in the expanded safety cohort.

          -  Subject has received anticancer therapy including chemotherapy, immunotherapy,
             radiotherapy, hormonal, biologic, or any investigational therapy within a period of 21
             days prior to the first dose of ABT-806.

          -  Subject has had any adjustments of an ongoing steroid medication during the 14 days
             prior to the first dose of ABT-806.

          -  Subject has received a prior EGFR-directed monoclonal antibody within a period of 4
             weeks prior to the first dose of ABT-806.

          -  Subject has unresolved clinically significant toxicities from prior anticancer
             therapy, defined as any Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) Grade 2
             or higher.
