      The purpose of this study is to determine whether nilotinib is effective in the prophylaxis
      and treatment of CMV reactivation in allo-HSCT patients.

      Prophylaxis Part: patients will be treated with nilotinib after their hemogram engraftment to
      prevent CMV reactivation Salvage Part: patients who have had intractable CMV reactivation
      after gancyclovir therapy will be treated with nilotinib

             1000 copy numbers/ml by Quantitative-PCR) after allo-HSCT.

          -  Patients with CMV reactivation that is uncontrollable by conventional first line agent
             (ganciclovir) for 2 or more weeks, or patients who are intolerable to ganciclovir
             treatment.

        Part B

             neutrophil count 500/mm3) for at least 3 consecutive days, and stable megakaryocyte
             engraftment (platelet count 20k/uL) for at least 3 consecutive days.

          -  Patient with no CMV reactivation before enrollment: a negative (undetectable) plasma
             CMV DNA Quantitative-PCR assay on blood collected within 7 days Patients without
             previous or current exposure to any prophylactic or therapeutic drugs for CMV
             reactivation
