      The Genetics of Neural Tube Defects Study at the University of Miami: The University of Miami
      John P. Hussman Institute for Human Genomics is looking for families to participate in
      research to identify the genetic and environmental factors that contribute to Neural Tube
      Defects (NTD). Our research goal is to better understand the genetic and environmental causes
      of both open NTD, like spina bifida and anencephaly, and closed NTD, like lipomeningocele and
      tethered cord. This will eventually lead to more accurate genetic counseling and risk
      assessment, improved treatments, and better prevention methods. Any individual with a
      diagnosis of NTD and his/her selected family members can participate, if willing.
      Participation is free. Travel is not required. Participation involves reading and signing a
      consent form, providing a blood sample, a family and medical history interview, and granting
      the research staff permission to review the medical records of the individual(s) with NTD. We
      maintain the highest standards of confidentiality for all families. If interested, please
      contact Maria Ciliberti, the study coordinator, at 1-877-686-6444 (toll free) or directly at
      305-243-4360, or by email Mciliberti@med.miami.edu . Please visit our web site at
      www.hihg.org for more information.
