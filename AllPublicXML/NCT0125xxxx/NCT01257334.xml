    <textblock>
      The objective of the current study is to investigate the efficacy, safety and tolerability of
      BI 10773 (10 mg, 25 mg / once daily) compared to placebo given for 24 weeks as add-on therapy
      to metformin or metformin plus sulfonylurea in patients with T2DM with insufficient glycaemic
      control.

      Open-label arm: to estimate efficacy and safety of 25 mg BI 10773 in very poorly controlled
      patients (HbA1c &gt; 10%)

      Concomitant medications, including other treatments used to treat intercurrent medical
      conditions during the treatment period, will be recorded on the CRFs. This record will
      include the name of the medication, frequency, unit dose, dosage, the date when the drug is
      started and stopped, and the indication for the use of the drug.

      Prohibited

      The following treatments are prohibited in the trial

        1. Other antidiabetic agents except for the background therapy (metformin or the
           combination of metformin plus sulfonylurea)

        2. Treatment with anti-obesity drugs or systemic steroids

        3. Other investigational medications
