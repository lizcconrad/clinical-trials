  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Non diabetic patients on renal replacement therapy are prone to changes in body composition
      with an increase in visceral fat and muscle wasting all favoured by the insulin resistant
      state. Malnutrition is associated with a worst prognosis in these patients. Glitazones are
      the most powerful insulin sensitisers available in clinical practice which also have
      anti-inflammatory properties. Their use has been associated with significant and favourable
      changes in body fat distribution in type 2 diabetic subjects. Experimental studies suggest
      that glitazones may attenuate muscle wasting in renal failure.

      The goal of this study was to examine in non diabetic ESRD patients the effects of
      pioglitazone on inulin sensitivity and protein metabolism as determined by the
      hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamp and on changes in body composition as determined by
      anthropometric measurements, dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) and CT-scan determined
      changes in abdominal visceral and sub-cutaneous fat.
