      The purpose of this research project was to systematically compare two widely used types of
      intervention programs for children with autism within a parent training model. In one
      condition, randomly assigned children were provided with an intervention that typically
      results in acquisition of expressive words in a large percentage of children diagnosed as
      having autism, using a well-documented manualized intervention focused on verbal expressive
      communication only (Pivotal Response Training, PRT). In the other condi¬tion, randomly
      assigned children received a widely used intervention on the same social communication
      functions using a well-documented manualized augmentative system of intervention (Picture
      Exchange Communica¬tion System, PECS) that has been reported to produce verbal and nonverbal
      communication in large percentages of children diagnosed with autism. Children in the two
      conditions were compared for development of verbal and nonverbal communication, changes in
      disruptive behavior, changes in symptoms of autism, and general adaptive behavior gains. In
      addition, parent satisfaction and stress measures were gathered in order to assess the
      effects of each intervention on family functioning.
