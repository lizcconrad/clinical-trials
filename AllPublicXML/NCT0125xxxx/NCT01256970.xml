    <textblock>
      Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is an extremely common disorder in women of reproductive
      age. Diagnosis of PCOS is principally based on clinical and physical findings. Diagnostic
      criteria and PCOS definitions used by clinicians and researchers are almost as heterogeneous
      as the syndrome. This first part of study is determine whether genetic polymorphisms
      influence hormonal and metabolic characteristics in Taiwanese patients with PCOS and
      controls. Furthermore, women with PCOS were reported with high risk of cardiovascular
      disease, the investigators planned to calculate the difference of carotid intima-media
      thickness (IMT) and B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) between women with PCOS and normal
      control to determine the premature atherosclerosis of women with PCOS.
