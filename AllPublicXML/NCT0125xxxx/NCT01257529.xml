    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to 1) evaluate the extent of absorption of a single dose of a
      pregabalin controlled release tablet following either a low, medium, or high-fat evening meal
      as compared to a single dose of the pregabalin immediate release capsule, 2) evaluate the
      safety and tolerability of a single dose of a pregabalin controlled release tablet following
      a low, medium, or high fat evening meal as compared to a single dose of the pregabalin
      immediate release capsule.
