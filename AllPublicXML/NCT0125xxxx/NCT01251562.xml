      The primary objective of this clinical study is as follows:

      • To determine the MTD and to assess the safety and tolerability of C31510 administered as a
      single 4-hour IV infusion (up to nine different dosages) in subjects with solid tumors

      The secondary objective of this study is as follows:

      • To evaluate plasma PK and estimate renal elimination of C31510 administered as a single
      4-hour IV infusion (up to nine different dosages) in subjects with solid tumors

      The exploratory objectives of this study are as follows:

        -  To evaluate the pharmacodynamic correlates of C31510 activity in plasma and peripheral
           blood cells

        -  To radiographically evaluate the effects of C31510 on tumors. In selected subjects, the
           effects on vascular permeability will be assessed by digital contrast enhanced
           (DCE)-magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)

        -  To evaluate tumor response (preliminary antitumor activity) after repeat administration
           of C31510

        -  Long-term safety and tolerability of C31510 after repeat administration

    <description>Tumors will be assessed by standard methods ex. computerized tomography (CT), MRI etc; at baseline and then once every two treatment cycles of 28 days (2 months) thereafter in the absence of clinical rapid progression of disease.
Assessment of tumor vascularity (using DCE-MRI) for at least 6 subjects who received C31510 at the MTD, will be done within 24 hours pre-dose and post-dose.</description>

    <description>samples are taken to evaluate plasma pharmacokinetics (PK) and estimate renal elimination of C31510 administered as a single IV infusion in subjects with solid tumors
PK will be collected during Day 1 of the first month of each cohort at the following timepoints: pre-dose, post-start of infusion at 0.5, 1, 2, 3.75 (15 min prior to end of infusion), 4.083 (5 min after end of the infusion) 4.5, 6, 8, 10, and 24 hrs. after start of the infusion
Additional PK will be done at pre-dose time and at 24 hours post the dose of Day 3, and on Day 28.</description>

    <description>During the treatment period, subjects in each initial dose level cohort will have a single 4-hour IV infusion of C31510 at the assigned dose level of their particular cohort, three times per week for 26 days (on Day 1, 3, 5, 8, 10, 12, 15, 17, 19, 22, 24 and 26) followed by a 28-day follow up period that will be counted from the first dose given on Day 1. In the absence of unacceptable toxicity or disease progression during the treatment period, those subjects may receive similar 28-day repeat treatment cycles of 3 times per week for up to 1 year, at the discretion of the investigator.</description>
