  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pregestational diabetes (PGD) during pregnancy may be associated with an increased rate of
      spontaneous abortions, intrauterine death and congenital anomalies among the offspring.
      Although the prevalence of congenital anomalies among the offspring of diabetic mothers is
      reduced as a result of the improvement of the glycemic control in the early pregnancy, the
      rate of congenital anomalies is increased and there seems to be an increased rate of
      neurodevelopmental disorders including some fine and gross motor deficits as well as
      increased rate of inattention and/or hyperactivity. In gestational diabetes, that develops in
      the second half of pregnancy (past the period of major organogenesis), there seems to be no
      increase in the rate of major congenital anomalies but there are some developmental disorders
      in the offspring.

      The exposure of the developing embryo and fetus to diabetic environment (i.e. hyperglycemia,
      hyperketonemia ext), is known to cause increased oxidative stress and significant changes in
      gene expression as observed in several experimental diabetic models. We hypothesize that
      diabetic environment may also cause long lasting epigenetic changes. It is therefore our
      purpose to evaluate these possible epigenetic changes and correlate their presence with the
      degree and time of onset of diabetes, (i.e. whether from the beginning as in PGD or in the
      second half of pregnancy as in GD), the degree of oxidative stress and with the
      neurodevelopmental outcome of the offspring. Diabetic pregnancies will be compared to a
      similar number of normal pregnancies in all parameters studied.

        Infants of diabetic mothers. The follow-up will start at the high risk pregnancy clinic.
        The obstetrician will follow women with pre-gestational and gestational diabetes. The
        neonates will be evaluated and followed for epigenetic changes and neurodevelopmental
        outcome
