    <textblock>
      To investigate whether the use of Corus CAD (Age/Sex/Gene Expression score - ASGES) blood
      assay changes the diagnostic testing pattern in patients referred to a cardiologist for the
      evaluation of chest pain or anginal equivalent symptoms.

    <textblock>
      A prospective cohort of 88 subjects receiving the Corus CAD (Age/Sex/Gene Expression score -
      ASGES) assay were compared to a retrospective cohort of 83 subjects that did not receive the
      assay.
