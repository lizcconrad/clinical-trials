  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate if there is a difference in survival between elective treatment of
      draining lymph nodes vs. clinical nodal observation in patients undergoing Mohs surgery for
      high risk skin squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck who have a normal lymph node
      exam. Each treatment arm is accepted as a current standard of care, and the objective is to
      compare outcomes between the two arms.

      This is a prospective, randomized, non-blinded, controlled trial of high risk head and neck
      cutaneous squamous cell carcinomas which will compare specific outcomes between two treatment
      arms. Subjects are eligible patients who are sent to Zitelli &amp; Brodland PC for Mohs
      micrographic surgery of tumors that meet our high risk criteria. These patients with
      clinically-negative lymph node exams will either enter into the arm of nodal observation or
      the arm of elective management of the neck, which is currently the standard protocol per the
      UPMC ENT department. The patients in the observation arm will have evaluation and treatment
      of their lymph nodes if an abnormality is detected clinically. The primary endpoint is
      disease-specific survival. Secondary endpoints will include overall and disease-free
      survival, complications, and quality of life measures for each arm.

    <description>This entails selective lymph node dissection in patients with negative lymph node exams. The nodes dissected are those that drain from the high risk cutaneous squamous cell cancer. Subsequent radiation and/or chemotherapy may be administered in a small percentage of subjects, depending on the result of the neck dissection.</description>
