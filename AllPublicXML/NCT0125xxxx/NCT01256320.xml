  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The current research study has the potential to generate data that would provide solid
      clinical endpoints as to the impact of including eggs in a regular diet in individuals with
      peripheral arterial disease. Any one of three potential outcomes may be observed as a result
      of this study, and they are predicted as follows: 1) Egg consumption does not lead to a
      deterioration of indices of cardiovascular health; 2) Egg consumption improves indices of
      cardiovascular health; 3) Egg consumption worsens the indices of cardiovascular health.

      Given the hypotheses proposed, if either of the first two predictions prove to be positive,
      they will help encourage directive efforts to be made toward effective nutrition messages for
      egg consumption in the peripheral arterial disease and the healthy population. If the last
      prediction is positive, while least favourable, it will still establish important information
      to assist the industry in their efforts toward establishing population-specific nutrition
      messaging.
