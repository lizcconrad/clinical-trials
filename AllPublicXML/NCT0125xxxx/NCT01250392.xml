  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this project is to see if behavioral nudges will increase an individual's
      likelihood of participating in a nurse visit. The behavioral nudges under consideration are
      encouraging subjects to make an active choice and sending reminders.

      The employees in our sample will schedule their nurse visit time slot via e-mail and a health
      service provider website. Much as is the case in the current system, the control group will
      be informed via e-mail of the window of dates during which they can take part in the on-site
      screening and given instructions for scheduling an appointment. The treatment group, the
      active choice only arm, will be given the same information as the control group, but they
      will also be asked to make an appointment immediately, defer the scheduling decision, or
      decline to receive a screening. The treatment group will also receive email reminders one
      week before their appointment.
