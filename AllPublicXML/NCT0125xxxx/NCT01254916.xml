      Introduction: Chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) is a significant health problem increasing in both
      incidence and prevalence. It calls into attention consensus about diagnosing, assessing
      symptoms and treatment of patients with CRS. Therefore a validated Danish measure of
      health-related quality of life in sinonasal disease is needed.

      Method: The Sinonasal Outcome measure 22 (SNOT-22) was translated into Danish and
      reproducibility was evaluated by test-retesting 40 patients with CRS. The statistical
      analyses used, were Pearson´s correlation coefficient, Cronbach´s alfa, Kappa and
      Bland-Altman´s Plot. Reproducibility was also tested looking at subscales within the SNOT-22.

      Result: The results show good internal correlation with Cronbach´s alfa at 0.83 in the
      initial test and 0.92 in the retest. Pearson was 0.70 (p&lt;0.001) revealing good correlation
      between the initial scores and the retests scores. Kappa was calculated for each item with a
      mean value of 0.61 showing substantial agreement. Paired t-test revealed no significant
      difference in the subscales.

      Conclusion: The Danish version of SNOT-22 is recommended for Danish clinicians and researches
      as a patient-reported measure of outcome in sino-nasal disorders such as rhinosinusitis and
      nasal polyposis.
