  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The fatty acid composition of canola oil will have beneficial acute and chronic effects on
      vascular function in individuals with peripheral arterial disease.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Given that much of the evidence for current dietary recommendations for type and amounts of
      fatty acids is based on heart disease, the proposed research will contribute to the knowledge
      base for dietary fat recommendations for individuals with established cardiovascular disease.
      Specifically, this study will establish whether canola oil has positive effects on blood
      vessel function in individuals with peripheral arterial disease by measuring true clinical
      endpoints such as ankle-brachial index, walking distance, claudication, and vascular function
      measures. Additionally, since reduced blood flow contributes to cognitive impairment, this
      study will explore whether improvements in blood vessel function are also associated with
      improvements in cognitive function. Given the large proportion of the population affected by
      atherosclerosis and various forms of cardiovascular disease, there is significant potential
      for greater consumption and utilization of canola oil if there are beneficial effects on
      blood vessel function and other indicators of cardiovascular disease risk.
