      The purpose of this study is to use implantable loop recorder (ILR) in patients under chronic
      hemodialysis to record arrhythmias and conduction disorders and correlate them with
      hemodialysis parameters.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Primary cause of death in patients under chronic hemodialysis is Sudden Cardiac Death (SCD)
      (25% of all cause mortality). SCD is mainly due to cardiac arrhythmias (conduction
      disturbances or ventricular arrhythmias). These cardiac arrhythmias are highly sensitive to
      hydro-electrolytic disorders which are extremely frequent in patients under hemodialysis. In
      addition, other conditions leading to cardiac arrhythmias are frequent in this population
      such as ischemic myocardiopathy or dilated myocardiopathy. However, so far, little is known
      about the occurrence of arrhythmias because of studies using only standard Holter monitoring
      (24 to 48 hours monitoring at best).

      The investigators sought to evaluate the incidence of cardiac arrhythmias by using an
      implantable loop recorder (ILR)(Reveal XT, Medtronic) that allows continuous rhythm
      monitoring for 24 months. This ILR will be implanted under local anesthesia.

      Clinical follow-up will be performed during hemodialysis and rhythm management will be
      performed automatically using a remote-monitoring system (Carelink, Medtronic).
      Pre-programmed alerts (conduction disturbances, supra-ventricular arrhythmias or ventricular
      arrhythmias) recorded by the ILR will be sent automatically on a daily basis in our center.
      These data will be analyzed during week days from 9AM to 5PM. They will be reviewed by an
      electrophysiologists and depending on the potential lethality, the patients will be called
      and ask to come to the emergency room in case of high risk or the nephrologist will be
      contacted and he will see the patients during the next hemodialysis in case of on vital
      event.
