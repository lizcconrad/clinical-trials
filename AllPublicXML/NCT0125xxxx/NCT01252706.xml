      The aims is to evaluate the rate of exposure to alcohol, psychoactive substance and nicotine
      among pregnant women in periphery hospital (Poria) and in the center of Tel Aviv (Ichilov)
      and to evaluate study Brief Intervention impact on reduction exposure, and its effect on
      newborn outcomes.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      All pregnant women who will arrive to Poria (and third of pregnant who will arrive to
      Ichilov) ER, high risk, and follow-up clinic will be asked for alcohol exposure, smoking and
      psychoactive substance usage. Relevant women will be asked to participate in a brief
      intervention treatment for about 30 min by expert personal, and a follow-up by phone every 3
      months during pregnancy and post deliver. In addition, through all the year, questionnaires
      about exposure will be given to all women who will have labor (about 3000 labors), and third
      of 10,000 expecting in Ichilov. We expect in the second half of the year, to have those who
      enrolled to the BI. New-born outcome of the BI group as compared to the non-BI group will be
      compared, as well as rate of alcohol/substance/nicotine abstinence and reduction.
