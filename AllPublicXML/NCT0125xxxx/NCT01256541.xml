      To determine whether Kristalose causes a significant increase in hydrogen and/or methane gas
      levels in patients requiring bowel evacuation, and also to determine the safety, efficacy,
      and patient preference of Kristalose as a bowel evacuant

    <textblock>
      This is a single center, open-label, pilot study to determine the safety, efficacy, and
      patient preference of Kristalose as a bowel evacuant prior to colonoscopy. Prior to
      colonoscopy, subjects will also undergo evaluation for the production of hydrogen and methane
      gases in the patient's gut (before and after receiving Kristalose) as assessed by a breath
      analysis instrument. Safety will be assessed by the occurrence of any treatment emergent
      adverse events. Efficacy will be determined by the endoscopist's rating of the cleanliness of
      the colon and the incidence of treatment failure (insufficient evacuation of the bowel).
