  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this project, we will work directly with underserved patients in a safety-net setting to
      conduct a randomized clinical trial of standard-of-care adherence counseling versus a novel
      adherence intervention embedded in an existing PHR that uses cellular phone short message
      service (SMS) reminders and patient responses to the reminders. We will compare adherence
      rates in both arms as assessed by antiretroviral medication concentrations in hair samples
      and self-report; clinical outcomes will also be compared in the two arms. The project will
      examine medication adherence for antiretroviral medications and treatments of common
      conditions such as depression, hypertension, diabetes and hypercholesterolemia.

    <description>The primary analyses of the 12-month trial data will compare the two study groups with respect to (i) change from baseline in CD4 T-cell count; and (ii) proportion of patients whose HIV viral load (VL) level is detectable. We will use repeated-measures analysis techniques to estimate longitudinal prevalence at the population level (via generalized estimating equations) and at the individual levels (via generalized linear mixed models)[25].</description>
