    <textblock>
      This study will examine the combined effects of a continuous oral contraceptive (OC) regimen
      with supplemental estradiol therapy on headache severity and occurrence in subjects with
      documented Menstrually Associated Migraines (MAMs). The subjects enrolling in the study will
      have cyclic menses either due to spontaneous ovulation or use of cyclic hormonal
      contraception (pill, patch, or ring). Enrolled subjects will start a continuous OC regimen
      following two baseline menstrual cycles. If breakthrough bleeding/spotting (BTB/BTS) occurs,
      the subject will institute a 4-day hormone-free interval (HFI). In an attempt to
      prevent/lessen the severity of headache during the HFI, subjects will be randomized to oral
      estradiol or placebo during this period. If no BTB/BTS occurs after 80 days of continuous
      pills, the subject will institute a 4-day HFI during which they will be randomized into
      estradiol or placebo groups.

      The purpose of this research study is to examine the effects of continuous oral contraceptive
      pills and oral estradiol on headaches that occur around the time of your period. Many woman
      take continuous oral contraceptive pills (OC) and when OCs are stopped they may get
      headaches. This study will examine if taking estradiol around the time of the period will
      affect the headache, and how it will be affected.

      This study is a prospective trial. A subject's participation will last approximately 32
      weeks.
