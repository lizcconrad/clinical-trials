    <textblock>
      The primary objective was to evaluate the adequacy of ovulation suppression, cycle control,
      and safety of three transdermal contraceptive delivery systems (TCDSs) containing 2 different
      doses of levonorgestrel (LNG) and 3 different doses of ethinyl estradiol (EE) during 3
      consecutive cycles of administration of each treatment.
