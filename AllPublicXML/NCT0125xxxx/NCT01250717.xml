      The purpose of this research study is to determine if the combination of chemotherapy and
      hormone therapy is safe and helpful for patients who plan to have their high-risk prostate
      cancer surgically removed. Some physicians believe that patients with high risk cancer that
      is located in one area, may have an early but small spread of the cancer outside of the
      prostate, and perhaps even to distant organs. Therefore, better treatments for the entire
      body are needed to improve the ability of surgery or other local therapies to cure prostate
      cancer. Since chemotherapy is beginning to demonstrate increasing activity in advanced
      prostate cancer patients, it is possible that using chemotherapy combined with hormonal
      therapy earlier in the course of localized but high risk patients might improve the outcomes
      for these patients.

      -  Participants will receive treatment in the outpatient clinic, where the docetaxel
           chemotherapy will be placed in a bag of fluid and will be given by vein every three
           weeks. Participants will take Decadron (dexamethasone) by mouth 12 hours and 1 hour
           before docetaxel and again 12 hours after docetaxel. They will also take estramustine
           and casodex by mouth at home. Zoladex (or lupron) will be given subcutaneously (under
           the skin) 4 times every three months. They will also be started on coumadin beginning at
           the time of the first docetaxel infusion and continuing until 3 weeks after the 4th
           cycle of chemotherapy.

        -  After 2 months (or cycles) of therapy, participants will be evaluated in order to assess
           the response and toxicity of treatment, including a review of medical history, physical
           examination, blood tests, including PSA. If there is no evidence of progression or
           excessive toxicity, treatment will continue for 2 more months in the same manner.

        -  At the end of 4 months of chemotherapy, participants will be reassessed by the medical
           oncologist and urologist regarding surgery to remove the prostate.

    <description>One of two pathologists (SR, EG), assigned the Gleason scores for each patient from pre-treatment prostate biopsies and assessed pathological staging on post- prostatectomy specimens. Staging including a description of all tumor foci within the gland, presence or absence of perineural invasion and/or lymphovascular invasion, presence of extraprostatic extension of tumor (including seminal vesicle invasion), and margin status. The pathologists reviewed the presence or absence of cancer in each prostate gland removed on the study patients. RECIST has to my knowledge not been used for pathological examination in neoadjuvant studies. 0 out of 28 participants acheived complete response. RECIST is not appropriate as cancer within the gland at the time of treatment is not measurable by RECIST. The primary outcome is a pathological complete response.</description>

Zoladex : Given subcutaneously for 4 doses every three months
Casodex : Taken orally once a day for 6 months
Estramustine : Taken orally three times a day for 5 days for the first part of every three week cycle
Docetaxel : Given by an IV infusion over 1 hour on day 2 of a three-week cycle
Dexamethasone : Orally 12 hours and 1 hour before docetaxel and again 12 hours after docetaxel</description>

          <title>Pathologic Complete Response Was Assessed by Rigorous Pathological Examination by One of Two Pathologists</title>
          <description>One of two pathologists (SR, EG), assigned the Gleason scores for each patient from pre-treatment prostate biopsies and assessed pathological staging on post- prostatectomy specimens. Staging including a description of all tumor foci within the gland, presence or absence of perineural invasion and/or lymphovascular invasion, presence of extraprostatic extension of tumor (including seminal vesicle invasion), and margin status. The pathologists reviewed the presence or absence of cancer in each prostate gland removed on the study patients. RECIST has to my knowledge not been used for pathological examination in neoadjuvant studies. 0 out of 28 participants acheived complete response. RECIST is not appropriate as cancer within the gland at the time of treatment is not measurable by RECIST. The primary outcome is a pathological complete response.</description>
