  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Mapatumumab is a fully human, agonist monoclonal antibody that activates the cell death
      pathway in tumor cells by specifically binding to TRAIL-R1 with high affinity. Sorafenib, a
      multikinase inhibitor, is the standard of care for treatment of patients with advanced
      hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The mechanisms of sorafenib and mapatumumab action suggest
      that these agents could interact synergistically. This is a Phase 2, multi-center,
      randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of
      mapatumumab in combination with sorafenib in subjects with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma.
