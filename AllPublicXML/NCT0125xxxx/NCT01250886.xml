      The purpose of this study is to determine whether fluid administration in patients undergoing
      colonoscopy should affect acid-base disorder in term of the strong ion differences.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, double-blinded, randomized control trial. The study enrolls 90
      consecutive outpatients, well-prepared bowel, scheduled to undergo routine colonoscopy for
      screening, surveillance, or diagnosis of colorectal diseases. At the outpatient clinic, the
      co-researcher invites patients who meet the inclusion criteria to join the study. The process
      of the project is explained to the interested patients in details before an informed consent
      is obtained and the first blood sample is conducted.

      On the day of colonoscopy, all participants are randomized equally into three groups: Normal
      saline solution (NSS, n = 30) as control group, lactated Ringer's solution (LRS, n = 30) and
      acetated Ringer's solution (ARS, n = 30) as treatment groups. The second blood sample is
      obtained from patients via 20-gauge needle in either forearm immediately before an allocated
      intravenous (IV) fluid administered on the same site. The volume of fluid is calculated by
      means of Holliday and Segar formula.

      The colonoscopy under total intravenous anesthesia is performed between 9:00 a.m. and 3:00
      p.m. At the end of colonoscopy, the patients spontaneously wake up in the recovery room.
      After they gain conscious and all vital signs are stable; the intravenous fluid is off and
      the third blood sample is taken in the other forearm. After completion of the procedure, the
      patient is advised to follow the discharge instructions.
