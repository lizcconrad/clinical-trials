  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Glutamine is the most abundant nonessential amino acid in the human body. Besides its role as
      a constituent of proteins and its importance in amino acid transamination, glutamine may
      modulate immune cells.

      The innate immune system is the first line of host defence against pathogens and in most
      cases sufficient to eliminate invading microbes. Mammalian Toll-like receptors (TLR) comprise
      a family of germ line-encoded trans-membrane receptors which activation leads to the
      induction of inflammatory responses, phagocytosis but also to the development of antigen
      specific adapative immunity.

      It has been postulated though not formally proven yet that glutamine beneficial effect could
      be due to a positive effect on the innate immune system. Given the importance of TLRs and
      TLRs-dependent signalling in host defence against infections we hypothesized that glutamine
      may increase the expression and/or functionality of TLRs which in turn may have beneficial
      effects to clear infections.

      Objective: To evaluate whether glutamine supplementation alters the expression and
      functionality of TLR2 and TLR4 in circulating monocytes of trauma patients admitted to the
      ICU. Specifically the next variables were measured:

        -  Expression of TLR2 and TLR4 in peripheral blood monocytes was determined by flow
           cytometry

        -  To study the functionality of TLR2 and TLR4, monocytes were stimulated with TLR specific
           agonists and cytokines were measured in cell culture supernatants. We determined the
           concentration of IL-1β, IL-6, TNFα and IL-10 in cell culture supernatants using a bead
           array ELISA.

        -  To determine the phagocytic capability of monocytes, live Escherichia coli expressing
           green fluorescent protein was added to 100 μL of whole blood collected in
           K2-anticoagulation medium tubes. Bacteria were added at a ratio of 100 bacteria per
           monocyte. The analyses were carried out in an Epics XL flow cytometer.
