    <measure>Change From Baseline of Period 1 (Baseline 1) to End of Period 1 on Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder Rating Scale (DSM-IV ADHD RS) Total Score by Treatment</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline 1 to End of Period 1 (Week 9)</time_frame>
    <description>Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder Rating Scale (DSM-IV ADHD RS) total score consists of 18 items directly adapted from the ADHD symptom list according to the DSM-IV. The DSM-IV ADHD RS total score was calculated as the sum of the Inattentive and the Hyperactive-Impulsive subscores. The 18 items are rated from 0 (&quot;Never&quot;) to 4 (&quot;Very often&quot;). The total score ranges from 0(least symptomatic) to 72 (most symptomatic). Decrease in the DSM-IV ADHD RS total score indicates improvement, therefore a greater decrease (change at Final Visit compared to baseline) indicates a greater improvement in ADHD symptoms. 30% improvement: 100×(DSM-IV ADHD RS total score during Period 1 - DSM-IV ADHD RS total score at randomization(visit 2))/DSM-IV ADHD RS total score at randomization (visit 2) &lt;= - 30%.</description>

    <description>SDS, a 5-self-rated questionnaire to measure the extent a pt's disability due to an illness/health problem interferes with work/school, social life/leisure, family life/home. First 3 items, pts are asked how their symptoms disrupted their reg. activities over the past 7d in ea. using a scale from 0(not at all)-10(extremely) Ea. subscale(work disability, social life disability, family life disability) can be scored independently or combined into a total score(sum of the non-missing responses for items 1-3)from 0-30,higher scores indicate significant functional impairmt. Subscale scores &gt;5 suggest impairment in that subscale area. Final 2 items ask pts about the # of days their symptoms caused them to miss school/work and # of days their symptoms caused them to be underproductive at school/work.(These items were not included in the total score.) Before responding to SDS items 1-3, pts were verbally instructed to recall the past 7d, items 4-5 refer to the last week w/in the item wording.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline Period 3 (Baseline 2) to End of Period 3 in Conners Adult ADHD Rating Scales Observer: Short Version (CAARS-O:S:) Total Score by Treatment</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline 2 to end of Period 3 (end of withdrawal period 40 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>CAARS is an instrument to assess ADHD symptoms and behaviors in adults. This study utilizes the Observer Short Version (CAARS-O: S), consisting of 26 items and 6 subscales: Inattention/Memory Problems, Hyperactivity/Restlessness, Impulsivity/Emotional Lability, Problems with Self-Concept, ADHD Index (to distinguish ADHD adults from non-clinical adults), and Inconsistency Index (to identify random or careless responding) and is rated by someone close to the patient in their daily life such as a spouse, friend, or coworker. The observer is asked to notice the patient carefully and decide how much or how frequently each of the 26 items of the scale describes the patient recently. The response to every question in increasing order of severity is &quot;not at all, never = 0; Just a little, once in a while = 1; Pretty much, often = 2; Very much, very frequently = 3&quot;. The total score combined from all the 26 items ranges from 0 to 88.</description>

          <description>In period 1 patients were given Ritalin LA 20 mg and up titrated to 40 mg at week 2, continued in same dose till week 9. Period 2- The dose of study medication was re-titrated for all patients (including those in the Placebo arm during Period 1) starting at 20 mg/day Ritalin LA and increased at weekly intervals in increments of 20 mg/day until reaching the patient’s optimal dose 40 mg. Optimal dose was defined as the dose at which the investigator considered an optimal balance between control of symptoms and side effects was maintained for a period of at least one week prior to Week 14. In period 3, patients were re- randomized to either their optimal dose of medication (40, 60, or 80 mg/day) or Placebo from beginning of week 15 to end of week 40.</description>

          <description>In period 1 patients were given Ritalin LA 20 mg and up titrated to 40 mg at week 2, continued in same dose till week 9. Period 2- The dose of study medication was re-titrated for all patients (including those in the Placebo arm during Period 1) starting at 20 mg/day Ritalin LA and increased at weekly intervals in increments of 20 mg/day until reaching the patient’s optimal dose 40 mg. Optimal dose was defined as the dose at which the investigator considered an optimal balance between control of symptoms and side effects was maintained for a period of at least one week prior to Week 14. In period 3, patients were re- randomized to either their optimal dose of medication (40, 60, or 80 mg/day) or Placebo from beginning of week 15 to end of week 40.</description>

        <description>Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder Rating Scale (DSM-IV ADHD RS) total score consists of 18 items directly adapted from the ADHD symptom list according to the DSM-IV. The DSM-IV ADHD RS total score was calculated as the sum of the Inattentive and the Hyperactive-Impulsive subscores. The 18 items are rated from 0 (&quot;Never&quot;) to 4 (&quot;Very often&quot;). The total score ranges from 0(least symptomatic) to 72 (most symptomatic). Decrease in the DSM-IV ADHD RS total score indicates improvement, therefore a greater decrease (change at Final Visit compared to baseline) indicates a greater improvement in ADHD symptoms. 30% improvement: 100×(DSM-IV ADHD RS total score during Period 1 – DSM-IV ADHD RS total score at randomization(visit 2))/DSM-IV ADHD RS total score at randomization (visit 2) &lt;= - 30%.</description>

        <description>SDS, a 5-self-rated questionnaire to measure the extent a pt’s disability due to an illness/health problem interferes with work/school, social life/leisure, family life/home. First 3 items, pts are asked how their symptoms disrupted their reg. activities over the past 7d in ea. using a scale from 0(not at all)-10(extremely) Ea. subscale(work disability, social life disability, family life disability) can be scored independently or combined into a total score(sum of the non-missing responses for items 1-3)from 0-30,higher scores indicate significant functional impairmt. Subscale scores &gt;5 suggest impairment in that subscale area. Final 2 items ask pts about the # of days their symptoms caused them to miss school/work and # of days their symptoms caused them to be underproductive at school/work.(These items were not included in the total score.) Before responding to SDS items 1-3, pts were verbally instructed to recall the past 7d, items 4-5 refer to the last week w/in the item wording.</description>

        <description>On the CGI-I scale, a lower score reflects greater improvement between 1 and 3, a score of 4 is “no change”, scores higher than 4 reflect worsening. The CGI-I consists of 7 ratings that range from 1 = “Very much improved” to 7 =“Very much worse”. Improvement on the CGI-I scale is defined as a visit rating of 1 “very much improved” or 2 “much improved” on the CGI-I scale. Percentage has been calculated from the evaluable patients (N) as Percentage = n/N * 100.</description>

          <title>Percentage of Patients With Improvement on Clinical Global Impression – Improvement Scale (CGI-I) From Baseline Period 1 (Baseline 1) to End of Period 1</title>
          <description>On the CGI-I scale, a lower score reflects greater improvement between 1 and 3, a score of 4 is “no change”, scores higher than 4 reflect worsening. The CGI-I consists of 7 ratings that range from 1 = “Very much improved” to 7 =“Very much worse”. Improvement on the CGI-I scale is defined as a visit rating of 1 “very much improved” or 2 “much improved” on the CGI-I scale. Percentage has been calculated from the evaluable patients (N) as Percentage = n/N * 100.</description>
          <population>Full Analysis Set for Period 1 (FAS P1) – all randomized patients who take one dose of study medication in period 1. Patients will be assigned to their randomized fixed dose. Evaluable patients with both baseline and post-baseline (end of week 9) assessments were included.</population>

        <description>DSM-IV ADHD RS consists of 18 items directly adapted from the ADHD symptom list according to the DSM-IV. The SDS is a five-item, self-rated questionnaire that has been used widely in clinical trials and observational studies. CAARS-O: S consists of 26 items and 6 subscales: Inattention/Memory Problems, Hyperactivity/Restlessness, Impulsivity/Emotional Lability, Problems with Self-Concept, ADHD Index, and Inconsistency Index and is rated by someone close to the patient in their daily life such as a spouse, friend, or coworker. The Adult Self-Report Scale (ASRS) is a self-rating scale designed to assess Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) symptoms. The 18 items are written to reflect the DSM-IV diagnostic criteria for ADHD and are rated from 0 (&quot;Never&quot;) to 4 (&quot;Very often&quot;).</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline Period 3 (Baseline 2) to End of Period 3 on DSM-IV Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder Rating Scale ADHD RS Total Score by Treatment</title>
        <description>The ADHD-RS-IV is an 180 item clinician rated scale to assess ADHD by DSM-IV-TR, defined criteria using symptom terminology appropriate for the adult population. Each item pertains to inattention (odd-numbered) or hyperactivity/impulsivity (even-numbered) and is scored on a scale of 0 (no symptoms) to 3 (severe symptoms). A total added score can range from 0-54.</description>

        <description>The Sheehan Disability Scale (SDS) is a self-rating scale designed to assess the extent to which the patient’s work social life/leisure activities and home life are impaired by his or her symptoms. The scale generates 4 scores: a work disability score, a social life disability score, a family life disability score and a total score. To get a total score the 3 individual scores (work: social life: family life) are totaled. The maximum possible score is 30 The higher the score, the more “impaired” a patient’s work, social life, family life is.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline Period 3 (Baseline 2) to End of Period 3 in Conners Adult ADHD Rating Scales Observer: Short Version (CAARS-O:S:) Total Score by Treatment</title>
        <description>CAARS is an instrument to assess ADHD symptoms and behaviors in adults. This study utilizes the Observer Short Version (CAARS-O: S), consisting of 26 items and 6 subscales: Inattention/Memory Problems, Hyperactivity/Restlessness, Impulsivity/Emotional Lability, Problems with Self-Concept, ADHD Index (to distinguish ADHD adults from non-clinical adults), and Inconsistency Index (to identify random or careless responding) and is rated by someone close to the patient in their daily life such as a spouse, friend, or coworker. The observer is asked to notice the patient carefully and decide how much or how frequently each of the 26 items of the scale describes the patient recently. The response to every question in increasing order of severity is “not at all, never = 0; Just a little, once in a while = 1; Pretty much, often = 2; Very much, very frequently = 3”. The total score combined from all the 26 items ranges from 0 to 88.</description>
