      We prospectively compared outcomes of subinguinal varicocelectomy for 40 patients who
      received 2 ml intratunical space injection of methylene blue before spermatic vein ligation
      with 40 controls in whom no mapping technique was adopted in the period between January 2008
      and Feb. 2010, in Mansoura university hospital ward 7.After surgery, the patients were
      assessed at 2 weeks,6 and 12 months for varicocele recurrence, hydrocele formation, atrophy,
      pain or other complications with mean follow up was 15+ 7months.

      Methods. We prospectively compared outcomes of subinguinal varicocelectomy for 40 patients
      who received 2 ml intratunical space injection of methylene blue before spermatic vein
      ligation with 40 controls in whom no mapping technique was adopted in the period between
      January 2008 and Feb. 2010, in Mansoura university hospital ward 7.After surgery, the
      patients were assessed at 2 weeks,6 and 12 months for varicocele recurrence, hydrocele
      formation, atrophy, pain or other complications with mean follow up was 15+ 7months.

      Results: There were no intraoperative complications in either group. There were no adverse
      reactions, scrotal haematomas or atrophy. In group 1, no patient had a hydrocele at 3 months
      after surgery. By contrast, in group 2 (surgery alone) there were four cases of secondary
      hydrocele (10%; P=0.025)); no testicular hypertrophy was observed following lymphatic sparing
      surgery , One patient in each group had varicocele recurrence. Pregnancy was reported in 30
      patients (37.5%) during a follow up period, 17 of them (42.5%) were group(1),P &gt;0.34.
      difference was not significantly different among the two groups
