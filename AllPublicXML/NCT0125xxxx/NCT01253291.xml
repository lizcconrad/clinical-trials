  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of 48 weeks
      subcutaneous dosing with LY2127399 for patients who have participated in a prior LY2127399
      clinical study. At the end of the 48 week treatment period, patients will participate in a 24
      week follow up period. Additional follow up after week 72 may continue to assess B cell
      recovery.
