  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A study to compare the bronchodilatory effect of a single dose of Mometasone
      Furoate/Formoterol Fumarate (MF/F) pressurized metered dose inhaler (MDI) delivered with and
      without an AeroChamber Plus® with Flow-Vu® Anti-Static Valved Holding Chamber (spacer) versus
      Placebo MDI (combined with and without spacer) and formoterol fumarate (F) dry powder inhaler
      (DPI). Participants were randomly assigned to 1 of 6 treatment sequences and each participant
      was to receive a single dose of each of 4 treatments in each period. Each treatment period
      was separated by a 5 to 7 day washout period. It assumed that a single dose MF/F MDI 100/10
      microgram (mcg) delivered with a spacer would produce bronchodilation, defined as a
      significant increase in forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) area under the curve
      from 0 to 12 hours (AUC[0-12 hr]) when compared to placebo.

    <measure>Area Under the Curve From 0-12 Hours (AUC[0-12h]) of the Change From Baseline in Forced Expiratory Volume in 1 Second (FEV1) After a Single Dose of MF/F MDI With Spacer Compared to Placebo MDI Combined With or Without Spacer</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 12 hours postdose</time_frame>
    <description>The AUC was standardized to liters by dividing the length of time for which measurements of FEV1 were included in the calculation of the AUC. Baseline was defined as the average of 2 pre-dose FEV1 measurements (taken 30 minutes before and immediately before dosing), which was subtracted from each of the serial FEV1 measurements over the 12-hour period. The AUC was calculated based on these changes from the baseline evaluations using the trapezoidal rule.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Must have a diagnosis of asthma of at least 6 months duration

          -  Must have taken an Inhaled Corticosteroid ([ICS]; alone or in combination with a
             long-acting beta-2 Agonist [LABA]) for at least 3 months prior to the Screening Visit
             and must have been on a stable daily dose for at least 2 weeks prior to the Screening
             Visit

          -  FEV1 must be at least 70% predicted after all restricted medications have been
             withheld for the appropriate intervals

          -  Must demonstrate an increase in absolute FEV1 of at least 12% within 30 minutes after
             administration of 360 mcg albuterol (4 inhalations x 90 mcg, ex-actuator) or of
             nebulized albuterol (2.5 mg), if confirmed as standard office practice

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Has been treated in the emergency room for a severe asthma exacerbation requiring
             systemic glucocorticosteroid treatment, or hospitalized for management of airway
             obstruction within 3 months prior to the Screening Visit

          -  Has required ventilator support for respiratory failure secondary to asthma

          -  Demonstrates a decrease in absolute FEV1 of &gt;20% at any time from the Screening Visit
             up to and including the Baseline Visit

          -  Requires the use of greater than 8 inhalations per day of short-acting beta-2 agonists
             (SABA) MDI, or 2 or more nebulized treatments per day of 2.5 mg SABA on any 2
             consecutive days from the Screening Visit up to and including the Baseline Visit

          -  Experiences a clinical deterioration in asthma that results in emergency treatment,
             hospitalization due to asthma, or treatment with additional, excluded asthma
             medication (including oral or other systemic corticosteroids, but allowing SABA) as
             judged by the investigator, at any time from the Screening Visit up to and including
             the Baseline Visit

          <title>AUC (0-12h) of the Change From Baseline in FEV1 After a Single Dose of MF/F With Spacer Compared to F DPI</title>
          <description>The AUC was standardized to liters by dividing the length of time for which measurements of FEV1 were included in the calculation of the AUC. Baseline was defined as the average of 2 pre-dose FEV1 measurements (taken 30 minutes before and immediately before dosing), which was subtracted from each of the serial FEV1 measurements over the 12-hour period. The AUC was calculated based on these changes from the baseline evaluations using the trapezoidal rule.</description>
