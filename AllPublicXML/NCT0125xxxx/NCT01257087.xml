  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Obesity surgery is very effective in improving or even curing Type 2 Diabetes in patients
      with obesity. Many patients stop or reduce their medication after surgery and this can happen
      fairly quickly. The investigators do not know whether strict control of blood glucose/sugar
      after the operation makes any difference in the long term. Additionally many patients prefer
      their blood sugars to be a &quot;bit high&quot; because they are afraid of hypos.A number of studies
      have described patients whose eye, nerve and kidney disease has deteriorated when high sugars
      are controlled very quickly. The investigators want to ensure that surgery provides maximum
      benefit and remains safe in patients with diabetes. This study will help us decide if the
      investigators should be strict with blood glucose after obesity surgery operations or not and
      whether obesity surgery is safe for the eye, nerve and kidney complications of diabetes.

      Subjects would be randomised into intensive glycaemic control and conventional glycaemic
      control after obesity surgery. Data on complications of diabetes such as eye, nerve and
      kidney will be collected before obesity surgery and 1 year after surgery.
