  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In individuals with Type 2 Diabetes (T2D) it has been obtained an outstanding improvement in
      the management of hyperglycemia, but it has not been achieved a similar result in the
      reduction of the atherosclerotic syndrome. The comprehension of the mechanisms that link over
      nutrition to inflammation and innate immune response can be important to understand the
      relationship between insulin resistance, diabetes mellitus and endothelial dysfunction. It
      will be investigated: 1) the role of Toll Like Receptors (TLR)s in the pathophysiology of T2D
      and associated atherosclerosis; 2) the role of aspirin and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide
      phosphate (NADPH) oxidase inhibitor/s in the production of TxA2 and F2-isoprostanes in T2D
      patients; 3)new biomarkers associated to Diabetes and atherosclerosis including markers of
      endothelial dysfunction and cytokines.

      It will be analyzed in isolated platelets from normal controls and/or diabetic patients the
      production of TxA2, isoprostanes and pro-inflammatory/thrombotic cytokines using aspirin and
      NADPHoxidase inhibitors.

      Study design: prospective, controlled, randomized study. All eligible patients will be
      randomly assigned in a 1:1 manner to receive aspirin or placebo.

      In each recruited subjects we will do:

        1. Anamnestic clinical information and Anthropometric measurements

        2. Electrocardiogram, echocardiogram and ultrasound assessment of carotid intima-media
           thickness (IMT) and flow-mediated dilatation (FMD)

        3. Ankle-Brachial Index measurement (ABI)

        4. blood samples from an antecubital vein after an overnight fast and urine samples at
           baseline, after 3 days and after 30 days of aspirin (100 mg/day) administration.

      Laboratory Methods: Blood samples will be immediately centrifuged at 2,000 rpm for 20 min at
      4°C, and the supernatant was collected and stored at -80°C until measurement. All
      measurements will be done blinded. Samples will be tested in duplicate, and those showing
      values above the standard curve will be re-tested with appropriate dilutions.Analysis of
      urinary and platelet isoprostane:Urinary PGF2α-III was measured by a previously described and
      validated EIA assay method. Ten millilitre urine were extracted on a C-18 SPE column; the
      purification was tested for recovery by adding a radioactive tracer (tritiated PGF2α-III)
      (Cayman chemical). The eluates were dried under nitrogen, recovered with 1ml of buffer, and
      assayed in a PGF2α-III specific EIA kit (Cayman chemical). Urinary PGF2α-III concentration
      was corrected for recovery and creatinine excretion and expressed as pg/mg of creatinine. PRP
      was then centrifuged 20 min at 800 g to concentrate platelets and the pellet was suspended in
      Tyrode buffer to obtain a final platelet concentration of 5x108/mL. PGF2α-III content was
      measured by a validated EIA assay method as previously described and expressed as pg/mg
      platelet protein.
