      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the pharmacokinetics of golimumab in Japanese and
      Caucasian Males.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized (study medication assigned by chance), double-blind (both the physician
      and subject do not know the assigned study medication) study to assess the safety,
      tolerability, immune response, pharmacokinetics (what the body does to the drug), of
      golimumab (Simponi). The study population will consist of 24 healthy male Japanese subjects
      and 24 healthy male Caucasian subjects. Subjects will receive a single dose of either 200 mg
      or 400 mg golimumab or placebo. Subjects will be in the study for up to 16 weeks. Safety
      assessments will be performed throughout the study and include obtaining and evaluating
      laboratory tests, vital signs (eg, blood pressure), and the occurrence and severity of
      adverse events. A single dose of 200 mg or 400 mg golimumab, or placebo.
