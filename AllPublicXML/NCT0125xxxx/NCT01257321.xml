  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS) is the most common indication for tonsillectomy and
      adenoidectomy in young children. According to previous studies, as much as 8 to 20% of
      patients will develop post operative respiratory complications requiring medical
      intervention. The pre-operative risk factors that could predict respiratory complications
      retrospectively analyzed were young age, obesity and high preoperative apnea-hypopnea index.
      Despite the removal of obstructing lymphoid tissue, upper airway obstruction occurs on the
      first postoperative night in children with OSA. There is a debate regarding the
      post-operative duration and monitoring needed in children with OSA.

      Hypothesis:

      Pre-operative, operative and immediate post-operative parameters could predict post
      tonsillectomy respiratory complications.
