      The purpose of this study is to determine whether nonpharmaceutical interventions (i.e.,
      handwashing and masks) reduce secondary transmission of influenza in households.

    <textblock>
      HITS is a multi-year project that will prospectively identify laboratory-confirmed influenza
      infected children. Secondary influenza infection will then be examined among members of the
      child's household and effectiveness of non-pharmaceutical interventions to decrease secondary
      infection will be assessed. The pediatric influenza-infected index case will be identified by
      rapid influenza testing and their household will then be enrolled and randomized to one of
      three study arms: control, hand washing (Intervention 1), and hand washing and mask use
      (Intervention 2). Following enrollment, at days 0, 3 and 7, all household participants will
      be tested: the index case will be assessed for influenza viral shedding and household members
      will be assessed for secondary influenza infection. This study is being conducted at Queen
      Sirikit Institute for Child Health in Bangkok.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Child, 1 month through 15 years of age

          -  Resident of Bangkok Metropolitan Area

          -  Outpatient of Queen Sirikit National Institute of Child Health Children's

          -  Hospital seen during HITS' active study period

          -  Positive influenza rapid test result from patient presenting with influenza-like
             illness

          -  In addition to the index case, consent must be obtained from at least 2 household
             members â‰¥1 month of age who plan to sleep inside the house for a period of at least 21
             days from the time of enrollment

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Illness onset 48 hours or more before presentation and influenza testing at Queen
             Sirikit National Institute of Child Health Children's Hospital

          -  Treatment with influenza antiviral medications since it may decrease secondary attack
             rate

          -  Children who are at high risk for severe influenza disease (e.g., chronic lung
             disease, renal disease, chemotherapy for cancer, long-term aspirin therapy)

          -  A history of influenza-like illness in another household member that precedes the
             index case by 7 days or less will lead to exclusion of the household because the
             source of influenza infection for secondary cases is uncertain.

          -  Receipt of influenza vaccine by any household member during the preceding 12 months.

          -  Prior participation in HITS.
