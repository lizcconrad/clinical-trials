    <time_frame>Weeks 4 and 12 of Treatment Cycles 1 to 3; Week 4 of Treatment Cycle 4</time_frame>
    <description>Individual goals were defined prior to treatment in each treatment period. The GAS is a functional scale used to measure progress towards individual therapy goals. Individual goals were defined for each subject by the physician, and the child's parents (caregiver) where applicable, prior to treatment. After treatment in each treatment cycle, the GAS for each goal was rated using a defined scale (-2: Much less than expected outcome, -1: Somewhat less than expected outcome, 0: Expected outcome, 1: Somewhat more than expected outcome, and 2: Much more than expected outcome).</description>

    <measure>Mean Change From DB Baseline in Angle of Arrest (XV1) Derived From the Tardieu Scale (TS), in the GSC Assessed at the Ankle Joint of the (Most) Affected Lower Limb</measure>
    <time_frame>DB baseline and Weeks 4 and 12 of Treatment Cycles 1 to 3; Week 4 of Treatment Cycle 4</time_frame>
    <description>The TS was used to measure spasticity in the GSC at the ankle joint of the (most) affected lower limb.
The Investigator assessed muscle reactions of the tested muscle to passive stretch at two velocities: SLOW = V1: as slow as possible (slower than the rate of natural drop of the limb segment under gravity); FAST = V2 (speed of the limb segment falling under gravity) or V3 (as fast as possible - faster than the rate of natural drop of the limb segment under gravity).
The mean change from DB baseline in XV1 at slow speed was derived.</description>

    <measure>Mean Change From DB Baseline in Spasticity Grade (Y) Derived From the TS, in the GSC Assessed at the Ankle Joint of the (Most) Affected Lower Limb</measure>
    <time_frame>DB Baseline and Weeks 4 and 12 of Treatment Cycles 1 to 3; Week 4 of Treatment Cycle 4</time_frame>
    <description>The mean change from baseline (in the DB study) in Y was derived from the TS.
Y was graded according to the following scale: Grade 0 - no resistance throughout passive movement (best outcome); Grade 1 - slight resistance throughout passive movement; Grade 2 - clear catch at precise angle, interrupting passive movement, followed by release; Grade 3 - fatigable clonus (less than 10 sec when maintaining pressure) occurring at a precise angle, followed by release; Grade 4 - unfatigable clonus (more than 10 seconds when maintaining pressure) occurring at a precise angle; Grade 5 - joint immovable (worst outcome).
Catch without release was graded 0 if XV1=XV3, 'unratable' spasticity otherwise; catch with 'minimal' release was graded 2 if XV3 was consistent and consistently less than XV1.
Angle 0 = position of minimal stretch of the tested muscle. For Grades 0 and 1, spasticity angle X = 0 by definition.</description>

    <measure>Mean Change From DB Baseline in the Observational Gait Scale (OGS) Total Score of the (Most) Affected Leg</measure>
    <time_frame>DB Baseline and Weeks 4 and 12 of Treatment Cycles 1 to 3; Week 4 of Treatment Cycle 4</time_frame>
    <description>The OGS is a measurement tool used to objectively quantify positive and negative features (impairments) of the upper motor neurone syndrome. The OGS is useful when children are too young or insufficiently cooperative for instrumented gait analysis. It is based on the Physicians Rating Scale but has some modifications to improve its sensitivity to detect changes following administration of Botulinum Toxin Type A (BTX-A).
The OGS total score was calculated as the sum of the individual question scores for Questions 1 to 7, with the highest possible score being 20. The parameters collected were: knee position in midstance, initial foot contact, foot contact at midstance, timing of heel raise, hindfoot at midstance, base of support and gait assistive devices. Higher scores indicate better gait.
The mean change from baseline (in the DB study) in the OGS total score of the (most) affected leg was derived.</description>

    <measure>Mean Change From DB Baseline in the PedsQL Score (CP Module Scores) at Each Study Visit Except Week 4</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>The PedsQL has a disease specific CP module that is relevant to the study population and complements the core modules.
The 35-item questionnaire encompassed 7 scales including (1) daily activities (2) school activities (3) movement and balance (4) pain and hurt (5) fatigue (6) eating activities and (7) speech and communication. A 5-point scale was utilised for parent proxy-report: 0 = never a problem; 1 = almost never a problem; 2 = sometimes a problem; 3 = often a problem; 4 = almost always a problem.
Each CP score was calculated as follows: (1) Individual item scores were reversed and transformed from a 0-4 scale to a 0-100 scale by assigning 0=100, 1=75, 2=50, 3=25 and 4=0; (2) Each scale score was calculated as the sum of the transformed individual item scores, divided by the number of non-missing items. Higher scores indicated better quality of life (fewer symptoms or problems).
A scale score was only calculated if at least 50% of the associated items were non-missing.</description>

    <measure>Mean Change From DB Baseline in the PedsQL Score (Generic Core Scores) at Each Study Visit Except Week 4</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>The PedsQL is a validated quality of life questionnaire, designed for children from 2 to 18 years of age. The Generic Core Scale covers four multidimensional scales including physical, emotional, social and school aspects, with three summary scales of total scale score, physical health summary score and psychosocial health summary score.
Each generic core scale was calculated as follows: (1) Individual item scores were reversed and transformed from a 0-4 scale to a 0-100 scale by assigning 0=100, 1=75, 2=50, 3=25 and 4=0; (2) Each scale score was calculated as the sum of the transformed individual item scores, divided by the number of non-missing items. Higher scores indicated better quality of life (fewer symptoms or problems).
A scale score was only calculated if at least 50% of the associated items were non-missing.</description>

      <recruitment_details>This was a multicentre study performed at 27 investigational sites in France, Mexico, Turkey, Poland, Chile and the United States of America (USA). Twenty six sites recruited at least one subject and the other site was inactive.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>Of 216 subjects enrolled in this open label study from Study Y-55-52120-141, 203 went straight into Cycle 1. 13 subjects were not considered eligible for re-treatment at end (all of whom had received Dysport) and as per study design they entered into the observational phase of Study 147. Of these 13, 4 subjects entered Cycle 1 at a later date.</pre_assignment_details>

        <title>Mean Change From DB Baseline in Angle of Arrest (XV1) Derived From the Tardieu Scale (TS), in the GSC Assessed at the Ankle Joint of the (Most) Affected Lower Limb</title>
        <description>The TS was used to measure spasticity in the GSC at the ankle joint of the (most) affected lower limb.
The Investigator assessed muscle reactions of the tested muscle to passive stretch at two velocities: SLOW = V1: as slow as possible (slower than the rate of natural drop of the limb segment under gravity); FAST = V2 (speed of the limb segment falling under gravity) or V3 (as fast as possible - faster than the rate of natural drop of the limb segment under gravity).

        <title>Mean Change From DB Baseline in Spasticity Grade (Y) Derived From the TS, in the GSC Assessed at the Ankle Joint of the (Most) Affected Lower Limb</title>
        <description>The mean change from baseline (in the DB study) in Y was derived from the TS.
Y was graded according to the following scale: Grade 0 - no resistance throughout passive movement (best outcome); Grade 1 - slight resistance throughout passive movement; Grade 2 - clear catch at precise angle, interrupting passive movement, followed by release; Grade 3 - fatigable clonus (less than 10 sec when maintaining pressure) occurring at a precise angle, followed by release; Grade 4 - unfatigable clonus (more than 10 seconds when maintaining pressure) occurring at a precise angle; Grade 5 - joint immovable (worst outcome).
Catch without release was graded 0 if XV1=XV3, ‘unratable’ spasticity otherwise; catch with 'minimal' release was graded 2 if XV3 was consistent and consistently less than XV1.
Angle 0 = position of minimal stretch of the tested muscle. For Grades 0 and 1, spasticity angle X = 0 by definition.</description>

          <title>Mean Change From Baseline (Prior to the First Injection Cycle in the Hamstrings) in XV3 Derived From the TS, in the Knee Flexors Assessed at the Knee Joint of the (Most) Affected Lower Limb</title>
          <description>The TS was used to measure spasticity in the knee flexors at the knee joint of the (most) affected lower limb.
The Investigator assessed muscle reactions of the tested muscle to passive stretch at two velocities: SLOW = V1: as slow as possible (slower than the rate of natural drop of the limb segment under gravity); FAST = V2 (speed of the limb segment falling under gravity) or V3 (as fast as possible - faster than the rate of natural drop of the limb segment under gravity).
The mean change from baseline (prior to the first injection cycle in the hamstrings) in XV3 at fast speed was derived.</description>

        <description>The mean change from baseline (prior to the first injection cycle in the hamstrings) in Y was derived from the TS.
Y was graded according to the following scale: Grade 0 - no resistance throughout passive movement (best outcome); Grade 1 - slight resistance throughout passive movement; Grade 2 - clear catch at precise angle, interrupting passive movement, followed by release; Grade 3 - fatigable clonus (less than 10 sec when maintaining pressure) occurring at a precise angle, followed by release; Grade 4 - unfatigable clonus (more than 10 seconds when maintaining pressure) occurring at a precise angle; Grade 5 - joint immovable (worst outcome).
Catch without release was graded 0 if XV1=XV3, ‘unratable’ spasticity otherwise; catch with 'minimal' release was graded 2 if XV3 was consistent and consistently less than XV1.
Angle 0 = position of minimal stretch of the tested muscle. For Grades 0 and 1, spasticity angle X = 0 by definition.</description>

        <title>Mean Change From DB Baseline in the Observational Gait Scale (OGS) Total Score of the (Most) Affected Leg</title>
        <description>The OGS is a measurement tool used to objectively quantify positive and negative features (impairments) of the upper motor neurone syndrome. The OGS is useful when children are too young or insufficiently cooperative for instrumented gait analysis. It is based on the Physicians Rating Scale but has some modifications to improve its sensitivity to detect changes following administration of Botulinum Toxin Type A (BTX-A).
The OGS total score was calculated as the sum of the individual question scores for Questions 1 to 7, with the highest possible score being 20. The parameters collected were: knee position in midstance, initial foot contact, foot contact at midstance, timing of heel raise, hindfoot at midstance, base of support and gait assistive devices. Higher scores indicate better gait.
The mean change from baseline (in the DB study) in the OGS total score of the (most) affected leg was derived.</description>

        <title>Mean Change From DB Baseline in the PedsQL Score (CP Module Scores) at Each Study Visit Except Week 4</title>
        <description>The PedsQL has a disease specific CP module that is relevant to the study population and complements the core modules.
The 35-item questionnaire encompassed 7 scales including (1) daily activities (2) school activities (3) movement and balance (4) pain and hurt (5) fatigue (6) eating activities and (7) speech and communication. A 5-point scale was utilised for parent proxy-report: 0 = never a problem; 1 = almost never a problem; 2 = sometimes a problem; 3 = often a problem; 4 = almost always a problem.
Each CP score was calculated as follows: (1) Individual item scores were reversed and transformed from a 0-4 scale to a 0-100 scale by assigning 0=100, 1=75, 2=50, 3=25 and 4=0; (2) Each scale score was calculated as the sum of the transformed individual item scores, divided by the number of non-missing items. Higher scores indicated better quality of life (fewer symptoms or problems).
A scale score was only calculated if at least 50% of the associated items were non-missing.</description>

        <title>Mean Change From DB Baseline in the PedsQL Score (Generic Core Scores) at Each Study Visit Except Week 4</title>
        <description>The PedsQL is a validated quality of life questionnaire, designed for children from 2 to 18 years of age. The Generic Core Scale covers four multidimensional scales including physical, emotional, social and school aspects, with three summary scales of total scale score, physical health summary score and psychosocial health summary score.
Each generic core scale was calculated as follows: (1) Individual item scores were reversed and transformed from a 0-4 scale to a 0-100 scale by assigning 0=100, 1=75, 2=50, 3=25 and 4=0; (2) Each scale score was calculated as the sum of the transformed individual item scores, divided by the number of non-missing items. Higher scores indicated better quality of life (fewer symptoms or problems).
A scale score was only calculated if at least 50% of the associated items were non-missing.</description>

Each generic core scale was calculated as follows: (1) Individual item scores were reversed and transformed from a 0-4 scale to a 0-100 scale by assigning 0=100, 1=75, 2=50, 3=25 and 4=0; (2) Each scale score was calculated as the sum of the transformed individual item scores, divided by the number of non-missing items. Higher scores indicated better quality of life (fewer symptoms or problems).
A scale score was only calculated if at least 50% of the associated items were non-missing.</description>
          <population>ITT population where n represents number of subjects with data. For Treatment Cycle 4, Week 12 was not included in the study design. Subjects who completed the study or withdrew were counted as missing at subsequent visits. PHS = pyschosocial health summary; W12 = Week 12.</population>

      <desc>Safety population. One subject received placebo in the DB study and two cycles of Dysport in the OL study. As both Dysport treatments were outside of the ranges specified (≤7.5 U/kg in Treatment Cycles 1 and 2), the subject was excluded from the analysis (no TEAEs were reported for this subject), and the number of participants at risk was equal to 215.
A total of 175 subjects experienced nonserious AEs, of whom 147 experienced nonserious AEs that occurred above the frequency threshold of 5%.</desc>
