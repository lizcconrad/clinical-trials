  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare the effect of a 25% glucose solution given via a
      soother with or without facilitated tucking with a similarly administered water placebo
      (control condition) on infant stress responses during and immediately after a neonatologist
      performed ECHO (np-ECHO).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      One hundred and four infants were randomized to one of four groups during a single np-ECHO
      examination, at the discretion of the medical team. Randomization to soother and water
      (Control) with and without facilitated tucking or to soother and 25% glucose (Intervention)
      with or without facilitated tucking will be determined by generating randomly permuted
      sequential blocks of four and six allocation numbers.

    <description>Oral Glucose 25% first given two minutes before the first contact by the physician performing the np-ECHO. A soother will be held in the infant's mouth to ensure that continuous contact is maintained throughout the testing period. Repeat application of solution as per study protocol. No other non-pharmaceutical interventions for stress reduction will be applied. During each np-ECHO, infants have additional handling only if it is required to maintain physiological stability.</description>
