      Researchers at the University of California, San Francisco have developed methods that permit
      them to test multiple pulse oximeter sensors on neonates simultaneously during cardiac
      surgery. During this type of surgery, the arterial oxygen saturation changes over a wide
      range, providing an ideal arena for the assessment of neonatal pulse oximeter sensors at many
      levels of oxygen saturation. Several arterial blood gas samples are typically obtained during
      these procedures. Saturation of each arterial blood sample is determined by direct oximetry
      in a hemoximeter and this measurement is compared to the reading displayed on the pulse
      oximeter.
