  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test the effectiveness of a drug called erlotinib in treating
      the tumor. This is a multi-center pilot study that explores efficacy and molecular effects of
      high dose weekly erlotinib for recurrent EGFR vIII mutant malignant gliomas, and correlate
      molecular profile of pre-treatment tissue with outcome.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Amplification of the EGFR gene locus occurs also in approximately 40% of glioblastomas (GBM).
      Activating EGFR mutations such as EGFRvIII occur in approximately 50% of these GBMs (20%
      overall), leading to constitutive receptor activation and oncogenic signaling. The high
      frequency of EGFR signaling abnormalities in GBM led to initial enthusiasm for clinical
      trials of the EGFR TKIs erlotinib and gefitinib. However, responses were rare.

    <description>All patients will have their tumor measurements recorded at baseline and at the time of each MRI/CT scan.
Clinical efficacy of pulsatile dosing with the EGFR Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitor erlotinib in patient with EGFR vIII mutant, recurrent malignant gliomas will be explored by determination of radiographic response and 6 month progression-free survival (6mPFS rate).</description>

    <description>Pharmacokinetics will be measured, including intratumoral concentration of erlotinib and active metabolites. Blood samples will be drawn at indicated timepoints in order to assess the Cmax blood concentration levels of Erlotinib for subjects on treatment.</description>

    <description>Evaluation of the in vivo biological activity of protocol therapy will be explored by a within patient comparison of EGFR activation (measured by pEGFR), PI3K/AKT/mTOR/S6K signaling (measured by pS6K and pAKT and related molecules), RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK signaling (measured by pERK and related molecules) and cell proliferation (measured by Ki-67 immunostaining to estimate the proliferation index as the % of tumor cells staining per high power field) in pre-treatment archived tissue versus the tissue acquired during treatment for patients in cohort B. Slides analyzed by immunohistochemistry will be scored for staining on a 4 point scale (0-3)</description>
