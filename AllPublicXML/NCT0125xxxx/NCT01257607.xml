        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Be at least 18 years of age

          3. Have a reported history of dry eye

          4. Have a history of use or desire to use eye drops for dry eye

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Be diagnosed with an ongoing ocular infection (bacterial, viral, or fungal), or active
             ocular inflammation (e.g. follicular conjunctivitis) at Visit 1, or have been
             diagnosed with ocular rosacea, or any viral or bacterial disease of the cornea or
             conjunctiva, within the last 12 months

          2. Have any planned ocular and/or lid surgeries over the study period

          3. Have corrected visual acuity greater than or equal to +0.7 as assessed by Early
             Treatment of Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) scale in both eyes at Visit 1

          4. Have an uncontrolled systemic disease

          5. Be a woman who is pregnant, nursing or planning a pregnancy

          6. Be a woman of childbearing potential who is not using an acceptable means of birth
             control; acceptable methods of contraception include: hormonal - oral, implantable,
             injectable, or transdermal contraceptives; mechanical - spermicide in conjunction with
             a barrier such as a diaphragm or condom; IUD; or surgical sterilization of partner.
             For non-sexually active females, abstinence may be regarded as an adequate method of
             birth control; however, if the subject becomes sexually active during the study, she
             must agree to use adequate birth control as defined above for the remainder of the
             study

          7. Have a known allergy and/or sensitivity to the test article or its components

          8. Have a condition or be in a situation which the investigator feels may put the subject
             at significant risk, may confound the study results, or may interfere significantly
             with the subject's participation in the study

          9. Be currently enrolled in an investigational drug or device study or have used an
             investigational drug or device within 45 days of Visit 1

         10. Be unable or unwilling to follow instructions, including participation in all study
             assessments and visits
