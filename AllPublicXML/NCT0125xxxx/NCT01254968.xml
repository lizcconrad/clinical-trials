    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is evaluation of cerebral blood flow (based on testing the rate of flow
      in middle cerebral arteries by transcranial Doppler ultrasound) during different forms of
      walking training - walk forwards and backwards, with closed and open eyes.

    <textblock>
      In the third minute of training walking a significant increase in blood flow velocity was
      recorded, both in right and left middle cerebral arteries. It was observed in the left artery
      during all forms of training. In the right artery it occurred only during three forms of
      difficult training, and was preceded by significant decrease in blood flow in the first
      minute of the gait with eyes closed. The output values of the rate of blood flow in both
      right and left middle cerebral arteries became progressively reduced in the successive stages
      of gait. Pressure and pulse rates did not correlate with the variables of blood flow velocity
      in middle cerebral arteries.

    <description>Significant changes in blood flow to the brain depending on the form of walking and its conditions were observed. Changes in the right middle cerebral artery were more diverse than in the left artery. Difficulty in walking training forms gave long-term vasodilation.</description>

        20 healthy subjects (11 men, 9 women, average age 23.94) participated in a study measuring
        the speed of blood flow in middle cerebral arteries using transcranial Doppler
        (transcranial Doppler Sonography) while walking on a treadmill.
