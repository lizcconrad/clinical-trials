    <textblock>
      The purpose of the BLOCk-CTI study is to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of the Blazer®
      Open-Irrigated Ablation Catheter for the treatment of sustained or recurrent type 1 atrial
      flutter. This study will compare outcomes in patients treated with the Blazer® Open-Irrigated
      Ablation Catheter to outcomes in patients treated with open-irrigated radiofrequency ablation
      catheters that have received FDA market approval for the treatment of type 1 atrial flutter.

      The BLOCk-CTI study is a prospective, multicenter, single blind, 1:1 randomized study. The
      study is designed to demonstrate that the safety and effectiveness of the Blazer®
      Open-Irrigated Ablation Catheter are non-inferior to the safety and effectiveness of the
      control catheters. In this study, the control catheters are open-irrigated radiofrequency
      ablation catheters that have received FDA market approval for the treatment of type 1 atrial
      flutter. (Biosense Webster ThermoCool® ablation catheters (NaviStar™, EZ Steer, or SF) or St.
      Jude Medical ablation catheters (Therapy™ Cool Path™ or Safire BLU™).

    <description>A procedure-related complication is defined as an adverse event that results in death, a life-threatening complication, or a persistent or significant disability/incapacity or required intervention to prevent a permanent impairment of a body function or damage to a body structure. All adverse events related to the investigational or control devices or ablation procedure will be considered procedure-related events.</description>

    <description>Acute success is defined as demonstration of bidirectional cavo-tricuspid isthmus block (ie, lack of electrophysiological conduction through the isthmus) 30 minutes after the last radiofrequency application in the cavo-tricuspid isthmus with the investigational or control catheter only.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  At least 1 documented episode of type 1 atrial flutter in the 180 days (6 months)
             preceding enrollment documented by 12-lead ECG, Holter monitor, rhythm strip, or
             transtelephonic monitor

             tachyarrhythmia other than type 1 atrial flutter must be controlled on the
             anti-arrhythmic drug for a minimum of 30 days prior to enrollment. If type 1 atrial
             flutter was documented prior to the development of other tachyarrhythmias, this 30-day
             period is not required.

             and placement, as determined by the Investigator

          -  Any cerebral ischemic event (including transient ischemic attacks) within 180 days
             prior to enrollment

          -  Contraindication to anticoagulation therapy based upon published guidelines

          -  Creatinine greater than 2.5 mg/dl or creatinine clearance less than 30 mL/min within

             metabolic illness)

          -  Enrolled in any concurrent study without BSC written approval

          -  Women who are pregnant or plan to become pregnant within the course of their
