    <measure>Change from Baseline in muscle function using the 6 Minute Walking Distance (6MWD) test assessed at Week 48</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Day 0) and Week 48</time_frame>
    <description>During the 6MWD, participants were asked to walk, at their own preferred speed, up and down a fixed distance until they were told to stop after 6 minutes (M). The participants were warned of the time and were told that they may stop earlier if they feel unable to continue. The total distance walked within 6M (or until the participant stopped in case of early termination of the test), the 6MWD, was recorded in meters as well as any falls. Baseline was defined as participants randomization assessment at Visit 3 (Day 0). Change from Baseline was calculated by subtracting the Baseline value from the value at Week 48.</description>

    <measure>Change from Baseline in the linearized North Star Ambulatory Assessment (NSAA) total score at Week 48</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Day 0) and Week 48</time_frame>
    <description>The NSAA is a functional scale devised from the Hammersmith Scale of Motor Ability specifically for use in ambulant children with Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD). It consists of 17 activities graded 0 (unable to perform), 1 (performs with modifications), 2 (normal movement). The scale assesses activities required to remain functionally ambulant (e.g. rise from the floor), activities that can be difficult even early in the disease (e.g. standing on heels) and activities that are known to progressively deteriorate over time (stand from a chair, walk). NSAA Total Score ranges from 0 to 34, with a score of 34 implying normal function. Baseline was defined as participants randomization assessment at Visit 3 (Day 0). Change from Baseline was calculated by subtracting the Baseline value from the value at Week 48.</description>

    <measure>Change from Baseline in the 4 stair climb (ascent) velocity at Week 48</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Day 0) and Week 48</time_frame>
    <description>The participant was asked to ascend four steps. Time was recorded with a stopwatch from the initiation of movement until the participant stood on the fourth step. A flight of steps with handrail was used for this test. Number of stairs ascended per second was calculated as 4 divided by the time to ascend 4 complete. Baseline was defined as participants randomization assessment at Visit 3 (Day 0). Change from Baseline was calculated by subtracting the Baseline value from the value at Week 48.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from Baseline in the 10-meter walk/run velocity at Week 48</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Day 0) and Week 48</time_frame>
    <description>The participant was instructed to perform the test bare foot. No aids or orthoses were allowed. The participant was asked to traverse a marked 10-meter measured walkway as quickly as he safely could. Time was recorded to one tenth of a second with a stop watch from when his first foot crossed the start line until when the second foot crossed the finish line. If the wall was touched, it was noted how often. Care was taken to ensure that the participant was safe when completing this test. The assessor walked nearby to provide emergency help if needed, but did not support or provide manual assistance to the participant in any way. If the participant could not complete the 10-meter walk, the total distance was recorded. 10 minute walk/run speed was equal to 10 divided by time taken to complete 10 minute walk/run. Baseline was defined as participants randomization assessment at Visit 3 (Day 0). Change from Baseline was calculated by subtracting the Baseline value from the value at Week 48.</description>

    <measure>Number of participants with Identified Mutation: DMD Exon 51 skip (upon muscle biopsies) at Week 48</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 48</time_frame>
    <description>Most participants had biopsies taken from their tibialis anterior muscle (only 3 participants used their quadriceps).1 at Week 8, 12, 24, or 36 (participants were arbitrarily assigned to these visits) and 1 at Week 48 (all participants). Small samples of the muscle biopsy were stored for retrospective analysis. These were only analyzed in the event that any participant did not respond. Total muscle ribonucleic acid (RNA) was isolated from muscle tissue sections and was analyzed by reverse transcriptase polymer chain reaction (RT-PCR). RT-PCR analysis focused on the area flanking the targeted exon 51 was performed to detect specific exon 51 skipping in muscle. Depending on the participants mutation different sets of DMD-gene specific RT and PCR primers were used. Sequence analysis was performed on isolated PCR products to confirm specific exon 51 skip band detection.</description>

    <measure>Change from Baseline in Pediatric Quality of Life (PedsQL) Total Score at Week 48</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Day 0) and Week 48</time_frame>
    <description>The PedsQL 3.0 scale is used to measure pediatric quality of life (QOL) in children with neuromuscular disorders. The 25-item PedsQL Module encompasses 3 scales About My/My Childs Neuromuscular Disease (AMND,17 items related to the disease process and associated symptomatology), Communication (3 items related to the participant ability to communicate with health care providers about his/her illness), About Our Family Resources (AOFR, 5 items related to family financial and social support systems). A 5-point response scale is utilized (where 0=never a problem and 4=almost always a problem). The AMND Scale uses a 3-point response scale using smiley faces to assess problems for the child (0 =not at all and 4=a lot). The PedsQL total score ranges from 0-100, where higher scores indicate better health-related QOL. Baseline was defined as participants randomization assessment at Visit 3 (Day 0). Change from Baseline was calculated by subtracting the Baseline value from the value at Week 48.</description>

    <measure>Number of participants who showed improvement on Clinician Global Impression of Improvement (CGI-I) scale at Week 48</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 48</time_frame>
    <description>The CGI-I is scored based on the clinician's reflection of the participant's current overall clinical condition compared to the overall clinical condition just prior to the initiation of medication use (i.e., the period prior to Randomization). The CGI-I is rated without regard to the clinician's belief that any clinical changes are or are not due to medication and without consideration of the etiology of the symptoms. The CGI-I is measured on a 7-point Likert scale (where 1 = very much improved, 2 = much improved, 3 = minimally improved, 4 = no change, 5 = minimally worse, 6 = much worse, 7 = very much worse).</description>

    <measure>Change from Baseline in Health Utilities Index (HUI) Scores at Week 48</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Day 0) and Week 48</time_frame>
    <description>A 15-item HUI questionnaire for proxy-administered completion was used to assess Health-related quality of life (HRQoL).Responses from the 15-item HUI were used to quantify HRQoL according to two complementary health status classification systems, the HUI Mark 2 (HUI2) and HUI Mark 3 (HUI3). The HUI2 assessed seven HRQoL dimensions: sensation, mobility, emotion, cognition, self care, pain and fertility. The HUI3 assessed eight HRQoL dimensions: vision, hearing, speech, ambulation, dexterity, emotion, cognition and pain. A utility value of 1.0 represented perfect health and a utility value of 0.0 represented death. The lowest possible HUI2 score was -0.03 and the lowest possible HUI3 score was -0.36, where scores less than zero represented health states considered worse than death. Baseline was defined as participants randomization assessment at Visit 3 (Day 0). Change from Baseline was calculated by subtracting the Baseline value from the value at Week 48.</description>
