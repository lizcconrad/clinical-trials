  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Ulnar translocation of the carpus is a form of wrist instability where the small bones of the
      wrist shift out of position. It is well recognized in patients with rheumatoid arthritis, but
      can also occur after a traumatic event, such as a violent football tackle or a fall from a
      height. The treatment options vary considerably, and there is no consensus of how to best
      address this injury pattern.

      Because traumatic ulnar translocation is relatively rare, the diagnosis may be missed or
      delayed, causing problems for the patient such as persistent pain and loss of function. The
      investigators present 11 cases of this injury, discuss how to recognize it, and report our
      results after different treatment methods.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Ulnar translocation of the carpus is a form of wrist instability where the entire carpus
      translates medially along the inclined plane of the distal radius. This pattern of
      instability has been well recognized in patients with rheumatoid arthritis as a result of
      articular erosions and attenuation of wrist ligaments. In contrast, ulnar translocation of
      the carpus following trauma is seemingly rare, with published accounts limited to case
      reports and small case series.

      The radiographic features of traumatic ulnocarpal translocation have been described and the
      instability pattern has been reproduced in cadaveric models. However, the recognition of
      radiocarpal malalignment may be unintentionally missed or delayed owing due to the uncommon
      nature of the this injury. The investigators present 11 cases of posttraumatic ulnar
      translocation of the carpus and review criteria for early recognition of the injury and the
      results following varying treatment methods.
