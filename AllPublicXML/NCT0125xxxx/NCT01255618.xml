    <textblock>
      Near infrared spectrophotometry (NIRS) offers the possibility of noninvasive and continuous
      bedside investigation of cerebral , renal, mesenteric and peripheric oxygenation and
      hemodynamics, and changes in newborn period.The aim of the present study is to investigate
      cerebral oxygenation with NIRS method in polycythaemic infants who underwent partial exchange
      transfusion.

    <description>Near-infrared range and has been used in newborn infants since 1985. Fibre-optic bundles or optodes are placed either on opposite sides of the tissue being interrogated (usually a limb or the head of a young baby) to measure transmitted light, or close together to measure reflected light. Light enters through one optode and a fraction of the photons is captured by a second optode and conveyed to the measuring device. NIRS uses a frequency band between 650 nm and 1000 nm and relies on three important phenomena: (1) human tissue is relatively transparent to light in the near-infrared region of the spectrum; (2) pigmented compounds known as chromophores absorb light as it passes through biological tissue; and (3) human tissues contain substances whose absorption spectra at near-infrared wavelengths are well defined and depend on their oxygenation status.</description>
