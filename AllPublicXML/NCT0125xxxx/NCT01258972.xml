  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Tryton Side Branch Stent System has been designed to address the procedural difficulty
      surrounding treatment of bifurcation lesions and to ensure patency of the side branch with
      similar performance capabilities (e.g., tracking, radiopacity, coverage and radial strength)
      that are currently available with conventional coronary stents designed for straight (non
      bifurcation) lesions.

      The Tryton Side Branch Stent is intended to treat and maintain patency in the side
      branch/carina by providing better ostial side branch conformability and is intended for use
      in conjunction with currently approved balloon-expandable drug-eluding stents for treatment
      of the main branch.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The use of drug-eluding stents in the treatment of bifurcation lesions suggests that DES
      reduces the rate of restenosis int he main branch (5-10%); however, results int he side
      branch are not optimal. A study of T stenting in true bifurcation lesions showed a restenosis
      rate int he main branch of approximately 6% using the CYPHER stent. However, the same study
      demonstrated that the restenosis rate remained high int he side branch (20%) despite stent
      implantation and when restenosis occurs, it is generally located at the ostium of the side
      branch. Further, in half the cases where PTCA alone was the intended strategy for the side
      branch, a side branch stent had to be placed to address sub-optimal procedural results.

      These findings are consistent with previous metal stent studies and suggest the best
      long-term results are obtained when a side branch stent is not placed. This study and others
      suggest that the outcomes are related to the way the stents sit within in the vessel; and
      therefore a stent designed specifically for bifurcation lesions will be needed to reduce
      restenosis rates and improve long-term outcomes.
