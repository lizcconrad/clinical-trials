    <textblock>
      The purpose of this 4-week dispensing trial is to evaluate and compare an investigational
      soft contact lens worn on a daily disposable basis with three other soft contact lenses also
      worn on a daily disposable basis.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Overall Comfort</measure>
    <time_frame>4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Overall comfort was assessed and recorded by the participant on a questionnaire as a single, retrospective evaluation of 4 weeks of wear. Overall comfort was measured on a 10-point scale, with 1 being poor and 10 being excellent.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Vision Quality During the Day</measure>
    <time_frame>4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Vision quality during the day was assessed and recorded by the participant on a questionnaire as a single, retrospective evaluation of 4 weeks of wear. Vision quality during the day was measured on a 10-point scale, with 1 being poor and 10 being excellent.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Overall Handling</measure>
    <time_frame>4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Overall handling was assessed and recorded by the participant on a questionnaire as a single, retrospective evaluation of 4 weeks of wear. Overall handling was measured on a 10-point scale, with 1 being poor and 10 being excellent.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Dryness Throughout the Day</measure>
    <time_frame>4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Dryness throughout the day was assessed and recorded by the participant on a questionnaire as a single, retrospective evaluation of 4 weeks of wear. Dryness throughout the day was measured on a 10-point scale, with 1 being very dry and 10 being not dry.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Average Daily Wear Time</measure>
    <time_frame>4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Average daily wear time (hours) was reported by the participant as a single, retrospective evaluation of 4 weeks of wear.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Lens Fit</measure>
    <time_frame>4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Lens fit was assessed by the investigator for each eye using a biomicroscope, which magnifies the appearance of the contact lens on the participant's eye. Lens fit was graded on a 5-point scale, with 2=unacceptable loose, 1=acceptable loose, 0=optimal, -1=acceptable tight, and -2=unacceptable tight.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Corrected Visual Acuity</measure>
    <time_frame>4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Corrected visual acuity was tested for each eye while the participant read distant charts in normal lighting. Corrected visual acuity was measured with a Snellen chart, which was converted into logMAR units (logarithm of the minimum angle of resolution). A 20/20 Snellen acuity equates to a logMAR acuity of 0.0 and is considered normal distance eyesight. Positive logMAR values indicate poorer vision, and negative values denote better visual acuity.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Overall Satisfaction</measure>
    <time_frame>4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Overall satisfaction was recorded on a 5-point Likert scale as a single, retrospective evaluation of 4 weeks of wear. The following scale was used: 2=very satisfied, 1=somewhat satisfied, 0=neither, -1=somewhat dissatisfied, and -2=very dissatisfied.</description>

        <title>Corrected Visual Acuity</title>
        <description>Corrected visual acuity was tested for each eye while the participant read distant charts in normal lighting. Corrected visual acuity was measured with a Snellen chart, which was converted into logMAR units (logarithm of the minimum angle of resolution). A 20/20 Snellen acuity equates to a logMAR acuity of 0.0 and is considered normal distance eyesight. Positive logMAR values indicate poorer vision, and negative values denote better visual acuity.</description>
