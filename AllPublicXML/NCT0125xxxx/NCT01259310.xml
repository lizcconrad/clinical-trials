      This is a three-center prospective case-control study to examine the patterns of fertility
      among women with epilepsy (WWE) compared to an age-matched group of women without epilepsy
      (WWoE). The investigators will determine if pregnancy rates differ in WWE compared to WWoE.
      Covariates of interest include proportion of ovulatory cycles, sexual activity, and type of
      anti-epileptic drug (AED). The investigators will compare seizure frequency during
      preconception to seizure frequency during pregnancy, with analysis of covariates of interest
      (AED type, AED ratio-to-target concentrations, and epilepsy syndrome). The investigators will
      also observe interactions between seizures/epilepsy, AEDs, and sex steroid hormones during
      this opportune time when women are not on birth control. Patterns of seizures will be
      evaluated for accepted catamenial patterns with consideration of ovulatory and anovulatory
      cycles, AED concentrations, and epilepsy type.

        recruited from Obstetrics and Gynaecology clinics, local academic institutions, and
        referrals from epilepsy clinic employees or patients.
