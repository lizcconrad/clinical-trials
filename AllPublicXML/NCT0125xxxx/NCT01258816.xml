      The purpose of the study is to investigate the pharmacokinetics (PK) and cardiac properties
      of elacytarabine in patients with relapsed or refractory Acute Myeloid Leukaemia (AML). The
      efficacy and tolerability of elacytarabine will also be assessed.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Elacytarabine is an investigational drug which is not commercially available. It consists of
      a fatty acid that is connected to cytarabine which is commonly used in treatment of AML. Due
      to the connection to a fatty acid, elacytarabine might have an increased uptake in blast
      cells and thereby increased efficacy.

      The characterisation of the pharmacokinetics of an investigational drug, as well as the
      cardiac safety are essential. The PK of both elacytarabine and its metabolites will be
      assessed at defined timepoints before, during and after infusion. The cardiac safety of
      elacytarabine will be evaluated by triplicate ECG recordings at the same time points as the
      PK assessments.

      Elacytarabine will be given as a continuous infusion for 5 days. The patients may continue
      with further courses of elacytarabine as long as the patient benefits from treatment with
      elacytarabine.

        Inclusion¨Criteria:

          1. Patients must have relapsed / refractory AML according to WHO classification
             (excluding acute promyelocytic leukaemia)

          2. Patients must have ECOG Performance Status (PS) of 0 - 2

          3. Patients must be 18 years of age or older

          4. Women of child-bearing potential must have a negative serum or urine pregnancy test
             within two weeks prior to treatment start

          5. Male and female fertile patients must use adequate contraception for the duration of
             the study, and males also for 3 months after the last elacytarabine dose

          6. Patients must be capable of understanding and complying with protocol requirements,
             and they must be able and willing to sign a written informed consent

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. A history of allergic reactions to egg. A history of CTCAE grade 3 or 4 allergic
             reactions to ara-C of

          2. A history of cancer that according to the investigator might confound the assessment
