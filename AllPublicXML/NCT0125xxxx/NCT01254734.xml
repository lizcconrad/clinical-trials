      RATIONALE: Transoral robotic surgery (TORS) is a less invasive type of surgery for head and
      neck cancer and may have fewer side effects and improve recovery. PURPOSE: This clinical
      trial studies how transoral robotic surgery works in treating patients with benign or stage
      I-IV head and neck cancer.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: To conduct a pilot study at City of Hope (COH) which assesses the
      feasibility and safety of TORS (Transoral robotic surgery), including: total operative time,
      blood loss, hospitalization time, need to convert to an open procedure, intra-operative as
      well as post-operative complications. SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. To collect data on oncologic
      outcomes, disease free survival, local control rate and overall survival. II. To collect
      normative data regarding objective functional outcomes (FO) which may impact quality of life
      in patients undergoing TORS, including need for adjunctive procedures, such as gastrostomy
      tube placement and tracheostomy placement, and with regards to speech, swallowing function
      and pain, using patient-report outcomes instruments. OUTLINE: Patients undergo transoral
      robotic microsurgery. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up
      periodically for 5 years.
