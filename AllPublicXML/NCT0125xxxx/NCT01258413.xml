      The purpose of this study is to determine whether laparoscopic radical hysterectomy for early
      cervical cancer will has decreased postoperative pain intensity compared to abdominal radical
      hysterectomy with similar postoperative complications and survival rates.

      Background: Radical hysterectomy with pelvic lymphadenectomy is one of the FIGO
      (International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics) recommended treatments for early
      cervical cancer. The objective of this study was to compare radical hysterectomy by
      laparoscopic approach and open radical hysterectomy in a single center randomized clinical
      trial. Nevertheless, there are no finished randomized controlled trials comparing
      laparoscopic radical hysterectomy and abdominal radical hysterectomy although there is an
      ongoing trial.

      Methods: Were enrolled 30 IA2 with lymph vascular space invasion and IB cervical cancer
      patients. Postoperative pain intensity was defined as primary endpoint and pain intensity was
      measured by a 10-point numeric rating scale. Secondary outcomes were: intraoperative and
      other postoperative outcomes, histopathological outcomes and 5-year follow-up. Data analysis
      is being done at this moment

    <description>The primary outcome is postoperative pain as measured by a 10-point numeric rating scale (NRS) during the postoperative period. Pain was assessed every six hours by nursing staff during a patient's usual postoperative care. The nursing staff was not aware of the study objective.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Intraoperative, perioperative and postoperative complication</measure>
    <time_frame>30 days or five years</time_frame>
    <description>1 Intraoperative outcomes included the following: operative time (minutes), injuries to the ureter, bladder, bowel or vessels and anaesthesia complications requiring blood transfusion.
2. Early (&lt; 30 days) or late postoperative events and findings during the hospital stay or after included the following: hospital stay duration (days), complications. Surgical or clinical findings that could be attributable to the treatment in five years of follow up 74 Clinical or surgical findings that could be attributable to the treatment or the disease at five years of follow-up.</description>

    <measure>Surgicopathological outcomes</measure>

    <description>outcomes included the following: histological type, surgical margins, lymph node status and lymph node number, all assessed by pathologists with expertise in gynaecologic oncology. In addition, parametrial and vaginal cuff width (centimetres) was assessed by the first surgeon in the operating room, before tissue processing.</description>
