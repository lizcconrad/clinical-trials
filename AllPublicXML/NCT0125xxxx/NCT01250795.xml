             diphtheria, and pertussis [Tdap] up to 8 days before or at least 8 days after a dose
             of study vaccine will be allowed, and administration of study vaccine injection can be
             delayed if a nonstudy vaccine has been administered and will be given as soon as
             acceptable [as described above] provided the vaccine is not administered within 2
