    <textblock>
      The purpose of this trial is to describe the Seroprotection Rate (SPR) at least 2 years
      following completion of a primary series with a hepatitis B vaccine (Base Study V232-059,
      NCT00440531) and 1 month following a challenge dose with a Modified Process Hepatitis B
      vaccine.

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of Participants With One or More Adverse Experiences</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to Day 15 after challenge dose</time_frame>
    <description>An adverse experience is defined as any unfavorable and unintended change in the structure, function, or chemistry of the body temporally associated with the use of the sponsor's product, whether or not considered related to the use of the product. Any worsening of a preexisting condition which is temporally associated with the use of the sponsor's product, is also an adverse experience. The percentage of participants with one or more adverse experiences was assessed.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of Participants With One or More Serious Adverse Experiences</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to Month 1 after challenge dose</time_frame>
    <description>A serious adverse experience is an adverse experience that results in death, is life threatening, results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity, results in or prolongs a hospitalization, is a congenital anomaly or birth defect, is a cancer, or may jeopardize the participant and may require medical or surgical intervention. The percentage of participants with one or more serious adverse experiences was assessed.</description>
