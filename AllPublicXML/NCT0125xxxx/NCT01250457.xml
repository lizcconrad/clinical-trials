      The purpose of this research is to find out if the use of topical timolol 0.5% solution
      applied twice daily will help to shrink rosacea lesions around the eye.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Benign vascular tumors of the eyelid are common causes of ocular morbidity. Capillary
      hemangiomas in children cause refractive and occlusive amblyopia. In adults,
      Rosacea-associated eyelid telangiectasis and sclerosis can result in keratitis and corneal
      neovascularization. Corticosteroid therapy of benign vascular lesions risks sight-threatening
      complications including central retinal artery occlusion and significant systemic morbidity.
      Alternatively, oral and intravenous beta-blockers have been reported to induce regression of
      benign vascular lesions. One recent report documented efficacy of topical timolol in treating
      a large capillary hemangioma of the eyelid in a child. Topical application reduces systemic
      side effects of beta-blockers including bradycardia, hypotension, heart block, and
      bronchospasm. This one-year prospective case-control series will investigate whether topical
      Timolol 0.5% solution applied twice daily causes significant regression of benign vascular
      periocular lesions.
