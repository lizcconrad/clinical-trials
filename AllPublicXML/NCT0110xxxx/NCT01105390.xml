  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial is studying how well giving AMG 102 together with pemetrexed disodium and
      cisplatin works in treating patients with malignant pleural mesothelioma. Monoclonal
      antibodies, such as AMG 102, can block tumor growth in different ways. Some block the ability
      of tumor cells to grow or spread. Others find tumor cells and help kill them or carry
      tumor-killing substances to them. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as pemetrexed disodium and
      cisplatin, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the
      cells or by stopping them from dividing. Giving AMG 102 together with pemetrexed disodium and
      cisplatin may kill more tumor cells

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the progression-free survival of patients with malignant pleural mesothelioma
      (MPM) treated with anti-HGF monoclonal antibody AMG 102 in combination with pemetrexed
      disodium and cisplatin.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the toxicity associated with this regimen in these patients. II. To determine
      the response rate of patients treated with this regimen. III. To determine the overall
      survival of patients treated with this regimen. IV. To evaluate multiple potential
      correlative biomarkers in MPM that are relevant to this combined regimen, including serum HGF
      and mesothelin levels, c-met expression by IHC in tumor specimens, presence of c-met
      mutations in tumor, and the presence of thymidylate synthetase (TS) and excision repair cross
      complementing protein-1 (ERCC1) polymorphisms.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive anti-HGF monoclonal antibody AMG 102 (AMG 102) IV over 1 hour, pemetrexed
      disodium IV over 10 minutes, and cisplatin IV over 1 hour on day 1. Treatment repeats every
      21 days for 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.
      Patients without disease progression may continue AMG 102 IV over 1 hour on day 1, every 3
      weeks, as maintenance therapy in the absence of disease progression. Some patients undergo
      blood sample collection at baseline and periodically during study for correlative biomarker
      studies. Tumor samples from diagnostic tissue may also be analyzed.

      After completion of study therapy, patients are followed up periodically every 3 months for 2
      years and then every 6 months for 1 year.
