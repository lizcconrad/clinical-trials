      This study will obtain pilot data on the impact oral naltrexone 50 mg/day vs. a
      sustained-release naltrexone implant on response to antiretroviral therapy (ART) in opioid
      addicted patients beginning ART in St. Petersburg, Russia.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will randomize, in a 1:1 ratio, 260 recently detoxified opioid addicts beginning
      ART to a 48-week course of biweekly drug counseling with either oral naltrexone 50 mg/day +
      placebo naltrexone implant, or placebo tablet + naltrexone implant. Approximate balanced
      randomization will be achieved by using an urn randomization design within each set of sites
      based in two baseline characteristics: (1) viral load &gt;100,000 copies/&lt;100,000 copies, and
      (2) CDF count &gt;50/&gt;50 copies. The primary outcome will be the response to ART as measured by
      reduction in viral load at 24 and 48 weeks.
