  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if a supplement called Provex CV can reduce blood
      pressure and other risk factors for heart disease. Heart disease is the leading cause of
      death in this country and it is important to identify dietary factors, including supplements,
      that can reduce heart disease risk factors. The supplement to be tested in this study is made
      of a combination of natural compounds found in plants such as grapeseed extract, green tea,
      and quercetin. Each compound individually has been shown to improve blood pressure or reduce
      inflammation. We hypothesize that Provex CV will reduce blood pressure and levels of
      inflammatory cytokines hypertensive patients with symptoms of metabolic syndrome. This
      investigational trial of Provex CV has been approved by the United States Food and Drug
      Administration.
