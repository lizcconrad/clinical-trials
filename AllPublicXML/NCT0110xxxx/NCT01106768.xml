      There is little accurate data in the literature at present on oral problems of hyperactive
      children, especially regarding care needs that would justify an assumption oral specific. The
      purpose of this study is therefore to have accurate data regarding the risk of caries, other
      oral diseases like periodontal disease, trauma, and assess the needs dental care and problems
      in cooperation for dental care in a population of children and adolescents with hyperactivity
      disorder with attention deficit. Finally, it has recently been described as the sleep
      disordered breathing was not uncommon in disorder attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder,
      whether snoring and/or apnea. But it is now accepted that some features of facial morphology
      favoring pharyngeal congestion occur in individuals with obstructive sleep apnea
      (hyperdivergent typology with increased anterior facial height and decreased posterior facial
      height, becoming the facial retrognathia, pharyngeal congestion, elongation and thickening of
      the soft palate, low position of the hyoid bone). A cephalometric analysis of craniofacial
      architecture and relationships with the soft tissue surrounding skeletal structures will
      detect if any of these specific characteristics that could promote sleep disordered breathing
      are found in disorder attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder prevalence with a particular.
