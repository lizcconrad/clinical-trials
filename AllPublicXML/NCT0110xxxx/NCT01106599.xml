  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, multicenter, Phase I dose-escalation study to assess the safety,
      tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of GDC-0623 in patients with locally advanced or
      metastatic solid tumors. Patients will be enrolled in one of two stages: a dose-escalation
      stage (Stage I) followed by an expansion stage (Stage II). Stage I will evaluate the safety,
      tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of increasing doses of GDC-0623 administered orally on a
      21 day on/7-day off dosing schedule.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Histologically or cytologically documented, locally advanced or metastatic solid
             tumors for which standard therapy either does not exist or has proven ineffective or
             intolerable

          -  Evaluable disease or disease measurable per RECIST

          -  Life expectancy &gt;= 12 weeks

          -  Adequate hematologic and end organ function

          -  Agreement to use effective form of contraception for the duration of the study

          -  Consent to provide archival tissue

          -  For the cohort expansion stage (Stage II): Patients in this cohort must have had no
             more than four prior systemic therapies for cancer and must have KRAS mutant CRC
             (Stage II A and B), pancreatic cancer (Stage IIC, or KRAS mutant NSCLC [Stage IID])

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  History of prior significant toxicity from a MEK pathway inhibitor requiring
             discontinuation of treatment

          -  History of parathyroid disorder or history of malignancy-associated hypercalcemia
             requiring therapy in the last 6 months

          -  History of retinal vein occlusion (RVO) or predisposing factors to RVO, including
             uncontrolled hypertension, uncontrolled diabetes, uncontrolled hyperlipidemia, and
             coagulopathy

          -  Evidence of visible retinal pathology considered a risk factor for retinal vein
             thrombosis

          -  History of glaucoma

          -  Palliative radiotherapy, experimental therapy, or anti-cancer therapy or major
             surgical procedure within a specified timeframe prior to first dose of study drug

          -  Current severe, uncontrolled systemic disease

          -  History of clinically significant cardiac dysfunction

          -  History of active gastrointestinal bleeding within 6 months prior to screening

          -  Clinically significant history of liver disease, current alcohol abuse, or current
             known active infection with HIV, or hepatitis B or C virus

          -  Active autoimmune disease

          -  Uncontrolled ascites

          -  Pregnancy, lactation, or breastfeeding

          -  Known brain metastases that are untreated, symptomatic, or require therapy to control
             symptoms

          -  For the Exploratory PK Cohorts (Stage IB and Stage IC): Patients who have a history of
             or ongoing gastro-esophageal reflux disease or peptic ulcer, or who have gastric
             pathology or history of gastric surgery which could affect absorption of GDC-0623 from
             the stomach, will be excluded from these cohorts
