    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to accurately assess the relationship between knee joint kinematics
      and migration of the tibial component of a high congruent, rotating platform total knee
      prosthesis by using fluoroscopy synchronised in time and space with a force plate, an
      external motion registration system and Electromyography (EMG).
