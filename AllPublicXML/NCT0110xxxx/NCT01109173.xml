  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study was to assess the safety and efficacy of an investigational eye
      drop intended for the prevention and treatment of inflammation (swelling and redness) and
      pain in the eye after cataract extraction.

    <description>Ocular inflammation was assessed by the investigator during slit lamp examination. Aqueous cells were scored on a 5-unit scale from 0 (none) to 4 (&gt; 30 cells), and aqueous flare (protein escaping from dilated vessels) was scored on a 4-unit scale from 0 (no visible flare when compared with the normal eye) to 3 (severe - very dense flare). To be considered cured, the patient must have had a score of 0 for both cells and flare.</description>

        <description>Ocular inflammation was assessed by the investigator during slit lamp examination. Aqueous cells were scored on a 5-unit scale from 0 (none) to 4 (&gt; 30 cells), and aqueous flare (protein escaping from dilated vessels) was scored on a 4-unit scale from 0 (no visible flare when compared with the normal eye) to 3 (severe â very dense flare). To be considered cured, the patient must have had a score of 0 for both cells and flare.</description>
