    <textblock>
      The Mobile Diabetes Intervention Study trial is evaluating a diabetes coaching system, using
      mobile phones and patient/ physician internet portals to allow patient-specific treatment and
      communication by their primary care physician. We hypothesize that timely information
      provided to patients and their physicians can result in reduction of A1c over 1 year.

Patients may provide their PCPs with printed copies of their logbooks and other information but physicians do not have access to the patient portal system. Patient action plans summarizing the patient-entered data and identifying possible self-management actions for improving their diabetes control are electronically sent to the patients every 2.5 months.</description>

The PCP is reminded that all data analysis is based on patient-entered, unvalidated data. The PCP has the option to use this information and remains responsible for all treatment decisions.</description>
