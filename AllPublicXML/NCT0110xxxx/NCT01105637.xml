      Burn injuries can affect how well you are able to perform daily activities. The reason this
      study is being done is to find out if aerobic exercise helps burn patients recover function,
      strength and stamina.

      Participants will come to Johns Hopkins Bayview Medical Center, Burn Rehabilitation Gym for
      treadmill exercise sessions 3 days per week for 12 weeks. Participants will be tested for
      strength and stamina before the start of the 12 week program, at the end of the 12 week
      program, as well as 6 months, 1 year and 2 years after the end of the 12 week program.

      Patients who recently suffered a burn injury and who were discharged from the hospital in the
      past six months may be eligible to participate.
