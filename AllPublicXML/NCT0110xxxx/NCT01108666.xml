  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Seventy two patients are being asked to take part in this research study because they have
      been diagnosed with Stage IIIA or IIIB non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). This study is
      being done to determine the highest safe dose of proton beam radiotherapy and/or study drug
      (called Nelfinavir) that can be given with concurrent chemoradiotherapy to patients with
      cancer without causing bad side effects; and to develop biomarker for clinical outcome. This
      study will be done in two phases. In the first phase, feasibility will be established. We
      will follow patients treatment courses and record side effects at the standard proton
      radiation dose that can be given together with Cisplatinum + Etoposide or Carboplatin +
      Paclitaxel. In the second phase, we will see if it is possible to increase the total proton
      radiation dose or study drug without increasing the number of bad side effects while treated
      together with chemotherapy drugs.

      Overall objectives:

        1. Determine MTD of proton beam radiotherapy with concurrent cisplatin and etoposide for
           stage III NSCLC.

        2. Determine MTD of proton beam radiotherapy with concurrent carboplatin and paclitaxel for
           stage III NSCLC in non-cisplatin candidates.

        3. Determine MTD of Nelfinavir with concurrent chemoradiotherapy for stage III NSCLC at
           RPTD of proton beam radiotherapy.

        4. Develop biomarker for clinical outcome with concurrent chemoradiotherapy in stage III
           NSCLC.

        5. To determine clinical efficacy, as defined by metabolic response, sites of recurrence
           (e.g., local, regional, distant) and progression-free and overall survival.

    <measure>Feasibility</measure>
    <time_frame>10 days of estimated date of treatment completion or requires a treatment break greater than 5 days</time_frame>
    <description>Feasibility will be based on multiple radiation planning and treatment parameters.Treatment will be deemed infeasible if patient cannot be given treatment because anatomy is such that a dosimetrically satisfactory treatment plan cannot be devised. Patient is unable to tolerate 30% of treatments using proton radiotherapy, that is, up to 70% of treatments could be delivered using photons. Patient is unable to complete all of his/her treatments within 10 days of estimated date of treatment completion or require a treatment break greater than 5 days.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Acute Toxicity (or dose limiting toxicity)</measure>
    <time_frame>Greater than 14 days</time_frame>
    <description>Any treatment related Grade 4 hematologic toxicty requiring a break in therapy of greater than 14 days or Grade 3 or higher non-hematologic toxicity, except esophagitis and pneumonitis, which is observed within 90 days from start of radiotherapy and which is probably or definitely related to treatment. All toxicities will be graded by NCI CTC Version 4.0.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Late Toxicity</measure>
    <time_frame>Open-Ended, Known to occur a year or more after therapy</time_frame>
    <description>Late toxicities will be graded according to the RTOG/EORTC late morbidity scoring system. The time frame for late toxicity is open-ended and late toxicities have been known to occur a year or more after therapy. Follow-up for late toxicity will cease when a patient experiences disease progression, since 2nd line therapies may then be initiated.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Clinical Efficacy</measure>
    <description>Defined as metabolic response (complete, partial or less than partial) based on PET/CT imaging. Patients are followed for disease recurrence and site (local, regional, distant). Progression-free and overall survival are defined as from start of treatment to first documented recurrence (for PFS), date of death or last patient contact alive.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Biomarkers</measure>
    <description>Will be evaluated on tumor tissue, as the methods for measurement become available. For example, the radiation resistance biomarker, IRDS (Interferon Related DNA Damage Resistance Gene Signature), will soon be under prospective validation in NSCLC. Similar biomarker discoveries will be considered during the course of this 4 1/2.year trial.</description>
