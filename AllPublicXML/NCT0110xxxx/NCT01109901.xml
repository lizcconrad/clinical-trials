      The purpose of this study is to determine which surgical method is better for cubital tunnel
      syndrome in outcomes.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Compression of the ulnar nerve at the cubital tunnel is the most common cause of numbness on
      the ulnar side of the hand. We aimed to compare patient outcomes included pain, sensation,
      muscle strength and muscle atrophy in two methods of surgery contain Anterior Sub Cutaneous
      Transposition (ASCT) and Anterior Sub Muscular Transposition (ASMT) of the ulnar nerve in
      Cubital tunnel syndrome.

    <time_frame>at 6 months post-operatively</time_frame>
    <description>Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) with scores of zero to ten (0 for no pain and 10 intolerable pain) then scored as follows: 0, Sever (8-10); 1, Slight (4-7); 2, none (0-3)</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>sensation</measure>
    <time_frame>at 6 months post-operatively</time_frame>
    <description>Sensory disturbance were tested with Semmes-Weinstein filaments and sensory deficits were categorized according to the Yale sensory scale. According to standard scoring system that designed, the severity of sensation and function of the ulnar nerve was scored as follows: 0, Abscent sensation; 1, Decrease or abnormal sensation; 2, Intact sensation.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Muscle strength</measure>
    <time_frame>at 6 months post-operatively</time_frame>
    <description>Muscle strength was evaluated with the grading system from the Medical Research Council which is based upon a scale of zero to five: 0, No muscle contraction; 1,Flicker or trace of muscle contraction; 2,Limb or joint movement possible only with gravity eliminated; 3,Limb or joint movement against gravity only; 4,Power decreased but limb or joint movement possible against resistance; 5,Normal power against resistance. Then results were scored as follows: 0,Poor (0-1); 1,Moderate (2-3); 2,Good (4-5)</description>

    <measure>Muscle atrophy</measure>
    <time_frame>at 6 months post-operatively</time_frame>
    <description>Muscle atrophy was scored with one orthopedic surgeon as follows: 0, sever; 1, moderate; 2, none</description>
