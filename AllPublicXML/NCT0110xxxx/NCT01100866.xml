  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, two-arm, placebo controlled trial to evaluate benefit of treatment
      using POMELLA™ extract on mechanisms known to drive prostate cancer. This research allows
      provision for biochemical and histological comparisons to be made between POMELLA™ treated
      and placebo treated prostate tissues removed from men with organ confined prostate cancer.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Men 18 years or older (19 years in BC) with a histologic diagnosis of clinically
             localized prostate cancer prior to radical prostatectomy as defined by:

               1. Clinical state T1-T2

               2. PSA &lt;20

               3. Gleason score ≤ 7

          -  ECOG performance status of 0-1.

          -  Life expectancy greater than 10 years.

          -  Able to understand and give informed consent.

          -  Laboratory values must be as follows:

               1. White blood cell count: ≥ 3,000/mm^3

               2. Absolute granulocyte count: ≥ 1,500/mm^3

               3. Platelets: ≥ 100,000/mm^3

               4. Hemoglobin: ≥ 12g/dL

               5. Serum creatinine: ≤ 1.5 x ULN

               6. AST: ≤ 2 x ULN

               7. ALT: ≤ 2 x ULN

               8. Serum calcium: ≤ ULN

               9. Total bilirubin: ≤ 1.5 x ULN

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients who are receiving any other investigational therapy.

          -  Patients who have received or are receiving any other treatment for their prostate
             cancer.

          -  Patients with an active serious infection or other serious underlying medical
             condition that would otherwise impair their ability to receive protocol treatment.

          -  Dementia or significantly altered mental status that would prohibit the understanding
             and/or giving of informed consent.

          -  Histologic evidence of small cell carcinoma of the prostate.

          -  Patients who are currently receiving active therapy for other neoplastic disorders
             will not be eligible for study.

          -  Patients who are receiving any androgens, estrogens or progestational agents.

          -  Patients with a known hypersensitivity to pomegranates or composites of the
             capsules/placebo: hydroxypropyl methylcellulose, silicon dioxide or aerosol.

          -  Patients who are taking any drugs or natural health products which might impact
             biochemical tests (some examples include: spironolactone, aprepitant, bexarotene,
             clarithromycin, itraconazole, ketoconazole, St. John's wort). A washout period of 30
             days prior to commencing the study would be necessary for these compounds if required.

          -  Patients who have chronic active hepatitis.

          -  Medical conditions, which, in the opinion of the investigators would jeopardize either
             the patient or the integrity of the data obtained.
