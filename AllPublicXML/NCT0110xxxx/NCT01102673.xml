      The purpose of this study is to characterize the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK)
      and preliminary food effect of PF-04991532 following single escalating oral doses in healthy
      adult subjects.

    <description>This will be a crossover study with 2 cohorts and an interleaving design with placebo substitution. The study will be conducted over 4 treatment periods in Cohort 1 (n=9) and over 3 treatment periods in Cohort 2 (n=9). Six subjects will be allocated to receive PF-04991532 and three subjects will be allocated to receive placebo treatment during each dosing period, except for the 4th period of Cohort 1. The 4th period of Cohort 1 will be dedicated to assess the effect of food on PF-04991532 PK parameters at one of the doses previously tested in Cohort 1; hence all 9 subjects will be dosed with PF-04991532 in an open-label fashion. A washout period of at least 7 days will occur between each dose.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Healthy male and/or female (non child-bearing potential) subjects between the ages of
             18 and 55 years, inclusive (Healthy is defined as no clinically relevant abnormalities
             identified by a detailed medical history, full physical examination, including blood
             pressure and pulse rate measurement, 12-lead ECG and clinical laboratory tests).

          -  Body Mass Index (BMI) of 17.5 to 35.5 kg/m2; and a total body weight &gt;50 kg (110 lbs).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Evidence or history of clinically significant hematological, renal, endocrine,
             pulmonary, gastrointestinal, cardiovascular, hepatic, psychiatric, neurologic, or
             allergic disease (including drug allergies, but excluding untreated, asymptomatic,
             seasonal allergies at time of dosing).

          -  Any condition possibly affecting drug absorption (eg, gastrectomy).

          -  History of regular alcohol consumption exceeding 7 drinks/week for females or 14
             drinks/week for males (1 drink = 5 ounces (150 mL) of wine or 12 ounces (360 mL) of
             beer or 1.5 ounces (45 mL) of hard liquor) within 6 months of screening.

             cigarettes per day.

          -  Self-reported history of hypoglycemia, or fasting laboratory glucose value &lt;/=80 mg/dL
             at screening or Day 0 of Period 1, confirmed by a single repeat if deemed necessary.
