  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Many population studies include food questionnaires (recording the normal food intake or the
      food intake of the study day). This is necessary, because diet is an important lifestyle
      factor, although food questionnaires are time-consuming and expensive. Moreover,
      mis-reporting is a very common problem. We therefore seek for a tool to validate food
      protocol.

      The hypothesis is to find biochemical marker for animal protein, fruit intake and grape
      consumption in urinary metabolic profiles after specific food consumption. Furthermore we
      want to specify biomarkers for different animal protein sources, fish and beef.

      Volunteers are asked to follow a diet plan over the whole course of the study. Every newly
      introduced food (in this study the dinner on days 2-5) will cause a change in biochemical
      marker excretion with urine. To monitor the kinetics of biomarker excretion it is necessary
      to collect urine several times a day; we will ask volunteers to collect the first morning
      urine, before lunch, before dinner and before going to bed. Urine sampling will start with
      the first morning urine on day 1 and end with first morning urine on day 7.

      As test food, we propose a fruit salad (apples, grapes, orange and grapefruit) on day 2, fish
      on day 3, grapes on day 4, beef on day 5 and again fish for lunch on day 6.

      From day 0 (run-in day) to day 6 the basic diet will always be bread and cheese for
      breakfast, coffee in the morning, a ham sandwich for lunch, and pasta and tomato sauce for
      dinner. As beverages only water will be allowed (although wine is permitted on day 4 if the
      subject wishes but this is not a protocol requirement). The test foods will be consumed in
      addition to that.

      All urine samples will then be analysed using high resolution NMR spectroscopy and mass
      spectrometry. Mathematical data analyses as well as the visual examinations of the NMR
      spectra will also be carried out to identify new food biomarkers.

    <description>1H NMR metabolic profiles will be acquired for all urine samples. These metabolic profiles contain a wealth of information about metabolites present in urine samples.
Multivariate mathematical model procedures, such as partial least squares discriminant analysis, will be employed to elucidate metabolic signatures associated to consumption of fish, beef, fruit salad and grape.</description>
