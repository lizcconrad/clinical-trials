      Zeltiq System.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of the study is to achieve a discernable change to the contour of the
      abdominal area treated with the JUNO applicator that is consistent with that documented
      during a clinical study of a previous applicator used to treat lovehandles.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>The primary effectiveness endpoint is the correct identification of the series of pre-treatment images by three independent reviewers. It is expected that the percentage of correct identification of the pre-treatment images will be at least 80%.</measure>

    <description>The pre and post treatment images will be reviewed by three qualified and independent reviewers. The reviewers will be asked to select the pre-treatment images. The success rate is defined at the correct selection of the pre-treatment images. The expected success rate is 80%.</description>

             6 months.

          2. Subject has had an invasive fat reduction procedure (e.g., liposuction,
             abdominoplasty, mesotherapy) in the area of intended treatment within the past year.

          3. Subject has had a non-invasive fat reduction procedure in the area of intended
             treatment within the past 6 months.

          4. Subject has a known history of subcutaneous injections into the area of intended
             treatment (e.g., heparin, insulin) within the past month.

          5. Subject has a known history of cryoglobulinemia, cold urticaria, or paroxysmal cold
