  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will report on the outcome of a clinical program, operational since 1998, that has
      used surgery targeting an emotional pathway in the brain in the treatment of severe
      depressive illness that has failed to respond to all other available interventions. Benefit
      from surgery was anticipated on the basis that the lesion (bilateral anterior capsulotomy) is
      a well established surgical target for treating severe treatment resistant depression.

      Since 1998 bilateral anterior capsulotomy (BAC) has been available to patients in British
      Columbia Canada who have treatment refractory severe depressive illness. This study will
      report on the outcome of patients who have received this intervention. BAC is achieved by
      stereotactic radiofrequency lesioning. To date 8 patients have received BAC. For all patients
      there is follow-up data of at least 24 months. The purpose of this retrospective study is to
      report on the surgical protocol and to demonstrate the efficacy and safety of BAC in severe
      depression.
