  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Individuals with cystic fibrosis (CF) develop chronic lung infections and suffer intermittent
      acute exacerbations of their lung disease. Most exacerbations are not treated until they
      cause increased symptoms, and patients seek medical attention. This proposal details a study
      of home lung function and symptom monitoring. Subjects will be randomly assigned to one of
      two groups: 1) home monitoring, in which spirometry and symptoms are recorded; or 2) standard
      care. The home monitoring data will be transmitted electronically to the study center. If
      spirometry or symptoms have deteriorated substantially, treatment for a CF pulmonary
      exacerbation will be initiated. It is anticipated that use of home monitoring will lead to
      earlier, more reliable recognition and treatment of exacerbations, which will translate into
      better lung health.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Individuals with CF develop chronic lung infections and suffer intermittent exacerbations,
      which require intensive treatment with antibiotics. The most common and useful objective
      measure of CF lung disease is spirometry. Chronic treatment of CF lung disease requires
      airway clearance, mucolytics and antibiotics. These treatments have been quite successful and
      there is evidence that early, aggressive treatment of lung disease results in better
      outcomes. Unfortunately, most exacerbations are not treated until they cause pronounced
      deterioration in symptoms, which prompts patients to seek medical attention. Self-monitoring
      of clinical status has improved outcomes in many other disorders such as asthma, diabetes
      mellitus, and lung transplantation. This is an important, randomized trial of home lung
      function and symptom monitoring in CF. Subjects will be assigned to one of two groups: 1)
      Home monitoring, in which spirometry and symptoms are recorded daily; or 2) Standard Care.
      The home monitoring data will be transmitted electronically twice weekly to the study center,
      where the results will be reviewed. If spirometry or symptoms have deteriorated substantially
      below baseline, treatment for a CF pulmonary exacerbation will be initiated. It is
      anticipated that use of home monitoring will translate into better clinical outcomes. We will
      test the hypothesis that if pulmonary exacerbations are identified and treated earlier than
      the current standard of care, the progression of lung disease will be slowed.

    <description>Change in CF respiratory symptoms as measured by the CFRSD. The CFRSD consists of 8 items which quantify symptom severity for the previous 24 hours to capture the magnitude of symptoms in stable CF, during medically treated CF exacerbations, and during recovery from an exacerbation. The CFRSD also includes emotional and activity impacts. Emotional impacts include frustration, sadness/depression, irritability, worry, and difficulty sleeping. Activity impacts include time spent sitting or lying down, reduction of usual activities, and missing school or work. will be analyzed using a linear mixed effects model incorporating baseline randomization factors FEV1 (&lt;50%, 50-75%, and &gt;75% predicted) and age (14-18 &amp; 19+), treatment group, time (in weeks) and the interaction between treatment and time. The range of scores is 8 to 40 with higher scores indicating more severe symptoms.</description>

The CFQ-R measures functioning in a variety of domains, including Physical Functioning, Vitality, Health Perceptions, Respiratory Symptoms, Treatment Burden, Role Functioning, Emotional Functioning, and Social Functioning. Only the respiratory subscale of the the CFQ-R was evaluated. This ranges from 0 to 100 with higher scores indicating better respiratory quality of life. A negative number indicates a decrease in respiratory quality of life.</description>

        <description>Change in CF respiratory symptoms as measured by the CFRSD. The CFRSD consists of 8 items which quantify symptom severity for the previous 24 hours to capture the magnitude of symptoms in stable CF, during medically treated CF exacerbations, and during recovery from an exacerbation. The CFRSD also includes emotional and activity impacts. Emotional impacts include frustration, sadness/depression, irritability, worry, and difficulty sleeping. Activity impacts include time spent sitting or lying down, reduction of usual activities, and missing school or work. will be analyzed using a linear mixed effects model incorporating baseline randomization factors FEV1 (&lt;50%, 50-75%, and &gt;75% predicted) and age (14-18 &amp; 19+), treatment group, time (in weeks) and the interaction between treatment and time. The range of scores is 8 to 40 with higher scores indicating more severe symptoms.</description>

The CFQ-R measures functioning in a variety of domains, including Physical Functioning, Vitality, Health Perceptions, Respiratory Symptoms, Treatment Burden, Role Functioning, Emotional Functioning, and Social Functioning. Only the respiratory subscale of the the CFQ-R was evaluated. This ranges from 0 to 100 with higher scores indicating better respiratory quality of life. A negative number indicates a decrease in respiratory quality of life.</description>
