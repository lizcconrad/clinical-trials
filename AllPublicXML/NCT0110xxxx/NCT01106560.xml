      This is a single-centre, randomised, prospective clinical follow-up study to evaluate
      clinical outcome and gait analysis after total hip arthroplasty using the standard
      postero-lateral approach or the minimally invasive anterior approach.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Males and females aged 18-75 years at time of surgery.

          -  Those presenting with primary or secondary osteoarthritis and/or rheumatoid arthritis
             of the hip.

          -  Those deemed capable of giving informed consent, understanding the aims of the study
             and expressing willingness to comply with the post-operative review programme.

          -  Patients who signed the study consent form prior to surgery.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Pregnant women or women who plan to conceive in the future.

          -  Those whose prospects for a recovery to independent mobility would be compromised by
             known coexistent, medical problems.

          -  Those already treated by with a Total Hip Replacement (THR) (i.e. requiring a revision
             hip replacement).

          -  Those with co-existent ipsilateral knee disease or back problems

          -  Muscle contracture around the hip joint

          -  Individuals who have undergone organ transplant.

          -  Those with a known co-existent medical condition where death is anticipated within
             five years due to the pre-existing medical condition.

          -  Individuals who have had a THR on the contra-lateral side within the 6 months.

          -  Individuals who have undergone a THR on the contralateral side and whose outcome is
             considered unsatisfactory or not good. An unsatisfactory or poor result is defined as
             achieving a total UCLA score (including activity) &lt; 16 points.

          -  Individuals requiring bilateral hip replacement.

          -  Individuals whose body mass index (BMI; kg/m2) &gt;35.
