    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Male and female patients at least 4 years of age at the time of the screening visit

          2. Patient's informed consent for &gt; or = 18 years of age before any assessment is
             performed

          3. Parent or legal guardian's written informed consent and child's assent, if
             appropriate, are required before any assessment is performed for patients &lt; 18 years
             of age.

          4. Patients with a diagnosis of CAPS: FCAS/FCU, MWS, or NOMID/CINCA

          5. Body weight &gt; or = 15 kg

          6. Able to communicate with the investigator and comply with the requirements of the
             study (for children the parent can assist when necessary)

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Patient is pregnant or breastfeeding. Women of childbearing potential must have a
             negative urine pregnancy test at baseline

          2. Patient of childbearing potential (man or woman) and unwilling to use double barrier
             method of contraception. It is required that double barrier method of contraception be
             used (i.e. condom with spermicide or diaphragm with spermicide) by patients of
             childbearing potential (man or woman) regardless of whether a hormonal agent is also
             used as a method of contraception.

          3. Participation in any clinical investigation within 4 weeks prior to dosing

          4. Live vaccinations within 3 months prior to the start of the trial, during the trial
             and up to 3 months following the last dose.

          5. History of significant medical conditions, which in the Investigator's opinion would
             exclude the patient from participating in this trial (this can be discussed with
             Novartis on a case by case basis in case of uncertainty).

          6. History of drug or alcohol abuse within 12 months prior to dosing

          7. History of hypersensitivity to any of the study drugs or to drugs of similar chemical
             classes
