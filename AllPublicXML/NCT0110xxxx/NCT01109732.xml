    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate how systematic physical training after
      endovascular treatment influence the durability of the endovascular treatment and how it
      effects physical function, quality of life and future cardiovascular events.

    <description>Hospital-based SET two days per week for 12 weeks and one home-based exercise session every week. The group-based SET was based on The Norwegian Ullevaal Model, a modified cardiac rehabilitation program, and was slightly adjusted to be applicable to this patient group. Each SET session lasted for 60 minutes and consisted of warm-up exercises, three high-intensity, two moderate-intensity and cool-down exercises, including stretching. The exercises were generally simple aerobic dance movements and walking and involved the use of both upper and lower extremities. The warm-up exercises included large muscle movements that were repeated later in the higher-intensity intervals, but with greater force and a larger range of movement.</description>
