      The purpose of the study is to evaluate the effect of an aerobic-resistance exercise program
      compared to a home based physical activity program on bone mass, body composition, metabolic
      risk factors and cardiovascular fitness in women with cancer who have completed therapy.

      The proposed study will evaluate an endurance-resistive exercise intervention to attenuate
      the effects of menopause and cancer treatment (bone loss, increased body fat, decreased lean
      muscle mass, weight gain, decreased physical activity) in an at-risk population of female
      cancer survivors. Women with solid tumors (breast, gynecological, colo-rectal) and lymphoma
      who have completed primary and/or adjuvant therapy within the past three years and who are
      perimenopausal or early postmenopausal and any woman on an Aromatase Inhibitor will be
      recruited to participate in a randomized controlled trial (RCT) of a 12 month exercise
      intervention (N=75) versus a health promotion control group (N=75). The specific aims of the
      study are to: (1) examine the effects of an exercise intervention on bone mass (serum
      biomarkers, lumbar spine, hip DEXA) and body composition (whole body DEXA, weight, waist
      circumference), (2) examine the effect of an exercise intervention on metabolic risk factors
      (lipids, cholesterol, fasting glucose, insulin resistance, Hemoglobin A1-C, and blood
      pressure), and (3) examine the effects of an exercise intervention on functional status and
      cardiovascular fitness (exercise stress test).
