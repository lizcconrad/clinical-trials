  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to determine if robot aided rehabilitation therapy can be
      equivalent to or more effective than conventional rehabilitation therapy at promoting
      functional recovery of the paretic upper limb in acute and subacute stroke patients.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study aims to test a robotic rehabilitation protocol which involves the use of a robotic
      device (NeReBot) as an alternative to the conventional rehabilitation treatment. NeReBot is a
      3-degree-of-freedom robotic device, which can be programmed by the therapist to perform
      repetitive assistive movements (flexion and extension, adduction and abduction, pronation and
      supination, circular) of the upper limb (shoulder and elbow), combined with a visual and
      acoustic display. Acute and subacute stroke patients (≤20 days post-stroke) will be
      randomized into two groups with a procedure by a computer program: the experimental group
      (EG) and the control group (CG). Both groups will receive a total daily treatment time of 120
      minutes for five days a week and for five weeks. The EG will perform the conventional
      functional rehabilitation (proprioceptive exercises, verticalization, gait training, paretic
      hand and wrist mobilization, without mobilizing the proximal paretic arm) and occupational
      therapy for 80 minutes a day, while the proximal paretic arm will be treated by NeReBot for
      40 minutes a day. For the CG, NeReBot therapy is substituted by 40 minutes of conventional
      mobilization of the proximal paretic arm by the therapist.

    <measure>Fugl-Meyer (FM-SEC and FM-WH)</measure>
    <time_frame>7 months</time_frame>
    <description>Fugl-Meyer (FM) assessment for measures of the motor impairment of the upper-limb; the test includes items related to movements of the shoulder, elbow, forearm (proximal arm), and wrist and hand (distal arm). The total scores range between 0 and 66. We considered the shoulder/elbow and coordination subsections (FM-SEC = 42/66 items) and the wrist/hand subsection (FM-WH = 24/66 items).</description>

    <measure>Motor-Functional Independence Measure (m-FIM)</measure>
    <time_frame>7 months</time_frame>
    <description>Motor-Functional Independent Measure (m-FIM) is a test to measure improvements in basic motor ADL, outcomes and the degree of self-care. The motor-FIM is a subsection of Functional Indipendence Measure that is an ordinal scale that assesses severity of motor disability, composed of 13-item motor subscale (including self-care, sphincter control, mobility, locomotion) with a scoring ranges between 13 and 91; each item envisages 7 levels of performance independence (7 is total independence, 1 is total dependence or unassessable).</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Frenchay Arm Test (FA-T)</measure>
    <time_frame>7 months</time_frame>
    <description>Franchey Arm Test (FA-T) evaluates five activities of daily living: lifting and replacing of a glass, drawing a line with the use of a ruler, combing the hair, lifting and replacing of a cylinder [5 cm long], removing of a sprung clothes peg from a dowel and replacing it; 0 = worst score; 5 = best score).It reflects both hand and arm functions.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Medical Research Council (MRC deltoid, biceps, triceps, wrist flexor, wrist extensor)</measure>
    <time_frame>7 months</time_frame>
    <description>Medical Research Council (MRC) is an ordinal scale for measuring strength of muscle force (range, 0 [no muscle contraction] to 5 [normal strength] for each muscle) in isolated or group muscle groups. We use this scale to rate the strength of the paretic arm during 5 actions: shoulder abduction (MRC deltoid), elbow flexion (MRC biceps), elbow extension (MRC triceps) wrist flexion (MRC wrist flexors) and extension (MRC wrist extension).</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Modified Ashworth Scale (MAS)</measure>
    <time_frame>7 months</time_frame>
    <description>Modified Ashworth scale (MAS) to test for hypertonia in several upper-limb joints (score, 0 - 5). A higher score on the modified Ashworth scale indicates higher tone, so a lower score indicates lower abnormal tone. The modified Ashworth scale (0 - 5) assesses the muscle tone of the shoulder adductors, the flexors of the elbow, wrist, and fingers (total AS-sum, 0-20).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Functional Independent Measure (FIM)</measure>
    <time_frame>7 months</time_frame>
    <description>Functional Independent Measure (FIM) is an international standard measurement of disability. The FIM questionnaire explores 18 activities of daily living (13 items for self-care, sphincter control, mobility, locomotion, and 5 cognitive items). Each item can receive a score ranging from 1 (complete dependence) and 7 (complete self-sufficiency). The cumulative score and profile of scores under the various headings are standard indicators.</description>

    <measure>Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS)</measure>
    <time_frame>7 months</time_frame>
    <description>The Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS) is a method of evaluating the impact of fatigue on a person. The FSS is a short questionnaire that requires the patient to rate the level of fatigue. The FSS questionnaire contains nine statements that rate the severity of the fatigue symptoms.</description>

    <measure>Trunk Control Test (TCT)</measure>
    <time_frame>7 months</time_frame>
    <description>TCT is a measurement scale evaluating control of trunk movements and stability. It assesses whether the patient can turn his body on the bed plane, maintain the sitting position and vary posture, yielding a score from 0 to 100.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Box and Block Test</measure>
    <time_frame>7 months</time_frame>
    <description>Box and Block Test of manual dexterity assesses upper limb disability. It consists of two adjacent boxes of the same size, separated by a 15.2-cm high partition, with one of them filled with 150 blocks of 2.5 cm each. The patient performs the test with his unaffected and then with his affected upper extremity. The test evaluates the number of individual blocks could transport between the 2 boxes within 1 min.</description>
