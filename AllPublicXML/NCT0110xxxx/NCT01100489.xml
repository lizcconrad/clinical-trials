      RATIONALE: Breast-conserving surgery is a less invasive type of surgery for breast cancer and
      may have fewer side effects and improve recovery. Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays
      to kill tumor cells. Giving radiation therapy after surgery may kill any tumor cells that
      remain after surgery.

      PURPOSE: This phase II clinical trial is studying how well breast-conserving surgery followed
      by radiation therapy works in treating patients with stage I or stage II breast cancer.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine ipsilateral breast tumor recurrence rates as well as tumor bed recurrence
      rates. Patients will be followed for a period of five years following completion of radiation
      to determine these rates.

      II. To determine the cosmetic outcome resulting from breast conserving surgery and breast
      radiation.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine if there are patient factors which limit a patient's suitability to receive
      breast conserving therapy in the setting of multi-centric disease.

      II. To determine patient satisfaction of breast conserving therapy as it pertains to their
      overall treatment experience as measured by a questionnaire.

      III. To evaluate wound healing and overall complication rate after radiation as a component
      of breast conserving therapy.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients undergo breast-conserving surgery consisting of partial mastectomies followed by
      external beam breast radiation therapy 5 days a week for 5 weeks in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed at 1 month, then every 3 months
      for 1 year, every 6 months for 1 year, and then annually for 5 years.

    <description>Patients will undergo excisional biopsy or needle localization removal of the tumor. Patients with margins &lt; 2 mm undergo re-excision of the biopsy cavity. Surgical clips should be placed at the time of tylectomy to define the excision cavities. Ideally, clips are to be placed marking the superficial, deep, right, left, inferior, and superior dimensions of the tylectomy or re-excision cavities.</description>
