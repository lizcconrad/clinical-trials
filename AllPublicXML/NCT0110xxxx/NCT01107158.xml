    <textblock>
      Despite the fact that a link between cholesterol and the myometrium has been clearly
      established, no study investigating aspects of cholesterol metabolism and uterine dystocia
      currently exists. This study is a pilot study whose aim is to test the hypothesis that an
      association between uterine dystocia and single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the genes
      coding for the LXRs.

        The study population represents women undergoing a difficult, stagnating labor due to
        either physical or uterine dystocia.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients undergoing C-section for a dystocia: 2 to 3 hours of stagnation in labor
             progress are observed (ie no increasing dilation, and uterine contractions less that
             3-5 per 10 minutes) in spite of measures taken to overcome dystocia (oxytocin
             injection and artificial breaking of waters)

          -  the child is alive

          -  the child does not have apriori known malformations that could interfere with a
             vaginal birth

          -  foetus in cephalic position

          -  full term pregnancy (&gt;= 37 weeks of amenorrhea)

          -  single birth

          -  patient has signed consent

          -  patient is affiliated with a social security system

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  vaginal birth

          -  programmed C-section

          -  C-section is chosen because the fetus has a cardia rhythm problem, and there is no
             stagnation in the labor process

          -  multiple pregnancy

          -  the child is in a breech position

          -  premature birth (&lt;37 weeks amenorrhea)

          -  in utero fetal death

          -  fetal malformation known before birth that could interfere with a vaginal birth

          -  non french-speaking patient (impossible to correctly inform the patient)

          -  patient under guardianship
