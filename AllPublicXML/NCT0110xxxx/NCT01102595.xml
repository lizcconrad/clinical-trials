  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In the last 20 years, only temozolomide has obtained indication for the treatment of
      High-grade glioma (HGG). Temozolomide during and later radiation therapy has doubled one year
      survival and is the standard treatment for glioblastoma. But 30% of glioblastomas receive
      only a biopsy as they can't be resected and don't get benefit from this treatment. They and
      should be treated immediately after the biopsy to prevent neurological deterioration but in
      spite of this approach they often deteriorate neurologically during radiotherapy. . An
      effective pre-radiation treatment should improve their prognosis and allow them to complete
      concomitant radiotherapy and temozolomide treatment. Bevacizumab in recurrent HGG displays
      63% of objective responses when combined with irinotecan. But irinotecan is not the most
      active treatment in this disease.

      We propose a phase II, two arms, open label, randomized, multicentric study with 2 cycles of
      temozolomide before radiation therapy and concomitant temozolomide, in patients with
      glioblastoma and 'biopsy-only'. Bevacizumab will be added to one arm.
