    <textblock>
      Carbon monoxide poisoning still places a burden on the healthcare system worldwide. While
      oxygen therapy is the cornerstone treatment, the role and practical modalities of hyperbaric
      oxygen therapy (HBO) remain controversial. This study aimed at comparing one session of HBO
      at 2 absolute atmosphere followed by 4 hours of normobaric oxygen therapy to 6 hours of
      normobaric oxygen therapy in adult victims of acute domestic carbon monoxide poisoning and
      without coma.
