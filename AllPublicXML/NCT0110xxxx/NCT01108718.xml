    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to determine if a new mattress relieves the symptoms of
      fibromyalgia and improves sleep, and if this is the case, whether one type of mattress is
      better than the other in doing so.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The various stages of sleep will be monitored via polysomnography(PSG) and scored to indicate
      the degree to which they reflect a normal sleep pattern. Changes in the severity of
      fibromyalgia symptoms will be assessed by tender point exam and study questionnaires
      administered at 2 month intervals.
