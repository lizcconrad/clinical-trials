    <textblock>
      Standard cystic duct cholangiography (CDC) during laparoscopic cholecystectomy can be
      difficult, time consuming and bile duct injury may be caused by attempts to cannulate the
      cystic duct. Operative cholangiography performed by direct puncture of the gall bladder
      fundus or Cholecystocholangiography (CCC) is a valid and easier alternative.

      This study was conducted on 60 patients with symptomatic gall bladder stones undergoing
      laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Patients were randomized into two groups: Group (1) was
      evaluated by cholecyst-cholangiography by puncture through the gall bladder fundus. Group (2)
      was evaluated for the standard cystic duct cholangiography.Cholangiography was considered
      successful if it could be performed with complete delineation of the biliary tree with flow
      of the dye through the duodenum occurred. It is to be noted that inability to cannulate the
      cystic duct for example, is considered a failure.

    <description>a central venous pressure catheter was introduced through the anterior abdominal wall subcostally in a direction parallel to the gallbladder bed under direct vision so that it emerges close to the gall bladder. Then the catheter was advanced into the fundus of the gall bladder . The dye was prepared by diluting 20ml of 76% urografin with 20ml normal saline in a 50ml syringe</description>

    <description>Then a 14G cannula was introduced through the anterior abdominal wall subcostally, (size 4F), was introduced through this cannula. The catheter was inserted into the cystic duct no more than 1 cm, by a grasper Then a 50ml syringe with the diluted urografin dye, as above, was attached to the catheter and cholangiography was performed by slowly injecting the dye under control of C-arm image intensifier.</description>
