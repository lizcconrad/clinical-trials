      The main objective is to investigate the incidence of Respiratory Tract Infections (RTIs) and
      antibiotic prescriptions in children and during pregnancy, the different drugs chosen by
      their doctors according to diagnosis, and compliance by patients. Further to investigate the
      possible effect of antibiotic use during pregnancy on RTIs and antibiotics and respiratory
      drug prescriptions in children the first two years after birth.

      Specific study objectives:

        -  RTIs and antibiotic prescriptions in pre-school children

             -  Frequency of diagnoses and antibiotic prescriptions

             -  The proportion of broad spectrum antibiotics chosen

        -  Prescription patterns and treatment compliance during pregnancy

             -  Incidence of diagnoses, compared with not pregnant patients

             -  Choice of antibiotics in RTIs

             -  Prescription collection from pharmacies

        -  Antibiotics and respiratory medication in children aged 0-2 yrs

             -  Compare prevalence in children of mothers with frequent RTIs/antibiotic
                prescriptions during pregnancy and prevalence in children of mothers with few or no
                consultations during pregnancy

             -  Incidence of wheezing and asthma diagnoses and incidence og respiratory
                prescription drugs when the mother has received antibiotics in pregnancy
