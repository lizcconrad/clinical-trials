      This study is designed to test a specific hypothesis exploring the neurophysiologic
      mechanism(s) that underlie the pain- relieving effects of immersive Virtual Reality (VR) as a
      non-pharmacologic pain management technique, using healthy volunteers experiencing carefully
      controlled thermal and/or electrical pain in the laboratory. Over the past decade, our
      research group has performed a series of NIH-funded investigations of VR analgesia - in both
      the clinical pain and laboratory pain settings - demonstrating its clinical efficacy and
      safety. In the current study we will test pharmacologic manipulation of VR analgesia (with
      the opioid analgesia antagonist naloxone). We anticipate that this theoretical work will
      provide a foundation for future clinical applications of immersive VR - whether used alone or
      in combination with other analgesic agents - and make immersive VR a more effective and more
      widely used analgesic tool for the treatment of clinical pain.

      Our previous work with immersive VR indicates that its use during a painful event can reduce
      subjective pain reports during both acute clinical and laboratory pain by 20-50% [1].
      Furthermore, we have shown that effective VR analgesia is associated with reduced
      pain-related brain activity that is quantitatively and qualitatively comparable to clinically
      relevant doses of systemic opioid analgesics [2]. The laboratory pain protocol proposed in
      the current application is identical to the UW HSD-approved protocol used in our previous
      studies (#25296 - &quot;Reducing Brief Thermal and Electrical Pain&quot;). What is specifically
      different in the current protocol is the use of naloxone to determine whether VR analgesia
      operates through an endogenous opioid-dependent mechanism or not. The results of this study
      will not only suggest the mechanism of action of VR analgesia, but also allow us to more
      effectively apply immersive VR analgesia in the clinically pain setting through its
      thoughtful combination with well-established pharmacologic analgesic techniques, such as
      opioid analgesia administration.

      The specific aim of this study and the hypothesis it tests are as follows: To determine the
      extent to which subjective analgesic effects of VR analgesia are inhibited by opioid receptor
      antagonism with naloxone. Hypothesis - VR analgesia will not be inhibited by systemic opioid
      receptor antagonism, suggesting that VR analgesia is not mediated by release of endogenous
      opiates and/or by activation of opioid-dependent descending central nervous system pathways.
