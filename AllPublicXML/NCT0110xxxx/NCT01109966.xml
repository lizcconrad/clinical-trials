  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate whether a new version of an amino acid based formula
      improves tolerance to milk in cow's milk allergic infants/young children.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Infants with CMA cannot tolerate proteins contained in milk, although they are able to
      tolerate amino acids which are the 'building blocks' of proteins. Unlike standard infant
      formulas which are made from milk proteins, amino acid formulas (AAF) are made from
      nonallergenic aminoacids plus all the other nutrients required to support growth and
      development.
