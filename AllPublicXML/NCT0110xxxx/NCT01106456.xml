  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      American Indians and Alaska Natives (AI/ANs) have the highest smoking rates of the major
      racial/ethnic groups in the United States, approaching 40% to 50%.1-3 In addition, this
      underserved population has very low smoking cessation and abstinence rates. The
      smoking-attributable mortality rate of AI/ANs is not only the highest but double that of
      other ethnic groups.4 To date, there have been almost no studies that have focused on methods
      to encourage smoking cessation among AI/AN smokers and no randomized clinical trials. There
      is a desperate need for effective, culturally tailored cessation programs.5, 6 We propose a 2
      arm, group randomized clinical trial to be conducted at 2 sites in the Midwest (Kansas and
      Oklahoma).

      We have begun to address these issues through the creation of the &quot;All Nations Breath of
      Life&quot; (ANBL) smoking cessation program using community-based participatory research methods.
      ANBL is group-based and is culturally-sensitive in all program components. It recognizes the
      sacred role of tobacco among many AI/ANs and how culture affects smoking cessation among
      AI/AN, while still addressing recreational smoking. Our pilot work shows promise for reducing
      cigarette smoking in AI/AN smokers, with quit rates of 30% at six months post-baseline,
      compared to 8-10% quit rates in other published studies.

      All participants in the proposed study will be offered pharmacotherapy (e.g. Varenicline or
      Bupropion or NRT) then randomized into either the culturally-tailored &quot;All Nations Breath of
      Life&quot; program (ANBL) or Nontailored (NT. ANBL consists of in-person group sessions and
      individual telephone calls. We have successfully conducted a pilot study of ANBL and have
      found very promising results. At 6 months post baseline, all participants will be assessed
      for smoking status and continuous abstinence. We will randomize 28 groups per site (8 smokers
      per group) to ANBL or NT for a total sample size of 448 AI/AN smokers.

      This study is the first controlled trial to examine the efficacy of a culturally-tailored
      smoking cessation program for AI/ANs. In collaboration with AI/AN colleagues in Oklahoma we
      designed and successfully piloted the intervention to be culturally-tailored and sustainable
      in order to enhance its potential for widespread adoption and ultimate impact among AI/AN
      smokers. If the intervention is successful, the potential health impact is significant
      because the prevalence of smoking is the highest in this population.

    <textblock>
      This study will use a group randomized multi-site clinical trial design to examine the
      efficacy of a culturally-tailored smoking cessation program (ANBL) for AI/AN smokers versus
      Non-tailored (NT). AI/AN smokers in two sites (Kansas and Oklahoma) will be group randomized
      to either ANBL or Non-tailored (NT). Each site (KS and OK) will randomize 28 groups,
      resulting in 14 groups per arm of the intervention, per site. Participants in both groups
      (ANBL and NT) will be offered pharmacotherapy (e.g. varenicline or bupropion or NRT). The
      primary outcome of interest will be biochemically verified continuous abstinence at 1 year.
      Secondary endpoints include number of quit attempts and number of cigarettes smoked (among
      continuing smokers), pharmacotherapy utilization, and the number of completed group sessions.
      We will also examine the marginal cost-effectiveness of the intervention. The study will
      proceed in three phases over a five-year period. Phase I will consist of development and
      training. Phase 2 will be to conduct the randomized trial, and Phase 3 consists of data
      analysis and dissemination. Participants will be recruited from two sites: Kansas and
      Oklahoma. Although the ANBL arm is a group intervention and the NT arm is individual standard
      care, the unit of randomization will be at the group level (further discussed in the next
      section - Randomization process). Recruitment and randomization will be balanced by site:
      both sites will recruit until we reach our target sample size of 448 AI/AN smokers who are at
      least 18 years of age. Each site will randomize 28 groups (14 groups per arm) with 8 smokers
      in each group for a total site sample size of 224 smokers per site. Pharmacotherapy: The PI
      and site PI of this study along with our AI/AN community members agreed that all participants
      (ANBL and NT arms) had to be offered pharmacotherapy (varenicline or bupropion or NRT) as a
      component of the study design. This decision was a collaborative one between the AI/AN tribes
      and the investigators who have worked with this population. The AI/AN community will not
      accept placebo treatment, therefore, the interventions would not be acceptable or feasible to
      potential participants if a placebo was part of the study design. In addition, we believed it
      was ethically imperative that we provided smoking cessation interventions consistent with the
      current clinical practice guidelines for the treatment of tobacco use.

          <description>All participants in the proposed study will be offered pharmacotherapy (e.g. Varenicline, Bupropion, or NRT) then randomized into either the culturally-tailored &quot;All Nations Breath of Life&quot; program (ANBL) or Nontailored program (NT).
Experimental 1: All Nations Breath of Life program (ANBL): ANBL consists of in-person group sessions and individual telephone calls. We have successfully conducted a pilot study of ANBL and have found very promising results. At six months and 12 months post baseline, all participants will be assessed for smoking status and smoking abstinence.

Experimental 2: Nontailored program (NT): The nontailored intervention includes the medicines listed above to all participants and targeted counseling delivered by non-American Indian counselors who have worked closely with the American Indian communities and respect the cultures, values, and traditions of the Indian people. Therefore, our intervention includes the current &quot;best practice&quot; recommendations for smoking cessation. At six months and 12 months post baseline, all participants will be assessed for smoking status and smoking abstinence.
