      The MiniMed Medtronic CGMS (continuous glucose monitoring system), the first model approved
      by FDA, was used for subcutaneous glucose monitoring. The CGMS continually measures the
      glucose concentration of the interstitial fluid every 10 seconds and then stores an average
      glucose value for each 5 minutes period, for a total of up to 288 measurements each day.

    <description>PPB-R-203-02 Noodle is manufacture by Pharma Power Biotec Co., Ltd. The composition of PPB-R-203-02 Noodle is resistant starch (RS). By definition, resistant starch (RS) is any starch that is not digested in the small intestine but passes to the large intestine (or the colon). Therefore, resistant starch can be regarded as a component of dietary fiber.
