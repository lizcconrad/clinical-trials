      The aim of this phase 3 study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of CKD-501 and
      metformin combination for 24 weeks in type 2 diabetes mellitus. Furthermore, the extension
      study for additional 28weeks is designed to confirm long term safety of CKD-501 as an oral
      hypoglycemic agent.
