      The purpose of this study is to see whether a Virtual Ward reduces readmissions after
      hospital discharge.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      We will conduct a pragmatic, randomized controlled trial to evaluate a new model of care for
      high-risk medical patients after discharge from hospital. This new model of care has two key
      elements. First, we will use the LACE index (see citation below for details) to identify
      patients who are at high risk of readmission or death after hospital discharge. These
      patients will be randomized to either the Virtual Ward or usual care on the day of discharge.
      Although patients being cared for in the Virtual Ward will reside at home, they will benefit
      from a hospital-like interdisciplinary team, a shared set of notes, a single point of
      contact, round-the-clock physician availability and increased co-ordination of specialist,
      primary and home-based community care for several weeks after hospital discharge.
