  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Diabetes is highly prevalent in the elderly, afflicting about 20% of older adults aged 65-75
      years and 40% of adults &gt;80years of age. Management of hyperglycemia is challenging in the
      geriatric population in long-term facilities. Numerous factors place hospitalized patients at
      increased risk for hyperglycemia including aging, sedentary life, stress of medical and
      surgical comorbidities, and changes in antidiabetic regimen. In addition, elderly patients
      often experience changes in their nutritional intake and organ dysfunction which increase the
      risk of hypoglycemic events.

      There are only a few retrospective studies in elderly patients analyzing quality of diabetes
      care and glycemic control adjusted for medications and presence of co-morbidities in
      long-term care facilities. In addition, no randomized controlled trials have demonstrated
      benefits of glycemic control on clinical outcome, quality of life, and rate of acute
      metabolic complications (hyperglycemia and hypoglycemic events) in long-term care facilities.

      The investigators will conduct a retrospective study to determine the prevalence of diabetes,
      comprehensively describe the management of diabetes, and to evaluate the impact of quality of
      care and glycemic control on clinical outcome in elderly subjects admitted to two large
      long-term care facilities: Grady Health System (GHS) and Veterans Administration Medical
      Center (VAMC) in Atlanta, Georgia between 1/01/08 to 12/31/08.
