  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to examine the incidence of acute myocardial infarction (MI)
      occurring after an influenza-like illness using linked primary care and disease registry
      databases.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will measure the incidence ratio for MI occurring in time periods after
      presentation with an acute respiratory illness compared to baseline time periods using the
      self-controlled case series method, with reference to the timing of the influenza season
      (defined by national virological and clinical surveillance data). It will also validate
      accuracy and completeness of information on MI in the GPRD using linked anonymised data from
      both MINAP and Hospital Episode Statistics.

      This study is part of the CALIBER (Cardiovascular disease research using linked bespoke
      studies and electronic records) programme funded over 5 years from the NIHR and Wellcome
      Trust. The central theme of the CALIBER research is linkage of the Myocardial Ischaemia
      National Audit Project (MINAP) with primary care (GPRD) and other resources. The overarching
      aim of CALIBER is to better understand the aetiology and prognosis of specific coronary
      phenotypes across a range of causal domains, particularly where electronic records provide a
      contribution beyond traditional studies. CALIBER has received both Ethics approval (ref
      09/H0810/16) and ECC approval (ref ECC 2-06(b)/2009 CALIBER dataset).

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Participants must be registered with a GPRD 'up to standard' practice during the study

             and the study period

          -  They must have at least 6 months between their registration date and the date of the
             incident MI

          -  They must have accessed primary care on at least one occasion for a respiratory
