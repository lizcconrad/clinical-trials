    <textblock>
      The aim of this randomized trial is to compare the efficacy of high dose tirofiban
      administered as either an intracoronary bolus alone or as an intravenous bolus followed by a
      maintenance infusion with respect to microvascular perfusion and long term left ventricular
      infarct size, volumes and function.

    <textblock>
      Primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) is currently the treatment of choice for
      patients with acute ST elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). Nevertheless, despite
      restoration of normal epicardial flow, myocardial perfusion remains impaired in approximately
      half of patients and is associated with a poor prognosis. A variety of invasive and
      non-invasive techniques have been proposed to evaluate microvascular perfusion and several
      invasive hemodynamic measures have been closely associated with microvascular damage.In order
      to improve microvascular perfusion after primary PCI, a variety of treatment strategies have
      been developed, such as adjunctive administration of glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors (GPIs).
      Although current ACC/AHA guidelines recommend that small molecule GPIs should be administered
      as a bolus followed by 18 hours of continuous infusion, changes in clinical practice may
      obviate the need for a maintenance infusion in current practice.

      We hypothesized that when tirofiban is administered via intracoronary route, a bolus-only
      strategy may even be superior to intravenous bolus plus infusion strategy in maintaining
      myocardial perfusion. In order to evaluate microvascular function, we used a guidewire tipped
      with pressure and temperature sensors and measured the coronary hemodynamic parameters, as
      the index of microvascular resistance and coronary flow reserve, measures which have been
      closely associated with microvascular damage. In order to increase the predictive value of
      these indices, we performed these measurements four to five days after MI, because it has
      been shown that the extent of microvascular dysfunction changes, particularly within first 48
      hours after reperfusion and stabilizes between 2 days and 1 week after perfusion
