  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is in two parts

      Part one of the study describes the use of the new single-use flexible video-scope for
      intubation of patients with predicted normal airways.

      Part two compares the performance of the single-use flexible video-scope with that of a
      conventional flexible video-scope for awake intubation of patients with predicted difficult
      airways.

      The hypothesis is that the new single-use flexible video-scope for intubation performs as
      well as the traditional scope.
