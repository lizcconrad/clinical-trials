    <textblock>
      Blood-Oxygen-Level-Dependent (BOLD) responses to painful mechanical stimulation of the OA
      knee following treatment with four consecutive doses (at 8 hour intervals) on giving
      sustained released paracetamol treatment or placebo will be compared. The fMRI and pain
      assessments will occur approximately 2-5 hours after taking the final dose.

      The objective of this study is to investigate if functional magnetic response imaging (fMRI)
      can detect the effects of a known pain medicine at over-the-counter doses in people with
      osteoarthritis (OA) of the knee. The fMRI is a harmless and painless technique that is used
      in the current study to collect images of brain activity to see if is changed when feeling
      pain. In this study, BOLD response to mechanical stimulation via pressure stimuli applied to
      the tibio-femoral joint and patello-femoral in participants with knee OA following four
      treatment doses of any of three treatment will be compared.

    <measure>Blood Oxygen Level-Dependent (BOLD) Response in the Tibio-femoral Joint of Knee Osteoarthritis (OA): [BOLD (T-f)]</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to 2-5 hours post last dose administration</time_frame>
    <description>BOLD response to painful pressure stimuli was evaluated using fMRI. Voxel-wise BOLD scores were reported on a Z-scale (Gaussian,mean=0,SD=1); range -3 (worst score, lowest connectivity) to +3 (best score, highest connectivity). The software derived scores compared the intensity reading in the region to a template, specifically the Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) Echo-Planar Image (EPI) template. The template provides, for each region, expected (mean/median) intensity for that region, along with expected variation. The BOLD score on the Z-scale represents how far the actual measured intensity is from the expected in the template. A score of 0 would correspond to the mean/median, a score of 1.65 would represent the 90-percentile, -1.65 the 10-percentile, and so on, according to a standard normal distribution.</description>

        <title>Blood Oxygen Level-Dependent (BOLD) Response in the Tibio-femoral Joint of Knee Osteoarthritis (OA): [BOLD (T-f)]</title>
        <description>BOLD response to painful pressure stimuli was evaluated using fMRI. Voxel-wise BOLD scores were reported on a Z-scale (Gaussian,mean=0,SD=1); range -3 (worst score, lowest connectivity) to +3 (best score, highest connectivity). The software derived scores compared the intensity reading in the region to a template, specifically the Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) Echo-Planar Image (EPI) template. The template provides, for each region, expected (mean/median) intensity for that region, along with expected variation. The BOLD score on the Z-scale represents how far the actual measured intensity is from the expected in the template. A score of 0 would correspond to the mean/median, a score of 1.65 would represent the 90-percentile, -1.65 the 10-percentile, and so on, according to a standard normal distribution.</description>
