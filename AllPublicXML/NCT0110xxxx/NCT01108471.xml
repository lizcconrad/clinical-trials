  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      We aim to assess a new pulse oximeter which measures continuous hemoglobin concentration
      (SpHb) in healthy patients undergoing elective Cesarean delivery (CS). This patient
      population often experiences significant blood loss during surgery, and measurements of
      surgical blood loss are often inaccurate. We will compare measurements of SpHb with estimated
      blood loss during the perioperative period, and laboratory measurements of hemoglobin at set
      time intervals during the perioperative and postoperative periods (to evaluate the accuracy
      of this device's ability to measure continuous SpHb).

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      We hope that this pulse oximeter will provide important new information (SpHb) about
      hemoglobin measurement in patients undergoing elective CS, who may often experience
      significant blood loss and postpartum anemia in the perioperative period. The measurement of
      perioperative blood loss is often inaccurate, and formal measurements of hemoglobin levels
      are often associated with time delays, especially in the setting of ongoing acute blood loss.
      We hope that this device will provide accurate continuous data of hemoglobin in this patient
      population, which may prove to be a significant advance in patient monitoring in this patient
      population. Probes for SpHb measurement will be provided by Masimo Corporation.
