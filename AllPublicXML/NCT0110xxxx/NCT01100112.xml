      Open-label, 8 week study, to assess the efficacy and safety of oral Budesonide-MMX 9 mg
      Extended-release Tablets in patients with mild to moderate, active ulcerative colitis who are
      not in remission based on the Ulcerative Colitis Disease Activity Index in study CB-01-02/01
      (parent study [NCT00679432]).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients who complete the parent study and who do not achieve clinical remission will be
      eligible to receive 8 weeks of open-label treatment with Budesonide-MMX 9mg if they satisfy
      the entry criteria for this study.

    <measure>The Percentage of Patients Achieving Clinical Remission</measure>
    <time_frame>At the end of the 8 week treatment period</time_frame>
    <description>The primary efficacy endpoint is clinical remission at 8 weeks, defined as a Ulcerative Colitis Disease Activity Index score of &lt; or = 1 with a score of 0 for both rectal bleeding and stool frequency, and &gt; or = 1 point reduction from baseline in endoscopy score, without any sign of mucosal friability (a score of 0 for mucosal appearance).
The UCDAI has 4 components. Each component is scored on scale of 0 to 3 (total maximum [worst] score = 12). Definitions of component scores are as follows: stool frequency: 0 = normal frequency, 1 = 1 - 2 stools per day greater than normal frequency, 2 = 3 - 4 stools per day greater than normal frequency, and 3 = &gt; 4 stools per day greater than normal frequency; rectal bleeding: 0 = none, 1 = streaks of blood, 2 = obvious blood, 3 = mostly blood; physician's rating of disease activity: 0 = normal, 1 = mild, 2 = moderate, 3 = severe; mucosal appearance: 0 = normal, 1 = mild friability, 2 = moderate friability, 3 = exudation, spontaneous bleeding.</description>

    <measure>The Secondary Efficacy Endpoint is Clinical Improvement</measure>
    <time_frame>After 8 weeks treatment period</time_frame>

    <time_frame>Throughout the 8 week treatment period</time_frame>
    <description>Safety will be assessed by evaluating SAEs and AEs. The outcome measure data are the numbers of patients who experienced SAEs or other nonserious AEs.</description>

    <measure>Endoscopic Improvement</measure>

    <description>Greater or equal to a 1 point improvement in the mucosal appearance subscore of the ulcerative colitis disease activity index (UCDAI), from baseline to week 8.
The UCDAI mucosal appearance subscore is graded as follows: 0 = normal, 1 = mild friability, 2 = moderate friability, 3 = exudation, spontaneous bleeding.</description>

        <title>The Percentage of Patients Achieving Clinical Remission</title>
        <description>The primary efficacy endpoint is clinical remission at 8 weeks, defined as a Ulcerative Colitis Disease Activity Index score of &lt; or = 1 with a score of 0 for both rectal bleeding and stool frequency, and &gt; or = 1 point reduction from baseline in endoscopy score, without any sign of mucosal friability (a score of 0 for mucosal appearance).
The UCDAI has 4 components. Each component is scored on scale of 0 to 3 (total maximum [worst] score = 12). Definitions of component scores are as follows: stool frequency: 0 = normal frequency, 1 = 1 - 2 stools per day greater than normal frequency, 2 = 3 - 4 stools per day greater than normal frequency, and 3 = &gt; 4 stools per day greater than normal frequency; rectal bleeding: 0 = none, 1 = streaks of blood, 2 = obvious blood, 3 = mostly blood; physician's rating of disease activity: 0 = normal, 1 = mild, 2 = moderate, 3 = severe; mucosal appearance: 0 = normal, 1 = mild friability, 2 = moderate friability, 3 = exudation, spontaneous bleeding.</description>
