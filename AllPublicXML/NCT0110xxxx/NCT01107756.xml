      Primary Objective:

      To evaluate the incidence and severity of neutropenia in patients being treated for solid
      tumours with a Taxotere® based regimen when Granocyte® 34 is being used as a primary
      prophylaxis for chemotherapy-induced neutropenia.

      Secondary Objectives:

      Haematological : To evaluate the incidence and severity of febrile neutropenia (with or
      without antibiotics) and anaemia in patients being treated for solid tumors treated with a
      Taxotere based regimen when Granocyte is being used as a primary prophylaxis.

      Non-Haematological : To evaluate the incidence and severity of the following adverse events:
      asthenia, anorexia, myalgia, nail changes and oral mucositis in patients with solid tumours
      treated with a Taxotere based regimen; when Granocyte is being used as a primary prophylaxis.
