    <textblock>
      Background: While treatment for pediatric cancer has improved significantly over the past 40
      years, the neurotoxic side-effects of the chemotherapy agents themselves are now being
      recognized. Two drugs suspected of having acute impact on memory performance in children are
      methotrexate (MTX) and steroids (GCs). In addition, new evidence suggests that this
      neurotoxicity might actually protect these children from traumatization.

      Working hypothesis and aims: This project aims to examine the acute impact of MTX and GC
      chemotherapy on memory performance in children and young adults with cancer, and the
      subsequent impact on the development of traumatic symptoms. We hypothesize that MTX and GCs
      will each produce acute declines in memory performance and that children with greater
      reductions in memory performance will have fewer traumatic symptoms.

      Methods: The investigators will recruit 45 children being treated with MTX or GCs at Dana
      Children's Hospital. To determine acute impact on memory, a battery of memory tests will be
      administered before and after a cycle of MTX and before and after a cycle of GCs. In
      addition, traumatic symptoms will be assessed at each post-chemotherapy evaluation point
      Expected results: The investigators expect poorer memory performance after MTX and after GCs
      and that these performance declines will correlate with lower rates of traumatic symptoms.

      Importance: The immediate impact of MTX and GCs on memory is not well known, especially in
      children. In addition, recent findings have led us to hypothesize that chemotherapy-induced
      deficits in memory function would paradoxically protect these patients from the
      traumatization often associated with cancer and its treatment. The proposed study will test
      this novel hypothesis for the first time.
