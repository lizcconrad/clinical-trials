  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to examine how Buprenorphine, a form of opioid addiction
      treatment, changes the ability to think and reason among people addicted to opiates, who are
      either HIV negative or HIV positive. In addition, blood samples will be stored for HIV+ and
      HIV- individuals who take buprenorphine to study its effect. We hypothesize that the HIV
      positive participants will demonstrate significant improvement in thinking and reasoning
      ability at 3 and 6 months compared to baseline, but that their thinking and reasoning ability
      will still be lower than HIV negative participants. We also hypothesize that the biomarkers
      in participants' blood samples will be associated with measures of change in thinking and
      reasoning ability.

        Subjects for this study will be drug users with a diagnosis of opioid dependence who are
        initiating buprenorphine therapy at a DoSA clinic or at the CHCC. The study population is
        expected to reflect the ethnic composition of the opioid-dependent population in the Bronx.
        This population is composed of 40% women, and is 24% African-American, 58% Hispanic and 17%
        Caucasian. Both males and females with opioid dependence who are initiating buprenorphine
        will be recruited for the proposed study, and, based on our previous studies, we expect to
        recruit high proportions of women and minorities.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Documented HIV-serostatus

          -  English-speaking

          -  Age 18-60

          -  Able to give voluntary, signed informed consent

          -  Plan to initiate buprenorphine treatment in the next month.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Over age 60: Participants over the age of 60 will be excluded, as normal
             age-associated cognitive changes may confound neuropsychological (NP) assessment and
             diagnosis of HIV-related cognitive disorders.

          -  Neurologic: History of head injury with loss of consciousness for greater than 12
             hours; previous penetrating skull wounds; previous brain surgery; known seizure
             disorder, or any other non-HIV related CNS disorders that might affect neurocognitive
             functioning (e.g., previous cerebrovascular accident, Parkinson's disease, multiple
             sclerosis, brain tumor).

          -  Medical: e.g. collagen vascular disorder (e.g. lupus), oxygen requiring chronic
             pulmonary disease,, or end stage renal disease requiring dialysis.

          -  Psychiatric: Lifetime diagnosis of schizophrenia or bipolar disorder.

          -  Less than 6 years of education.

          -  Acute intoxication due to alcohol or other drugs, as assessed by research staff.

          -  Use of buprenorphine in the past month, either prescribed or purchased on the street.
