  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will gather data on potential biomarkers in the treatment of advanced renal cell
      carcinoma (kidney cancer) and investigate their use as indicators of disease response. The
      results could eventually enable doctors to match levels of therapy to levels of biomarker on
      an individual basis and to increase the chance of disease response in patients. This study
      will also test a new paradigm in the treatment approach of advanced kidney cancer by using
      the drug everolimus in a neo-adjuvant setting, with the overarching goal of decreasing cancer
      recurrence rates and improving patient outcomes and survival.
