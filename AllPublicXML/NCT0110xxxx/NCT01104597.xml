  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Previous research has shown that Asian Indians are at relatively high risk for developing
      diabetes, heart problems and high blood pressure.

      The purpose of this study is to evaluate subclinical atherosclerosis (an early sign of heart
      disease) which may be associated with abnormalities like diabetes mellitus, hypertension
      (high blood pressure), high cholesterol and heart problems.

      Endothelium is the inner lining of your blood vessels. Endothelial dysfunction is found more
      in people with diabetes. In addition, high body mass index (BMI) is a strong risk factor for
      developing metabolic abnormalities like diabetes mellitus. This research study may provide
      information as to how useful endothelial dysfunction will be to detect people at risk of
      metabolic abnormalities and heart disease at an early stage.

      Two groups of subjects will be enrolled. Caucasians and Asian Indians There will be a total
      of 100 subjects participating in this study. Approximately 50 Caucasians and 50 Asian Indians
      will be enrolled. Caucasians will serve as the control group for this study.
