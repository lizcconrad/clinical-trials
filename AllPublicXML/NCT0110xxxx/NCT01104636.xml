    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to determine the success rates for stopping smoking with varenicline
      in Germany. The main measure of success will be continuous abstinence from smoking (not a
      single puff) in the last week of the standard 12 week treatment period. Additional
      information will be gathered regarding prescribing practices in Germany, smoking history,
      reasons why smokers quit smoking and re-start smoking, smoking related illnesses and the
      tolerability of varenicline.

    <description>The use of nicotine was recorded using Nicotine Use Inventory (NUI) to determine the participants who abstained from smoking for the previous 7 days. A responder for the 7-day point prevalence was defined as those with 'no' answers to the following two questions: Did the participant smoke any cigarettes (even a puff) in the last 7 days; and did participant use any other tobacco products (example pipe, cigars, snuff, chewing tobacco) in the last 7 days.</description>
