  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The pathogenesis of MS remain elusive, however some studies have linked the disease with
      infection by Epstein-Barr virus; therefore the use of drugs with immunosuppressive or
      immunomodulating action alone may be less suitable for primary progressive MS.This study will
      evaluate treatment with hydroxyurea (HU) in primary progressive MS. Hydroxyurea act by
      inhibiting the synthesis of deoxynucleotides essential for viral transcription,HU has
      recently been used in combination with antiretroviral drugs in HIV and has been shown to
      limit immune activation and suppress viral load by both antiviral and cytostatic activities.
      Furthermore has been demonstrated experimentally that HU suppressed the expression of EBV.
      For these reasons HU could be useful in primary progressive MS with cytostatic and antiviral
      action , confirming the role of EBV in the pathogenesis of MS.
