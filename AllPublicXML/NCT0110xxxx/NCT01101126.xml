      The purpose of this study is to determine whether disease management program is effective in
      preventing acute exacerbations in patients with unstable chronic obstructive pulmonary
      disease (COPD) or asthma.

      The aim of the present study is to test the efficacy of a comprehensive community disease
      management program in patients with unstable chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) or
      asthma. The intervention is delivered by designated nurses and pulmonologists, in
      collaboration with the primary practitioners and other healthcare professionals at the
      community, in the Jerusalem and the Lowland District of Maccabi Health Services in Israel.

      The main purpose is to evaluate the effect of the intervention on the use acute care and
      emergency health services for acute exacerbation of the lung disease.

      Secondary objectives include the evaluation of the effect of the intervention on quality of
      life, physical function, pulmonary function test, depression and all-cause mortality.
