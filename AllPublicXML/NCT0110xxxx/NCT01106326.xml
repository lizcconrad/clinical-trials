  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this pilot study is to implement directly observed therapy with preventive asthma
      medications through a partnership with the school nurse (with input and direction from the
      primary care provider) to assure that the teen receives guideline based preventive
      medications, and provide a motivational interviewing intervention to help the teen transition
      to independence with their medical treatment plan. We hypothesize that this community-based
      pilot intervention will; 1) be feasible and acceptable among this population and among school
      personnel, and 2) yield reduced asthma morbidity (symptom-free days, absenteeism, and
      emergency room / urgent care use for asthma care). We anticipate that enhancing preventive
      healthcare for urban teens with asthma through partnerships with schools will yield improved
      health, prevention of suffering, decreased absenteeism from school, and reduced healthcare
      costs. This new method of preventive care delivery could be sustained within the school
      nursing system, and could be implemented in schools nationwide. Further, it could be applied
      to other chronic illnesses affecting disadvantaged populations.
