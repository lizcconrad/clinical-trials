  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Women found to have early stage breast cancer will have their cancer surgically removed
      followed by radiation treatment to the entire breast, five times per week for several weeks.
      The radiation treatment prevents the cancer from growing back but creates skin burns. Several
      studies have showed that it is nor necessary treating the whole breast.

      The investigators team has pioneered a new therapy realizing the permanent implantation of
      tiny radioactive seeds into the surgical cavity in a single one hour procedure under light
      anesthesia. Patients live a normal life while receiving the radiation treatment. The results
      of a first clinical trial on 67 patients shows that the treatment is well tolerate and
      efficient. The purpose of the study is to offer the treatment in several places and to
      increase the cohort of patient to 420 to capture rare complications if any.

      For early stage breast cancer, accelerated partial breast irradiation is an alternative
      treatment option to whole breast irradiation after breast conserving surgery. Our group has
      previously reported results of a Phase I/II study of permanent breast seed implant (PBSI)
      using palladium-103 seeds as an alternative to whole breast radiotherapy for well selected
      breast cancer patients. The procedure is realised in a single session under light sedation
      and local freezing. After a median FU of 54 months no patients has recurred on a cohort of 67
      patients, and acute of delayed side effect compared favourably to external beam radiotherapy.

      Yet this study was a single centre study and the sample size did not allow evaluating
      appropriately the risk of serious adverse events (SAE). The current study propose evaluating
      SAE on a multicentre and larger cohort of 420 patients.

    <time_frame>Initial and then yearly up to 5 years</time_frame>
    <description>Serious Adverse Events (SAE) is an unintended sign, symptom, or syndrome illness that occurs during the period of observation in the clinical study and that is life threatening or result in death. SAE will be coded using the NCI CTC V3.0 scale and corresponds to grade 4 or 5 signs or symptoms.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Breast cancer local recurrence</measure>
    <time_frame>Yearly up to 10 years</time_frame>
    <description>Ipsilateral in-breast or chest wall recurrence is defined as evidence of invasive or in situ breast cancer (except LCIS) in the ipsilateral breast. Patients will have a biopsy of the suspicious lesion to confirm the diagnosis with documentation of the location.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Regional recurrence</measure>
    <time_frame>Yearly up to 10 years</time_frame>
    <description>Regional recurrence is defined as the development of tumor in regional nodes as well as the soft tissue of the ipsilateral axilla after axillary dissection. The regional recurrence is suspected on imaging and/or clinical symptoms and must be documented with fine needle aspiration. Also the localisation of the nodal recurrence must be reported (internal mammary chain, supra-clavicular area or axilla).</description>

    <measure>Metastases</measure>
    <time_frame>Yearly up to 10 years</time_frame>
    <description>Distant recurrence is defined as evidence of tumor in any area of the body. The metastasis recurrence should be proved by appropriate imaging, biopsy or fine needle aspiration</description>

    <description>Any toxicity related to the radiation treatment, including skin and subcutaneous, or any other organ in case of seed migration will be coded using the NCI common toxicity criteria version 3.0 scale. Fat necrosis will be diagnosed either by mammography or clinically (prolonged indurations and pain in the area of seeds implantation without evidence of infection).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Cosmetic outcome</measure>
    <time_frame>Yearly up to 10 years</time_frame>
    <description>Cosmetic results will be evaluated at each follow-up visit by the treating radiation oncologist. An excellent cosmetic result score is assigned when the treated breast looked essentially the same as the contralateral breast (as it relates to radiation effects). A good cosmetic score is assigned for minimal but identifiable radiation effects of the treated breast. A fair score means significant radiation effects were readily observable. A poor score is used for severe sequelae of breast tissue secondary to radiation effects.</description>
