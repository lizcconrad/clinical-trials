  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Anemia is still a main public health problem in sub-Saharan Africa. Anemic women have an
      increased maternal and perinatal mortality and anemic adults have diminished work capacity.
      In sub-Saharan Africa, the etiology of anemia is multifactoral; the major causes are low
      dietary bioavailability and chronic parasitic infections such as malaria. These causes are
      likely to interact because infection and infection-associated inflammation may impair the
      utilization and absorption of iron. Therefore, the control of parasite infections may be
      important to improve iron bioavailability from foods.

      Malaria infections are endemic in northern Benin. To investigate the contribution of
      asymptomatic malaria (a positive blood smear for malarial parasites but without clinical
      symptoms of fever, headache or malaise) to anemia, we are planning a human iron absorption
      study in Benin. We will recruit adults with asymptomatic malaria infection. The iron
      absorption and utilization of the study subjects will be studied while infected, then they
      will be treated to clear their infections, and then iron absorption and utilization will be
      restudied. Iron absorption will be determined by incorporation of labeled iron into
      erythrocytes, 14 days after the administration of a test meal containing labeled iron (stable
      isotope technique). Subjects will be men and non-pregnant, non-breastfeeding women with a
      body weight &lt; 65 kg and between the age of 18 - 30 years.

      The results of this study will provide important information on the influence of malaria
      infections on iron absorption and utilization in humans. The study will provide insight into
      the potential necessity of malaria control to ensure iron bioavailability from foods in
      developing countries.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Age 18-35 y

          -  Body weight &lt; 65 kg

          -  A positive malaria smear (asexual P. falciparum parasitemia &gt; 500/Î¼L blood) without
             clinical symptoms (fever or self-reported fever in last 7 days, headache, malaise)

          -  If female, not pregnant (tested by pregnancy test) and not breastfeeding

          -  No mineral and vitamin supplements two weeks before and during the study

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Severe anemia (hemoglobin &lt; 8.0 g/dl)

          -  Chronic medical illnesses

          -  Blood donation or transfusion in the last 6 months before study time

          -  Soil-transmitted helminth infections (positive Kato-Katz-Smear)

          -  Tuberculosis (TB): The potential presence of TB will be excluded by a short health
             questionnaire (cough? night sweats? weight loss? close relative with TB?). If this
             questionnaire raises the possibility that the subject may be at risk for TB, he/she
             will be referred to the local medical service
