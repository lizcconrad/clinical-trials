    <textblock>
      This study is a randomised, single-blind, placebo-controlled, repeat dose study of
      otelixizumab administered subcutaneously in rheumatoid arthritis patients. One cohort will
      receive a single dose of adalimumab (HUMIRA, Abbott) as rescue medication to assess
      additional concomitant safety and tolerability issues.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Otelixizumab is a humanized, aglycosyl, non-mitogenic, anti CD3 monoclonal antibody (MAb)
      directed against the ε domain of the human lymphocyte antigen CD3, which is currently
      undergoing phase III clinical trials in adult new-onset type I diabetes mellitus patients and
      has been evaluated in rheumatoid arthritis and psoriasis patients in small exploratory
      studies. Otelixizumab has been administered via the subcutaneous route as a single dose in
      type I diabetes patients. This study is a randomised, single-blind, placebo-controlled,
      repeat dose study of otelixizumab administered subcutaneously in rheumatoid arthritis
      patients. One cohort will receive a single dose of adalimumab (HUMIRA, Abbott) as rescue
      medication to assess additional concomitant safety and tolerability issues.

      This study will consist of a screening phase, followed by an in-house phase whereby
      otelixizumab will be administered to cohorts in a staggered fashion. Six cumulative doses
      will be evaluated covering a 10-fold dose range in seven cohorts. The starting regimen will
      be three doses (1.5 mg cumulative dose), increasing to 15 doses (15 mg cumulative dose).
      Cohorts 1a and 1b have been included as optional lower doses. Serial blood samples will be
      obtained for clinical laboratory testing, determination of pharmacodynamic markers, serum
      otelixizumab PK parameters, and immunogenicity. Safety and pharmacodynamic data from the
      previous dose(s) will be evaluated prior to dose escalation or modification to ensure safety
      and to achieve target systemic peripheral blood pharmacology. Adverse events, laboratory
      values, vital signs and ECG's will be monitored closely during this study. All subjects in
      the study will undergo long-term follow-up out to 48 months to monitor and ensure patient
      safety.

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

        A subject will be eligible for inclusion in this study only if all of the following
        criteria apply:

          1. Male or female subjects between 18 and 75 years of age inclusive.

          2. A female subject is eligible to participate if she is of:

               1. Non-childbearing potential defined as pre-menopausal females with a documented
                  tubal ligation or hysterectomy; or postmenopausal defined as 12 months of
                  spontaneous amenorrhea [in questionable cases a blood sample with simultaneous
                  follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) &gt; 40 mIU/ml and estradiol &lt;40 pg/ml (&lt;140
                  pmol/L) is confirmatory]. Females on hormone replacement therapy (HRT) and whose
                  menopausal status is in doubt will be required to use one of the contraception
                  methods in Section 8.1.1 if they wish to continue their HRT during the study.
                  Otherwise, they must discontinue HRT to allow confirmation of post-menopausal
                  status prior to study enrollment. For most forms of HRT, at least 2-4 weeks will
                  elapse between the cessation of therapy and the blood draw; this interval depends
                  on the type and dosage of HRT. Following confirmation of their post-menopausal
                  status, they can resume use of HRT during the study without use of a
                  contraceptive method.

               2. Child-bearing potential and agrees to use one of the contraception methods listed
                  in Section 8.1.1 for an appropriate period of time to sufficiently minimize the
                  risk of pregnancy at that point. Female subjects must agree to use contraception
                  for at least two weeks prior to dosing and for at least 60 days after the last
                  dose.

          3. Male subjects must agree to use one of the contraception methods listed in Section
             8.1.2. This criterion must be followed from the time of the first dose of study
             medication until at least 60 days after the last dose of otelixizumab or two months
             after adalimumab (Cohort 6 only).

          4. Body mass index within the range 18.5 - 35 kg/m^2 inclusive

          5. Capable of giving written informed consent, which includes compliance with the
             requirements and restrictions listed in the consent form and willing and able to
             follow the procedures outlined in the protocol.

          6. A 12-lead ECG at pre-study screening measured in triplicate, which in the opinion of
             the Principal Investigator or physician designee has no abnormalities that will
             compromise safety in this study. QTcB &lt; 450 msec; or QTc &lt; 480 msec in subjects with
             Bundle Branch Block.

          7. No significant and/or active disease in any body system. Examples of significant
             diseases include but are not limited to: coronary artery disease, congestive heart
             failure, uncontrolled hypertension, emphysema, seizure disorder, chronic infectious
             disease ( e.g., chronic renal infection, chronic chest infection with bronchiectasis,
             tuberculosis (TB) or latent tuberculosis, hepatitis B and C).

          8. The subject has a diagnosis of RA according to the revised 1987 criteria of the

             is willing to refrain from using any such antibody for 2 years after the last dose of
             study drug unless invited to participate in possible future studies with otelixizumab.

         11. If taking methotrexate, the patient must have been taking methotrexate for at least 12
             weeks and to be on a stable dose of methotrexate (7.5-25 mg/week) for at least four
             weeks prior to dosing and be willing to remain on this dose until day 28 of the study
             unless change required for clinical management of disease activity or safety.

         12. If sulfasalazine is being taken, the patient must have been taking sulfasalazine for
             at least 12 weeks and to be on a stable dose within local treatment guidelines for at
             least four weeks prior to dosing and be willing to remain on this dose until day 28 of
             the study unless change required for clinical management of disease activity or
             safety.

             dose within local treatment guidelines for four weeks prior to dosing with study drug
             and be willing to remain on this dose until day 28 of the study unless change required
             for clinical management of disease activity or safety.

         14. Patients on glucocorticoids e.g. prednisolone (≤10mg/day), must be on stable dosing
             regimens for at least four weeks prior to dosing and be willing to remain on this dose
             until day 28 of the study.

             IV antibiotics to resolve); other infections, e.g., bronchitis, sinusitis, localized
             cellulitis, candidiasis, or urinary tract infections, must be assessed on a

             Screening for latent TB infection using intradermal injection of tuberculin (e.g. the
             Mantoux test or equivalent) should be conducted in accordance with local guidelines.
             The tuberculin skin test results should be evaluated according to the criteria for
             immunocompromised subjects. Subjects with a positive skin tuberculin test should be
             excluded if the investigator judges the patient to be at risk of latent TB infection).
             Cohort 6 are required to undergo radiographic screening with CXR, this is optional

             after the last dose of study drug.

         23. Positive plasma / white cell JC virus (JCV) PCR (either compartment)

         24. The subject has a condition or situation that, in the investigator's judgment, is
             likely to cause the subject to be unable or unwilling to participate in study
