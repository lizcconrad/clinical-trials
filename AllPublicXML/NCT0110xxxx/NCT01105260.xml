    <textblock>
      Reconditioning program during the chronic phase of the spinal cord-injury is well known for
      its beneficial effects, but there is no investigation in early rehabilitation consequences.
      Nevertheless, it may be justified : to increase oxygen uptake; to decrease the risks of
      medical complications; or to improve the mobility. The restrictive autonomy is due to
      different factors: firstly wheelchair users reduce their movement because they need technical
      or human help to achieve transfers; and secondly, locomotion is performed by the upper limbs.
      Without specific practice, the upper limbs mechanical and physiological properties do not
      permit exercises that are long and intense. Then, the purpose of this research is to evaluate
      the effects of an 8 weeks interval training program on wheelchair independance during
      inpatient early rehabilitation for spinal cord injury (3 to 6 months post injury) compared to
      a control group (classical rehabilitation program in a physical medicine and rehabilitation
      department).
