  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      LPLD is a rare autosomal recessive disorder, characterized by the presence of marked
      chylomicronemia and hence hypertriglyceridemia. Clinically the most severe manifestation of
      chylomicronemia, is acute pancreatitis, which can be lethal. There is no effective therapy
      available to modulate the course of the illness and prevent complications for these patients.
      The current clinical management consists of severe reduction of dietary fat that is hard if
      not almost impossible to comply with. LPLD subjects continue to experience pancreatitis
      attacks, and are admitted to intensive care units on several occasions.

      Alipogene tiparvovec corrects or restores lipoprotein lipase (LPL) function long term, and
      hence reverses some symptoms, halts the disease progression and prevents further
      complications. Alipogene tiparvovec gene therapy ensures that a catabolically beneficial
      variant of the human LPL gene, LPL[S447X] is expressed and active in the relevant tissues in
      humans. Delivery of the gene is realized via intramuscular injection of an adeno-associated
      viral vector, pseudotyped with AAV1 capsids.

      The CT-AMT-011-01 study is an open-label, dose-escalating study evaluating the safety and
      efficacy of a single intramuscular administration of AMT-011 (at multiple sites). The study
      will be performed in the Community Genomic medicineCenter (CGMC) Chicoutimi, Canada, under
      the supervision of their medical ethical committee and according to the local biosafety
      procedures. The study participants will be treated under the responsibility of a Principal
      Investigator specialised in the treatment of lipid disorders. A total number of 14 subjects
      will be administered. Participants will be screened 3 weeks prior to administration of
      AMT-011 and will be evaluated for 12 weeks post administration in this study. After the
      study, subjects will be followed up long term with particular emphasis on the safety and
      efficacy aspects of LPL gene therapy using AMT-011. Subjects will be evaluated at the
      clinical site at 19 weeks, 26 weeks, 39 weeks, 1 year, 1.5 years, 2 years, 3 years, 4 years
      and 5 years after administration of AMT-011. The TG values that are obtained at week 26 will
      be used for secondary efficacy analysis.
