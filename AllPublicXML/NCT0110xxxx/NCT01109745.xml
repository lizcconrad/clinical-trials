  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this project is to establish the effectiveness of implementation of a
      self-administered electronic asthma-specific quality of life instrument for childhood asthma
      in primary care and specialist care.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Health related quality of life (HRQL) is important to the asthmatic child and if HRQL aspects
      are taken into account in daily care this could result in improved treatment satisfaction,
      compliance, asthma control and, ultimately, improved HRQL. The Pelican instrument we have
      developed has the essential features to be useful in daily care. In this study, the
      effectiveness of implementing the Pelican instrument in medical care is assessed. An
      intervention study with 9 months follow-up in primary and secondary care will be carried out.

    <measure>Lung function</measure>
    <time_frame>9 months</time_frame>
    <description>Lung function indices (FEV1 and FVC before and 15 minutes after inhalation of 400 µg salbutamol) are measured by a certified lung function technician specifically trained to coach children using a spirometer with child-incentive. Spirometry tests will be performed according to ERS/ATS spirometry standards and recommendations regarding testing in children. Spirometry is performed at least 8 hrs after the last inhalation of a short-acting bronchodilator, and 12 hrs after a long-acting bronchodilator.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Cost-effectiveness</measure>
    <time_frame>9 months</time_frame>
    <description>A cost-effectiveness analysis (CEA) from a societal perspective will be performed and reported according to national and international guidelines. In the CEA an effect is defined as a relevant change in HRQL (i.e., ∆PAQLQ ≥0.5 point) in the denominator and the total of all relevant costs in the nominator. C/E ratios with and without inclusion of the indirect cost will be reported. A sensitivity analysis will be performed in order to estimate the susceptibility of C/E ratio's to variation in prior assumptions and choices, including 'worst case - best case' scenarios.</description>

    <description>The intervention is the integration of the output of the Pelican instrument in daily care to guide disease management for children with asthma treated in primary care. The general practitioner can integrate the information of the Pelican instrument in their consultation and disease management decisions. The general practitioner will be trained and supported to negotiate the child's, and physicians' agendas based on the outcome of the instrument, and discuss possible interventions. All participating children of a GP will be allocated to the same treatment group (i.e., hierarchical or nested design).</description>
