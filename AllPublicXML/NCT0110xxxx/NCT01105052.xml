      The purpose of this study is to investigate whether a self-help book for insomnia, with or
      without therapist support, can improve sleep and alleviate insomnia symptoms in individuals
      suffering from insomnia, also for persons presenting with different kinds of co-morbid
      problems.

    <textblock>
      CBT has previously been identified as an effective treatment for insomnia. However, there is
      a lack of trained CBT-therapists, and self-help is beginning to prove useful for many areas
      of psychological distress. Earlier studies of different kinds of self-help (e.g. computer
      based and bibliotherapeutic) suggest that many patients do indeed benefit from self-help
      treatments for insomnia, but there is a need for independent replications. Also, most
      previous studies have had very strict inclusion criteria, such that for instance only
      individuals with primary insomnia and no co-morbid problems have been included. A general
      question in self-help is whether patients need therapist support to benefit from treatment,
      or if a book is enough to alleviate symptoms.

    <description>7-item patient-reported outcome assessing the severity of initial, middle and late insomnia; sleep satisfaction; interference of insomnia with daytime functioning; noticeability of sleep problems by others; and distress about sleep difficulties. A 5-point scale is used to rate each item, yielding a total score of 0 to 28. Higher score indicates more severe insomnia within 4 severity categories: absence of insomnia (score of 0-7); subthreshold insomnia (8-14); moderate insomnia (15-21) and severe insomnia (22-28).</description>
