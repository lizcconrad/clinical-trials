    <textblock>
      The ambition of this study is to raise the quality of care for old and chronically ill
      patients by establishing a sustainable, systematic prevention and integrated care model for
      users of home care services.

      In this cluster randomized study the intervention will be carried through in five
      municipalities and three general hospitals. The home care units in every municipality will be
      randomized to either intervention og control units.

      The primary objective of this study is to develop a functional and integrated care model
      between primary and secondary health care that will meet the needs both in the city and in
      smaller rural areas.

      The secondary objective of this study is to reduce the need of care at primary and secondary
      level through a a systematic and integrated follow-up by home care nurses and general
      practitioners to:

        -  Enable these patients to manage their health needs more efficiently and independently

        -  Achieve better collaboration within primary care

        -  Achieve better collaboration between primary- and secondary health care professionals

        -  Achieve increased satisfaction and confidence with the health care services by the users
           and their relatives both for included patients and other patients receiving home care
           services.

        -  Promote health and prevent unnecessary decline in health

        -  Strengthen the patients' ability to manage their daily activities.
