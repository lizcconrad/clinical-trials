      This is an observational research study whose purposes are to see:

        1. if 40 Hyperbaric Oxygen Therapy sessions at 1.5 atmospheres (HBOT 1.5) or more (60, or
           80 HBOT's) help, worsen, or have no effect on subjects with chronic TBI/PCS (Traumatic
           Brain Injury/Post-Concussion Syndrome) and/or PTSD (Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder).

        2. if improvements or worsening of symptoms can be recorded with computerized and written
           tests for memory and thinking, and with questionnaires about the subject's quality of
           life and health.

        3. determine the long-term outcome of the treatment.

        4. confirm, in large numbers of study participants at multiple sites nationwide, the strong
           positive results obtained in pilot studies

        One thousand subjects will be recruited. Subjects will be 18-65 years old and have been
        diagnosed with mild or moderate (but not severe) TBI or TBI/PTSD or PTSD by either the
        military (any etiology) or civilian neurologists or neuropsychologists. This diagnosis will
        especially include war veterans who have had a significant decrease in their
        neuropsychological test scores.

        There will be no gender restriction. However, it is anticipated that the cohort will
        consist mostly of males, due to the nature of the injury. There will be no race or
        ethnicity restriction.

        All subjects will be legally capable of consenting. No subjects who need 3rd party consent
        will be enrolled in the NBIRR study.

        Military - Unless specifically approved by a military site IRB, active duty participants
        will have to voluntarily contact NBIRR participating sites or respond to a recruitment
        outreach outside of the command.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Any 18-65 year-old patient with mild-moderate TBI or PTSD. (If a military injury,
             subject may be active duty or a veteran. If active duty, participants will have to
             voluntarily contact NBIRR.)

          2. Have demonstrated a &gt;20% decrement (compared to pre-deployment baseline) in ANAM
             composite score or specific sub-score with regard to &quot;simple reaction time&quot; and/or
             &quot;procedural reaction time&quot;.

          3. Have a diagnosis of TBI, chronic TBI/PCS or TBI/PCS/PTSD or PTSD made by a military
             (military etiology of blast injury) or civilian specialist.

          4. Negative pregnancy test in females.

          5. Less than 90% on the Percent Back to Normal Rating Scale. (If patient is considered
             100% normal before TBI, patient should be less than 90% normal for entry into the
             study).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Pulmonary disease that precludes HBOT (e.g., asthma unresponsive to medication,
             bullous emphysema).

          2. Unstable medical conditions that are contraindicated in HBOT (e.g. severe congestive
             heart failure or heart failure requiring hospital emergency evaluation or admission in
             the previous year).

          3. Severe confinement anxiety (claustrophobia; e.g., patients who require anesthesia
             conscious sedation for MRI or who cannot go in elevators).

          4. Pregnancy.

          5. Other pre-TBI neurological diagnoses.(seizure disorders, multiple sclerosis,
             Parkinson's, Lyme, etc.)

          6. Participation in another experimental trial with active intervention.

          7. High probability of inability to complete the experimental protocol (e.g. terminal
             condition).

          8. Past or current history of mental retardation unless diagnosed post TBI (baseline IQ â‰¤
             70).

          9. Pre- or post-TBI history of systemic illness with impact on central nervous system.
             (Principal Investigator in consultation with study sponsor Medical Officer will make
             the ultimate decision).

         10. Any pre-existing chronic infection not related to battlefield injuries or government
             service.
