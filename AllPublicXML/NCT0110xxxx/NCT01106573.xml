  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Diabetes Mellitus (DM) is frequently appearing in patients with cardiovascular disease and
      these patients, as a consequence herby, has a lesser prognosis. DM is often related to
      increased arterial stiffness and hypertension. The investigators thesis is that DM and
      pre-diabetes is prevalent in patients undergoing cardiovascular surgery and to some extend is
      under-diagnosed. At the same time the investigators imagine that DM is closely related to the
      degree of arterial stiffness, and that these parameters are closely related to a new
      biochemical marker, fibulin-1.

      The investigators aim to describe the prevalence of type 2 DM and dysmetabolism in patients
      admitted to the hospital to undergo cardiovascular surgery and besides that to investigate if
      there is a connection between the degree of the dysmetabolism and arterial disease, by
      studying arterial stiffness and by measuring a new biochemical marker, fibulin-1, which the
      investigators newly have identified. The results of this project will give us a measure for
      the quantity of unknown DM in patients undergoing cardiovascular surgery and furthermore tell
      us more in terms of the connections between a newly identified plasma arterial marker,
      arterial stiffness and diabetes.
