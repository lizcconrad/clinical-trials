      The purpose of this study is:

        1. To characterize the types and frequency of molecular alterations to the epidermal growth
           factor receptor (EGFR) pathway, FGFR4 and EML-ALK in Asian patients with non-small cell
           lung cancer

        2. To identify candidate biomarkers of importance in the EGFR and estrogen pathways

      Most, if not all, human malignancies including lung cancer are caused by somatic alterations
      of the genome, leading to activation of oncogenes or inactivation of tumor suppressor genes
      and their resultant oncogenic effects. In addition to mutations, increased chromosomal copy
      number (by amplification or polysomy) and DNA methylation are other mechanisms of oncogene
      activation and tumour suppressor gene inactivation respectively.

      Little is known about the relationship between these oncogenes of the EGFR family and the
      recently described oncogenes FGFR4 and fusion gene EML4-ALK. Recent data suggests molecularly
      defined subgroups of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) exist and can be used to predict for
      sensitivity to targeted agents (erlotinib or gefitinib) or cytotoxic chemotherapy
      (pemetrexate, gemcitabine, platinum agents). The findings that estrogen receptors are present
      in lung tumours and that estrogen can stimulate growth and proliferation of lung cancers in
      vitro and in vivo are provocative. Further studies to evaluate the role of estrogens and
      other sex hormones in lung cancer are warranted.

      A further understanding of the molecular indicators of lung cancer prognosis and treatment
      prediction would improve drug development and patient treatment selection.

      Archived paraffin-embedded and fresh frozen NSCLC tumor tissue will be obtained via the
      Department of Pathology and the National University Tissue Repository respectively.
      Clinico-pathological characteristics will be obtained from the case records, Pathology and
      Tissue Repository. DNA will be isolated using standard techniques. Sequencing of genes in the
      EGFR signaling pathway: EGFR, KRAS, ErbB2, ErbB3, MET, PI3K, and BRAF as well as FGFR4.
      Unstained slides from the paraffin-embedded tissue will be obtained and subjected to
      fluoresce in vitro hybridization (FISH) for breakpoints in the EML4 and ALK genes as
      previously described. For cases that have been snap-frozen, RNA will be extracted and
      EML4-ALK fusions will be confirmed using RT-PCR and pre-specified primers. To analyse the
      expression of proteins of putative relevance to EGFR function (such as EGFR, ErbB2, ErbB3,
      AKT, MET, STAT, ERK, MAPK, cyclin D1, C/EBPa), downstream effects of EGFR: cell proliferation
      (Ki-67), angiogenesis (CD34, VEGF-A), apoptosis (bcl-2), metastasis, and hormonal influence
      (oestrogen and progesterone receptors, aromatase), TMA technology will be utilised. The
      status of the tumor suppressor genes PTEN and C/EBPa will be analysed.
