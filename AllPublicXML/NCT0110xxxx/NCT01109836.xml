      Aim of this randomized controlled study is to test if intensive polyintervention therapy
      including life style modifications targeting at reduction of modifiable risk factors of
      stroke can reduce the risk of post-stroke cognitive decline compared to a group of patients
      receiving standard care.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Stroke is the second most frequent cause of death and cognitive deficits including dementia
      occur frequently following a stroke. The frequency of cognitive disturbances has been
      reported up to 30% and thus occurs three times more frequent than recurrent stroke (10%).
      Major attempts have been made to prevent the occurrence of new strokes by means of effective
      strategies including preventive drugs. In contrast, hardly any studies have been performed
      addressing the prevention of deteriorating cognitive function following a stroke. In spite of
      this high prevalence therapeutic possibilities are extremely limited. It must be expected
      that cognitive deficits become even a more frequent disability following stroke. This is
      caused by the increased aging of the population leading to further increase of incidence,
      furthermore that more people survive their acute stroke due to increased possibilities of
      acute treatment, and that frequent risk factors (e.g. hypertension, diabetes) are
      increasingly controlled, thus leading to less severe strokes with less severe and permanent
      motor deficits, but an increase of potentially disabling cognitive disturbances. The aim of
      this randomized controlled study is to test an intensive multiple intervention therapy for
      the first time in stroke and to add life style modifications targeting modifiable risk
      factors for cognitive deterioration.

      It is hypothesized that the risk of post-stroke cognitive decline can be significantly
      reduced compared to a control group with standard care when using polyintervention. These
      interventions will focus on nutrition, exercise, cognitive and social activity and monitoring
      and management of metabolic and vascular risk factors. Regular contacts with the subjects
      shall increase motivation and adherence to the study protocol.
