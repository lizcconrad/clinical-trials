    <measure>Difference of Sensitivity for Detection of Full Extent of Malignant Breast Disease Using CMRM vs UMRM Per Reader</measure>
    <time_frame>Immediately before injection and after injection</time_frame>
    <description>For a single participant the sensitivity was defined as the proportion of malignant breast regions that were recognized by the clinical investigators and the 3 blinded readers using the respective imaging modality as malignant. Subsequently the sensitivity percentage was calculated based on the mean of the sensitivities across all participants. The difference was calculated as CMRM value minus UMRM value. For ease of expression, the following abbreviations will be used: Magnetic Resonance Mammography (MRM), Unenhanced MRM (UMRM), combined unenhanced and contrast (gadobutrol)-enhanced MRM (CMRM), X-ray mammography (XRM).</description>

    <description>The disease state &quot;bilateral malignant disease&quot; was derived from the assessment of the different regions for each breast (right and left) for investigators for each imaging modality (UMRM, CMRM, XRM, UMRM+XRM, and CMRM+XRM) based on the following rule: If the participant had at least one breast with no malignant region , the assessment of bilateral malignant disease was categorized as &quot;No&quot;. If the participant had at least one malignant lesion in both breasts, the assessment of bilateral malignant disease was categorized as &quot;Yes&quot;. The proportion of correct matches of each different image set to the SoT for the existence of bilateral malignant disease were derived. The analysis was based on the difference in accuracy for the evaluation of bilateral malignant disease for the following image comparisons on a participant level. The difference was calculated as CMRM value minus UMRM value, CMRM+XRM value minus UMRM+XRM value, CMRM+XRM value minus XRM value respectively.</description>

          <description>Participants first received an unenhanced magnetic resonance mammography (MRM), followed by a gadobutrol-enhanced MRM. Gadobutrol was administered at the standard dose of 0.1 mmol/kg body weight (bw) [0.1 ml/kg bw] as an intravenous injection (i.v.) at a rate of 2 ml/sec. Unenhanced MRM (UMRM) and combined unenhanced and contrast (gadobutrol)-enhanced MRM (CMRM) image sets were evaluated in a randomized fashion. After the evaluation of the UMRM or CMRM the respective X-ray mammography (XRM) was added and evaluated together with the UMRM images.</description>

        <title>Difference of Sensitivity for Detection of Full Extent of Malignant Breast Disease Using CMRM vs UMRM Per Reader</title>
        <description>For a single participant the sensitivity was defined as the proportion of malignant breast regions that were recognized by the clinical investigators and the 3 blinded readers using the respective imaging modality as malignant. Subsequently the sensitivity percentage was calculated based on the mean of the sensitivities across all participants. The difference was calculated as CMRM value minus UMRM value. For ease of expression, the following abbreviations will be used: Magnetic Resonance Mammography (MRM), Unenhanced MRM (UMRM), combined unenhanced and contrast (gadobutrol)-enhanced MRM (CMRM), X-ray mammography (XRM).</description>
        <time_frame>Immediately before injection and after injection</time_frame>
        <population>The analyses were based on 390 participants in the Full Analysis Set (FAS) who had regions with malignant disease verified by Standard of Truth (SoT).</population>

        <title>Breast Level Specificity of CMRM for Non-malignant Breasts by Reader</title>
        <description>A non-malignant breast was defined as false positive (FP), when the reader assessed at least one breast region as malignant. When all breast regions were assessed as non-malignant, the breast was defined as true negative (TN). Breast level specificity was first defined in participant as number of TN-breasts in participant divided by number of non-malignant breasts in participant. Subsequently the specificity percentage was calculated based on the mean of the specificities across all participants who contributed with at least one non-malignant breast.</description>
        <time_frame>Immediately before injection and after injection</time_frame>
        <population>The analyses were based on 367 participants in FAS; evaluable for specificity were breasts without malignant disease as verified by Standard of Truth (SoT) for which a CMRM assessment was available.</population>

        <description>The investigator and the blinded readers each recorded his/her confidence in diagnosis for each breast region based on a 4-point scale (1 = not confident, 2 = somewhat confident, 3 = confident, and 4 = very confident). For each participant, the mean of the confidence responses for the diagnosed breast regions was calculated, and rounded to the nearest 0.5. The difference was calculated as CMRM value minus UMRM value, CMRM+XRM value minus UMRM+XRM value, CMRM+XRM value minus XRM value respectively.</description>

        <title>Breast Level Specificity of in Non-malignant Breasts Using UMRM, XRM, CMRM+XRM and UMRM+XRM by Reader</title>
        <description>A non-malignant breast was defined as false positive (FP), when the reader assessed at least one breast region as malignant. When all breast regions were assessed as non-malignant, the breast was defined as true negative (TN). Breast level specificity was first defined in participant as number of TN-breasts in participant divided by number of non-malignant breasts in participant. Subsequently the specificity percentage was calculated based on the mean of the specificities across all participants who contributed with at least one non-malignant breast.</description>

        <title>Breast Level Specificity for All Breasts by Imaging Modality and by Reader</title>
        <description>A non-malignant breast was defined as FP when the reader assessed at least one breast region as malignant. A malignant breast was defined as FP, when the reader using the respective imaging modality assessed more breast regions as malignant as were present according to SoT. Otherwise the breast was assessed as TN. Specificity was then defined as (N-FP)/N, where N was total number of breasts.</description>
        <time_frame>Immediately before injection and after injection</time_frame>
        <population>The analyses were based on 395 participants in FAS; evaluable for specificity were breasts with or without malignant disease verified by SoT with available assessments by the imaging modality.</population>

        <title>Sensitivity Difference in the Determination of Malignant Breast Disease Using CMRM vs UMRM, CMRM+XRM vs UMRM+XRM, and CMRM+XRM vs XRM Verified by SoT, Breast Region Level</title>
        <description>For a single participant the sensitivity was defined as the proportion of malignant breast regions that were recognized by the reader using the respective imaging modality as malignant. Subsequently the point estimates were calculated based on the mean of the sensitivities across all participants. Regions with malignant disease verified by SoT comprise unifocal and multifocal regions. Difference in sensitivity is calculated as CMRM value minus UMRM value, CMRM+XRM value minus UMRM+XRM value, CMRM+XRM value minus XRM value respectively.</description>

        <title>Sensitivity Difference in the Determination of Multifocal Malignant Breast Disease Using CMRM vs UMRM, CMRM+XRM vs UMRM+XRM, and CMRM+XRM vs XRM Verified by SoT, Breast Region Level</title>
        <description>For a single participant the sensitivity was defined as the proportion of malignant breast regions that were recognized by the reader using the respective imaging modality as malignant. Subsequently the point estimates were calculated based on the mean of the sensitivities across all participants. The difference in sensitivity is calculated as CMRM value minus UMRM value, CMRM+XRM value minus UMRM+XRM value, CMRM+XRM value minus XRM value respectively.</description>

        <title>Accuracy Difference of Presence of Bilateral Malignant Disease Verified by SoT by Clinical Investigator, Participant Level</title>
        <description>The disease state âbilateral malignant diseaseâ was derived from the assessment of the different regions for each breast (right and left) for investigators for each imaging modality (UMRM, CMRM, XRM, UMRM+XRM, and CMRM+XRM) based on the following rule: If the participant had at least one breast with no malignant region , the assessment of bilateral malignant disease was categorized as âNoâ. If the participant had at least one malignant lesion in both breasts, the assessment of bilateral malignant disease was categorized as âYesâ. The proportion of correct matches of each different image set to the SoT for the existence of bilateral malignant disease were derived. The analysis was based on the difference in accuracy for the evaluation of bilateral malignant disease for the following image comparisons on a participant level. The difference was calculated as CMRM value minus UMRM value, CMRM+XRM value minus UMRM+XRM value, CMRM+XRM value minus XRM value respectively.</description>

            <description>Patients first received an unenhanced magnetic resonance mammography (MRM), followed by a gadobutrol-enhanced MRM. Gadobutrol was administered at the standard dose of 0.1 mmol/kg body weight (bw) [0.1 ml/kg bw] as an intravenous injection at a rate of 2 ml/sec. Unenhanced MRM (UMRM) and combined unenhanced and contrast (gadobutrol)-enhanced MRM (CMRM) image sets were evaluated in a randomized fashion. After the evaluation of the UMRM or CMRM the respective X-ray mammography (XRM) was added and evaluated together with the UMRM images.</description>
