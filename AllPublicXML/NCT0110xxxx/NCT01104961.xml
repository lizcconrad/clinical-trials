  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to investigate the overall theory that the use of chemically
      preserved solutions associated with contact lenses promotes an increase in bacterial
      infection.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Any patient that is a current contact lens wearer.

          -  Patients with active ocular infection or inflammatory disease, history of herpetic
             keratitis, glaucoma, etc.

          -  Uncontrolled systemic disease or the presence of any significant illness or condition
             that could, in the judgment of the investigator, interfere with interpretation of the
             study results.

          -  Any patient using ocular tears, anti-histamine based ocular therapies, glaucoma
             therapy, vasoconstricting drops, etc.
