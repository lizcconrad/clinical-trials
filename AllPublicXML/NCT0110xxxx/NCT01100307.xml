    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>NEI-VFQ 25, Japanese version v.1.4 for self-administering questionnaires consisted of the base set of 25 questions and 12 subscale scores.
Response categories to each question were converted to a 0 to 100 scale so that the lowest and highest possible scores were set at 0 and 100 points, respectively. A higher score represented better functioning. Questions within each sub-scale were averaged together to create the 12 sub-scale scores. The overall composite score was calculated by averaging the vision-targeted subscale scores excluding the general health-rating question.
Positive change indicated improvement.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in National Eye Institute Visual Function Questionnaire (NEI-VFQ-25) Composite Score/Sub-scale Score at Week 24: Double Masked Phase</title>
        <description>NEI-VFQ 25, Japanese version v.1.4 for self-administering questionnaires consisted of the base set of 25 questions and 12 subscale scores.
Response categories to each question were converted to a 0 to 100 scale so that the lowest and highest possible scores were set at 0 and 100 points, respectively. A higher score represented better functioning. Questions within each sub-scale were averaged together to create the 12 sub-scale scores. The overall composite score was calculated by averaging the vision-targeted subscale scores excluding the general health-rating question.
Positive change indicated improvement.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in The 25-Item National Eye Institute Visual Function Questionnaire (NEI-VFQ-25) Composite Score/Sub-scale Score at Week 54: Open Phase</title>
        <description>NEI-VFQ 25, Japanese version v.1.4 for self-administering questionnaires consisted of the base set of 25 questions and 12 subscale scores.
Response categories to each question were converted to a 0 to 100 scale so that the lowest and highest possible scores were set at 0 and 100 points, respectively. A higher score represented better functioning. Questions within each sub-scale were averaged together to create the 12 sub-scale scores. The overall composite score was calculated by averaging the vision-targeted subscale scores excluding the general health-rating question.
Positive change indicated improvement.</description>
