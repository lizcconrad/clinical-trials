    <textblock>
      The study is an open, single center, observational study at the Cardiology Dept at Uppsala
      University Hospital. The number of patients included will be 410. The objectives are to:

      Evaluate biomarkers and change of these related to myocardial infarction, during two years
      follow-up in an unselected patient population with a recent myocardial infarction.

      Evaluate if an early change of biomarkers can be related to death, new myocardial infarction,
      and ischemic stroke in the same population after two and five years follow-up.

    <measure>Death, myocardial infarction, stroke</measure>
    <time_frame>Five years from study start</time_frame>
    <description>Death: Death will be sub-classified by vascular or non-vascular primary cause. All deaths with unknown/uncertain cause will be categorized as vascular death.
Myocardial Infarction(MI): Rehospitalization due to new non fatal MI or development of significant Q-wave.
Stroke: Diagnosed as abrupt onset of focal neurological deficit persisting more than 24 hours.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Venous thromboembolism, Arterial embolism, Bleeding</measure>
    <time_frame>Five years from study start</time_frame>
    <description>Venous thromboembolism: Deep venous thrombosis has to be diagnosed by ultrasonography or venography. Pulmonary embolism has to be diagnosed by spiral CT scan, pulmonary angiogram or ventilation-perfusion scanning.
Arterial embolism: Diagnosed as an arterial event. Radiological evidence includes imaging studies.
Bleedings: Classified as major or minor using International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis (ISTH). Major bleeds will be diagnosed as fatal and/or symptomatic bleeding in critical area or organ and/or bleeding associated with a decrease in Hb of 20 g/L or more or leading to transfusion.</description>
