  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cisplatin and carboplatin induce ototoxicity manifested as sensorineural hearing loss,
      tinnitus, and/or vestibular disturbances. Ototoxicity is induced via damage to inner ear
      structures by reactive oxygen species. Previous animal studies demonstrated that
      transtympanic injection of Ringer's Lactate (RL) provided near complete otoprotective effect
      against cisplatin. The purpose of this study is to determine if transtympanic administration
      of Ringer's Lactate via a pressure equalising (PE) tube in patients undergoing platinum based
      chemotherapy treatment will prevent tinnitus, vestibular dysfunction and hearing loss
      especially at high frequencies. Pre- and post- chemotherapy treatment audiometry will be
      measured and statistically analysed for significance.

    <description>For each patient, only one ear will receive the Ringer's Lactate solution. The other ear will act as a control. To ensure adequate delivery of the solution to the middle ear, a small pressure equalizing tube will be inserted under local anesthesia before commencement of chemotherapy treatment. The patient will be instructed to administer four drops of RL solution to the experimental ear twice a day during their chemotherapy treatment.</description>
