  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The endothelial dysfunction is the early event in atherosclerosis. The investigator previous
      study showed that impaired endothelial function exist in newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes. The
      investigators hypothesize that intensive multifactorial therapy including intensive blood
      control and intensive hypertension control as well as intensive blood lipids control of 1
      year can improve vascular endothelial function. Moreover, the improvement of endothelial
      function maintains after 5 years or 10 years of intensive multifactorial therapy, called
      &quot;Metabolic Memorial Effect of improvement of endothelial function&quot;.

      -  We select 1000 patients with newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes. They are divided into two
           groups, respectively (Intensive multifactorial therapy and conventional multifactorial
           therapy groups). After those therapy for one year, a 10 years of follow up study will be
           performed. During this period, we take them together intensive education, and take
           conventional multifactorial therapy for both of two groups.

        -  At the beginning (0 year),the end of intensive multifactorial therapy (1 year), 5 years
           and 10 years, we will measure the endothelium-dependent arterial dilation, endothelium
           related cytokines such as ET-1, vWF,as well as blood glucose, HbA1c for all of
           individuals.

        -  We will compare the endothelial function,endothelium related cytokines such as ET-1,
           vWF,as well as blood glucose, HbA1c between intensive therapy group and conventional
           therapy group at different time points.

    <description>Before and after intensive multifactorial therapy (one year intensive therapy, HbAic, fasting blood glucose and postprandial 2 hour glucose reach to the targets),endothelial function is measured. The intensive and conventional groups are taken together, and give the same therapy during the follow up of 10 years. The endothelium-dependent arterial dilation is measured during follow up. The aim is that the improvement of endothelial function induced by intensive therapy will exist after 10 years.</description>
