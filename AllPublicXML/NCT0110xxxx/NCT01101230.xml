  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research is to build the evidence base for approval of FDA health claims
      related to almonds and cardiovascular disease. A randomized, 2-period, crossover controlled
      feeding study was designed to compare the effects of two blood cholesterol lowering diets
      that meet the American Heart Association recommendations. The nutrient profiles of the
      control diet (no almonds/day) and almond diet (1.5 oz. of almonds/day) are matched for
      protein, saturated fat, and cholesterol. The study population consists of two cohorts of 25
      men and women with moderately elevated LDL-C. The investigators hypothesize that a
      cholesterol-lowering diet designed with almonds confers greater cardioprotective effects than
      a cholesterol-lowering diet without almonds on the basis of the LDL-C lowering response,
      effect on LDL particle size, abdominal adiposity and vascular health.
