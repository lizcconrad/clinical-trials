    <textblock>
      Many studies have reported on the beneficial effects of acupuncture for obesity, although
      some negative reports also existed.(Wang F. et al. 2008)Recently conducted systematic review
      of Pittler and Ernst reported that there was insufficient, but not conclusive evidence to
      support the efficacy of acupuncture and acupressure for weight loss. However, most of these
      studies had methodological limitation, such as lack of adequate control group or unclear
      specific effect of electroacupuncture alone because auricular acupuncture was administered as
      well. In this sudy, we had three-arm randomized controlled trial(with sham control group) to
      investigate whether electroacupuncture is effective in the treatment of obesity.

    <description>The Electroacupuncture therapy protocol included a total of 12 acupuncture points at the CV12,CV6, bilateral ST25, SP15, SP14,LI4, LI11, ST36, ST44. All acupuncture points were prepared with 70% alcohol pads, and disposable stainless steel needles were used. Abdominal acupuncture points were inserted horizontally 6~6.5cm in depth and the others were inserted vertically 2~2.5cm in depth until patient can feel De-Qi. All acupuncture points were stimulated electrically with a frequency of 24 Hz an intensity of 0.27-1.3mA(tolerable strength) with continuous stimulation by the pulse generator. The participants were given treatment twice a week for 30 minutes for 5 weeks by practitioner who had had 6 years of acupuncture training and 3 more years of clinical experience.</description>

    <description>The Sham electroacupuncture therapy protocol(Non-acupoint, No electrical stimulation)included the same number and type of needle, duration, frequency of sessions and practitioner as for the EA treatment, but superficially at non acupuncture points 15 mm to the lateral of each acupuncture point was treated. The points were not stimulated electrically, but the sound of the pulse generator was heard by the participants. (Lee SH, LeeBC 2009) Those receiving EA or SEA therapy were treated on alternate days to prevent crosstalk among groups, which could have compromised the blinded study design.</description>
