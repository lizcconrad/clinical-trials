  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Probiotics administration is associated with health benefits on gut barrier integrity and
      immunological functions of the gastrointestinal tract. Recently, probiotics consumption was
      proposed to reduce fat mass and body weight in rodents (Lee HY. et al. 2006; Hamad EM. et al.
      2009) as well as abdominal fat in human (Kadooka Y, 2010). The mechanisms explaining the
      effects of probiotics in weight control are not well understood.

      The primary objective of the clinical trial is to investigate whether a consumption of a
      probiotic formula when compared to an intake of a placebo, is associated with a greater
      reduction of body weight.
