  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the safety and tolerability of RDC-1036 (ALKS 37) in
      adults with opioid-induced constipation (OIC) following repeat dose administration
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Approximately 60 subjects will be enrolled in 1 of 2 cohorts. Following a review of Cohort 1
      safety and tolerability data, subjects will then be enrolled into Cohort 2, to explore
      additional doses. Dose escalation will occur in both cohorts. There will be 18 visits over a
      6-week period.
