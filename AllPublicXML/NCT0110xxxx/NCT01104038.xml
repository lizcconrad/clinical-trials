  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Childhood obesity has increased in prevalence over the past several decades and is predictive
      of adult type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease (CVD). Recent studies of children and
      youth suggest that exercise reduces cardiometabolic risk factors. Minimal data are available,
      however, on the effects of &quot;exergaming&quot; , interactive technology- mediated approaches to
      increasing physical activity in children and youth. This project involves a partnership
      between UMass Boston/GoKids Boston and Children's Hospital Boston featuring an
      interdisciplinary team of researchers and clinicians from pediatric cardiology, nursing,
      prevention and behavioral sciences and exercise physiology and is designed to examine the
      effects of exergaming on moderate or vigorous physical activity (MVPA) indices of adiposity,
      risk factors for cardiometabolic disease and self-competence in Boston Public School
      children. It is hypothesized that participation in the EXCEL/exergaming intervention for 60
      minutes, three times per week for 12 weeks will significantly increase MVPA (as measured by
      accelerometers), pre- to- post intervention and compared to an Advice only (Nutrition
      Education) group.Results of this pilot study will guide and inform a larger study of
      exergaming in children from the Boston Public Schools.

    <description>The primary test of hypothesis is the comparison of change in MVPA between baseline and final visit (12 weeks) in children in the Excel intervention group as compared to children in the Advice-only (Nutrition Education) group.

    <description>Cardiorespiratory fitness and cardiometabolic risk factors will be assessed at baseline and 12 and 18 weeks post-intervention in EXCEL intervention group and in the Advice only (Nutrition Education) group. Between and within group changes in cardiorespiratory fitness and cardiometabolic risk factors will be examined and compared at the 12 week and 18 week data point.</description>
