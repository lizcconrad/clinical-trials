  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multi-center, prospective open label, feasibility study evaluating the safety and
      efficacy of the combined ablation procedure for the treatment of longstanding persistent
      atrial fibrillation.

      The purpose of this feasibility study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the
      epicardial / endocardial combined procedure using the nContact Numeris®-AF Guided Coagulation
      System with VisiTrax® epicardially and the St. Jude Medical Therapy™ Cool Path™ Ablation
      Catheter endocardially to treat longstanding persistent Atrial Fibrillation (AF) patients.
