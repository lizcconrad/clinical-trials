  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single center phase II trial designed to optimize a clinical platform of
      lymphodepleting chemotherapy and T-cell suppression to promote the persistence, function, and
      expansion of allogeneic natural killer (NK) cells in patients with recurrent ovarian,
      fallopian tube, primary peritoneal cancer and advanced metastatic breast cancer.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The donor NK cells are infused on day 0, after a non-myeloablative preparative regimen of
      cyclophosphamide and fludarabine plus a cyclosporine A (CsA) based immunosuppressive therapy.
      Subcutaneous interleukin-2 (IL-2) is started the evening of the NK infusion and continued
      three times a week for 6 doses total.

      Up to 4 sequential immunosuppressive platforms will be tested (Arms 1 and 2 are currently
      closed) to identify a platform where patients have the potential for successful NK cell
      expansion (defined as an absolute circulating donor derived NK cell count of &gt; 100 cells/μl
      14 days after NK cell infusion). Once a clinical platform is determined, the platform will be
      expanded to a total of 18 patients. The primary goal of this extended phase is to obtain
      preliminary efficacy information.

      Follow-up for disease response is for 1 year from the NK cell infusion, with the possibility
      of re-treatment for patients who experience at least a clinical benefit who progress after 6
      months.
