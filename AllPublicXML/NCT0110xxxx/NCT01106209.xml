  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to characterize the time to maturation of neutrophil
      extracellular trap(NET) formation capability in polymorphonuclear leukocytes(PMNs) isolated
      from newborn premature and term infants as well as infants &lt;1 year of age undergoing elective
      surgery. This study will also determine whether NETs contribute to the pathogenesis of
      necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC). We hypothesize that NET formation contributes to the
      pathogenesis of NEC by inappropriately releasing degradative proteins and tissue destructive
      enzymes into the inflammatory milieu of the premature infant gastrointestinal tract following
      bacterial translocation. We also hypothesize that the delay in NEC development in premature
      infants (3rd - 4th week of life) as compared to at-risk term infants (1st week of life)
      results from a developmental delay in PMN ability to form NETs.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Prematurely born infants are at risk for necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC), the most common
      gastrointestinal emergency encountered in the newborn intensive care unit. This disease
      occurs in between 5 - 10% of infants born at less than 30 weeks gestation or less than 1500
      grams birth weight. In these patients, NEC routinely develops during the 3rd or 4th week of
      life. NEC rarely occurs in infants born closer to term; for these patients NEC usually
      develops during the 1st week of life. So far, no one has explained the inverse relationship
      between gestational age at birth and the delay in NEC development.

      Recently, our laboratory described for the first time an inherent deficiency of innate
      immunity in newborn infants - failure of neutrophil extracellular trap formation. Neutrophil
      extracellular traps or NETs are complex lattices of extracellular chromatin and DNA decorated
      with anti-microbial proteins and degradative enzymes which trap and kill microbes. When the
      neutrophils of newborn infants develop the ability to form NETs and whether the maturation of
      NET formation correlates with development of NEC in at risk infants remains unknown.

      We have therefore undertaken the following study best described as a prospective, in vitro
      longitudinal cellular biology study of LPS/PAF-stimulated PMNs isolated from the cord and
      peripheral blood of premature infants at risk for NEC and from term infants not considered at
      risk for NEC. We will also assay for NET formation in gastrointestinal tissue samples
      obtained at the time of surgery for severe NEC in enrolled prematurely born infants. These
      studies are the first of their kind and aim to answer these important questions.
