    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the efficacy of an internet-mediated pedometer based
      intervention that is designed to increase walking and improve function among veterans with
      chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The Specific Aims are: 1) to test the
      effectiveness of an automated internet-mediated walking program for veterans with COPD with a
      primary outcome of improvement in health-related quality of life at four-months and at one
      year in a randomized controlled trial (RCT) with a wait list control. 2) to estimate the
      effect of internet-mediated walking program for veterans with COPD on all cause days of
      hospitalization over one year following randomization. 3) to compare intervention reach,
      participation and satisfaction outcomes between rural and urban veterans among those
      randomized to the intervention arm. The long-term objective of this research is to develop,
      evaluate and disseminate effective, low-cost interventions that improve quality of life for
      veterans, particularly rural veterans, managing complex chronic conditions.

      Background:

      Low levels of physical activity are common in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary
      disease (COPD), and a sedentary lifestyle is associated with poor outcomes including
      increased mortality, frequent hospitalizations, and poor health-related quality of life.
      Individuals with COPD who undergo a facility-based, exercise-focused pulmonary rehabilitation
      program experience significant improvements in health related quality of life, dyspnea, and
      exercise tolerance as well as reduced rates of hospitalization. Unfortunately, only a small
      percent of individuals with COPD who could benefit from pulmonary rehabilitation have access
      to and participate in such programs. Moreover, the benefits of short-term pulmonary
      rehabilitation programs tend to diminish rapidly after the program ends. Rural veterans are
      less likely to have access to facility-based pulmonary rehabilitation than urban veterans.
      Health related quality of life in rural veterans with COPD is significantly worse than for
      veterans with COPD who live in urban areas.

      Objectives:

      The primary objective of this study was to assess the efficacy of an Internet-mediated,
      pedometer-based intervention designed to increase walking and health related quality of life
      for Veterans with COPD. The specific aims of this randomized controlled trial (RCT) with a
      wait list control were: 1) To test the effectiveness of an automated internet-mediated
      walking program for veterans with COPD with a primary outcome of improvement in health
      related quality of life at four months and at one year; 2) to estimate the effect of the
      internet-mediated walking program for veterans with COPD on all cause days of hospitalization
      over one year following randomization; and 3) to compare intervention reach, participation
      and satisfaction outcomes between rural and urban veterans among those randomized to the
      intervention arm.

      Methods:

      Participants were followed for 12 months to investigate the efficacy of the intervention in
      assisting patients with initiating and maintaining a regular walking program and improving
      health related quality of life. Eligible and consented patients wore a pedometer to obtain
      one week of baseline data and then were randomized on a 2:1 ratio to Taking Healthy Steps or
      to a wait list control. The intervention arm received iterative step-count feedback;
      individualized step-count goals, motivational and informational messages, and access to an
      online community. Wait list controls were notified that they were enrolled, but that their
      intervention would start in one year; however, they kept the pedometer and had access to a
      static webpage. Both groups completed on-line survey assessments at baseline, 4, and 12
      months, and were asked to report adverse events on a regular basis. The primary outcome was
      changes in health related quality of life, as measured using the St George's Respiratory
      Questionnaire (SGRQ), a disease-specific instrument in patients with COPD. Secondary outcomes
      included days of hospitalization during the one-year intervention period, changes in average
      daily steps as measured using the study pedometer, self-reported dyspnea, intervention reach,
      and adverse event rates. The analysis was conducted based [on the original randomized
      treatment assignment regardless of participation (an intent-to-treat analysis) and included
      both a complete case analysis as well as an all case analysis using a linear mixed-effects
      model. Between-group differences in change scores (4 months or 12 months) were estimated
      after adjusting for baseline values of the outcome variables.

      Status:

      This study is completed. Data analysis and manuscript preparation continue.

For example, &quot;0 - I only get breathless with strenuous exercise.&quot; and &quot;4 - I am too breathless to leave the house or I am breathless when dressing.&quot;)</description>
          <population>One Intervention participant was dropped from analysis due to being an extreme outlier. Nine Control and seventeen Intervention participants were missing data at 12 months.</population>
