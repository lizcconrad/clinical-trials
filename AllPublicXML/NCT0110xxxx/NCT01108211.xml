  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective randomized controlled trial investigating the effect of vibration
      therapy on bone mineral density (BMD) and bone quality in AIS subjects suffering from
      osteopenia (low bone mass).

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Scoliosis is a three-dimensional spinal deformity and AIS is the commonest with a high
      prevalence of 2-4 % in the general population. As many as 30% of AIS subjects also suffer
      from osteopenia which can persist and result in serious health problems later in life
      including vertebral collapse, fragility fractures, decreased quality of life and even
      mortality. In spite of this, a safe, effective and evidence-based treatment protocol for
      AIS-related osteopenia is not available. It remains uncertain how effective dietary advices,
      physical activity, Calcium and Vitamin D supplements are in this regard. On the other hand,
      low-magnitude high-frequency vibration therapy was shown to be effective in increasing bone
      mass both in animal models and in clinical trials involving elderly subjects. AIS-related
      osteopenia may have a different clinical behaviour. In addition, the in-vivo effect on bone
      quality has never been studied. We plan to carry out a scientific clinical study on the
      effect of vibration therapy on skeletally mature female AIS subjects with osteopenia. They
      are randomly allocated to either the treatment or the control group. BMD, bone
      micro-architectures are assessed to delineate whether vibration therapy has any therapeutic
      effect on improving low bone mass in osteopenic AIS subjects.
