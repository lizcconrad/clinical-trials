  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to learn more about how the body stores fat in and around organs
      (ex. the liver) and why this affects some people's health more than others. Understanding
      this may lead to better treatments for diseases such as diabetes and cardiovascular disease.

      The purpose of this study is to determine the specific cellular and organ system metabolic
      and immunologic alterations that are associated with insulin resistance and inflammation in
      order to identify putative mechanisms and novel bio-markers involved in the pathogenesis and
      progression of inflammatory and cardiometabolic diseases.

        The study population will consist of subjects of all races and ethnic groups with an equal
        number of men and women. Participants will be recruited by reviewing our database of
        research subjects containing thousands of lean and obese research study volunteers and by
        St. Louis metro area postings.
