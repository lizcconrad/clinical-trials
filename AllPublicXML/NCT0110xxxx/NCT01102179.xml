  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Vitamin D insufficiency and deficiency is common in chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients and
      is associated with elevated parathyroid hormone (PTH) concentration and mineral and bone
      disorder (MBD). There is also increasing evidence to show that these abnormalities increase
      cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in CKD patients. There is a need for early
      identification of vitamin D insufficiency/deficiency in CKD patients to prevent its long-term
      complications. However, the vitamin D status of CKD patients in Singapore has not been well
      described. The purpose of this study is to assess the vitamin D status of predialysis CKD
      patients in a tertiary academic teaching hospital in Singapore, and its association with
      parameters for MBD. Predialysis patients from the outpatient renal clinic at the National
      University Hospital (NUH) will be recruited into this study. Blood samples from the patients
      will be collected after an overnight fast to determine their serum 25(OH)D, creatinine,
      phosphorus, calcium, albumin and i-PTH concentrations. These parameters will be compared
      among patients in various stages of CKD.
