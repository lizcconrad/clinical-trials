          -  Age 18 years to 80 years.

          -  Subject with a non-ruptured saccular, or fusiform intracranial aneurysm arising from a
             parent vessel with a diameter of &gt; 2mm and &lt; 6mm.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Pregnancy

          -  Enrollment in another trial

          -  Allergy or contraindication to aspirin, clopidogrel, heparin, local or general
             anesthesia

          -  History of life threatening allergy to contrast dye.

          -  Major surgery within previous 30 days or planned in the next 90 days after enrollment
             date.

          -  Severe neurological deficit that renders the patient incapable of living independently

          -  Dementia or psychiatric problem that prevents the patient from completing required
             follow up

          -  Co-morbid conditions that may limit survival to less than one year

          -  Subject with anatomy not appropriate for endovascular treatment due to severe
             intracranial vessel tortuosity or stenosis, or intracranial vasospasm not responsive
             to medical therapy.

          -  Subject with an intracranial mass (tumor (except meningioma), abscess, or other
             infection), or is undergoing radiation therapy for carcinoma or sarcoma of the head or
             neck region.

          -  Subject has a history of bleeding diathesis or coagulopathy, international normalized
             ratio (INR) greater than 1.5, or will refuse blood transfusions.

          -  Subject has a serum creatinine level greater than 2.0 mg/dL (within 7 days of
             procedure) which the investigator determines restricts the use of contrast agents.

          -  Subject has a previously implanted intracranial stent associated with the symptomatic
             distribution within the past 12 weeks prior to enrollment date

          -  Stenting, angioplasty, or endarterectomy of an extracranial (carotid or vertebral
             artery) or intracranial artery within 30 days prior to enrollment date

          -  Subject has a previously implanted carotid stent associated with the symptomatic
             distribution within the past 12 weeks prior to enrollment date

          -  Subject has uncontrolled atrial fibrillation or known cardiac disorders likely to be
             associated with cardioembolic symptoms.

          -  Subject had a subarachnoid hemorrhage within 12 weeks prior to the enrollment date.

          -  Subject with resistance to ASA and/or Clopidogrel.

          -  Subject with two or more aneurysms in associated distribution - unless the device is
             used to treat both aneurysms.

          -  Subject has a non-treated arteriovenous malformation (AVM) in the territory of the
             target aneurysm.

          -  Target aneurysm is expected to require more than one device.
