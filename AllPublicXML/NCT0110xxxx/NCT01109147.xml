    <textblock>
      After an initial screening visit, including an assessment of psychiatric disorders, patients
      stabilized on antipsychotic medication (aripiprazole or risperidone) for at least 6 weeks and
      control subjects will undergo an assessment using functional magnetic resonance imaging
      (fMRI) of the differences of patterns of brain activation during an emotional task

      This study is: interventional, comparative, open label, multi center, without experimental
      treatment.

      Main objective: To evaluate the effect of aripiprazole and risperidone on brain activation
      during an emotional task of matching patients with schizophrenia, and in reference to control
      subjects.

      Secondary Objective: Comparison of emotional subjective and physiological perception in
      patients with schizophrenia in relation with their treatment. Comparison of brain activation
      in patients during the emotional induction task based on symptomatic dimensions, personality
      traits and performance on cognitive and attentional tests, and for insight capacity .
      Comparison of transcript level of candidate genes in blood mononuclear cells between the
      study groups and study the interactions between the observed differences in brain imaging and
      different levels of transcription of these genes.

    <time_frame>3 days after the decision of inclusion</time_frame>
    <description>During the fMRI session, the activation of each brain circuits is measured by a &quot;Bold signal&quot; (an arbitrary measure of contrast: numbers of voxels highlighted/activated in the region of interest).
The emotional task is composed by congruent and incongruent images. Three effects were caused by the task: congruence, attention and valence effects. Each of them affect, involve and activate the regions of interests differentially within the differents arms.
The region of interests who were mainly observed are: Anterior Cingulate Cortex (ACC), Prefrontal dorso-lateral Cortex (PFdlC) and the Amygdala (A).</description>

        <title>Identification of Brain Circuits Involved in a Task of Emotional Congruence (With fMRI)</title>
        <description>During the fMRI session, the activation of each brain circuits is measured by a &quot;Bold signal&quot; (an arbitrary measure of contrast: numbers of voxels highlighted/activated in the region of interest).
The emotional task is composed by congruent and incongruent images. Three effects were caused by the task: congruence, attention and valence effects. Each of them affect, involve and activate the regions of interests differentially within the differents arms.
The region of interests who were mainly observed are: Anterior Cingulate Cortex (ACC), Prefrontal dorso-lateral Cortex (PFdlC) and the Amygdala (A).</description>
