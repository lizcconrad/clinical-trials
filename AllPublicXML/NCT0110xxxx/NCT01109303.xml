  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Ankle fracture is frequent and its number is increasing. In Canada, surgical treatment of
      these lesions is advised and the options currently used all have in common a rigid fixation
      of the syndesmosis which results in residual stiffness and a high level of secondary surgery,
      mostly to remove the implant.

      The purpose of the study is to compare the treatment of ankle syndesmotic rupture by a
      dynamic fixation to a static fixation suggesting that the dynamic fixation method will
      improve the Olerud-Molander functional score of more than 15 points at the 3 months
      follow-up.

    <measure>Olerud-Molander score</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months after surgery</time_frame>
    <description>The Olerud-Molander scoring scale was chosen because it adequately represents the ankle performance following surgery (trauma or elective basis). It comprises nine functional parameters which are concerned with primary complaints, the ability to perform simple tasks and the everyday life activities.</description>
