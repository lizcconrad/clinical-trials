    <textblock>
      When a patient presents with a thyroid mass, part of the work-up may include a fine needle
      aspiration biopsy (FNAB). The results of the biopsy then help plan treatment. If the results
      are benign, the management will typically be to follow the nodule. If the results demonstrate
      or are suspicious for cancer, such as papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC), the treatment is a
      total thyroidectomy (total thyroid removal). The latest American thyroid association
      guidelines for PTC (2009) suggest that in many instances a central lymph node dissection
      (CLND) should be performed in conjunction with the total thyroidectomy. This procedure
      consists of removing the lymphatic (glandular) tissues surrounding the thyroid itself, as
      this tissue may have a propensity for cancer spread. The procedure's necessity has met much
      controversy in the last decade, but is becoming more of a standard in thyroid cancer surgery.

      When a thyroid nodule FNAB is reported as indeterminate, the treatment strategy is less clear
      cut. While a diagnostic hemi-thyroidectomy or therapeutic total thyroidectomy may be in
      order, the inclusion of CLND is not clearly defined. In many centers a CLND will be omitted
      with surgical management for an &quot;indeterminate&quot; lesion, while in others, it is standard
      protocol. The argument of performing CLND is largely based on the tenet that it adds little
      surgical time, cost or risks to the patient. Because the evidence of the prognostic role of
      lymph node metastases is limited many would argue that the risk of not performing CLND is
      greater than performing CLND. Furthermore, in the event of finding cancer on final pathology,
      and thus, having to re-operate in the thyroid/central compartment bed, post-operative
      complications may increase. Opponents of CLND argue that there is a paucity of strong
      evidence supporting CLND in the improvement of oncologic outcomes and can potentially
      increase post-operative low calcium levels or vocal nerve damage However, these
      recommendations are based on retrospective level III evidence. Thus the debate continues: is
      CLND justified as an adjunct to hemi-or total thyroidectomy in indeterminate thyroid
      pathology?

      The hypothesis is: CLND in hem- or total thyroidectomy for &quot;indeterminate&quot; thyroid nodules
      will not increase post-operative complications.
