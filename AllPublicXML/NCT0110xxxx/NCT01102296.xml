  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Male homosexuals are at risk for hepatitis A virus (HAV) infection, and HAV vaccination has
      been recommended to prevent HAV infection in male homosexuals. HIV infection may impair
      serological responses to HAV vaccination in HIV-infected patients. The investigators
      hypothesize that 3 doses of HAV vaccine will improve serological responses to HAV vaccine in
      HIV-infected patients.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In this study, we aim to compare the serological responses to HAV vaccination between
      HIV-infected patients who receive 2 doses or 3 doses of HAV vaccine and HIV-uninfected
      persons who receive 2 doses of HAV vaccine. Persons who identify themselves as male
      homosexuals aged younger than 40 years and are seronegative for hepatitis A virus will be
      enrolled. HAV vaccination will be provided free-of-charge. HIV-uninfected persons will
      receive 2 doses of HAV vaccine that will be administered at baseline and 6 months after the
      first dose, while HIV-infected patients will be given 2 doses or 3 doses of HAV vaccine; for
      those who choose to receive 3 doses, a second dose will be given 1 month after the first
      dose. A longitudinal follow-up of serological responses will be conducted to assess the
      effectiveness of HAV vaccination; HAV IgG will be determined at 6 months after the first dose
      of HAV vaccination(before the administration of the second dose), 12 months and 18 months
      after the first dose of HAV vaccination .
