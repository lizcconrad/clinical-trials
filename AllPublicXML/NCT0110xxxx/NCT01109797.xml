    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to compare two interventions for preparing diabetic teens and
      young adults for transition from pediatric to adult diabetes care.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      One will represent a short-term intensive social-behavioral intervention supported by
      peer-to-peer social networking in which subjects receive &quot;usual care&quot; from their current
      diabetes provider outside the parameters of the study. The second intervention will be a
      traditional transition clinic model, where subjects will receive the standard of diabetes
      care from a team of combined pediatric and adult practitioners and educators, with added
      educational modules and behavioral evaluation and support designed to facilitate the
      transition to adult care (i.e., that foster &quot;developmentally tailored care&quot;). The first is a
      much less intensive intervention from the standpoint of the providers and gives special
      prominence to peer support; the second is provider-intensive. The goal of both interventions
      is to improve self-efficacy (confidence in taking ownership of and managing one's diabetes);
      i.e., to prepare the patient to move from primary support by family and providers to a
      reliance on self-ownership and self-management as a responsible, independent adult.

      Optional sub-study available for parents, spouses, and significant others.

    <description>If you are assigned to the first group, you will have two all-day Saturday sessions four weeks apart on the KU campus in Lawrence. The objectives of the Saturday programs are to promote positive behavior change with respect to &quot;taking ownership&quot; of diabetes and its demands by providing transition-specific information, enabling participants to practice the life skills needed to successfully manage diabetes as an adult, and fostering peer-to-peer social networking over the 6-month period of the intervention (and beyond). You will continue to see your current provider of diabetes care outside of the parameters of this study.</description>

    <description>Patients who participate in the transition clinic arm of the study will be seen six times during a six-month time period, as well as receive psychological assessment and intervention, as necessary, prior to the first clinic visit (intake) and as part of visits 2 and 4. Three of the six visits will be standard of care medical visits with either a pediatric or adult provider or both. Three will be individual or group education sessions with diabetes educators focused on transition issues such as, managing the adult health care system, talking with your care provider,and dealing with adult issues (pregnancy, genetic concerns, etc).</description>
