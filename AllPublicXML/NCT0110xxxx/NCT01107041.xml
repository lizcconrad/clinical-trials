      Investigators are evaluating the use of phone sensor data to estimate behavior, depression
      and anxiety. Participants will include people who are high on depression, high on anxiety,
      hight on both depression and anxiety, and health controls. Particpants will load software on
      their phones that collects phone sensor data, and obtains self report on sleep, mood, and
      social contacts. Data will be collected for at least 6 weeks.
