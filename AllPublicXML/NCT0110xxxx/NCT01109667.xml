      The aim of this study is to assess the effect of Innovin速 reagent on laboratory results when
      compared with the Thromborel速 S.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Thromboplastins are the screening tests which are used in the diagnosis of acquired or
      inherited disorders of the coagulation system but still, alterations between various
      thromboplastin preparations in the measurements remains a problem.Blood samples are going to
      drawn from patients receiving and not receiving oral anticoagulant therapy (OAT) during their
      routine laboratory tests. Samples are subjected to analysis by using Thromborel速 S and
      Innovin速 reagents. Mean International Normalized Ratio (INR), prothrombin time and fibrinogen
      values are going to compared. To further study the importance of this phenomenon the cohort
      will be divided into three subgroups according to the INR values as Group I: Patients not
      receiving OAT, Group II: Patients under OAT and INR values in good therapeutic range and
      Group III: Patients under OAT and INR values over the therapeutic range.
