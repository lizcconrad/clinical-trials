  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In men, urinary incontinence (UI) is relatively uncommon, and usually associated with some
      forms of prostate surgery. Thus, one of the risks of surgery for benign prostate hyperplasia
      (BPH) is postoperative UI. The guidelines of the American Urological Association for BPH
      treatment indicate that UI (2~5%) is relevant complications after transurethral prostatectomy
      (TURP). Rassweiler et al., based on a review of publications stated that early UI may occur
      in up to 30-40% of patients after TURP. Rigatti et al. reported that early postoperative
      urgency UI occurred in 38.6% (TURP) and 44% (holmium laser enucleation of the prostate;
      HoLEP) of surgically treated patients at 1-month after the surgery. Recently, the follow-up
      data for patients treated with HoLEP showed that transient stress UI developed in up to 44%
      after HoLEP. Although this alternative surgical treatment such as HoLEP can be performed
      safely with minimal complications, patients often face debilitating UI during the
      postoperative period before any improvement in micturition parameters occurs. Although this
      symptom ameliorates within a relatively short time, it usually cause significant stress and
      anxiety to the patient as far as their durations is concerned. In addition to its economic
      cost, UI is a distressing condition that has major impacts on a patient's quality of life.
      Social withdrawal, isolation, and depression occur in some patients.

      Because this problem is usually temporary, there has been little attempt at addressing the
      issue. Therefore, there has been no research devoted specifically to transient de novo UI
      associated with HoLEP.

      1. The aim of the present study was following:

        1. to investigate the incidence of transient de novo UI after HoLEP for BPH

        2. determine the predictors of early postoperative transient de novo UI.
