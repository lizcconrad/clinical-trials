  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      RebiSmart™ is a device with an electronic injection log to monitoring adherence to therapy.
      Therefore RebiSmart is a tool for administering Rebif in multi-dose cartridges that may
      improve patient satisfaction and adherence to therapy. The objectives of this study are to
      evaluate adherence, effectiveness and convenience of treatment in subjects with relapsing
      multiple sclerosis (RMS) using RebiSmart to self-inject Rebif in a multi-dose cartridge.

    <textblock>
      This is an observational, international, multicenter study planned to be conducted in RMS
      subjects using the RebiSmart auto-injector at 300 sites in 15 countries across Europe. The
      participating countries are Austria, Belgium, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, France,
      Germany, Hungary, Lithuania, Portugal, Slovakia, Sweden, Switzerland, the Netherlands and the
      United Kingdom. Subjects with RMS naïve to treatment or currently being treated with Rebif
      multi-dose injected by RebiSmart for no more than 6 weeks and meeting the eligibility
      criteria will receive Rebif 22 or 44 mcg subcutaneously three time a week. The dose of Rebif
      will be titrated during the initial four weeks of treatment. The planned observational period
      per subject is 12 months. The study visits comprises of: Baseline or Day 1 (Visit 1), Month 6
      (Visit 2), and Month 12 (Visit 3).

      OBJECTIVES

      Primary objective:

        -  To assess adherence to treatment in subjects with RMS using RebiSmart to self-inject
           Rebif in a multi-dose cartridge

      Secondary objectives:

        -  To assess effectiveness and convenience of treatment in subjects with RMS using
           RebiSmart to self-inject Rebif in a multi-dose cartridge.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Males and female subjects between 18-65 years of age (only in Germany: Males and
             females between 12 - 65 years of age in order to follow national medical society
             guidelines)

          -  Female subjects must be neither pregnant nor breast-feeding and must lack
             child-bearing potential as defined by either: a) Post-menopausal or surgically
             sterile, or b) Using a highly effective method of contraception for the duration of
             the study. This is defined as a method that results in a low failure rate (i.e., less
             than 1% per year) when used consistently and correctly, and includes for instance
             implants, injectables, combined oral contraceptives, intra-uterine device (IUD),
             sexual abstinence or vasectomised partner

          -  Subjects diagnosed with Relapsing MS according to the revised McDonald Criteria (2005)

          -  MS-treatment naïve subjects or subjects treated with Rebif multi-dose injected by
             RebiSmart for no longer than 6 weeks prior to Baseline visit

          -  Subjects that are able to self-inject with RebiSmart (in the opinion of the physician)

             combination therapy) with the exception of Rebif multi-dose injected by RebiSmart

          -  Any visual or physical impairment that precludes the subject from self-injecting the
             treatment using the RebiSmart

          -  Pregnancy and breast-feeding

          -  Serious or acute heart disease such as uncontrolled cardiac dysrhythmias, uncontrolled
