    <textblock>
      A combination therapy of Docetaxel, Cisplatin und 5-Fluorouracil (= TPF) will be used in
      patients with resectable oropharyngeal and cavity of the mouth cancer. To improve the
      compatibility of the TPF-induction without decreasing the efficacy the dose will be given on
      day 1 and 8 instead of applying the whole dose on day 1 every 3 weeks.

      In the phase I-part of the trial the optimal therapeutic dose of Docetaxel and Cisplatin will
      be defined.

      In the phase II-part the progression-free survival after 2 years will be assessed in patients
      treated with the optimal therapeutic dose.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Local advanced Oropharyngeal and cavity of the mouth Cancer are often treated with a
      combination of surgery and/or radiation and /or chemotherapy.

      Despite of therapy improvement there are only little advances in progression-free survival
      and overall survival.

      Therefore new therapy concepts are needed. The advantage of the induction chemotherapy is the
      possibility of tumor response assessment during chemotherapy and may present a selection
      criterion for organ preservation.

      In order to minimize the time between chemotherapy and surgery it is important to have an
      early answer for the tumor response. In this study response will be assessed after the first
      cycle of chemotherapy. Patients showing no tumor response will be operated at once. The other
      patients will receive further cycles of chemotherapy.

      Toxicity of the induction chemotherapy have to be moderate because surgery should not be
      delayed.

      To improve the tolerance of induction therapy the medication dose isn't given on day 1 every
      3 weeks, but is dispersed on day 1 and day 8, q3weeks.
