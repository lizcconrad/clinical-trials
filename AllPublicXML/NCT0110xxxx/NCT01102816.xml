      The purpose of this study is to determine the feasibility, effectiveness and safety of
      acupuncture for pain management in hemodialysis patients.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Pain is one of the most common symptoms experienced by end-stage renal disease (ESRD)
      patients, which subsequently debilitates patient's quality of life. Although reducing pain is
      crucial to successful patient care in hemodialysis population, symptoms are often
      undertreated.Conventional pharmacological approaches are limited in dialysis population ,
      given their altered pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamic profiles and increased potential for
      adverse reactions. Acupuncture has been known to be beneficial in various chronic pain
      condition. As a non-pharmacologic intervention, it might be valuable for pain management in
      hemodialysis patients whose analgesic use are limited due to altered pharmacokinetics.
      However, little is known for the benefits of acupuncture for pain management in dialysis
      population. This study aims to determine whether acupuncture is a feasible, effective and
      safe therapeutic intervention for pain management in hemodialysis patients.

    <description>Individualized acupuncture treatment which focuses on each patient's symptoms and conditions will be provided twice a week for 6 weeks on a non-dialysis access day or before hemodialysis at dialysis-access day. 10-20 acupuncture needles will be inserted on the body except the arteriovenous fistula-located arm(s). Electrical stimulation of acupuncture will be conducted on 4 needles and the remained needles will be manipulated manually to elicit de-qi sensation. Needle retention time will be 20 minutes.
Routine care provided by dialysis staffs, primary physicians and other healthcare providers will be maintained.
Patients who received acupuncture treatment will be interviewed to explore patient's perceptions and experiences of acupuncture for their pain management. (Nested-qualitative study)</description>

    <description>Patients in this group will maintain routine care provided by their dialysis staffs, primary physicians or other healthcare providers for symptomatic care and disease management of end-stage renal disease through 6 weeks. After post-treatment evaluation, acupuncture treatment will be provided to patients who want to receive acupuncture treatment.</description>
