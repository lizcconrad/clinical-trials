  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators hypothesize that aberrant hypermethylation of tumour suppressor genes is an
      important mechanism for Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV) - related gastric carcinogenesis, the
      promoter hypermethylation status and the expression of S100A2 and TFF1 might be different
      between EBV-associated gastric cancer (GC) and non EBV-associated GC.

        200 gastric tumour and normal tissue samples, as well as up to 50 non-neoplastic gastric
        tissues samples from individuals without gastric cancer (treated for other reasons, such as
        gastric ulcers) will be obtained from the tissue archives of the NUH Department of
        Pathology. These samples were selected because relevant clinical information of these
        samples are available from gastric database and will allow us to perform association
        studies.
