  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this clinical study is to determine whether the inhibition of
      cytochrome P450 (CYP) isozyme CYP2C8 by XL184 observed in in vitro preclinical studies
      translates into the potential for clinically significant drug-drug interactions in humans.
      The study will measure the effect of once daily dosing of XL184 on the pharmacokinetics (PK)
      of rosiglitazone. The PK of XL184 when combined with rosiglitazone will be evaluated as well.

      A specific objective of this study is to determine whether the interaction between XL184 and
      a drug such as rosiglitazone is sufficiently large enough to necessitate a dosage adjustment
      when used in combination with XL184, or whether the interaction would require additional
      therapeutic monitoring.

      Rosiglitazone, commonly known as Avandia, is a prescription medicine approved by the FDA used
      to treat adults with Type 2 (adult-onset or non-insulin dependent) diabetes mellitus (high
      blood sugar). In this study, subjects will only take 2 doses of rosiglitazone. There is no
      intention of therapy as a result of taking rosiglitazone in this study.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Diagnosis of a solid tumor that is metastatic or unresectable and is refractory to or
             progressed (or relapsed) following standard therapies, or a disease for which no
             standard therapy exists. Initial enrollment will be limited to differentiated thyroid
             cancer and renal cell carcinoma. Additional criteria will apply.

          -  One lesion that is not within a previously radiated field and is measurable on
             computerized tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan.

          -  Body mass index (BMI) between 18 and 33 kg/m2.
