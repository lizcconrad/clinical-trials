  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a Ph I trial to test the safety of the study drug, hLL1-DOX at different dose
      levels in patients with recurrent multiple myeloma. HLL1 is also known as milatuzumab and is
      attached to doxorubicin in this clinical trial.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In this clinical research trial, hLL1-DOX will be administered on days 1, 4, 8 and 11. This
      treatment cycle will be repeated every 3 weeks as long as patients continue to tolerate it,
      for a maximum of 8 treatment cycles (approximately 6 months).

    <time_frame>Safety is measured during the treatment period and for a minimum of 12 weeks after the treatment period for a maximum of 2 years.</time_frame>
    <description>Safety evaluations include monitoring for infusion reactions or other acute adverse events, cardiac assessments (EKG, troponin T, BNP, MUGA scan or 2D-ECHO), vital signs, physical examination, routine safety laboratories (hematology, serum chemistries, urinalysis), serum immunoglobulins, and B- and T-cell levels, with immunogenicity analyzed by the Sponsor from human anti-milatuzumab antibody serum titers (HAHA). Antibody pharmacokinetics will be evaluated by hLL1-DOX serum levels analyzed by the Sponsor.</description>
