  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, randomized, multi-center study recruiting patients with an in-stent
      restenosis in the superficial femoral artery. The safety and efficacity of the Viabahn
      endoprosthesis (W.L. Gore &amp; Associates), a heparin-bonded endoprosthesis, is compared with
      plain old balloon angioplasty (POBA). In 4 Belgian and 2 German centers a total of 80
      Patients will be recruited. Primary endpoint is primary patency at 12 months, defined as no
      evidence of restenosis or occlusion within the originally treated lesion based on color-flow
      duplex ultrasound (CFDU) measuring a peak systolic velocity ratio ≤2.5, and without target
      lesion revascularization (TLR) within 12 months.

      In comparison to POBA, it is expected that the use of the Viabahn endoprosthesis (W.L. Gore &amp;
      Associates) will result in greater 12 month primary patency of treated superficial femoral
      artery in-stent restenotic lesions.
