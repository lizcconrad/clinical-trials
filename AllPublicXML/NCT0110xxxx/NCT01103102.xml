      The purpose of this study is to explore the dose-response relationship of Iocide oral rinse
      in a clinical trial of gingivitis.

      Approximately sixty (60) otherwise healthy subjects having gingivitis will be randomized into
      the 3-month study to provide 40 total evaluable subjects (10 per group). Each study
      participant will have four visits: a screening visit up to 21 days before the beginning of
      the trial, a baseline visit at day 1, and visits at weeks 8 and 12. The duration of the
      dose/range study will be three months to facilitate compliance and ensure timely completion
      of the Phase II study.

      Three dose/regimens will be evaluated against a placebo control oral rinse. Indices for
      gingivitis, plaque and bleeding will be scored and blood tests will be performed to determine
      the effect of the antimicrobial oral rinse on relative levels of biological markers of
      inflammation.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Males or non-pregnant females of at least 18 years of age, and in good general health,
             as determined by Investigator;

          -  Have at least 16 natural, gradable teeth and good dental health, as determined by
             Investigator;

          -  Have &gt; 25% sites with Gingival Index (GI) scores &gt; 2;

          -  Have average Plaque Index (PI) score &gt; 2;

          -  Use of effective method of contraception for the duration of the study or permanently
             sterilized;

          -  Able and willing to comply with study requirements including following instructions on
             study treatment and returning for follow-up visits as required by the protocol;

          -  Have full understanding of all elements of, and signature and dating of the written
             informed consent prior to the initiation of protocol specified procedures;

          -  Females with childbearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test before and
             during the study period. Sexually active females must be using an effective form of
             birth control or abstinence. These methods include oral contraceptives (&quot;the pill&quot;),
             an intrauterine device (IUD), levonogestrel implants (Norplant®), medroxyprogesterone
             acetate injections (Depo-provera®) or contraceptive foam with a condom.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  History, or current evidence, of any significant acute or chronic subject-reported
             medical or psychiatric condition that, in the opinion of the Investigator, would
             render examination difficult or invalid or prevent the subject from active study
             participation;

          -  ≤24% of sites with GI score &gt;2;

          -  TPOab positive &gt;34;

          -  Gross oral pathology (periodontal disease, rampant caries, tissue damage created by
             poor oral care or treatment, soft or hard tissue tumors) that, in the opinion of the
             Investigator, could influence the outcome of the study;

             &gt;5mm on six (6) sites per tooth (distofacial, facial, mesiofacial, mesiolingual,
             lingual and distolingual). A UNC-15 periodontal probe (Hu-Friedy) will be used for all
             measurements. Any subject with true periodontal pockets &gt; 5 mm will be excluded from
             participation in this study;

          -  Current signs or symptoms of mucosal tissue ulcerations or inflammation, or canker
             sores;

          -  Presence of orthodontic appliances or any removable appliance that impinges on the
             oral tissues being assessed;

          -  History of early onset periodontal disease or acute necrotizing ulcerative gingivitis;

          -  Subject reported history in past 6 months or current alcohol abuse that, in the
             opinion of the Investigator, could influence the outcome of the study;

          -  Subject reported history of last past 6 months or current drug abuse;

          -  Use of concomitant medication that, in the opinion of the Investigator, might
             interfere with the outcome of the study (e.g. antibiotics, immuno-suppressants,
             steroids, or therapeutic doses of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents, phenytoin,
             calcium antagonists, cyclosporine or coumadin);

          -  Concomitant therapy with another investigational drug or device without prior approval
             from the Sponsor within four weeks prior to Visit 2 (Study Day 1);

             (6) months;

          -  Females with childbearing potential with a positive pregnancy test, pregnant or
             nursing mothers, suspected pregnancy, or intention to become pregnant during the
             study;

          -  Residence in the same household as a subject already enrolled in the study (inclusion
             may create blinding and/or compliance issues);
