  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study will be conducted in asymptomatic pregnant women with P. falciparum parasitemia.
      The subjects will be given 3 day dosing regiment of the fixed-dose combination of
      Azithromycin and Chloroquine. Parasitological clearance rate with polymerase chain reaction
      data will be evaluated on Day 28 as primary endpoint.

      After interim analysis of efficacy data by an External Data Monitoring Committee, this study
      was terminated. Investigators were notified on 22 Aug 2013. There were no safety concerns
      that led to this termination.

          -  Use of antimalarial drugs in previous 4 weeks.

          -  History of convulsions, hypertension, diabetes or any other chronic illness that may
             adversely affect fetal growth and viability.

          -  Known allergy to the study drugs (AZ, CQ, and SP) or to any macrolides or
             sulphonamides.

          -  Requirement to use medication during the study that might interfere with the

             package inserts.

          -  Severe acute or chronic medical or psychiatric condition or laboratory abnormality
             that may increase the risk associated with study participation or investigational
             product administration or may interfere with the interpretation of study results and,
             in the judgment of the investigator, would make the subject inappropriate for entry
             into this study.

          -  Evidence of current obstetric complications that may adversely impact the pregnancy
             and/or fetal outcomes, including presence of congenital anomalies, placenta previa or
             abruption.

          -  Known severe sickle cell (SS) disease or sickle hemoglobin C (SC) anemia.

          -  Known family history of prolonged QT syndrome, serious ventricular arrhythmia, or
             sudden cardiac death.
