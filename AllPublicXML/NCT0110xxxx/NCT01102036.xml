      digestive discomfort during 2 weeks of treatment in comparison to placebo in healthy women
      and men.

      Transit time is the time it takes for a substance to pass through the gut. The major part of
      the transit is spent in the large bowel is therefore mainly a colonic event. It has been
      observed that slow transit time is associated with high prevalence of large bowel disorders.
      The objectives of this study is to:

        -  determine the effect on mean transit time after 2 weeks intake of a investigational
           products using radio-opaque sulphate impregnated polyethylene pellets as markers.

        -  determine effect of investigational products on total symptom score according to Bristol
           Stool Form (BSF)

        -  determine effect of investigational products in gastrointestinal symptoms

        -  determine safety of intake of the investigational products

    <description>To determine the effect on mean transit time after 2 weeks intake of investigational products using radio-opaque barium sulphate impregnated polyethylen capsules. These capsules will be consumed during 3 days and thereafter an x-ray image will be taken over the bowel. The capsulese will then be calculated to determine the colonic transit time</description>
