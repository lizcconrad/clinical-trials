      blood pressure clinic staffed by a specialist nurse supported by visiting consultant improves
      blood pressure control compared to usual care.

    <description>Blood pressure will be measured according to protocol.For patients with blood pressure above optimal targets, treatment changes will be discussed with the patient, a visiting consultant physician and the patient's GP. If they agree, the GP will intensify anti-hypertensive treatment with monthly follow up by the specialist nurse until BP targets are achieved.</description>
