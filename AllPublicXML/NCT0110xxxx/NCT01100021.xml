        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Written Informed Consent.

          2. Adult male subjects 40 to 65 years of age, inclusive.

          3. A body weight of at least 50 kg and a body mass index (BMI) between 18 and 32 kg/m2,
             inclusive [BMI will be calculated as weight in kg/(height in m)2].

          4. Subjects are able to communicate with the Investigator, and to understand and comply
             with all requirements of study participation.

          5. Medically healthy, with no clinically significant screening results (e.g., laboratory
             profiles, medical histories, ECGs, physical exam, etc.), in the opinion of the
             Investigator in consultation with the Sponsor.

          6. Male subjects should be willing to use a condom and spermicide during sexual activity
             for 90 days after last dosing of avanafil and be willing to not donate sperm for 90
             days after dosing.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. A history or presence of significant cardiovascular (including thromboembolic
             disorders), neurological, hematological, psychiatric, hepatic, gastrointestinal,
             pulmonary, endocrine, immunologic or renal disease or other condition known to
             interfere with the absorption, distribution, metabolism, or excretion of drugs or
             place the subjects at increased risk as determined by the Investigator.

          2. Any clinically significant laboratory abnormalities as judged by the Investigator.
             Inclusion of a subject with out of normal range laboratory values must be approved by
             VIVUS prior to subject enrollment.

          3. A predisposition to priapism, such as subjects with sickle cell disease or blood
             dyscrasias.

          4. Known history of cardiovascular or cerebrovascular event, any history of angina.

          5. Subjects with episode(s) of fainting or vasovagal hypotension.

          6. History or ECG evidence of any high-risk arrhythmia or ECG judged by the Investigator
             to be clinically significant.

          7. Hypertrophic obstructive or other clinically significant cardiomyopathy, moderate or
             severe cardiac valvular disease.

          8. Subjects whose pulse is lower than 55 bpm at screening or 50 bpm prior to dosing.

          9. Acute illness, especially any infection, within 2 weeks of dosing.

         10. Systolic blood pressure &lt; 90 or &gt;150 mmHg; diastolic blood pressure &lt; 50 or &gt; 95 mmHg
             at screening or at check-in on Day -1 (2 rechecks are allowed).

         11. Subjects with benign prostatic hyperplasia or orthostatic hypotension (as evidenced by
             reduction of 20 mmHg or more in systolic blood pressure, reduction of 10 mmHg or more
             in diastolic blood pressure, or evidence of cerebral hypoperfusion upon standing from
             a seated position).

         12. History of retinitis pigmentosa or nonarteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy.

         13. Any history of bipolar disorder or psychosis, history of psychiatric hospitalization,

         17. Positive testing for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis B surface antigen
             (HBsAg), or hepatitis C antibodies (HCV) at screening.

             as defined by the Investigator.

         19. Allergy to or previously significant adverse events with PDE5 inhibitors, doxazosin
             and tamsulosin or their constituents.

         20. Use of any prescription or over-the-counter (OTC) medication, including herbal
             products, within the 14 days prior to Day 1. Up to 2 g per day of acetaminophen is
             allowed at the discretion of the Investigator.

         21. Use of any drug in Appendix 1 (drugs known to have clinical significance in inhibiting
             or inducing liver enzymes involved in drug metabolism [CYP P450]) within 30 days prior
             to Day 1.

         22. Blood donation or significant blood loss within 56 days prior to Day 1.

         23. Plasma donation within 14 days prior to Day 1.

             whichever is longer, prior to Day 1.

         26. Evidence of any clinically significant medical, psychiatric, social or other condition
             by history, physical examination or laboratory studies that, in the opinion of the
             Investigator, would contraindicate the administration of study medications, affect
             compliance, interfere with study evaluations, limit study participation, or confound
             the interpretation of study results.

         27. Involvement in the planning and conduct of the study (applies to both VIVUS or
             designee staff, or staff at the investigational site).
