    <textblock>
      This is a 2-part pilot study in healthy male subjects to evaluate plasma enrichment kinetics
      of [13C3,4]-cholesterol (Part I) and to assess the test-retest reproducibility (Part II) of
      Reverse Cholesterol Transport (RCT) measurements. The study will determine whether atom
      percent enrichment (% APE) at 18 hours can be extrapolated from the steady-state value and
      whether the mean difference in repeat Ra measurements is below is a prespecified level.
