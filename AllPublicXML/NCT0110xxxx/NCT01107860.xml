  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary aim of this study is to continue the investigation of cone beam computed
      tomography (CBCT) for breast imaging already underway in the diagnostic setting by providing
      a compelling body of evidence incorporating non-contrast CBCT in the study protocol. The goal
      is to accumulate a body of evidence to provide data to incorporate CBCT into the diagnostic
      work-up of breast lesions.

    <time_frame>about 3 years</time_frame>
    <description>The primary measure of this study will include the following aspects.
the capacity of CBCT to image the breast in its entirety as compared with the gold standard mammographic exam
patient's comfort during the CBCT exam vs the mammographic exam
the concordance and discordance of CBCT breast imaging with standard mammography and other breast-imaging studies
the concordance and discordance of CBCT breast imaging with histopathology
number of participants with adverse events as a measure of safety</description>

        The study population will be selected from the patient population at a community based
        clinic, Elizabeth Wende Breast Care, LLC, which is located in Rochester, NY. Group I will
        consist of subjects who have had mammograms read as BIRADS® 1 or 2. Group II will be
        subjects who have had a diagnostic mammogram read as BIRADS® 4 or 5 prior to breast biopsy.
