      This multicenter, prospective, observational study will evaluate the quality of life and the
      factors that influence the quality of life of epoetin beta [Neorecormon] in patients with
      renal chronic anemia, who are on dialysis. For each eligible patient data will be collected
      for 6 months. Target sample size is 5000-7000 patients.
