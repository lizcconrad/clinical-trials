  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Published data by the Organizaci√≥n panamericana de la Salud shows that Peru's mortality rate
      from acute respiratory infections (ARI) in infants less than one year of life is second only
      to Haiti (14,150/100,000). Government data reports shows a marked increase of RSV infections
      in Peru. &quot;Instituto Nacional de Salud&quot; (Peru's National Institute of Health) reports between
      January 1st to February 26th 2006, 62% of their positive samples corresponded to RSV.
      Epidemiological data from Lima-Peru, demonstrates that there is no specific season for RSV
      infection although some data suggest an increase in RSV activity during cold months (May to
      September; INS data). Clinical studies show that giving five doses of Synagis (palivizumab)
      resulted in serum concentrations &gt; 30 ug/mL for &gt;20 weeks. The aim of this post-marketing
      observational study is to determine the RSV hospitalization rate in high-risk infants who
      received Synagis (palivizumab) through the Social Security Hospitals in the context of
      routine clinical practice.
