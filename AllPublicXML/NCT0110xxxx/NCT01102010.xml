  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Elderly with hip fractures are often frail and discharged from hospital after few days of
      hospitalisation. Hip fracture surgery is often associated with blood loss, where the patient
      is at risk of developing anaemia. Low haemoglobin level reduces the body's oxygen transport
      which causes impaired functional ability and strain on vital organs. Acute anaemia is worse
      tolerated in elderly, than in younger patients. Therefore this study aims to investigate
      whether there are effects of an expanded indication for blood transfusion in the frail
      elderly.

  <detailed_description>

      All elderly patients aged 65 and above who are hospitalised from nursing home or sheltered
      housing facilities to the Orthopaedic Surgery Ward at Aarhus University Hospital with hip
      fracture and treated operatively, are eligible for this study. According to sample size
      calculations 284 patients are needed. Informed consent or deputy informed consent, if the
      patient is cognitively impaired, is needed. Inclusion is dependent on a haemoglobin measure
      between 6 and 7 mmol/l 6 days after surgery at the latest. Randomization will be
      computerised. Randomization will determine intervention with blood transfusion and the
      measurement of haemoglobin is blinded to the patient, relatives, and endpoint assessor. Both
      transfusion groups will receive blood when haemoglobin is less than 6 mmol/l, as recommended
      by the Danish Health and Medicine Authority. Geriatric and Orthopaedic Team (GO-team),
      consisting of following trained specialists: physiotherapist, nurse, and physician, will
      conduct medical evaluations, including blood transfusions, from admission until 30 days after
      surgery. The GO-team will work on weekdays both at the Orthopaedic surgery ward and in the
      patients home immediately after discharge. In accordance with Aarhus Blood Bank's
      instructions, blood transfusions are given both under hospitalisation, in the nursing homes
      and in the sheltered housings. Outcomes are functional ability and mortality during 90 days,
      and overall quality of life (OQoL) after 30 days and 1 year. The association between physical
      recovery and OQoL are tested.
