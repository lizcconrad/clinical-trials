  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic-inflammatory autoimmune central nervous system disorder
      and a leading cause of neurological disability in younger adults in Western countries.
      Besides &quot;classic&quot; neurological symptoms both depressivity and fatigue are among the most
      frequent symptoms in MS, affecting up to 90% of patients at onset or during the course of the
      disease. Neither are the psychological and immunological backgrounds of both well understood,
      nor are there numerous controlled therapeutic trials which would offer convincing treatment
      options for fatigue and depressivity in MS.

      Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) has been frequently used to investigate altered
      hemispheric and inter-hemispheric connectivity in MS. Recently, first therapeutic trials have
      been performed to address specific MS-related symptoms by TMS. Koch et al. demonstrated an
      improvement of hand dexterity following repetitive TMS, and Centonze and colleagues showed
      reduced spasticity following TMS.

      Recently, a specific coil for the stimulation of deeper brain regions including the deep
      nuclei was developed, the so-called H-coil. It successfully stimulates deeper (pre-frontal)
      brain regions. Stimulation with this coil has been shown to be safe and well tolerated in
      healthy volunteers, and in patients suffering from major depression.

      The aim of this project is to apply deep TMS with the H-coil to the prefrontal cortex (PFC)
      of MS patients. The PFC is the region at which stimulation is aimed in previous depression
      studies as this brain region has been shown to play a relevant role in affective disorders.
      It is the primary aim of this study, to evaluate the safety and tolerability of deep TMS with
      the H-coil in MS patients with fatigue or depressivity.
