  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Our objective is to determine whether food form (liquid vs. solid) alters gastric emptying,
      satiety, and food intake, when all macronutrients and fiber are controlled. The study
      population will include 10 healthy women, who have a normal body mass index. We have chosen
      to evaluate only women because this is a small pilot study and one of our endpoints is
      gastric emptying. Gastric emptying is known to differ between men and women. Gastric emptying
      will be evaluated using the Smartpill technology, satiety will be evaluated using
      computerized visual analog scales/questions, and food intake will be measured by providing
      subjects with an ad libitum/buffet-style lunch.

      Our hypothesis is that our subjects will be less hungry after they eat a solid breakfast
      compared to a liquid breakfast. We also hypothesize that our subjects will have a slower
      gastric emptying time after they eat the solid meal. Lastly, we think subjects will want to
      eat less food at lunch time if they have eaten a solid meal compared to a liquid meal for
      breakfast.
