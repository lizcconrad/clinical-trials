  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main component in the treatment of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is consist of
      anthracycline (such as daunorubicin or idarubicin) and cytarabine. Inter-individual
      variability of transport/metabolism of the chemotherapeutic agent and several genetic
      pathways involved in the drug action might be associated with different response following
      the treatment for AML usually consisted of chemotherapy and/or transplantation. One of
      potential pathways involved in the drug action is DNA repair pathway, accordingly single
      nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the DNA repair machinery pathway might be a predictive
      marker for therapy outcomes in AML.

      Several genes were involved in the DNA repair machinery which are 1) Nonhomologous end
      joining (NHEJ) pathway involved in the G1/S phase, 2) Homologous recombinational repair (HRR)
      pathway involved in the S/G2 phase. XRCC4, LIG4, MRN and ATM are well known genes involved in
      the NHEJ pathway, while MRE11, RAD50, NBS1 (MRN), RAD51, XRCC2, XRCC3, RAD51B, RAD51C, RAD
      51D, RAD52 or RAD54 are known to be associated with HRR pathway.

      A study suggested that the SNPs in the DNA repair pathway was involved in the susceptibility
      of secondary AML developing after chemotherapy or autologous hematopoietic stem cell
      transplantation, thus these SNP markers could become a predictive marker for secondary AML.
      However, it has never been investigated for multiple candidate pathways simultaneously with
      relateively larger number of patients. Accordingly, the current study attempts to investigate
      the potential role of the genotype markers in multiple candidate pathways, esp. focused on
      the DNA repair machinery, with respect to response following chemotherapy or survival of AML
      patients.

      Total of over 500 archived samples from the patients diagnosed as acute myeloid leukemia at
      the Samsung Medical Center, Seoul, Korea will be included, and genomic DNAs will be extracted
      and will be examined for their genotypes of the candidate SNPs involved in the DNA repair
      pathways. Then statistical analysis will be pursued for single marker analysis, haplotype
      analysis and for the construction of genetic risk model based on the multivariate analysis.
