  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study was designed to examine changes in capillary blood glucose and venous insulin
      levels after a 70 gram oral sucrose challenge with and without simultaneous consumption of a
      dietary supplement containing L-Arabinose and a patented version of chromium (LA-Cr).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study concluded that consumption of the LA-Cr supplement in conjunction with a 70-gram
      sucrose challenge led to a significant reduction of capillary blood glucose and venous
      insulin as compared to the sucrose challenge without the LA-Cr supplement. This finding may
      provide an important tool to reduce the adverse effects associated with elevated glucose and
      insulin levels.
