  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The hypothesis of this study focuses on obtaining accurate information on the effectiveness
      of photographic educational material on orientation of carbohydrate counting for adolescents
      with diabetes.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The adolescents with diabetes at the Pediatric Endocrinology and Diabetes outpatient clinic,
      will be randomly distributed between two groups: those who will receive orientation on
      carbohydrate counting through photographic educational material and those through a list of
      foods equivalent.

      Research will follow 3 steps:

      First, data will be collected on age, gender, BMI, HbA1C, schooling, type of educational
      material and parents grade level; answer sheets will be applied to evaluate previous
      knowledge on carbohydrate counting; orientation will be provided on counting with photo
      material or list.

      Second, after a month of using the educational material, a quiz by phone will be conducted
      with the sole intent to reinforce orientation.

      Third, two days later, adolescents will be directed to the experimental kitchen to see
      portions of real food and provide answers on amount or choice of carbohydrate.

      Statistical tools will be applied to evaluate results.

    <description>One month after intervention the adolescents' ability in CH counting will be tested.
In an experimental kitchen, the adolescents will look at portions of real food and will provide answer sheet on carbohydrate counting.
The answer sheet have 11 questions based on the different food groups, each group will be represented by one type of food.
We will compare of photographic education material and list of foods equivalent by analysis of the answering sheets.
We will categorize the answers by correct or incorrect. The statistics analysis we will compare the average score of each group.</description>
