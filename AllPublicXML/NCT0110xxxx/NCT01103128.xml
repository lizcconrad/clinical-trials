      The primary aim of this study is to determine if mutations of BRCA1 and BRCA2 result in
      different precancerous pathways to pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), as suggested in
      our validated mouse model. Genomic DNA will be isolated on normal tissue obtained from
      patients who underwent pancreatic resection for PDAC, intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm
      (IPMN) or mucinous cystic neoplasm (MCN). Tissue will be examined for the three most common
      founder mutations in Ashkenazi Jews. In the cases in which BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutations are
      found, heterozygote normal and abnormal tissue will be examined to look for mutations in the
      other BRCA1 or BRCA2 allele. The interaction between other cancer causing genes with BRCA1/2
      will also be evaluated by comparing the sequences of the other genes in pre-cancerous
      lesions.

      We hypothesize that BRCA1- and BRCA2-mediated pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma progresses
      through the PanIN route, as seen in both BRCA1 and BRCA2 murine models of pancreatic cancer.
      We further hypothesize that BRCA1 mutations may enable an additional pre- neoplastic pathway
      through MCN, and that IPMN may embody yet another pre- neoplastic pathway.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is the fourth leading cause of death from malignancy
      in the United States. Several gene mutations and cancer syndromes have been identified that
      are found in greater frequency in individuals with PDAC, including the breast ovary cancer
      syndrome (BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations). We have recently generated mouse models of pancreatic
      cancer in which we found that deletions of either BRCA1 or BRCA2 cooperate with K-ras
      activation and p53 mutations to increase the rate of tumorigenesis via accelerated
      progression of Pancreatic Intraepithelial Neoplasia (PanIN). However, only BRCA1 deletions
      were associated with the development of concomitant Mucinous Cystic Neoplasms (MCNs),
      suggesting potentially distinct pathways for BRCA1- and BRCA2-mediated tumorigenesis in the
      pancreas. Our primary aim is to determine if germline mutations of BRCA1 and BRCA2 result in
      different pre-neoplastic pathways to pancreatic cancer, as in our murine model. Genomic DNA
      will be isolated on normal tissue obtained from patients who underwent pancreatic resection
      for pancreatic cancer, IPMN or MCN. Tissue will be genotyped for the three most common
      founder mutations in Ashkenazi Jews. In the cases in which BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutations are
      found, heterozygote normal and abnormal tissue will be microdissected to look for loss of
      heterozygosity at the BRCA1 or BRCA2 allele. Our secondary aim is to evaluate the interaction
      of p53 and Kras with BRCA1 and BRCA2 by sequencing p53 and Kras in PanIN as compared to IPMN
      and MCN lesions.

      -  Peripheral Blood Specimens: Three tubes of blood will be collected from each study
           participant. Two tubes will be EDTA-whole blood and one tube will be serum. Each tube
           will contain ~4-5 ml. A portion of the blood will be utilized to extract white blood
           cells that will be immortalized by EBV infection.

        -  Archived Fixed Tissue Samples: Tissue blocks from surgery performed at CUMC or
           elsewhere, will be requested after obtaining consent for study participation.

        -  Fresh Tissue Collection: At the time of surgery for tumor resection, tumor and adjacent
           normal tissue will be requested from the Pathology Department. At the time of endoscopy,
           aspirated fluid or biopsied tissue will be requested. No additional tissue will be
           resected beyond that required for surgical or endoscopic management.

        -  Genetic Testing: All genetic testing will be performed in a research laboratory. Test
           results from research laboratories will not be disclosed to patients.
