  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study hypothesis is that continuous ND0611 increases the bioavailability of levodopa and
      therefore the levodopa area-under-the-concentration-curve values, half-life, and trough
      concentrations The study will help determining the safety and tolerability of ND0611 and
      determine the pharmacokinetic profile of levodopa following multiple oral dosing of
      levodopa/carbidopa (LD/CD) and continuous delivery of ND0611
