      Data from this pivotal clinical trial will be used to support a marketing application (i.e.,
      NDA) of Navidea's Lymphoseek for use in anatomical delineation of lymphoid tissue (nodes) in
      the lymphatic pathway draining the primary site of a tumor.

      Multicenter, open-label, within-patient comparative study of Lymphoseek and vital blue dye in
      the detection of excised lymph nodes in patients with known melanoma and breast cancer. All
      patients will receive a single dose of 50 µg Lymphoseek radiolabeled with 0.5 or 2.0 mCi Tc
      99m and vital blue dye.

    <textblock>
      In patients with primary melanoma and breast cancer, lymph node status is often a strong
      predictor of outcome and influences the course of treatment a patient may follow after
      surgery. In an effort to reduce the morbidity and costs of detection of lymph node
      metastases, surgical oncologists have developed a method by which the sentinel lymph node
      (SLN; the first node in a draining basin) is identified intraoperatively and removed. This
      technique, called sentinel node biopsy, has extremely high negative predictive values for
      melanoma metastases and breast cancer metastases. The two largest trials for melanoma,
      Morton, et al (2005) and Rossi, et al (2006), reported false negative rates of 6.3% and
      14.7%, respectively. Morton, et al (2006), in perhaps the most mature trial reported to date,
      showed a false negative rate of 3.4%. There is growing evidence that sentinel node biopsy
      will have a significant impact on the management of melanoma. Sentinel node biopsy also has
      extremely high negative predictive values for breast cancer metastases; the false-negative
      rates range from 0% to 9%. There is growing evidence that sentinel node biopsy will have a
      significant impact on the management of breast cancer. Although the survival and local
      recurrence studies have yet to be completed, the technique has emerged into common practice.

      Intraoperative lymphatic mapping (ILM) with a radiopharmaceutical is a nuclear medicine
      examination which identifies for the surgeon the first lymph node to receive lymphatic flow
      from the primary tumor site. This node is removed and analyzed for the presence of malignant
      cells. By locating the lymph node prior to surgery, a small incision can be used to remove
      the node and a smaller dissection can be employed. The high negative predictive value of the
      technique seems to provide an accurate staging procedure and may spare patients who are lymph
      node negative the morbidity of a complete lymph node dissection. Consequently, staging of
      melanoma by lymph node mapping and biopsy may be equivalent to regional node dissection
      without the attendant post surgical morbidity.

      An ideal lymph node imaging agent would exhibit rapid clearance from the injection site,
      rapid uptake and high retention within the first draining lymph node, and low uptake by the
      remaining lymph nodes. The ideal agent would also have low radiation absorption; high
      biological safety; convenient, rapid, and stable technetium-99m labeling; and biochemical
      purity.

      Lymphoseek (Technetium Tc 99m diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid mannosyl dextran, [Tc 99m]
      DTPA Mannosyl Dextran) is a radiotracer that accumulates in lymphatic tissue by binding to a
      mannose binding protein that resides on the surface of dendritic cells and macrophages.
      Lymphoseek is a macromolecule consisting of multiple units of DTPA and mannose, each
      synthetically attached to a 10 kilodalton dextran backbone. The mannose acts as a substrate
      for the receptor, and the DTPA serves as a chelating agent for labeling with Tc 99m.

      Lymphoseek has a diameter of about 5 nm, which is substantially smaller than current agents
      used for targeting lymphoid tissue. Lymphoseek's small diameter permits enhanced diffusion
      into lymph nodes and blood capillaries, resulting in a rapid injection site clearance. Upon
      entry into the blood, the agent binds to receptors in the liver or is filtered by the kidney
      and accumulates in the urinary bladder.
