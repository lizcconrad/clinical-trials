  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Available data suggest that compulsive hoarders have cognitive deficits, particularly with
      sustaining attention that might contribute their hoarding symptoms.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Compulsive hoarders perform significantly worse than healthy controls on standard attention
      tasks. These data suggest that the inability to sustain focus may interfere with hoarders'
      ability to organize, categorize and make decisions about discarding possessions. Stimulants
      are first-line treatments for ADHD, improve CPT performance in people with ADHD and enhance
      school performance in children with ADHD. Extended release formulations, such as
      methylphenidate ER, are associated with better medication compliance. Together, these data
      suggest that adjunctive methylphenidate ER might be a novel way to improve attention in
      compulsive hoarders which might improve hoarding symptoms.

      The investigators hypothesis is that adjunctive methylphenidate ER will improve attention in
      compulsive hoarders aged 18-55. The investigators will also explore the safety of
      methylphenidate ER administration in compulsive hoarders.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Clinically significant compulsive hoarding (Proposed DSM-V criteria) that is principal
             (i.e. currently most severe and needing of treatment) and has been present for at
             least one year.

          -  At least moderate attentional difficulties.

          -  Able to provide consent.

          -  Patients can be on or off of serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SRIs) or serotonin and
             norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) but dose must be stable for 12 weeks prior
             to study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Currently taking any psychotropic medications other than SRIs or SNRIs.

          -  Presence of psychotic symptoms or lifetime history of schizophrenia, bipolar disorder
             or other psychotic disorder.

          -  Current major depression is permitted if clearly secondary in importance to the
             hoarding.

          -  Judged clinically to be at risk of suicide (suicidal ideation, severe depression or
             other factors)

          -  Any cardiovascular abnormality that increases the risk of participation, including
             significant history of cardiovascular disease or family history of sudden death.

          -  Any medical or neurological disorder that increases the risk of participation or that
             is a medical contraindication for taking methylphenidate (e.g. glaucoma or Tourette's
             syndrome).

          -  Current use of any drug that is contraindicated with methylphenidate (e.g. monoamine
             oxidase inhibitors).

          -  Female patients who are pregnant or nursing.

          -  Current or previous treatment with methylphenidate or CBT for hoarding.

          -  Current ETOH/drug abuse or dependence disorder of dependency in the past 6 months.

          -  Individuals with mild cognitive impairments, dementia, or significant intellectual
             deficits.

          <title>Number of Patients Who Met Response Criteria for the Saving Inventory-Revised.</title>
          <description>Patients given Saving Inventory-Revised (SI-R), an evidence-based measure of three features of hoarding: excessive acquisition, difficulty discarding, and clutter. For the SI-R the minimum units are 0 and Maximum units on the total scale are 92. The higher the number on the SI-R, the more severe the symptoms. Response was defined as at least a 25% reduction on the SI-R.</description>
