  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) have a poor prognosis primarily due to
      cardiovascular disease. The cardiovascular risk can be assessed by measurements of arterial
      stiffness. A decrease in stiffness has been shown to decrease the risk of cardiovascular
      disease as well as death. Most of the CKD population also have hypertension and the control
      of blood pressure is one of the corner stones in inhibition of disease progression. Using
      drugs that specifically block the renin-angiotensin-system for blood pressure control has
      been shown to have a beneficial impact on inhibition of progression beyond that of the
      achieved blood pressure control. It has been reported that inhibition of the hormone
      aldosterone has a positive effect on survival in patients with heart failure, hypertension
      and diabetic as well as on-diabetic nephropathy.

      This study undertakes the investigation of the influence on arterial stiffness of adding an
      aldosterone receptor inhibitor to the medication CKD patients are already taking. Besides the
      primary end point which is Pulse wave velocity (PWV), arterial stiffness is also quantified
      thorough ambulatory blood pressure measurements.
