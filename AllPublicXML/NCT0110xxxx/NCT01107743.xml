    <textblock>
      In this survey, to collect the safety and efficacy information of Amlodipine /Atorvastatin
      (Caduet® Combination Tablets) in daily medical practice will be examined. In addition, the
      necessity of special Investigation and post-marketing clinical studies will be examined,
      while investigating unexpected adverse drug reactions during the survey period and
      understanding of the status of frequency of adverse drug reactions in daily medical practice.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      All the subjects whom an investigator prescribes the first Amlodipine /Atorvastatin (Caduet®)
      Combination Tablets should be registered consecutively until the number of subjects reaches
      target number in order to extract patients enrolled into the investigation at random.
