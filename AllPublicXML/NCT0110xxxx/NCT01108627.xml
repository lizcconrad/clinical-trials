    <textblock>
      Asthma is the most common chronic disease of childhood affecting 6.2 million children between
      2 and 18 years of age, and is the most common cause of school absenteeism due to chronic
      disease. African American children are 3 to 4 times more likely to be hospitalized for asthma
      and 4 to 6 times more likely to die from the disease compared to European Americans. The
      economic burden in this country from asthma is enormous, exceeding $16 billion in 2004.
      Though there is no cure for asthma, several drugs are available that have been shown to be
      generally safe and effective in controlling symptoms. Beta 2 agonists are the most commonly
      used asthma drugs. When inhaled these drugs relax cells in the lungs, which helps patients
      with asthma breath easier. Two types of beta agonists in use are short-acting beta agonists
      (SABA) and long-acting beta agonists (LABA). SABA, like albuterol, are used to provide quick
      relief of chest tightening which help patients to breathe easier. Long-acting beta agonists
      (LABA) also help patients breathe easier and for a longer period of time. Continued SABA use
      (for example, inhale albuterol 3 or 4 times a day) is not recommended, and continued LABA use
      is recommended only if used together with inhaled corticosteroids (ICS). ICS are the most
      commonly used drug used in asthma that protects against inflammation in the lung. Studies
      over the past 50 years suggest that continued use of SABA, LABA, and the combination of
      ICS+LABA may worsen asthma in some patients by reducing the effect of the beta agonists,
      increasing the rate of asthma attacks, decreasing the ability of the lung to work
      efficiently, and death. Recent studies suggest asthma worsening by continued beta agonist use
      occurs in individuals with a certain genotype. Genotype refers to form of the protein, called
      the beta2 adrenergic receptor (b2AR), in the lung that beta agonists work on. Because of
      differences in genetic make up, there are different forms of the b2AR. One form is called the
      Arg16 genotype the other form is called the Gly16 genotype. Compared to Gly16 genotypes,
      patients with asthma genotyped as Arg16 appear to be more susceptible to asthma worsening
      that has been associated with continued use SABA, LABA or ICS+LABA. Most of the studies of
      the influence of genotype on asthma worsening associated with beta agonist use have been
      performed in adults. The results of a small number of studies suggest children are more
      susceptible to asthma worsening from chronic beta agonist use compared to adults, and that
      children with the Arg16 genotype are more susceptible to having asthma attacks than children
      with the Gly16 genotype. Some evidence suggest that children with asthma should not be
      treated with ICS+LABA, yet since 2000, the rate at which children with asthma are switched
      from ICS therapy alone to ICS+LABA has increased significantly. The major question posed by
      the proposed study is: Does treatment with ICS+LABA compared to ICS alone cause worsening of
      asthma in children with asthma genotyped as Arg16 homozygotes but not in Gly16 homozygotes?
      The specific aim of the project is to evaluate the safety of ICS+LABA in children with asthma
      when separated according genotype. Children with asthma will be screened, be assented and
      their care taker (parent, for example) consented. A sample of saliva will be collected from
      which genetic material (DNA) will be collected for the purpose of genotyping. A total of 90
      European and African American children, 45 Arg16 and 45 Gly16 genotypes, will be treated for
      16 weeks. Half of each genotype will be randomly assigned to receive ICS alone for 16 weeks
      the other half will receive ICS+LABA. At the end of 16 weeks, those starting with ICS will be
      then receive ICS+LABA while those who received ICS+LABA first will then take ICS alone.
      Before and once a month during treatment, each participant will visit the clinic to undergo
      tests that will assess lung function, how well asthma is being controlled, level of
      inflammation and quality of life. The results of our study are expected to have a major
      impact on the way children with asthma are being treated with drugs. If the results of our
      study show that Arg16 genotypes have worse asthma when they are taking ICS+LABA compared to
      ICS alone we will conclude that the safety of combination in children is questionable and
      should be tested in a larger population of children to determine if this popular combination
      should be used in children with asthma. If the results show that the combination in both
      genotypes does not worsen asthma compared to ICS treatment, we will conclude that the
      combination is safe to use in children, at least for 16 weeks.

    <description>• Drugs. The study drugs are open-labeled inhaled corticosteroids (ICS); FORADIL® AEROLIZER® and FORADIL placebo. FORADIL® AEROLIZER® consists of a capsule dosage form containing a dry powder formulation of FORADIL (formoterol fumarate) intended for oral inhalation only with the AEROLIZER Inhaler. Each clear, hard gelatin capsule contains a dry powder blend of 12 mcg of formoterol fumarate and 25 mg of lactose (which contains trace levels of milk proteins) as a carrier. Ten capsules are contained in each package, which is clearly labeled. To use the delivery system, a FORADIL capsule is placed in the well of the AEROLIZER Inhaler, and the capsule is pierced by pressing and releasing the buttons on the side of the device. The formoterol fumarate formulation is dispersed into the air stream when the patient inhales rapidly and deeply through the mouthpiece.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Age of participants will be 5 to 18 yo. FORADIL® is FDA-approved for children in this
             age group.

          -  Ethnicity; European and African American will be selected for study. Other minorities
             will not be studied owing to the problem of population stratification, which refers to
             differences in allele frequency between cases and controls that are due to differences
             in ancestry rather than associations of genes with disease or drug response (47). For
             European Americans, the frequency of Arg16 homozygosity is about 15% compared to about
             30% in African Americans (48). In previous studies, the PI restricted his analyses to
             European Americans because of the potential confounding of population stratification
             (48;49). .

          -  Participants must have a diagnosis of asthma. In addition, participants must have
             persistent asthma as defined by NAEPP guidelines: asthma symptoms &gt; 2 days; &gt; 3 to 4
             nighttime awakenings; SABA use &gt;2 days/week; pre-bronchodilator % predicted &gt;60%;

             during past 12 months; methacholine PC20 &lt; 16 mg/ml.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  FEV1&lt; 50% of predicted. Methacholine bronchoprovocation limited to participants with
