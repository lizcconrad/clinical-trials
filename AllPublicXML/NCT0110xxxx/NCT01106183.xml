    <textblock>
      The goals of our study are to critically evaluate if a healthy population supplemented with
      Transfer factor experiences fewer incidences of colds and flu, or experience shorter duration
      of illness compared to an identical population taking placebo. In this study we will give
      either Transfer factor or a placebo to two groups of healthy adult men and women for a period
      of 7 weeks in a double-blind experimental design. The frequency and duration of colds and
      flu-like symptoms will be recorded during the course of the study. Saliva samples will be
      collected weekly and assessed for salivary IgA secretion rate. Data from this study will
      establish the efficacy of Transfer Factor to support a healthy immune system.
