    <textblock>
      The investigators hypothesize that cLDL levels are elevated in RA patients and represents an
      important mechanism for accelerated atherosclerosis leading to excess cardiovascular disease
      (CVD) in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients. The purpose of this study is to improve
      understanding of the reasons for increased cardiovascular diseases (such as heart attack and
      stroke) seen in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA, an arthritis that causes inflammation
      and destruction of joints). Specifically, the study plans to determine whether a particular
      type of change in proteins in LDL cholesterol (&quot;bad cholesterol&quot;) known as carbamylation is
      an important risk factor for cardiovascular diseases in RA patients. The study will utilize a
      case−control study design. A total of 120 subjects (males and females between the ages of 18
      and 80) may be enrolled in order to ensure that 100 subjects (50 RA case subjects and 50 age
      and sex matched controls) complete the study. Procedures will consist of a single visit for
      each subject during which a screening evaluation, an enrollment evaluation, and a single
      blood draw will be performed.

      If a subject consents, any blood samples remaining after the tests planned for this study
      will be stored indefinitely for potential future new studies. Any future new studies using
      these blood samples will require prior approval by the UAMS Institutional Review Board (IRB).
      A subject may request destruction of the stored samples at any time.
