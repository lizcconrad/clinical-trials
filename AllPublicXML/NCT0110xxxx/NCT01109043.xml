    <textblock>
      The b.p.m study will be performed to gain the insight in the courses of illness and therapy
      in subjects, suffering from hypertension and that have elevated heart rate. This study will
      show that a therapy with bisoprolol (Concor/Concor PLUS) or any other blood pressure lowering
      (antihypertensive) drug lowers blood pressure (BP) and heart rate and increases the quality
      of subjects' life.

      The b.p.m study measures heart rate development whilst treating subjects with hypertension
      with Concor [bisoprolol] or Concor Plus [bisoprolol + hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ)].

      The objectives of this study are:

      After 6 months of the therapy treatment, 60% of the subjects showed a heart rate ≥ 80
      beats/min.

      An improved quality of life information after 6 months of therapy treatment, collected by
      asking standardised questions A decrease in systolic and diastolic BP after 6 months
      presented significant differences Digital sphygmomanometers (BP measuring devices) will be
      supplied in order to document the values of BP and heart rate. Blood pressure and heart rate
      should be measured at least 2 times, ideally 4 times per day. Furthermore, every subject will
      additionally receive a documentation sheet, where he/she will record the measurement data.
      The documentation sheet will be a part of the improvement of the quality of life; it can be
      removed and passed on.

      Every subject will be explained how to use and handle the BP measuring device and the
      importance of the documentation. The assessment of the quality of life must be made at the
      beginning and at the end of 6 month therapy. Within the framework of the examination the
      attending physician will ask 8 standard questions (SQ-8 Short Form Health Survey). The
      questionnaire will be a part of the quality of life assessment.

      The main focus of the observation is on the age group &lt; 55 years with concomitant diseases,
      such as diabetes or ketohexokinase (KHK).

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects with high blood pressure (BP) and tachycardia

          -  Subjects with essential hypotonia, angina pectoris

          -  Subjects with essential hypertonia, when a therapy with ß-blockers or diuretics is not
             sufficiently effective

          -  Precautions to be taken in case of severe peripheral circulation disorders, diabetes
             (especially at the time, when blood sugar is elevated), during a strict fast, in case
             of metabolic acidosis, atrioventricular block (AV) block of grade I, Prinzmetal
             angina, additional therapy with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors
             (ACE-inhibitors), severe coronary or cerebral sclerosis, hyperuricemia or gout and in
             subjects with a history of severe hypersensitive reactions or during a desensitization
             therapy (excessive anaphylactic reaction, attenuated adrenergic counterregulation)

          -  Special precautions must be taken with the subjects that have a family history or
             suffered from psoriasis, during a desensitization therapy (also anamnestic subjects),
             other obstructive pulmonary diseases on account of the possibility of initiation or
             intensification of bronchoconstriction, although, due to the marked ß1-selectivity of
             bisoprolol, the risk is lower than with non-selective ß-receptor blockers. The
             subjects that have a family history or suffered from psoriasis should the take Concor
             Plus only after a careful assessment of risk - benefit ratio. The subjects with
             pheochromocytoma should take Concor Plus, as well as other ß-blockers after inhibiting
             the alpha-receptors
