  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators are studying new ways to make treatment decisions for these types of
      cancer. Technologies at the Van Andel Research Institute (VARI) are available to determine a
      tumor's molecular makeup (gene expression profile). This technology (called &quot;Xenobase&quot;) is
      being used to discover new ways to understand cancers and potentially predict the best
      treatments for patients with cancer. The researchers at VARI have filed a patent on the
      Xenobase and the specific network analysis method that the investigators will be using as
      part of this study.

      A specimen obtained from the tumor during a recent surgical, biopsy, or bone marrow procedure
      will be sent to the Van Andel Research Institute. Researchers will attempt to identify the
      molecular makeup within the specimen, as well as in blood and urine samples in patients with
      aggressive and/or refractory cancer. This additional testing is different than the routine
      tests currently performed at the hospital for the evaluation of cancer.

      The goals of this part of the study are: To determine if the investigators tumor board
      committee (at minimum a panel of 3 oncologists and 1 pharmacist) can use patient specific
      cancer cells to make real-time treatment decision using patient specific genetic information,
      and predicted therapies generated in the Xenobase report.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients must have histologically proven neuroblastoma and confirmation of refractory
             or recurrent disease with histologic confirmation at diagnosis or at the time of
             recurrence/progression

          -  Patients must be age &gt;12 months and diagnosed before the age of 21

          -  Life expectancy must be more than 3 months

          -  If measurable disease, this must be demonstrated by residual abnormal tissue at a
             primary or metastatic site measuring more than 1 cm in any dimension by standardized
             imaging (CT or MRI). For patients with only skeletal sites of disease, there must be
             at least one persisting focus with increased activity on a pre-treatment
             meta-iodobenzylguanidine (MIBG) scan.

          -  Current disease state must be one for which there is currently no known curative
             therapy

          -  Lansky Play Score must be more than 30

          -  Patients without bone marrow metastases must have an ANC &gt; 750/μl and platelet count
             &gt;50,000/μl

          -  Adequate liver function must be demonstrated, defined as:

               -  Total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 x upper limit of normal (ULN) for age AND

               -  SGPT (ALT) &lt; 10 x upper limit of normal (ULN) for age

          -  No other significant organ toxicity defined as &gt;Grade 2 by National Cancer Institute
             Common Toxicity Criteria for Adverse Events version 3 (NCI-CTCAE V3.0
             (http://ctep.cancer.gov/forms/CTCAEv3.pdf))

          -  A negative serum pregnancy test is required for female participants of child bearing
             potential (≥13 years of age or after onset of menses)

          -  Both male and female post-pubertal study subjects need to agree to use one of the more
             effective birth control methods during treatment and for six months after treatment is
             stopped. These methods include total abstinence (no sex), oral contraceptives (&quot;the
             pill&quot;), an intrauterine device (IUD), levonorgestrol implants (Norplant), or
             medroxyprogesterone acetate injections (Depo-provera shots). If one of these can not
             be used, contraceptive foam with a condom is recommended.

          -  Informed Consent: All patients and/or legal guardians must sign informed written
             consent. Assent, when appropriate, will be obtained according to institutional
             guidelines. Voluntary consent for optional biology studies will be included.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients who have received any chemotherapy within the last 21 days.

          -  Patients receiving anti-tumor therapy for their disease or any investigational drug
             concurrently

          -  Patients with serious infection or a life-threatening illness (unrelated to tumor)
             that is &gt; Grade 2 (NCI CTCAE V3.0), or active, serious infections requiring parenteral
             antibiotic therapy within 2 weeks prior to screening

          -  Patients with any other medical condition, including malabsorption syndromes, mental
             illness or substance abuse, deemed by the Investigator to be likely to interfere with
             the interpretation of the results or which would interfere with a patient's ability to
             sign or the legal guardian's ability to sign the informed consent, and patient's
             ability to cooperate and participate in the study
