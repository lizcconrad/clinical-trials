  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Negative pressure wound therapy (NPWT) has become a powerful tool in wound bed preparation of
      complex wounds and is routinely used in various disciplines, including general surgery and
      plastic surgery.

      NPWT involves the creation of a controlled subatmospheric pressure in the wound bed. The
      vacuum is generated by a pump and is distributed over the wound bed by a dressing (mostly a
      foam or gauze sponge). The therapy has several positive effects on the wound bed, such as
      improved local blood circulation, stimulation of granulation tissue formation and controlled
      evacuation of wound exudates. Standard negative pressure applied mostly varies between -120
      mmHg and -130 mmHg.A new way of applying NPWT is the Engenex™ system using the Bio-Dome™
      Wound Dressing, a specially engineered structure that forms a defined space above the surface
      of the wound. This space will maintain its size and integrity in the presence of negative
      pressure and wound fluids and thus effectively imposes strain on the underlying tissue. The
      material properties of the dressing permit moist wound healing while encouraging efficient
      removal of exudates. The contact material will not absorb fluid. It has been clinically shown
      that the Bio-Dome™ Wound Dressing is effective at growing granular tissue in the base of a
      wound at a safe low negative pressure of -75 mmHg, possibly reducing dressing ingrowth into
      the wound bed to a minimum.

      Our intention is to evaluate NPWT by means of the Engenex™ pump and Bio- Dome™ Wound Dressing
      in 15 patients. Patients with large soft tissue defects will be examined by a plastic surgeon
      and if suitable for NPWT they will be treated with the Engenex™ NPWT system.

      Before starting NPWT wounds will be evaluated and measured (length, width, depth, volume) if
      possible. Digital photos will be made and wound swabs will be taken for microbiological
      examination.Dressing changes will be performed twice weekly, on Monday and Thursday or on
      Tuesday and Friday. At each dressing change a wound will be re-evaluated and measured.

      Other parameters to be noted will be, amongst others: pain, comfort, ease of use,material
      used, time needed for dressing change, etc.

      The NPWT treatment will be carried on for maximum three weeks. During this period plastic
      surgeons will evaluate whether the wound is ready for surgical closure or not.

      If surgical closure after 3 weeks is not yet an option possibility exists that NPWT will be
      continued.

      Every wound will be followed up until complete wound healing after surgical closure.

      All patients data will be recorded, secured, evaluated and analysed for both medical
      parameters and health economic parameters.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        Wounds will be assessed by plastic surgeons to evaluate the indication for wound bed
        preparation. If suitable for NPWT, they will be treated with Engenex® NPWT-system.

          -  Suitable wounds include:

               -  Pressure sores grade III and IV

               -  Traumatic wounds with considerable soft tissue loss

               -  Wounds after necrotizing fasciitis

               -  Abdominal wounds

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Impossibility to adhere the polyurethane film to healthy surrounding skin

          -  Malignancy in the wound

          -  Untreated osteomyelitis

          -  Non-enteric and unexplored fistula

          -  Undebrided wounds with necrotic tissue

          -  Exposed organs and blood vessels (Always protect vessels, organs, and nerves by
             covering them with natural tissues or several layers of fine-meshed, non-adherent
             synthetic material that form a complete barrier.)

          -  Increased risk of bleeding

          -  Patient has one or more medical condition(s), diabetes, including renal, hepatic,
             hematologic, neurologic, or immune disease that in the opinion of the investigator
             would make the patient inappropriate for this trial

             failure of the NPWT therapy

          -  Less than two weeks of NPWT
