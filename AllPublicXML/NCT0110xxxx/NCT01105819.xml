  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Critically ill patients often need ventilatory support through a plastic tube connected to a
      ventilator. Those patients have a altered microbiological flora in the mouth, oropharynx as
      well as throughout the intestine. Bacteria that can cause illness are often found in the
      oropharynx in such patients and measures are taken in order to reduce the risk of secondary
      infections by those bacteria. In all intensive care patients oral care is provided by the
      nursing staff aiming at a reduction of the pathogenic species. This is done by a variety
      measures.

      Chlorhexidine (CHX) is an antisepticum with a capability to reduce bacterial counts in the
      mouth and oropharynx and has been shown to be of value also for intubated patients. It is
      used frequently throughout the world.

      Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) is a costly rather frequent complication to intensive
      care and mechanical ventilation and is usually caused by aspiration of infected secretions
      from the oropharynx. CHX has in some studies been shown to reduce the frequency of VAP.

      The probiotic bacterium Lactobacillus plantarum 299 has the ability to adhere to the mucosa
      throughout the gastro-intestinal tract including the mouth and in our pilot study we found
      that L plantarum had better ability to reduce colonisation with enteric bacteria in the
      oropharynx than CHX had. Figures not statistical significant so this present study is aiming
      to get a larger amount of data.

      The procedure was found to be safe Hypothesis: Lactobacillus plantarum is better than CHX for
      the reduction of pathogenic bacteria in the oropharynx in intubated mechanically ventilated
      patients and consequently has a better potential to reduce the frequency of VAP

      This study is an expansion of a pilot study performed at the ICU Lund University Hospital,
      Sweden where 50 patients were included (ISRCTN00472141).

      Results have been published in Critical Care 2008, 12:R136 The protocol is the same and in
      this second phase we intend to include 100 patients and results will be summed up.

      Three centres are engaged. The results from the pilot study is encouraging and we are aiming
      at getting statistical significance in the differences in pathogenic findings in the cultures
      from oropharynx and also better a better basis for the calculation of the number of patients
      needed to get sufficient power to study difference in VAP frequency.
