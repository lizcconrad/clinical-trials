      To determine whether adding Ribose 5 grams 3 x day would improve quality of life, energy,
      sleep and cognitive function and decrease pain in patients with CFS and/or fibromyalgia
      (CFS/FMS).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Chronic Fatigue Syndrome and Fibromyalgia (CFS/FMS) are debilitating syndromes affecting ~
      2-4% of the population. Although they are heterogeneous conditions associated with many
      triggers, including infections, autoimmune illnesses, hormonal dysfunctions and other
      processes, they appear to have the common pathology of being associated with impaired energy
      metabolism.

      As D-ribose has been shown to increase cellular energy synthesis in heart and skeletal
      muscle, and was shown to significantly improve clinical outcomes in CFS/FMS in an earlier
      pilot study, we conducted a larger, community based, multicenter trial to see if these
      findings could be generalized to a broader patient population. We hypothesized that giving
      D-ribose would improve function in CFS/FMS patients.
