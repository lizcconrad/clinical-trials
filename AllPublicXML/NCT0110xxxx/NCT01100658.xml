  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      While neurocognitive impairments in attention, memory and executive functioning are commonly
      reported sequelae of childhood leukemia and brain tumors, studies have only recently begun to
      examine the treatment of attention deficits in this population. Numerous studies have
      examined the effectiveness of methylphenidate in the treatment of children with attention
      deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). However, the effectiveness of this medication for
      improving attention and behavioral functioning in children with medical illnesses or brain
      injury are less clear.

      Patients will be randomized to receive one week of Metadate CD (a controlled release form of
      methylphenidate, similar to Ritalin) and one week of placebo in a double-blind fashion.
