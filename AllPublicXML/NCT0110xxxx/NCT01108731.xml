  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Use of the drug Milnacipran will reduce ventricular lactate levels and processing time for
      completing complex tasks relative to placebo.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with Fibromyalgia will show elevated ventricular lactate levels as measured via
      magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS). Patients treated with Milnacipran will show
      normalization of ventricular lactate levels compared to those treated with placebo, and will
      also show normalization of the increased latency to respond to complex reaction time probes
      compared to those treated with placebo.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Ventricular Lactate Levels in the Brain</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 2 months</time_frame>
    <description>Ventricular lactate levels will be assessed before and at the end of the trial using a scanning method known as magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS), which is used to determine the presence and quantity of a number of chemicals in the brain.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Cognitive Function Assessed by the no Cue Condition of the Attention Network Test (ANT).</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 2 months</time_frame>
    <description>The Attention Network Test (ANT) is a computerized test designed to evaluate the efficiency of the attention network. The ANT consists of a set of cued reaction time tasks to assess vigilance and efficiency to detect novel visual stimuli. The ANT also includes a set of flanker tasks during which a decision needs to be made about whether the orientation of a central stimulus is congruent or incongruent with a set of flanking arrows. Scores on the cued reaction time tasks (no cue, centre cue, double cue) reflect latency to respond measured in milliseconds (slower performance equals greater values). The score on the flanker task reflecting executive attention is derived by subtracting obtained latencies on the congruent flanker from the incongruent condition. Based on our prior work, we are hypothesizing that drug treated Ss will show improved performance on the no cue reaction time condition and on the derived executive attention variable compared to placebo treated.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Widespread Pain</measure>
    <time_frame>2 months</time_frame>
    <description>Pain was assessed using a visual analog scale (VAS) ranging from 0 (no pain) to 10 (worst pain ever). The baseline value recorded was widespread pain at the time of assessment and the 2 months follow value recorded was widespread pain over the week prior to assessment.</description>

        <title>Change in Cognitive Function Assessed by the no Cue Condition of the Attention Network Test (ANT).</title>
        <description>The Attention Network Test (ANT) is a computerized test designed to evaluate the efficiency of the attention network. The ANT consists of a set of cued reaction time tasks to assess vigilance and efficiency to detect novel visual stimuli. The ANT also includes a set of flanker tasks during which a decision needs to be made about whether the orientation of a central stimulus is congruent or incongruent with a set of flanking arrows. Scores on the cued reaction time tasks (no cue, centre cue, double cue) reflect latency to respond measured in milliseconds (slower performance equals greater values). The score on the flanker task reflecting executive attention is derived by subtracting obtained latencies on the congruent flanker from the incongruent condition. Based on our prior work, we are hypothesizing that drug treated Ss will show improved performance on the no cue reaction time condition and on the derived executive attention variable compared to placebo treated.</description>
        <time_frame>Baseline and 2 months</time_frame>
        <population>Data from 4 were excluded due to 2 having error rates greater than 50%, indicating that they did not understand the task and 2 having simple reaction times longer than those for the complex reaction times on the ANT, suggesting their need for additional practice trials on the simple motor reaction time task.</population>
