  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Our overall goal is to advance science related to using the Internet in health services
      delivery, and specifically smoking cessation by targeting dental hygienists. Our proposed
      intervention is the first Internet-delivered intervention to target the dental microsystem
      for smoking cessation-providing access to hygienists and patients.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed to allow dental hygienists and dentists to provide additional tobacco
      cessation counseling with little additional marginal effort. This would be done using an
      Internet-based referral to external resources. This system, termed &quot;ReferASmoker&quot;, will allow
      hygienists and dentists to refer patients to a patient education, self-management website,
      &quot;Decide2Quit&quot; and accompanying Quitline, while the patient is still in the dental office. We
      anticipate that hygienists will be the primary drivers of this intervention. Our intervention
      has several innovations designed to support the dental practice in their tobacco cessation
      activities and maximize patient cessation rates. We will randomize 80 community-based primary
      dental practices into a clinical trial.

      Aim 1. To test hypothesis 1(H1)that the number of patients REFERRED to the self-management
      resource website will be larger in the intervention practices compared to control practices.

      Aim 2. To test hypothesis 2 (H2) that the proportion of patients referred who GO to the
      patient self-management website will be larger in intervention practices compared to control
      practices

      Aim 3. To test hypothesis 3 (H3) that the proportion of smokers who are referred who QUIT at
      six months will be larger among intervention compared to control because of the additional
      connectivity of the intervention.
