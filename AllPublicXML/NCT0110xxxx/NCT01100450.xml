  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To test the strength and physical performance outcomes of a 12-week progressive resistance
      training (PRT) exercise program in a small cohort of patients with Class III obesity who are
      preparing for bariatric weight loss surgery at Beth Israel Deaconess. The study will also
      test patient compliance to the 12 week PRT program. Whereas PRT exercise is currently
      recommended as a part of preoperative clinical care for bariatric surgery patients, little
      research has been done to measure the acceptance and effectiveness of a standardized PRT
      exercise protocol for improving health and perioperative care. Preliminary data from this
      study could be used to justify larger studies and further investigation.

    <measure>6-Minute Walk Test</measure>
    <time_frame>Before training - Week 1</time_frame>
    <description>Subjects are instructed to walk from one end to the other of a 30- meter hallway at their own pace, while attempting to cover as much ground as possible in the allotted 6 minutes. Subjects are allowed to stop and rest during the test, but were instructed to resume walking as soon as they felt able to do so. Total distance walked was recorded at the end of the test.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Muscle Fatigability Test</measure>
    <time_frame>Before training-Week 1</time_frame>
    <description>After appropriate warm-up, subjects performed as many repetitions as possible against a resistance set to 80% or 70% (leg and chest respectively) of their pre-intervention 1-repetition maximum resistance. Fatigability tests measures the ability to sustain a static muscle contraction or make repetitive submaximal dynamic contractions. The test was administered using the leg press and chest press machines (Nautilus Nitro).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>1-repetition maximum muscle strength test</measure>
    <time_frame>Before training-Week 1</time_frame>
    <description>The subject performs repeated single repetitions of leg press and chest press, separated by 60-second rest periods. Resistance is increased systematically at each repetition until the person's maximum voluntary muscle force cannot move the resistance through the full range of motion. The greatest resistance (measured in lbs.) a person can move through a full range of motion is recorded as the &quot;one-repetition maximum.&quot; Tests were performed on leg and chest press machines (Nautilus Nitro).</description>
