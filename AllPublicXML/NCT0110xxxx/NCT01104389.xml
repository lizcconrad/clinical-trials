      A Prospective Investigation of the Use of the Fluorescence Imaging on the da Vinci Surgical
      System for Intraoperative Near Infrared Imaging of Renal Cortical Tumors. To determine the
      feasibility of the fluorescence imaging on the da Vinci Surgical System in robotic partial
      nephrectomy procedures and report perioperative outcomes.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Ages of 18 to 80 years.

          -  Urine pregnancy test negative for women of childbearing potential prior to surgery

          -  Subject is able to comply with the study procedures

          -  A CT or MRI preoperative assessment of renal cortical tumor

          -  The renal tumor must be stage T1a-b - T2

          -  Written informed consent.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subject has significant liver disease, cirrhosis or liver insufficiency with abnormal
             liver function tests, as total bilirubin &gt;1.5 X normal and/or SGOT &gt;2X normal

          -  Subject has uremia, serum creatinine &gt;2.0 mg/dl.

          -  Subject has a previous history of adverse reaction or allergy to ICG, iodine,
             shellfish or iodine dyes

          -  Subject in whom the use of x-ray dye or ICG is contraindicated including development
             of adverse events when previously or presently administered

          -  Subject has any medical condition, which in the judgment of the Investigator and/or
             designee makes the subject a poor candidate for the investigational procedure

          -  Subject is pregnant or lactating

          -  Subjects actively participating in another drug, biologic and/or device protocol

          -  The presence of medical conditions contraindicating general anesthesia or standard
             surgical approaches.
