    <textblock>
      The objectives of this study would be to see if the addition of vitamin D to fluticasone
      propionate provides greater symptomatic relief in patients with seasonal allergic rhinitis
      compared to fluticasone propionate treatment alone.

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Total Nasal Symptom Score (TNSS) Over 2 Week Randomized Treatment Period</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 2 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Patients recorded the severity of sneezing, runny nose, stuffy nose, and other symptoms (e.g. itchy nose/throat) twice a day on a scale from 0 to 3 (0 = no symptoms, 1 = mild, 2 = moderate, and 3 = severe). The TNSS was calculated as the sum of all scores for morning and evening recordings with a range of 0 to 24. The change from baseline for each day of treatment was then calculated for each subject. So that each subject only had one observation, the average of these changes was calculated for each subject, and this summary measure was used in the analysis comparing the two treatment groups. We report the median and full range of these average changes for each group. A negative value indicates an improvement in symptoms.</description>

          <title>Change From Baseline in Daytime Nasal Symptom Score (DNSS) Over 2 Week Randomized Treatment Period</title>
          <description>Patients recorded the severity of sneezing, runny nose, stuffy nose, and other symptoms (e.g. itchy nose/throat) twice a day on a scale from 0 to 3 (0 = no symptoms, 1 = mild, 2 = moderate, and 3 = severe). The DNSS was calculated as the sum of all scores for morning with a range of 0 to 12. The change from baseline for each day of treatment was then calculated for each subject. So that each subject only had one observation, the average of these changes was calculated for each subject, and this summary measure was used in the analysis comparing the two treatment groups. We report the median and full range of these average changes for each group. A negative value indicates an improvement in daytime symptoms.</description>
