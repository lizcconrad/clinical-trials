  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      At Thomas Street Health Center (TSHC), one of the largest outpatient HIV clinics in the
      country, we developed a structured, theory-based, Patient Mentor Program to improve retention
      in HIV primary care. Many patients with HIV infection hospitalized at Ben Taub General
      Hospital (BTGH) do not successfully return to TSHC after discharge from the hospital. The
      purpose of this study is to test the efficacy of a patient mentor intervention in a 5-year
      randomized, controlled trial in more than 430 socio-economically and racially diverse
      HIV-infected patients hospitalized at BTGH. We hypothesize that the intervention will
      meaningfully increase retention in HIV primary care after discharge compared to an attention
      control.

    <description>The patient mentor intervention from TSHC has been adapted to the inpatient setting. Participants randomized to that arm will receive 2 sessions with a patient mentor during their hospitalization, as well as 5 phone call sessions over the 10 weeks after discharge and a brief meeting between the subject and the mentor when the subject attends their first outpatient visit at TSHC after discharge.</description>

    <description>Participants randomized to the control arm will receive an attention control intervention delivered by a patient educator who is not an HIV patient mentor. We will use a modified version of the RESPECT intervention for our attention control group. Similar to the active intervention, these patients will receive 2 sessions in the hospital and 5 phone calls over 10 weeks after discharge.</description>

    <intervention_type>Behavioral</intervention_type>
    <intervention_name>Patient Mentor Intervention</intervention_name>
    <description>The first session includes an exploration of needs, barriers, and facilitators to HIV care. HIV educational materials are introduced to identify areas of need. Mentors will address concerns and possible barriers to care using their own experiences. Mentors will encourage participants to set goals related to acquisition of care following discharge and how to address possible barriers to that goal. The second session will reinforce the first session. Mentors will call the patient 5 times over the 10 weeks after discharge. These phone calls will be brief and goal centered, to either reinforce positive behavior if the patient is in care, or continue to help the patient re-engage in outpatient HIV care.</description>

    <description>The control intervention is a modification of the project RESPECT intervention. We will use material from sessions 1, 2, and 3 of the RESPECT enhanced counseling intervention. These interactions will include a personalized assessment of risk behaviors and changing condom use self-efficacy. The second interaction will build on material covered during the first interaction, with additional focus on condom use attitudes. The counselors will call the patient 5 times in the 10 weeks after discharge. These phone-based sessions will be brief and goal centered, to reinforce safe HIV transmission behaviors.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

        1) Hospitalized at BTGH; 2) expected to be in the hospital for at least one more night at
        the time of enrollment; 3) at least 18 years of age at enrollment; 4) able to speak English
        or Spanish; 5) HIV infected, whether previously diagnosed or diagnosed this hospital stay;
        6) cognitively aware enough to provide informed consent and participate in the study.
        Patients who are temporarily cognitively incapacitated (e.g., from an acute process) will
        be followed and approached for enrollment if and when they are cognitively and physically
        capable of participating in the study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        1) Intending to use a source of HIV primary care other than TSHC after discharge from the
        hospital, because TSHC-specific mentoring is not relevant to them and the data on their
        appointments after discharge cannot be tracked; 2) in the opinion of the primary medical
        team, likely to be discharged to an institutional setting; 3) in the opinion of the primary
        medical team caring for the patient, likely to die in the hospital or be discharged to
        hospice; 4) cognitive impairment that in the opinion of the primary medical team caring for
        the patient is not expected to improve by discharge; 5) prisoner at admission and expected
        to be discharged back to prison or jail; 6) having had an HIV primary care visit in at
        least 3 of the 4 previous quarter-years AND having had at least 3 consecutive HIV VL&lt;400
        c/mL over at least 6 months, the most recent of which is within 3 months of enrollment; 7)
        enrolled in any other research project with prospective follow-up; 8) already enrolled in
        this study at any time.

        For the purposes of this study, &quot;prisoner&quot; will be defined in accordance with Federal
        regulations, as &quot;any individual involuntarily confined or detained in a penal
        institution...[including] individuals sentenced to such an institution under a criminal or
        civil statute, individuals detained in other facilities by virtue of statutes or commitment
        procedures which provide alternatives to criminal prosecution or incarceration in a penal
        institution, and individuals detained pending arraignment, trial, or sentencingâ€¦Parolees
        who are detained in a treatment center as a condition of parole are prisoners; however,
        persons living in the community and sentenced to community-supervised monitoring, including
        parolees, are not prisoners.&quot; Parolees meeting the definition of prisoner will be
        ineligible for the study.
