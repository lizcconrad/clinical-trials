  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to study the role of low vitamin D levels on the health of blood
      vessels or vascular function in adolescents and young adults with type 1 diabetes.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Vitamin D deficiency is known to be common in patients with type 1 diabetes. Studies in
      adults have shown that vitamin D deficiency is associated with cardiovascular events such as
      stroke, myocardial infarction and peripheral arterial disease. However, the impact of this
      deficiency on vascular health in adolescents with diabetes has not been examined. Furthermore
      given that endothelial dysfunction is reversible, early detection of this process may have
      therapeutic and prognostic implications in this population.

    <measure>Comparison of Endothelial Function</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>We will compare endothelial function in adolescents with type 1 diabetes divided into 2 groups on the basis of vitamin D status (deficient and sufficient).
Endothelial function will be assessed by peripheral arterial tonometry (PAT) which measures the elasticity of the arteries.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Endothelial Function after Treatment with Vitamin D</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 3 or 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>We will measure the change in endothelial function from baseline in the children that were vitamin D deficient. This measurement will be done once the child has become vitamin D sufficient.
Vitamin D status will be assessed at 3 months. If the levels remain deficient treatment would continue for another 3 months, with repeat testing at 6 months.
Endothelial function will be assessed by peripheral arterial tonometry (PAT) which measures the elasticity of the arteries.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Monitoring of Vitamin D Levels in Vitamin D deficient subjects</measure>
    <time_frame>2-3 months</time_frame>
    <description>At a vist to take place at 2-3 months, the Vitamin D deficient sujects will undergo blood sampling for 25 hydroxyvitamin D levels to ensure appropriate treatment with D Drops to normalize 25 OH vitamin D levels greater than 50 nmol/L.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Monitoring of Calcium Creatine Ratio in Vitamin D deficient subjects</measure>
    <time_frame>2-3 months</time_frame>
    <description>At a vist to take place at 2-3 months, the Vitamin D deficient sujects will have a urine assessment of spot calcium creatinine ratio to ensure that hypercalcemia (calcium/ creatinine ratio greater than 0.7) is not present.</description>

    <arm_group_type>No Intervention</arm_group_type>
    <description>Sufficient is defined as a 25 OH vitamin D level &gt;50 nmol/l measured at baseline. No clinical intervention will be assigned to this group.
Subjects will have fasting bloodwork done. Other study measurements to be taken include: height and weight, stage of puberty, blood pressure, vitamin D and calcium intake information, diabetes risk information, demographic information and spot urine sample.
We will also do a non-invasive test called a &quot;PAT&quot; or 'peripheral arterial tonometry' to look at the health of your blood vessels.</description>

    <description>Deficient is defined as a 25 OH vitamin D level ≤ 37.5 nmol/l. This group will receive Vitamin D.
