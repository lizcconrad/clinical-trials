      A study to determine the safety, effectiveness, and acceptability of 2 methods of
      administration of EUR-1008 (APT-1008) (Zenpep® [pancrelipase] delayed release capsule) 3,000
      lipase units capsule, a pancreatic enzyme product (PEP), in infants with exocrine pancreatic
      insufficiency (EPI) due to cystic fibrosis (CF). This study is sponsored by Aptalis Pharma

    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, randomized, open-label, crossover study in pediatric participants with
      EPI due to CF. The study will be carried out in infants between 1 and 12 months of age.

      The study comprises of a screening period (up to 10 days) followed by 2 treatment periods (10
      days each). During the screening period, all participants will be administered Zenpep® 5,000
      (pancrelipase) mixed with a small amount of apple sauce. Once determined eligible for
      participation, participants will be randomized into 1 of 2 treatment sequences. Each sequence
      corresponds to taking one treatment in the first period and the other treatment in the second
      period, and were administered EUR-1008 (APT-1008) (Zenpep® [pancrelipase] delayed release
      capsule) 3,000 lipase units capsule either mixed with apple juice using a syringe nurser or
      apple sauce using a spoon.
