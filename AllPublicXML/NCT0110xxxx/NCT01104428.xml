      Due to high incidence of renal damage by Hench-schonlein Purpura(HSP) is the key to affect
      prognosis, this project moves the research emphasis forward in line with the idea of
      &quot;prevention of progress of disease&quot;, Which concerns on Traditional Chinese Medicine(TCM)
      clinical research scheme evaluation of HSP, evaluates the renal damage and disease recurrence
      as the end event, and comes to the evaluation through the comparative study that the vantage
      point of the scheme of syndrome differentiation and treatment in detoxification, cooling
      blood and removing blood stasis to the conventional treatments can reduce kidney damage and
      recurrence rate.

      Target：Optimize the TCM scheme of syndrome differentiation and treatment of HSP in line with
      the idea of blood- Cooling - Toxin - Removing - Stasis - Dispersing under the path of
      combination between disease differentiation and syndrome differentiation, and regards
      reducing the rate of the recurrence of HSP and kidney damage as the end point of evaluation
      indexes, to evaluate the clinical efficacy of the scheme scientifically. Main research
      contents: Retrospective case investigation, analysis and research on literature, research on
      clinical assessment of the scheme of syndrome differentiation and treatment. Methods：With a
      series of compounds as the main interference factors, choosing the sample estimation of
      superiority design and adopting the test methods of randomized, double-blind,
      placebo-controlled to carry out the research of multicenter clinical efficacy evaluation.

      It summarizes the advantages and rules of syndrome differentiation and treatment in TCM by
      means of the comparative study, which provides technical guidelines for the industry and sets
      an example to summarize the key common technology of clinical research, and also improves the
      evaluation level of TCM clinical research and efficacy.
