      Background:

      - Family and twin studies have suggested that genetic factors influence approximately 50
      percent of a person's susceptibility to type 2 diabetes. Recently, some of the genes involved
      in the development of type 2 diabetes have been identified, in large part by genome-wide
      association studies. Certain risk factors for type 2 diabetes, such as obesity and insulin
      resistance, are highly inheritable, as are diabetic complications such as diabetes-related
      eye and kidney disorders. However, few genes associated or linked with diabetes risk factors
      or complications have been conclusively identified, and more research is needed to study
      specific genetic factors associated with these aspects of diabetes.

      Objectives:

      - To identify and characterize genetic variants associated with type 2 diabetes, its risk
      factors, and its complications.

      Eligibility:

      - Individuals at least 18 years of age who are not pregnant or nursing mothers at the start
      of the study.

      Design:

        -  All participants will provide information about family history, ethnicity and ethnic
           background, occupation, behavioral risk factors, and other data as requested by the
           researchers.

        -  In addition to a general health history, participants will provide specific information
           about diabetes history, with particular emphasis on date of diagnosis, symptoms,
           initiation of insulin therapy, complications, and current medications.

        -  Testing procedures will be different for individuals with and without diabetes. Those
           without diabetes will have an oral glucose tolerance test, while those with diabetes
           will be examined for diabetic complications.

        -  Other tests during the study will include the following:

        -  Physical examination with measurements of height and weight, waist circumference, blood
           pressure, and other tests for individuals who have been diagnosed with diabetes

        -  Glucose tolerance test for those who have not been classified as having diabetes

        -  Retinal photographs

        -  Electrocardiograms

        -  Hepatic Ultrasound

        -  Blood and urine tests

        -  Depending on the results of the examination and laboratory findings, participants may be
           asked to return to the clinic for supplemental interviews, physical examinations, or
           blood tests, or to arrange referrals for medical evaluation and treatment.

        -  Participants who have diabetes will be asked to return for yearly follow-up visits.
           Participants who do not have diabetes at the initial examination will be asked to return
           for follow-up visits every 2 years.

      Genetic factors play an important role in diabetes mellitus, its risk factors and
      complications, but most of the specific genetic determinants remain unidentified. The
      molecular pathways by which diabetes-susceptibility genes influence risk for diabetes and
      related conditions are also largely unknown. This project will seek to identify, and quantify
      the effects of, the genetic determinants of type 2 diabetes, its risk factors and
      complications in a multiethnic sample. Diabetes and glycemic status will be assessed from
      clinical interviews, an oral glucose tolerance test and glycated hemoglobin. Insulin
      sensitivity and insulin secretion will be assessed from indices derived from the oral glucose
      tolerance test. Other potential risk factors for type 2 diabetes (e.g., obesity) and its
      complications (e.g., retinopathy, nephropathy) will be measured. DNA will be collected and
      analyzed to identify genetic variants associated with or linked to diabetes or other traits.
      Studies of gene transcription, protein expression and metabolic profiling will be performed,
      and the resulting patterns will be analyzed for their relationships with diabetes, related
      traits and variants in diabetes susceptibility genes. Individuals will be studied
      longitudinally to determine if gene transcription, protein expression and metabolic profiles
      predict development of diabetes or its complications. These studies will help to determine
      the molecular pathways between genetic variants and susceptibility to type 2 diabetes and its
      complications.
