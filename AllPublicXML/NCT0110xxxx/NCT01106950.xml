    <textblock>
      This is a phase II therapeutic study of related donor HLA-haploidentical NK-cell based
      therapy after a high dose of fludarabine/cyclophosphamide with denileukin diftitox
      preparative regimen for the treatment of poor prognosis acute myelogenous leukemia (AML).

      Patients achieving a complete remission and neutrophil recovery (ANC &gt; 500) for at least 4
      weeks will be considered for allogeneic transplant to prolong remission (independent of this
      study).

      All patients, including those who go on to transplant, will be followed to determine disease
      free survival, treatment related mortality, and time to relapse.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Percent of Patients With Successful Expansion of Natural Killer Cells After Infusion</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 14</time_frame>
    <description>The primary objective of this study was to estimate the incidence of in vivo expansion of natural killer (NK) cells 14 days after infusion of an allogeneic donor product enriched for NK progenitors. Successful in vivo donor NK cell expansion was defined by measuring an absolute circulating donor-derived NK cell count of &gt;100 cells/ul in the patient's peripheral blood 14 days after infusion.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percent of Patients With Complete Remission of Disease</measure>
    <time_frame>At least 4 weeks after last dose (28 days)</time_frame>
    <description>Disease response was defined as complete remission (disease response) by morphologic criteria including &lt;5% blasts in a moderately cellular or cellular marrow. Complete remission was also correlated with NK cell expansion in vivo, IL-15 levels and donor/recipient KIR B genotyping, and Treg depletion.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percent of Patients With Disease Free Survival</measure>
    <time_frame>Month 6</time_frame>
    <description>Number of patients alive and disease free at 6 months. The length of time after treatment ends that a patient survives without any signs or symptoms of that cancer or any other type of cancer. In a clinical trial, measuring the disease-free survival is one way to see how well a new treatment works.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percent of Patients With Incidence of Relapse</measure>
    <time_frame>Month 6</time_frame>
    <description>Number of patients who have had a relapse(the return of disease after its apparent recovery/cessation) after obtaining a complete remission of their disease.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Patients With Treatment-Related Death</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 100</time_frame>
    <description>Number of patients who died within the first 100 days of treatment due to toxicity.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percent of Patients With Natural Killer Cell Expansion Versus KIR Genotype Versus Treg Depletion</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 14</time_frame>
    <description>Association between in vivo natural killer (NK) cell expansion and complete response without platelet recovery (CRp) with donor killer immunoglobulin-like (KIR) genotype and Treg depletion. In vivo donor NK cell expansion was correlated with regulatory T-cell (Treg) depletion as detected on flow cytometry.</description>

        <description>The primary objective of this study was to estimate the incidence of in vivo expansion of natural killer (NK) cells 14 days after infusion of an allogeneic donor product enriched for NK progenitors. Successful in vivo donor NK cell expansion was defined by measuring an absolute circulating donor-derived NK cell count of &gt;100 cells/ul in the patient's peripheral blood 14 days after infusion.</description>
