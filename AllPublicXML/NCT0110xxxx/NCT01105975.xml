  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of your participation in this study is to help answer the following
      research question(s)

        -  Whether LY2484595 in combination with a statin drug (atorvastatin, simvastatin or
           rosuvastatin; currently used to treat abnormal fat or cholesterol in blood) improves the
           blood fat profile more than statins alone.

        -  Whether LY2484595 alone improves blood fats profile compared to sugar pills.

        -  Whether LY2484595 interferes with break down or functioning of statins.

        -  Whether LY2484595 has any side effects that would not support testing it in future
           studies.

      Patients will be stratified according to baseline levels of serum triglycerides (&lt;150 or
      greater than or equal to 150 milligram/deciliter (mg/dL), HDL-C (&lt;45 or greater than or equal
      to 45 mg/dL for men; &lt;50 or greater than or equal to 50 mg/dL for women), and region (United
      States or Europe). After a diet lead-in and prior therapy washout phase, subjects meeting all
      entry criteria will be randomized to one of 10 double-blind treatment groups for a 12 week
      treatment phase. After randomization, patients will self-administer the study drugs once a
      day with a low fat meal as their first meal of the day.

    <measure>Change From Baseline to 18 Weeks Endpoint in EuroQoL Questionnaire - 5 Dimensions (EQ-5D) Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline up to Week 18</time_frame>
    <description>EQ-5D is a health-related, quality-of-life instrument. It allows participants to rate their health state in 5 domains: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and mood. A single score 1 -3 is generated for each domain, with 1=no problem and 3= extreme problems. The outcome ratings on the 5 domains are mapped to a single index through an algorithm. The index ranges 0-1, with the higher score indicating a better health state perceived by the participants. LS Mean values were controlled for region, baseline measurement, treatment, visit, and treatment by visit interaction.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline to 18 Weeks Endpoint in EuroQoL Questionnaire - 5 Dimensions (EQ-5D) Score</title>
        <description>EQ-5D is a health-related, quality-of-life instrument. It allows participants to rate their health state in 5 domains: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and mood. A single score 1 -3 is generated for each domain, with 1=no problem and 3= extreme problems. The outcome ratings on the 5 domains are mapped to a single index through an algorithm. The index ranges 0-1, with the higher score indicating a better health state perceived by the participants. LS Mean values were controlled for region, baseline measurement, treatment, visit, and treatment by visit interaction.</description>
