      RATIONALE: L-arginine supplements may improve the quality of life and erectile function in
      men who are prostate cancer survivors.

      PURPOSE: This randomized phase II trial is studying how well L-arginine supplementation works
      with or without enzyme inhibitors in treating erectile function and quality of life of
      prostate cancer survivors previously treated with radiation therapy.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  To determine the &quot;best dose&quot; (defined as the dose that shows the greatest improvement in
           the erectile function domain of the International Index of Erectile Function [IIEF]
           after 8 weeks of therapy) of an L-arginine/Korean ginseng/gingko biloba/damiana-based
           supplement (L-arginine) to be used in a subsequent phase III trial in prostate cancer
           survivors previously treated with radiotherapy.

      Secondary

        -  Evaluate the toxicity of treatment with L-arginine with or without phosphodiesterase-5
           inhibitors.

        -  Estimate trial accrual, retention, adherence, and variability.

        -  Assess changes in quality of life (QOL) and sexual function as defined by changes in the
           QOL of these patients using the Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite, changes in the
           other domains of the IIEF (i.e., orgasmic function, sexual desire, intercourse
           satisfaction, and overall satisfaction), changes in the Sexual Encounter Profile, and
           changes in the percentage of &quot;yes&quot; (positive) responses to either of the two global
           efficacy questions.

      OUTLINE: Patients are stratified according to age (&lt; 65 years vs ≥ 65 years) and current use
      of phosphodiesterase-5 (PDE-5) inhibitors (yes vs no). Patients are randomized to 1 of 3
      treatment arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients receive oral placebo twice daily (total of 6 capsules per day).

        -  Arm II: Patients receive oral L-arginine and oral placebo twice daily (total of 3
           capsules of each per day).

        -  Arm III: Patients receive oral L-arginine twice daily (total of 6 capsules per day).

      In all arms, treatment continues for 8 weeks in the absence of unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients may also receive oral sildenafil, tadalafil, or vardenafil (PDE-5 inhibitors).

      Patients complete the International Index of Erectile Function and the Expanded Prostate
      Cancer Index Composite-26 at baseline and at weeks 4 and 8. Patients also complete the Sexual
      Encounter Profile Questionnaire, FACT-P, and the Global Efficacy Questionnaire at weeks 4 and
      8.

    <description>The International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF) questionnaire consists of 15 questions, each of which is scored on a 0 to 5 or 1 to 5 scale. It is comprised of five domains, each scored as the sum of 2 to 5 questions. Erectile function is the sum of six questions with a range from 1 to 30. Higher scores indicate better functioning.</description>

  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Quality of Life</measure>
    <time_frame>8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Quality of life is quantified by the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy - Prostate (FACT_P) questionnaire. The FACT questionnaire is comprised of four subscales - social, emotional, functional, and physical. Each subscale is obtained by summing over 6-7 items, each of which is coded on a 0 to 4 scale. Negatively worded questions are reverse scored and higher scores for each subscale indicate better HRQOL. The social, functional, and physical subscales range from 0 to 28 while the emotional subscale ranges from 0 to 24. The overall score (FACT-G) is the sum over the four subscales and ranges from 0 to 108. Patients also completed 12 questions related to prostate cancer, and the prostate subscale score is the sum of those responses (with some items reverse scored). Scores range from 0 to 48, and as with the other FACT subscales higher scores indicate better HRQOL. FACT-P is the sum of FACT-G and the prostate subscale. This questionnaire was added half-way through the study.</description>

        <title>Quality of Life</title>
        <description>Quality of life is quantified by the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy - Prostate (FACT_P) questionnaire. The FACT questionnaire is comprised of four subscales – social, emotional, functional, and physical. Each subscale is obtained by summing over 6-7 items, each of which is coded on a 0 to 4 scale. Negatively worded questions are reverse scored and higher scores for each subscale indicate better HRQOL. The social, functional, and physical subscales range from 0 to 28 while the emotional subscale ranges from 0 to 24. The overall score (FACT-G) is the sum over the four subscales and ranges from 0 to 108. Patients also completed 12 questions related to prostate cancer, and the prostate subscale score is the sum of those responses (with some items reverse scored). Scores range from 0 to 48, and as with the other FACT subscales higher scores indicate better HRQOL. FACT-P is the sum of FACT-G and the prostate subscale. This questionnaire was added half-way through the study.</description>
