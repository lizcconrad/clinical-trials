  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of the study is to describe by a prospective observational study the
      serious adverse events occurring in patients treated off-label by rituximab for Immune
      Thrombocytopenia.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Rituximab (RTX) is used in the treatment of malignant non-Hodgkin's indication for which it
      has been authorized since 1997 and why it is considered effective and well tolerated.
      Rituximab is also effective and well tolerated in combination with methotrexate in severe
      rheumatoid arthritis (RA) refractory to anti-TNF. To date, the RA is the only autoimmune
      disease in which rituximab has proven efficacy in randomized trials and has obtained
      authorization in this indication. There are also data from the literature, for the benefit of
      rituximab in other autoimmune diseases like Lupus, cryoglobulinemia associated to Hepatitis C
      or Sjogren's disease.

      Immune Thrombocytopenia (ITP) is an autoimmune disease in which there is thrombocytopenia due
      in part to destruction of platelets by autoantibodies. In adults, the disease is most often
      chronic and in the most severe forms, the treatment of choice is splenectomy. Rituximab was
      suggested during chronic ITP when used with 4 weekly infusions of 375 mg/m2, 60% of patients
      achieve an immediate response and 30 to 40% a prolonged response. These encouraging results
      and the apparent good tolerance advocate for using rituximab as first-line treatment for
      patients refractory to splenectomy. In France, Afssaps - French Health Products Safety Agency
      has recently issued a temporary protocol processing to authorize rituximab in this
      indication. Nevertheless, many questions remain unresolved, including the tolerance of
      long-term treatment and the risk of late relapse in responders. This justifies the creation
      of this register, whose establishment is recommended by Afssaps - French Health Products
      Safety Agency.
