  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Human metapneumovirus (HMPV) is a virus that can cause respiratory illness. In older adults,
      those with asthma, infants, and children, illness can be severe, but in healthy adults the
      virus frequently causes no symptoms. The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious
      Diseases (NIAID) is working to develop a vaccine for HMPV that could be given to infants.
      Before potential vaccines can be tested, information about how HMPV affects healthy adults is
      needed. This study will examine the effects of exposure to HMPV in healthy adults.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Human metapneumovirus (HMPV), a virus that causes respiratory illness, was first discovered
      in 2001, although humans have been infected with it for at least 50 years. HMPV may cause
      upper respiratory illness or no symptoms at all in healthy adults, but older adults, adults
      with asthma, and children may be at risk of more serious illness. HMPV is a leading cause of
      viral lower respiratory infection (LRI) in children, so finding a vaccine for this virus
      could substantially reduce the instances of childhood respiratory illnesses.

      The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) is developing a vaccine for
      HMPV for use in infants, but before starting clinical trials with potential HMPV vaccines,
      researchers need to study how wild HMPV affects healthy adults. This study will expose
      healthy adults to a dose of the HMPV virus to assess its ability to infect, cause disease,
      and create an immune system response.

      Participation in this study will last approximately 6 months. Participants will be admitted
      to an inpatient unit, where they will stay for 10 full days. On their second day in the unit,
      participants will receive a single dose of the virus, delivered via nose drops. Twice each
      day while participants are inpatients, they will undergo physical exams and have their vital
      signs recorded. Nasal washes and blood samples will be collected before participants receive
      the virus, and then daily nasal washes will be collected until they are discharged from the
      inpatient unit. Participants will be discharged from the unit on the 9th day after receiving
      virus if their nasal wash from Day 8 was free of virus. Follow-up visits will occur 28, 120,
      and 180 days after participants receive the virus. During follow-up visits nasal washes and
      blood samples will be collected.
