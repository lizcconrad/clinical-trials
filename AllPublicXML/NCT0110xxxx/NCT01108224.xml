      PURPOSE: This randomized study included patients diagnosed with breast cancer who
      participated in an intervention including education and group psychotherapy lasting 10 weeks
      after surgery. The purpose of the study was to enhance Quality of Life, coping and social
      relations and to support the women when going through treatment. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We
      randomly assigned 210 patients with primary breast cancer to a control or an intervention
      group. Patients in the intervention group were offered 2 weekly 6-hour sessions of
      psycho-education and eight weekly 2-hour sessions of group psychotherapy. Participants and
      nonparticipants were followed up for QoL, coping and social relations after one, six and
      twelve months post intervention and on vital status 5 years after surgical treatment.
