  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There is evidence that glucocorticoids have an impact on intrusive memories in patients with
      posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Hydrocortisone impairs intrusive memory retrieval
      whereas dexamethasone should strengthen intrusions in PTSD. We, the investigators, want to
      investigate (1) the effect of these two glucocorticoids on traumatic memories and (2) assess
      the neural correlates using the script-driven imagery paradigm in the functional magnetic
      resonance imaging (fMRI) scanner. We hypothesize that intrusive memories are less intensive
      under hydrocortisone-administration and more intense under dexamethasone-administration
      comparing both to a placebo-condition. Regarding the neural activation pattern we expect
      higher activation in the hydrocortisone condition in the amygdala, the hippocampus and the
      medial prefrontal cortex compared to the placebo-condition and less activation in the
      dexamethasone-condition compared to the placebo-condition.

      There is evidence that glucocorticoids have an impact on intrusive memories in patients with
      posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Hydrocortisone impairs intrusive memory retrieval
      whereas dexamethasone should strengthen intrusions in PTSD. We, the investigators, want to
      investigate (1) the effect of these two glucocorticoids on traumatic memories and (2) assess
      the neural correlates using the script-driven imagery paradigm in the functional magnetic
      resonance imaging (fMRI) scanner. Therefore an individual trauma-and an individual neutral
      -script is assessed from each participant, recorded and replayed during fMRI-scanning. We
      hypothesize that intrusive memories are less intense under hydrocortisone-administration and
      more intense under dexamethasone-administration comparing both to a placebo-condition.
      Regarding the neural activation pattern we expect higher activation in the hydrocortisone
      condition in the amygdala, the hippocampus and the medial prefrontal cortex compared to the
      placebo-condition and less activation in the dexamethasone-condition compared to the
