      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of a health literacy/motivational
      intervention in a workplace setting. Parents will be taught how to use a child health book to
      lessen inappropriate use of physician services and improve parent confidence in their ability
      to identify and obtain necessary assistance when their children are ill.
