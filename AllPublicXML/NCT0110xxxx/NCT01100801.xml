      This is an open, non-randomized, multicenter Phase II study evaluating cisplatin plus TS-1 or
      oxaliplatin plus TS-1 as first-line therapy in predicted 'responder' to platinum and
      fluoropyrimidine.

      This study is planned in 3 centers in Singapore and Korea. A total of 30 subjects will be
      enrolled into each treatment arms. Each centers will recruit 15-25 subjects predicted to be
      'responder' to platinum and fluoropyrimidine. The study will consist of a prescreening
      period, a screening period and a treatment period. A fresh tumour biopsy sample will be
      obtained during the prescreening period for gene expression profiling.

      As this is a genomics guided trial, obtaining tissue biopsies is vital to the conduct of the
      trial.

      Patients will have the primary in situ (requirement for entry into trial), endoscopic biopsy
      performed prior to 1st cycle.

    <textblock>
      Gastric cancer is the world's second leading cause of cancer death. For patients with
      unresectable disease or recurrent disease after surgery, the main therapeutic option is
      chemotherapy. Chemotherapy can improve survival and quality of life in patients with advanced
      disease when compared with best supportive care alone.

      Despite a large number of randomized trials, there is no consensus as to the best agent or
      regimen. In general, combination chemotherapy regimens provide higher response rates than do
      single agent, however, this translates into only a modest improvement in outcome with a trade
      off in increased treatment toxicities. The key challenge in managing patients with advanced
      gastric cancer is to identify the appropriate drugs for patients who might benefit for
      palliative chemotherapy.

      Gastric cancer is a heterogeneous disease with differing chemosensitivities to anti-cancer
      drugs. Current selection of standard therapy is often empirical. Gene expression profiling
      has been shown to have the capability to dissect this heterogeneity allowing for
      sub-classification and risk-stratification of cancers according to their biological features
      and clinical outcome. Utilising gene expression data coupled with in-vitro, in-vivo or
      clinical response data is a promising strategy that may enable clinicians to match the right
      drug to the right patient.

      The purpose of the study are:

        1. Assess the feasibility of genomic-guided therapy

        2. Evaluated treatment response of standard-of-care chemotherapy in an enriched patient
           groups defined as 'responder' based on genomic-guided therapy
