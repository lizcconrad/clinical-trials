    <textblock>
      Two previous studies of an HIV preventive vaccine, the STEP study and the Phambili study,
      were halted because people who received the vaccine were more likely to become infected with
      HIV. Why this vaccine failed is still being researched, but one reason may be related to the
      recombinant Adenovirus type 5 (rAd5) virus vector used in the vaccine. Two trials of another
      HIV preventive vaccine that used a rAd5 virus vector were conducted in Uganda. This study
      will obtain follow-up safety information on participants in those trials.

      Two previous trials of an HIV preventive vaccine, referred to as the MRK rAd5 vaccine, were
      halted because people receiving the vaccine were at greater risk of HIV infection. The MRK
      rAd5 vaccine delivered parts of HIV inside a recombinant Ad5 (rAd5) virus vector, which is a
      modified version of a common virus that does not usually cause serious disease. Analyses of
      these trials found that the increased risk of HIV infection was seen only in male
      participants who already had detectable antibodies to Adenovirus type 5 (Ad5).

      A different HIV preventive vaccine developed by the Vaccine Research Center (VRC) at the U.S.
      National Institutes of Health (NIH) also uses a rAd5 virus vector. Although this vaccine,
      referred to as VRC Ad5, uses a rAd5 virus vector, it is structured and delivered differently
      than the MRK rAd5 vaccine. In two trials in Uganda it has shown no serious side effects. This
      study will perform safety follow-ups on participants in these two trials, RV 156A/WRAIR 1078A
      and RV 172/WRAIR 1218. Participants who received either the vaccine or the placebo will be
      recruited in order to compare health and HIV status.

      Participants in this study will complete eight clinic visits over 1 year and 2 weeks. Four
      visits will be completed at baseline and after 4, 8, and 12 months. During these visits,
      participants will be checked for health changes and complete a blood draw. As part of the
      blood tests performed, participants will be tested for HIV. Every 2 weeks after the four
      visits mentioned (on Days 14, 134, 254, and 374), participants will return to the clinic to
      receive the results of their HIV tests. On all eight visits, participants will also receive
      HIV risk reduction counseling.
