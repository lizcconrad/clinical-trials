    <description>Dry blood spots (DBS) analysis of a- galactosidase-A activity will be used for male patients' diagnosis. Males and females with enzymatic activity bellow the test's cut-off will be further diagnosed by gene sequencing. Since females are heterozygote and may have high residual levels of active enzyme, female patients with a- galactosidase-A activity of 30% bellow averaged normal range will also be further diagnosed by gene sequencing as described before (8).</description>
