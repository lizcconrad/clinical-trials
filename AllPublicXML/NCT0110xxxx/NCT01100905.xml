  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Military personnel face intense physical and cognitive demands. Diminished iron status
      affects physiologic responses to these challenges. Both cross-sectional and longitudinal
      studies indicate a significant decrement in iron status in enlisted female military personnel
      immediately following basic combat training (BCT). Decrements in iron status are associated
      with diminished cognitive and physical performance, and may affect body composition. The
      primary objective of this randomized, placebo controlled study is to assess the utility of an
      iron-containing food product for maintaining iron status during BCT. This study will provide
      insight into the utility and efficacy of an iron-containing food product for the maintenance
      of iron status during military training. Furthermore, it will provide novel scientific data
      regarding the relationship between iron status and physical and cognitive performance in
      female Soldiers.
