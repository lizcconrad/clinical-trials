  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Previous NIH funded Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) trials in children found
      that daily stimulant therapy produced sustained growth deficits. However, no federally funded
      studies have examined the growth suppression associated with modern once a day stimulant
      medications. Therefore, this study will precisely estimate the risks of stimulant induced
      growth suppression (SIGS), examine the underlying mechanisms and develop treatments for it.
      While drug holidays and caloric supplementation are two common treatments for SIGS, there has
      been little systematic investigation of either. It is unknown if they are effective or
      feasible. Therefore, using a randomized adaptive design, we will evaluate the efficacy and
      feasibility of these two practices vs. routine monitoring of growth in 180 prepubertal
      children with ADHD. An additional 50 subjects will be treated solely with behavioral
      therapies to evaluate for growth abnormalities associated with ADHD. The study will assess
      will the risk of SIGS with ER stimulants and the underlying mechanisms while providing
      evidenced-based treatments for its management.

      The study will consist of 4 parts:

        1. Screening assessment to determine if a child has ADHD and would be a good candidate to
           have their ADHD treated with an extended release (ER) stimulant medication. If the
           answer to step one is yes, then the child will be randomly assigned to receive either
           medication treatment with an extended release MPH product (OROS MPH). 78% of children
           with start with this option with 22% assigned to behavioral therapy/counseling
           treatments for ADHD. There will be no placebo treatments used in this study. All
           children must be between the ages of 5 and 12 and never have taken stimulant medications
           for ADHD for more than one week to be eligible for the study.

        2. Initial Treatment Phase: The dose of the assigned treatment option will be gradually
           adjusted over the course of the first 3 months until the child's ADHD is well
           controlled. If the child is assigned to medication, he/she will start with a low dose of
           the ER MPH product, and it will be gradually increased until his/her ADHD is in good
           control. Children assigned to medication will be asked to take it every day of the week
           for at least the first 6 months. Children assigned to behavior therapy will be asked to
           avoid using medication for the first 6 months of the study. After month 6 if the first
           treatment is not effective, the child will be given the chance to try the other option.
           If any treatment is causing a concerning side effect, he/she can stop taking it at any
           time and we will provide him/her with other treatment options as part of the study.

        3. Ongoing Treatment Phase: We will continue to provide these ADHD treatments for a total
           of 30 months (2 1/2 years). The dose or type of therapy may be adjusted if needed. The
           child will be monitored every 1-3 months over this time span. Monitoring includes doctor
           visits to assess growth and side effects of medication, regular contact with his/her
           teacher to assess function at school and with you to assess function at home. In total,
           the child will receive study treatments for approximately 30 months and will be required
           to come to our center for a minimum of 18 follow up visits over this time. The average
           visit should take 30 minutes or less.

        4. Weight Recovery Phase: Any child whose body mass index or BMI declines by a concerning
           amount will be randomly assigned to receive 1 of 3 weight promotion treatments to
           stabilize his/her BMI in order to see if this prevents suppression of height (keeps them
           growing to be as tall as they should be). We do not expect children assigned to the
           behavior therapy arm to need these treatments, but the identical weight promotion
           treatments will be available for children in this group if the need arises.

      A) Extra monitoring: A doctor will check the child's growth every month (instead of every 3
      months) until his/her BMI has returned to normal.The child will stay on the current daily
      dose of medication or behavior therapy.

      B) Caloric supplementation: Parents will be provided with a flavored calorie drink to give to
      your child every night and continue on the same daily dose and frequency of medication or
      behavior therapy. The child will have their growth monitored monthly by a study doctor.

      C) Drug Holiday: Participants will now only take medication on school days. Children assigned
      to behavior therapy will not participate in this treatment as they are not taking any study
      medication. The child will have their growth monitored monthly by a study doctor.

      Once the child's weight recovers, these extra treatments will end and he/she will return to
      the prior medication treatment (medication7 days a week or behavior therapy) in step 3 and to
      every 3 month growth assessments. Any time the child's BMI declines again, the extra
      treatments will restart again.

    <description>in addition to the primary outcome of height at month 30, change in z-height from baseline to study month 6 post is also reported. Subjects who were still moderately impaired after 6 months in their initial treatment arm were allowed to cross over and receive the treatments in the other arm so prior to month 6 no participants randomized to behavior arm were prescribed study medication.
This outcome includes all participants with 2+ growth assessments from the behavior therapy and ER stimulant arms. Doesn't include adaptive randomization arms (drug holiday, cal supplement, monitoring) as they didn't exist until 2nd randomization which did not occur until after this assessment period was over.
Height converted to z score to account for differences in age and gender. More negative values reflecting smaller incremental height gain.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  children meeting criteria for any subtype of ADHD between the ages of 5-12 who are
             stimulant naive

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Children who meet any of the following criteria will not be eligible to participate in
             this study:

               -  children with a Full Scale Intelligence Quotient (I below 70 as children with IQs
                  less than this would likely not benefit from the behavior therapy intervention

               -  not in full time school or less than 5 or older than 12 years at the time of the
                  screening visit

               -  children who have a history of seizures or other neurological problems and are
                  taking medication to prevent seizures as stimulants could worsen seizures

               -  children with a history of other medical problems for whom psychostimulant
                  treatment may involve considerable risk including cardiac arrhythmias,
                  hypertension, Tourette's Disorder or history of severe tic exacerbations
                  secondary to stimulant exposure

               -  children with a history of other medical problems that could impact appetite or
                  weight such as hypothyroidism, diabetes mellitus, liver or renal disease. Also,
                  children using prescription medication that can significantly impact appetite or
                  weight are excluded

               -  children with a childhood history or diagnosis of any of the following mental
                  health disorders: pervasive developmental disorder, schizophrenia or other
                  psychotic disorders, bipolar disorder, post traumatic stress disorder, major
                  depression with serious suicidal thoughts or an eating disorder as stimulants are
                  not safe and effective treatments for these conditions, and these diseases could
                  affect eating habits

               -  children whose Body Mass Index is very low (too light for safe use of stimulant
                  medication) or is too high (overweight so not suitable for weight promotion
                  treatments)

               -  children allergic to milk proteins as they are in the caloric supplement (lactose
                  intolerance okay)

               -  children previously treated with stimulant medications for more than 30 days as
                  this study is focusing on children who have never used stimulant medication
                  before.

        <description>in addition to the primary outcome of height at month 30, change in z-height from baseline to study month 6 post is also reported. Subjects who were still moderately impaired after 6 months in their initial treatment arm were allowed to cross over and receive the treatments in the other arm so prior to month 6 no participants randomized to behavior arm were prescribed study medication.
This outcome includes all participants with 2+ growth assessments from the behavior therapy and ER stimulant arms. Doesn't include adaptive randomization arms (drug holiday, cal supplement, monitoring) as they didn't exist until 2nd randomization which did not occur until after this assessment period was over.
Height converted to z score to account for differences in age and gender. More negative values reflecting smaller incremental height gain.
If participant dropped out prior to month 6, then the last assessment point was used.</description>

        <description>measures change in height z score from baseline to last assessment with participants grouped based on actual medication usage versus randomly assigned group since participants were allowed to cross treatment arms after 6 months and not all participants assigned to medication used it consistently. The rarely med group (n=44) used med &lt;12.5% of the study duration (with most using not at all). The consistent med group (N=38 used) med for at least 87.5% of their time in the study with most using the entire time. The inconsistent med group (N=111), used medication between 12.5 to 87.5 of the time (mean time on med was 45% of the time in the study) The other 37 participants did not have one year of growth data so were excluded from this analysis. Z scores used to account for differences in age and gender between groups. More negative values reflecting a smaller incremental height gain.</description>

        <title>Difference in Height z Score During Weight Recovery Phase (Second Randomization) by Actual Usage</title>
        <description>difference in height z score from entry into weight recovery phase to exit from that phase (exact duration varied by participant). Randomization could not occur before month 6 (so max of 24 month duration) but could start as late as month 29 (equaling a 1 month duration) based on the pattern of zBMI change. In this post hoc analysis we grouped participants by what they did (caloric supplementation, drug holiday or monitoring) not what they were randomly assigned to. The most common change was from drug holiday to monitoring for participants who were not using medication on weekends before assignment to drug holiday (family stopped weekend med by own accord prior to 2nd randomization) so assignment to drug holiday did not alter actual frequency of use as was designed to.Therefore they were reclassified as monitoring as frequency of med use did not change.
Z score used to account for differences in age and gender between groups. Larger values reflect greater height change.</description>

        <description>difference in height z score from entry into weight recovery phase to exit from that phase (exact duration varied by participant). Randomization could not occur before month 6 (so max of 24 month duration) but could start as late as month 29 (equaling a 1 month duration) based on the pattern of zBMI change. In this post hoc analysis we grouped participants by what they did (caloric supplementation, drug holiday or monitoring) not what they were randomly assigned to. The most common change was from drug holiday to monitoring for participants who were not using medication on weekends before assignment to drug holiday (family stopped weekend med by own accord prior to 2nd randomization) so assignment to drug holiday did not alter actual frequency of use as was designed to.Therefore they were reclassified as monitoring as frequency of med use did not change.
Z score used to account for differences in age and gender between groups. Higher values reflect greater incremental weight gain.</description>

Population is all participants with at least a baseline side effect rating and at least one additional rating of adverse events post baseline which is 212 cases total. This differs from other enrollment numbers as not all participants assigned to each group completed side effect assessments. We did not want to include missing cases as negative cases (no side effects) as that would impact side effect rates.</time_frame>

There participants could have come from either of the other two arms- initially assigned to either med or behavior. We added this post hoc arm as a subset of participants randomized to med never used med and a subset of behavior randomized participants did use medication. This group reports adverse event rates only in participants who used med for a sufficient duration to have their dose optimized.</description>
