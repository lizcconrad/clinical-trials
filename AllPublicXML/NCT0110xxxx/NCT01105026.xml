      The aim of this study was to evaluate by histology and MSCT scans during a 7-month period,
      the efficacy of a bioactive glass (Inion BioRestore™) placed in human extraction sockets in
      the maintenance of alveolar ridge.

      14 subjects in need of implant therapy were enrolled in the study. A total of 32 teeth were
      extracted and the fresh sockets underwent to ridge preservation procedures using Inion
      BioRestore™. Two different time points (1 week and 3 months after RPP) MSCT scans for each
      patient were used as a basis for bone change analysis occurred in the localized grafted
      alveolar sites. Twenty-two biopsied, representative of intermediate (3-4 months, n=10) and
      late phase (6-7 months, n=12) of healing, were harvested and histologically analysed.

    <description>Patients underwent surgery under local anesthesia and minimally invasive periotomy was carried out with a surgical blade. Atraumatic extraction with forceps was performed. The extraction socket was carefully curetted to remove the granulation tissue and was rinsed with a physiologic solution. To evaluate the eligibility of the surgical site, the alveolar walls integrity was checked clinically and by means of extemporaneous peri-apical radiography.
Then, the socket was filled to the bone margin with Inion BioRestore™ (granules size 1 to 2 millimetres). Finally, single interrupted (5-0) sutures were tightened to promote the stability of grafted particles. Ten days after the surgery, sutures were removed.</description>
