  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      PCSK9 (Proprotein convertase subtilisin kexin type 9) plays a key role in LDL-cholesterol
      (LDLC) metabolism by inhibiting LDL receptor (LDLR) at post-transcriptional level. PCSK9 loss
      of function mutations are associated to decreased LDLC levels and a cardiovascular
      protection. In this context, the development of pharmacological inhibitors of PCSK9, in
      association with statins treatment, represents a major therapeutic issue for LDLC modulation.
      It was previously shown that PCSK9 plasmatic concentration correlated with plasmatic LDLC, TG
      and glucose concentrations. However, no data are available on predictive value of PCSK9
      plasmatic level concerning coronary disease severity.

      The main objective of this study is to determine whether plasmatic PCSK9 concentration is
      linked to coronary damage severity in patients with acute coronary syndrome.

    <description>200 patients will be enrolled in the study (n=100 patients under statin treatment, n=100 patients without statin).
After checking inclusion and non-inclusion criteria and obtaining informed consent from the patients. The SYNTAX score will be calculated and will allow to determine coronary analysis will be done at J1 and J4 (glucose, HbA1C, lipids, ApoA1, ApoB, sterols, plasmatic bile acids, insulinemia, creatinin clearance, hepatic function panel, CRPus and PCSK9 level assessment).
Then, a sub-group of 30 patients will have supplementary blood analysis at 1 and 6 months after their admission, during their usual follow-up.</description>
