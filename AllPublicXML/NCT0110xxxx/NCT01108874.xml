      The purpose of this study is to find the best dose of metaraminol to be used in patients
      during elective cesarean sections.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the effective dose 90% (ED90) of metaraminol to
      treat hypotension after spinal anesthesia in elective cesarean sections (CS). It is a
      double-blind study that uses the biased-coin up-down sequential allocation method to
      determine the ED90 of metaraminol.

      Baseline systolic blood pressure (SBP) will be determined by three automated measures 3
      minutes apart just before CS. During the period from induction of spinal anesthesia to fetal
      delivery SBP will be monitored every minute and metaraminol will be administered every time
      it is lower than baseline value. If SBP falls below 80% of baseline value, the treatment will
      be considered a failure. An adequate response will be defined as the absence of hypotension
      during the study period.
