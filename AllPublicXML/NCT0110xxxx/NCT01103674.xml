      The purpose of this feasibility study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the
      epicardial / endocardial combined procedure for the treatment of drug refractory symptomatic
      Paroxysmal Atrial Fibrillation (AF) patients, using the nContact Numeris®-AF Guided
      Coagulation System with VisiTrax® epicardially and the Biosense Webster NaviStar® ThermoCool®
      Diagnostic/Ablation deflectable Tip Catheter in conjunction with the Carto Navigation System
      endocardially.
