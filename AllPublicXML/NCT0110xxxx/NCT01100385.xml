    <textblock>
      Does tomato extract improve blood vessel function in healthy people and people with
      cardiovascular disease?

      Atherosclerosis ('furring' of the arteries) affects the functioning of blood vessels,
      narrowing and eventually blocking them, causing conditions like heart attack and stroke. The
      Mediterranean diet, which is rich in tomatoes and tomato-based products, has been shown to be
      associated with a reduced risk of blood vessel damage. In this double blind,
      placebo-controlled randomised study, the investigators will investigate whether a food
      supplement containing a standardised extract of tomato improves blood vessel function in both
      healthy people (aged 40-80), and people with a history of cardiovascular disease. The food
      supplement is on sale to the public, and the investigators are testing the standard dose.
      Approximately 72 people will take part at the Clinical Pharmacology Unit at the ACCI
      Building, Cambridge University Hospitals NHS Trust.

      After they have passed screening tests, participants will be allocated by chance to receive
      either the tomato extract product (Ateronon), or a matching placebo (a dummy capsule with no
      active ingredients), which they will take once a day for 8 weeks. At the beginning and end of
      the treatment period, the investigators will test blood vessel stiffness using an ECG machine
      and external probe. The investigators will also measure forearm blood flow, which involves
      infusing 3 separate agents that affect how the lining of the blood vessel wall works, and
      helps to assess whether this is affected by the study treatment. Blood tests will also be
      used to look at how the food supplement is working and its effects on cholesterol and markers
      of inflammation. Including the screening period, and a follow-up telephone call two weeks
      after the end of treatment, participants will be in the study for 14 weeks.
