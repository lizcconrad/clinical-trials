      This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of veliparib when given together
      with cisplatin and vinorelbine ditartrate in treating patients with breast cancer that has
      returned or spread to other parts of the body. Veliparib may stop the growth of tumor cells
      by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as
      cisplatin and vinorelbine ditartrate, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor
      cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from
      spreading. Giving veliparib together with combination chemotherapy may be a better treatment
      for breast cancer.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of ABT-888 (veliparib) when administered
      daily for 14 days out of a 21 day cycle in combination with cisplatin and vinorelbine
      (vinorelbine ditartrate) in subjects with metastatic triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) and
      breast cancer (BRCA) mutation associated breast cancer.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Assess the pharmacokinetic profile of ABT-888 when combined with cisplatin and vinorelbine
      and the safety/tolerability profile of the combination.

      II. Evaluate the level of poly ADP ribose polymerase (PARP) inhibition at each dose level to
      determine whether maximal PARP inhibition is achieved.

      III. Identify the subgroup of triple negative breast cancer patients who will potentially
      derive the most benefits from PARP inhibition combined with platinum-based chemotherapy.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of veliparib.

      Patients receive veliparib orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on days 1-14 (days 0-13 of course 1
      only). Patients also receive cisplatin intravenously (IV) over 1 hour on day 1 and
      vinorelbine ditartrate IV over 10-20 minutes on days 1 and 8. Treatment repeats every 21 days
      for 6-10 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Treatment
      with veliparib alone may continue in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed for up to 30 days.
