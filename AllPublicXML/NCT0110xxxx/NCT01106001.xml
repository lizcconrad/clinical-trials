    <textblock>
      The hypothesis of this study is that isolated use of local periarticular levobupivicaine
      injection during primary hip arthroplasty would improve post-operative pain control. Patients
      were randomised in the operating room to receive either a periarticular infiltration, or a
      placebo consisting of Saline. Morphine and analgesic consumption was recorded for each
      patient, while the modified McGill pain scale was used to determine the adequacy of analgesia
      and the benefit of the peri-articular infiltration. 91 patients were recruited, with 45
      patients in the treatment group and 46 controls. The results were assessed after one year,
      once all the information from both treatment groups was collected.

    <textblock>
      The efficacy of periarticular injections during total knee arthroplasty is well established
      but there is little published data on their effect in primary hip arthroplasty. We
      hypothesized that isolated use of local periarticular levobupivicaine injection during
      primary hip arthroplasty would improve post-operative pain control. A double blinded,
      randomised, placebo-controlled trial on patients undergoing primary hip arthroplasty was
      performed. Patients were randomised in theatre to receive either a periarticular infiltration
      of 150mg levobupivicaine in 60mls of 0.9% Saline, or a placebo consisting of 60mls 0.9%
      Saline. Morphine and analgesic consumption was recorded for each patient, while the modified
      McGill pain scale was used to determine the adequacy of analgesia and the benefit of the
      peri-articular infiltration. 91 patients were recruited, with 45 patients in the treatment
      group and 46 controls. The results were assessed after one year, once all the information
      from both treatment groups was collected.

    <description>The treatment group received 150mg of levobupivicaine in 60mls of 0.9% saline. This was injected intra-operatively through the medial and anterior capsular spaces in the region of the obturator and femoral nerves and also around the short rotators and gluteus maximus in the region of the inferior and superior gluteal nerves. The timing of this was after insertion of the acetabular component. 10mls was then infiltrated around the tensor fascia lata and subcutaneously prior to closing the wound.</description>
