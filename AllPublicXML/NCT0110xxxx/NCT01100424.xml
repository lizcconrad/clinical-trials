        Inclusion Criteria:

        For non-lens wearers:

          -  Normal eyes.

          -  Currently not wearing contact lenses and has not worn contact lenses for the previous
             6 months.

          -  Free of dry eye using the Ocular Surface Disease Index (Schiffman et al).

          -  Other protocol-defined inclusion criteria may apply.

        For contact lens wearers:

          -  Currently wearing soft contact lenses.

          -  Free of dry eye during lens wear using the Contact Lens Dry Eye Questionnaire
             Short-Form (Nichols et al, Cornea, 2002).

          -  Reports a contact lens wearing time of at least 12 hours per day, 7 days per week,
             daily wear basis (not overnight wear).

          -  Reports only occasional use of contact lens rewetting drops or artificial tears.

          -  Other protocol-defined inclusion criteria may apply.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        For non-lens wearers and contact lens wearers:

          -  Pregnant.

          -  Participating in another research study.

          -  Exhibiting staining with fluorescein in more than 5% of the total cornea (graded by
             &quot;extent&quot; of staining across 5 regions).

          -  Other protocol-defined exclusion criteria may apply.
