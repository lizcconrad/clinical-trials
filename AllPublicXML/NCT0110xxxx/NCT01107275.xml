    <textblock>
      700 male and female healthy school-children (age 5 to 8) in Thailand were randomized to
      receive 2 or 3 primary rabies vaccine doses (PCECV, Rabipur) given intradermally in a dose of
      0.1mL into the skin in the deltoid region. In a subset of 100 children blood was taken for
      rabies virus neutralizing antibody determination on day 49. All subjects were randomized to
      receive 2 booster doses (the recommended vaccination schedule for pre-immunized individuals
      in case of an exposure) on days 0 and 3, one, three or five years later. Blood was taken
      before and after booster for up to one year.Safety and tolerability of the vaccine was
      assessed and persistence of immune response up to 1 year after the booster doses.
