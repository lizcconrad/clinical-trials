  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background:

        -  Tumors of the thymus are rare and can be treated with surgery, but it is often difficult
           to determine whether a thymic tumor is malignant based on biopsy alone and the long-term
           survival rate is less than 50 percent. Because thymic tumors are so rare, most treatment
           knowledge comes from a relatively small series of cases, and the choice of treatment
           usually depends on the hospital or clinic staff's experience and familiarity with a
           given chemotherapy and surgery regimen.

        -  Belinostat is an investigational anticancer drug that has not yet been approved by the
           Food and Drug Administration for use in any cancer. Researchers are interested in
           determining whether belinostat can be combined with conventional chemotherapy to safely
           and effectively treat advanced thymic cancer.

      Objectives:

        -  To determine a safe and tolerable dose of belinostat that can be given in combination
           with cisplatin, doxorubicin, and cyclophosphamide.

        -  To determine if belinostat (combined with the abovementioned standard chemotherapy
           regimen) is effective against thymic cancer cells.

      Eligibility:

      - Individuals at least 18 years of age who have been diagnosed with advanced or recurrent
      thymic malignancy that is not considered to be curable with surgery or radiation therapy, and
      who have not received previous chemotherapy treatment.

      Design:

        -  Participants will be screened with a physical exam, blood tests, and imaging studies as
           directed by the study researchers.

        -  Participants will receive six 21-day cycles (18 weeks) of treatment with belinostat in
           combination with cisplatin, doxorubicin, and cyclophosphamide. The treatment will
           require continuous infusion over 3 days, and participants will remain in the treatment
           center during this time. Participants will have regular blood tests, clinic visits, and
           imaging studies during the treatment period.

        -  Participants who complete the six treatment cycles with no severe side effects may be
           offered the option to continue treatment with belinostat alone.

        -  After the 18-week study period, participants will return for regular follow-up exams for
           at least 4 weeks, and will be asked to remain in contact with the study researchers once
           a year to continue to study long-term effects....

      Background:

        -  New options for the treatment of patients with advanced thymoma and thymic carcinoma are
           needed.

        -  Belinostat, N-hydroxy-3-(phenylsulphamoylphenyl) acrylamide, is a hydroxamic acid
           deacetylase inhibitor that is able to inhibit both histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDAC)
           Class I and II enzymes.

        -  An ongoing phase II study of belinostat in recurrent or metastatic thymic malignancies
           has shown activity which warrants further consideration of belinostat in the first line.

        -  Belinostat alterations in target protein levels due to gene expression changes may allow
           increased sensitivity of cancer cells to conventional chemotherapy.

      Objectives:

      Primary Objectives

        -  In the Phase I portion the primary objective will be to determine a safe and tolerable
           phase 2 dose, dose limiting toxicities (DLTs) and preliminary activity for the
           combination of belinostat by continuous intravenous (IV) infusion (CIVI) with cisplatin,
           doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide in patients with advanced thymic malignancies.

        -  In the Phase II portion the primary objective will be to determine the clinical response
           rate (partial response (PR)+complete response (CR)) of belinostat in combination with
           cisplatin, doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide in the first line treatment of patients with
           advanced thymic malignancies.

      Secondary Objectives

        -  To determine time to response, duration of response, progression free survival (PFS) and
           overall survival (OS).

        -  To determine the toxicity profile and safety of this combination.

        -  To assess exploratory correlative markers in relation to response to treatment
           (immunohistochemistry and array Comparative Genomic Hybridization (CGH))

      Eligibility:

        -  Patients with histologically confirmed advanced thymic malignancies who are chemotherapy
           na(SqrRoot) ve.

        -  Measurable disease by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) criteria

        -  Adequate renal, hepatic and hematopoietic function

      Design:

        -  The Phase I portion of the study will consist of four dose levels and dose escalations
           will follow according to traditional 3 patient cohorts.

        -  Once the maximum tolerated doe is determined, the phase II portion of the study will
           begin.

        -  Belinostat will be given as a 48h CIVI starting on day 1, doxorubicin as a slow
           intravenous (IV) injection on days 2 and 3, cisplatin will be infused over 1 hour on day
           2 and cyclophosphamide as a slow IV infusion on Day 3.

        -  Treatment will be given every 21 days for no more than 6 cycles or until disease
           progression. Treatment with belinostat alone may continue until disease progression.

    <description>Response is defined by the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST). Complete response (CR) is disappearance of all target lesions. Any pathological lymph nodes (whether target or non-target) must have reduction in short axis to &lt;10 mm. Partial response (PR) is at least a 30% decrease in the sum of the diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum diameters. Progressive disease (PD) is at least a 20% increase in the sum of the diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum on study (this includes the baseline sum if that is the smallest on study). In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum must also demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 5 mm. (Note: the appearance of one or more new lesions is also considered progressions). Stable disease (SD) is neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for PD, taking as reference the smallest sum diameters while on study.</description>

          1. Patients who have had major surgery or radiotherapy within 3 weeks of enrollment.

          2. Patients may not be receiving any other investigational agents.

          3. Patients with known brain metastases should be excluded from this clinical trial
             because of their poor prognosis and because they often develop progressive neurologic
             dysfunction that would confound the evaluation of neurologic and other adverse events.
             However, patients who have had treatment for their brain metastases and whose brain
             metastatic disease status has remained stable for at least 1 month without steroids
             may be enrolled at the discretion of the principal investigator.

          4. History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic
             composition to belinostat or other agents used in study.

          5. Patients with prior treatment with drugs of the HDAC inhibitor class are excluded,
             except for valproic acid (VPA) where prior treatment is accepted as long as it is not
             within the last 2 weeks before enrolment.

          6. Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac
             arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with
             study requirements.

          7. Pregnant women are excluded from this study because belinostat is an HDAC inhibitor
             with the potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects. Because there is an
             unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to
             treatment of the mother with belinostat, breastfeeding should be discontinued if the
             mother is treated with belinostat. These potential risks may also apply to other
             agents used in this study.

          8. Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-positive patients on combination antiretroviral
             therapy are ineligible because of the potential for pharmacokinetic interactions with
             belinostat. In addition, these patients are at increased risk of lethal infections
             when treated with marrow-suppressive therapy. Appropriate studies will be undertaken
             in patients receiving combination antiretroviral therapy when indicated.

          9. Marked baseline prolongation of Q wave, T wave (QT)/corrected QT interval (QTc)
             interval, e.g., repeated demonstration of a QTc interval &gt; 500 ms; Long QT Syndrome.
             Patients taking medications that may cause QTc prolongation will be eligible as long
             as they comply with the recommendations in appendix D.

         10. History of another invasive malignancy in the last five years. Adequately treated
             non-invasive, non-melanoma skin cancers as well as in situ carcinoma of the cervix
             will be allowed.

         11. Patients with tumor amenable to potentially curative therapy as assessed by the
             investigator.

At dose levels 1 and 2, patients received the same doses of doxorubicin (25mg/m(2) on days 2 and 3, intravenous push over 3-5 minutes), cisplatin (50 mg/m(2) over 60 minutes intravenous on day 2 after doxorubicin), and cyclophosphamide (500mg/m(2) over 60 minutes intravenous on day 3 after doxorubicin). Combination of chemotherapy and belinostat was repeated every 21 days for a total of 6 cycles unless there was evidence of disease progression or intolerance of the study treatment.

        <description>The MTD is defined as the highest dose at which less than 2 out of 6 patients experienced a dose limiting toxicity (DLT). A DLT is defined as grade 4 neutropenia lasting more than 7 days despite prophylactic or therapeutic use of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF), febrile neutropenia defined as absolute neutrophil count (ANC) less than 1000/mm(3) and temperature more than 38.5 degrees Celsius or 100.4 degrees Fahrenheit or life threatening sepsis, grade 4 thrombocytopenia or grade 3 thrombocytopenia associated with bleeding during the first cycle of therapy. Any grade 3 or 4 non-hematologic toxicity was considered dose limiting with the following exceptions: grade 3 diarrhea lasting less than 48 hours, grade 3 nausea and/or vomiting lasting less than 48 hours, grade 3 electrolyte abnormalities lasting less than 48 hours, grade 3 creatinine elevation lasting less than 48 hours.</description>

At dose levels 1 and 2, patients received the same doses of doxorubicin (25mg/m(2) on days 2 and 3, intravenous push over 3-5 minutes), cisplatin (50 mg/m(2) over 60 minutes intravenous on day 2 after doxorubicin), and cyclophosphamide (500mg/m(2) over 60 minutes intravenous on day 3 after doxorubicin). Combination of chemotherapy and belinostat was repeated every 21 days for a total of 6 cycles unless there was evidence of disease progression or intolerance of the study treatment.
A conventional 3 + 3 dose escalation design was used to determine maximum tolerated dose (MTD).</description>

At dose levels 1 and 2, patients received the same doses of doxorubicin (25mg/m(2) on days 2 and 3, intravenous push over 3-5 minutes), cisplatin (50 mg/m(2) over 60 minutes intravenous on day 2 after doxorubicin), and cyclophosphamide (500mg/m(2) over 60 minutes intravenous on day 3 after doxorubicin). Combination of chemotherapy and belinostat was repeated every 21 days for a total of 6 cycles unless there was evidence of disease progression or intolerance of the study treatment.
A conventional 3 + 3 dose escalation design was used to determine maximum tolerated dose (MTD).</description>

          <title>Number of Participants With Grade 3 and 4 Dose Limiting Toxicity (DLT) at 2000mg/m(2) Belinostat</title>
          <description>A DLT is defined as grade 4 neutropenia lasting more than 7 days despite prophylactic or therapeutic use of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF), febrile neutropenia defined as absolute neutrophil count (ANC) less than 1000/mm(3) and temperature more than 38.5 degrees Celsius or 100.4 degrees Fahrenheit or life threatening sepsis, grade 4 thrombocytopenia or grade 3 thrombocytopenia associated with bleeding during the first cycle of therapy. Any grade 3 or 4 non-hematologic toxicity was considered dose limiting with the following exceptions: grade 3 diarrhea lasting less than 48 hours, grade 3 nausea and/or vomiting lasting less than 48 hours, grade 3 electrolyte abnormalities lasting less than 48 hours, grade 3 creatinine elevation lasting less than 48 hours.</description>

        <title>Clinical Response</title>
        <description>Response is defined by the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST). Complete response (CR) is disappearance of all target lesions. Any pathological lymph nodes (whether target or non-target) must have reduction in short axis to &lt;10 mm. Partial response (PR) is at least a 30% decrease in the sum of the diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum diameters. Progressive disease (PD) is at least a 20% increase in the sum of the diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum on study (this includes the baseline sum if that is the smallest on study). In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum must also demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 5 mm. (Note: the appearance of one or more new lesions is also considered progressions). Stable disease (SD) is neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for PD, taking as reference the smallest sum diameters while on study.</description>

            <description>PXD101 (Belinostat) will be given as a 48h continuous intravenous infusion (CIVI) starting on day 1, doxorubicin as a slow intravenous (IV) injection on days 2, 3, cisplatin will be infused over 1 hr on day 2 and cyclophosphamide as a slow IV infusion on Day 3. Treatment will be given every 21 days for no more than 6 cycles or until disease progression. Treatment with PXD101 alone may continue until disease progression.
The thymic tumors are rare tumors that arise from the thymus and are histologically composed of epithelial cells which are the putative source of malignancy, B and T lymphocytes, interdigitating reticulum cells, macrophages, and myeloid cells. The most common tumors of the thymus are thymomas (well-differentiated neoplasms), atypical thymomas (moderately differentiated neoplasms) and thymic (poorly differentiated neoplasms) carcinomas.</description>

The most common tumors of the thymus are thymomas (well-differentiated neoplasms), atypical thymomas (moderately differentiated neoplasms) and thymic (poorly differentiated neoplasms) carcinomas.</description>

          <title>Clinical Response</title>
          <description>Response is defined by the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST). Complete response (CR) is disappearance of all target lesions. Any pathological lymph nodes (whether target or non-target) must have reduction in short axis to &lt;10 mm. Partial response (PR) is at least a 30% decrease in the sum of the diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum diameters. Progressive disease (PD) is at least a 20% increase in the sum of the diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum on study (this includes the baseline sum if that is the smallest on study). In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum must also demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 5 mm. (Note: the appearance of one or more new lesions is also considered progressions). Stable disease (SD) is neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for PD, taking as reference the smallest sum diameters while on study.</description>

The thymic tumors are rare tumors that arise from the thymus and are histologically composed of epithelial cells which are the putative source of malignancy, B and T lymphocytes, interdigitating reticulum cells, macrophages, and myeloid cells. The most common tumors of the thymus are thymomas (well-differentiated neoplasms), atypical thymomas (moderately differentiated neoplasms) and thymic (poorly differentiated neoplasms) carcinomas.</description>

            <description>Patients received 250mg/m(2) or 500mg/m(2) of belinostat via four consecutive 12 hour continuous intravenous infusion (CIVI) for 48 hours starting on day 1. At dose levels 1 and 2, patients received the same doses of doxorubicin (25mg/m(2) on days 2 and 3, intravenous push over 3-5 minutes), cisplatin (50 mg/m(2) over 60 minutes intravenous on day 2 after doxorubicin), and cyclophosphamide (500mg/m(2) over 60 minutes intravenous on day 3 after doxorubicin). Combination of chemotherapy and belinostat was repeated every 21 days for a total of 6 cycles unless there was evidence of disease progression or intolerance of the study treatment.
A conventional 3 + 3 dose escalation design was used to determine maximum tolerated dose (MTD).</description>
