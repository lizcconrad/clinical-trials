      -  Dementia correlates to decreased cognitive function, and Behavioral and Psychological
           Symptoms of Dementia (Neuropsychiatric symptom, BPSD) as well.

        -  Neuropsychiatric symptom attributes important role for mortality, mortality, and cause
           to enter nursing home.

        -  Study on neuropsychiatric symptom in patients with Parkinson's disease has not been
           thorough yet, and there even has not been any study done on this in Korea yet.

        -  The investigators will study prevalence of neuropsychiatric symptom in PDD patients and
           burden of caregiver.

      -  It is well recognized that the importance of non-motor symptoms of Parkinson's disease
           during its progression and many patients are suffering from this. The deterioration of
           cognitive function is especially known as a crucial prognostic factor. According to
           recently released cohort study, majority of patients go through dementia in advanced
           Parkinson's disease.

        -  Dementia correlates to decreased cognitive function, and Behavioral and Psychological
           Symptoms of Dementia (Neuropsychiatric symptom, BPSD) as well. Neuropsychiatric symptom
           composed of abnormal behavior and psychological symptoms: abnormal behaviors include
           combativeness, wandering, agitation, akathisia, inappropriate sexual behavior, following
           caregiver, shouting, cursing, insomnia and binge eating while psychological symptoms
           include anxiety, depression, hallucination, and illusion. Neuropsychiatric symptom is
           evaluated depending on information given by caregivers, and symptoms are likely to be
           temporary or changing constantly. Two thirds of patients is found to have
           neuropsychiatric symptom when they are diagnosed as dementia, 65 % in nursing home and
           70~90% in advanced dementia states. Neuropsychiatric symptom attributes important role
           for mortality, mortality, and cause to enter nursing home.

        -  Besides, neuropsychiatric symptom also plays important part as care-giver burden. It
           gives heavier burden on caregiver rather than on patients, and increases depression and
           anxiety of caregivers. Specific correlation with patient's neuropsychiatric symptom to
           burden of caregiver is known as agitation, depression, aggression, repetitive behavior,
           anxiety, and disinhibition. There are, however, various results related to race, region,
           subjects, and investigator.

        -  Study on neuropsychiatric symptom in patients with Parkinson's disease dementia has not
           been thorough yet, and there even has not been any study done on this in Korea yet.

        -  The investigators will study prevalence of neuropsychiatric symptom in PDD patients and
           burden of caregiver.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients who were diagnosed of Parkinson's disease dementia.

          -  Written informed consent will be obtained from the patient (if possible) or from the
             patient's legal guardian or other representative prior to beginning the any baseline
             assessments or activities. Even if unable to provide written informed consent, the
             patient must assent verbally to participating in the study.

          -  The regimen for levodopa that was administered regularly to patients for 1 month
             before the enrollment can be adjusted optimally for the patients during the
             investigation.

          -  Patients with other dopamine enhancer, MAO-B inhibitor or Amantadine administered
             should be kept stable state during this study.

          -  Patients who have been on other medication for 1 month before they are enrolled can be
             included if the investigator decides that those medication won't affect the result of
             the study.

          -  Other medication for the treatment of other disease can be administered under
             discussion with the physician in charge or those medications.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Participants are not allowed to take any other medication that can affect cognitive
             function e.g, anti-cholinergic medications, benztropine, trihexphenidyl, and
             biperidene.
