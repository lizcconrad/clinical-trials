    <textblock>
      The objective of this work is to evaluate, from volunteers viewpoint, the usability, comfort,
      appearance, weight, superficial temperature, and other characteristics of a polymeric plate
      derived from castor oil developed to thermotherapy.

      The volunteers will use polymeric plate as a therapeutic resource in the shoulder area and
      then fill in, without interference of the researcher, some questions about the
      characteristics of interest.

      In this study, the polymeric plate is prepared using the following procedure:

        1. - the water is heated to the boiling temperature

        2. - the heater is shut down

        3. - the polymeric plate is immersed in water

        4. - it rests in the water for 15 minutes

        5. - it is inserted in a wrap

      In this condition, the polymeric plate is placed on the shoulder of the volunteer and remains
      there for 20 minutes.

      After application, the volunteer answers the questionnaire containing eight questions on a
      Likert scale (0 to 10) and an area of observations.

      Previous laboratory tests were performed to ensure that the temperature of the polymeric
      plate will not cause skin burn in this application condition.
