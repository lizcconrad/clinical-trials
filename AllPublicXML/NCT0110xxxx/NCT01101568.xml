      This study is a Phase I, open-label, single-sequence drug interaction study to evaluate the
      effect of repeated doses of GSK1292263 on the pharmacokinetics of rosuvastatin and
      simvastatin in healthy adult subjects. Each subject will receive single doses of simvastatin
      and rosuvastatin on two occasions, once alone and once following administration of repeated
      (BID) doses of GSK1292263.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  AST, ALT, alkaline phosphatase and bilirubin less than or equal to 1.5xULN (isolated
             bilirubin &gt;1.5xULN is acceptable if bilirubin is fractionated and direct bilirubin
             &lt;35%).

          -  Healthy as determined by a responsible and experienced physician, based on a medical
             evaluation including medical history, physical examination, laboratory tests and
             cardiac monitoring. A subject with a clinical abnormality or laboratory parameters
             outside the reference range for the population being studied may be included only if
             the Investigator and the GSK Medical Monitor agree that the finding is unlikely to
             introduce additional risk factors and will not interfere with the study procedures.

          -  Male or female between 18 and 65 years of age inclusive, at the time of signing the
             informed consent.

          -  A female subject is eligible to participate if she is of non-childbearing potential,
             defined as pre-menopausal females with a documented tubal ligation or bilateral
             oophorectomy or hysterectomy; or postmenopausal defined as 12 months of spontaneous
             amenorrhea. If the clinical situation is unclear, FSH and estradiol levels may be used
             to confirm post-menopausal status at Screening. Simultaneous follicle stimulating
             hormone (FSH) &gt; 40 mIU/ml and estradiol &lt; 40pg/ml (&lt;140pmol/L) is confirmatory in the
             absence of a clear post-menopausal history.

          -  Male subjects must agree to use one of the contraception methods listed in the
             protocol. This criterion must be followed from the time of the first dose of study
             medication until 5 terminal half-lives (i.e. 4 days) post-last dose.

          -  Body weight greater than or equal to 50 kg and BMI within the range 19 - 30 kg/m2
             (inclusive).

          -  Capable of giving written informed consent, which includes compliance with the
             requirements and restrictions listed in the consent form.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  A positive pre-study Hepatitis B surface antigen or positive Hepatitis C antibody
             result within 3 months of screening

          -  A positive pre-study drug/alcohol screen.

          -  A positive test for HIV antibody.

          -  Current or chronic history of liver disease, or known hepatic or biliary abnormalities
             (with the exception of Gilbert's syndrome or asymptomatic gallstones). Subjects with
             cholelithiasis or obstructive or inflammatory gallbladder disease within 3 months
             prior to Screening are excluded.

          -  Gastrointestinal disease that could affect fat or bile acid absorption, or the
             pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics of the study drugs, including inflammatory bowel
             disease, chronic diarrhea, Crohn's or malabsorption syndromes within the past year

          -  Gastrointestinal surgery that may affect the pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics of
             the study drugs

          -  Subjects may be enrolled in the study if they have had a cholecystectomy three or more
             months before the time of screening and are stable and asymptomatic.

          -  Significant ECG abnormalities, defined in the protocol. Subjects with Left Bundle
             Branch Block are excluded from the study. Subjects with partial Right Bundle Branch
             Block may be considered for inclusion following consultation with the GSK Medical
             Monitor. Subjects with WPW syndrome are excluded from the study.

          -  History of regular alcohol consumption within 6 months of the study defined as an
             average weekly intake of &gt;14 drinks for males or &gt;7 drinks for females. One drink is
             equivalent to 12 g of alcohol: 12 ounces (360 ml) of beer, 5 ounces (150 ml) of wine
             or 1.5 ounces (45 ml) of 80 proof distilled spirits.

          -  The subject has participated in a clinical trial and has received an investigational
             product within the following time period prior to the first dosing day in the current
             study: 30 days, 5 half-lives or twice the duration of the biological effect of the
             investigational product (whichever is longer).

          -  Exposure to more than four new chemical entities within 12 months prior to the first
             dosing day.

          -  Use of prescription or non-prescription drugs, including vitamins, herbal and dietary
             supplements (including St John's Wort) within 7 days (or 14 days if the drug is a
             potential enzyme inducer) or 5 half-lives (whichever is longer) prior to the first
             dose of study medication, unless in the opinion of the Investigator and GSK Medical
             Monitor the medication will not interfere with the study procedures or compromise
             subject safety.

          -  History of sensitivity to any of the study medications, or components thereof or a
             history of drug or other allergy that, in the opinion of the investigator or GSK
             Medical Monitor, contraindicates their participation.

          -  Where participation in the study would result in donation of blood or blood products
             in excess of 500 mL within a 56 day period.

          -  Pregnant females as determined by positive serum or urine hCG test at screening or
             prior to dosing.

          -  Lactating females.

          -  Unwillingness or inability to follow the procedures outlined in the protocol.

          -  Subjects who have asthma or a history of asthma, (e.g., for any FTIH where risk of
             bronchoconstriction is unknown, or compound specific where risk of
             bronchoconstriction).

          -  Urinary cotinine levels indicative of smoking or history or regular use of tobacco- or
             nicotine-containing products within 6 months prior to screening.

          -  Consumption of red wine, seville oranges, grapefruit or grapefruit juice from 7 days
             prior to the first dose of study medication.

          -  CPK above the upper limit of normal at screening.

          -  Lactose intolerance.
