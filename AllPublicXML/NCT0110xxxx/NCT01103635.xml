      RATIONALE: Monoclonal antibodies, such as tremelimumab and CD40 agonist monoclonal antibody
      CP-870,893, can block tumor growth in different ways. Some block the ability of tumor cells
      to grow and spread. Others find tumor cells and help kill them or carry cancer-killing
      substances to them. Giving tremelimumab together with CD 40 agonist monoclonal antibody
      CP-870, 893 may kill more tumor cells.

      PURPOSE: This phase I trial is studying the side effects and best dose of giving tremelimumab
      together with CD40 agonist monoclonal antibody CP-870,893 in treating patients with
      metastatic melanoma.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the safety, dose-limiting toxicities and maximum tolerated doses of tremelimumab
      (administered intravenously every 12 weeks) and CP- 870,893 (administered intravenously every
      3 weeks).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I To seek preliminary evidence of anti-tumor efficacy of the combination of tremelimumab and
      CP-870,893, including objective response rate at MTD.

      II. To determine the immune pharmacodynamic changes associated with the administration of the
      combination of tremelimumab and CP-870,893.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive tremelimumab IV over 1 hour on day 1 and CD40 agonist monoclonal
      antibody CP-870,893 IV over 30 minutes on days 2, 22, 43, and 64. Treatment repeats every 12
      weeks for up to 4 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed for 4 weeks.

    <measure>Toxicity as assessed by CTCAE v3.0</measure>
    <description>Toxicities which occur during later cycles will be monitored and described separately. The MTD is defined as the dose level at which 0-1/6 patients experience DLT in the first 12 week cycle and at least 2/3 or 2/6 patients treated at the next higher dose level (unless MTD is level 4) experience DLT in the first 12 week cycle.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Response</measure>
    <description>Clinical response will be scored using RECIST criteria. Patients who do not complete a clinical response evaluation will be scored as unevaluable. The objective response rate is defined as the proportion of patients treated at the MTD who achieve either a complete or partial response. Unevaluable patients are included in the calculation of the objective response rate.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Immunological outcomes (analysis of antigen presenting cell activation, antigen-specific T cells, and tumor-specific T cells)</measure>
    <description>Analysis of antigen presenting cell (APC) activation, 2) analysis of antigen-specific T cells and 3) tumor-specific T cells, as described in Section 7.2. For T cell response analyses, overall immune response is defined as &gt;2 fold pre-treatment/post-treatment increase in any of the key T cell parameters.</description>
