    <textblock>
      Evaluation of the effect of a single dose of CDB-2914, as compared to placebo, administered
      after the onset of the LH surge on the outcome of the leading ovary follicle:

        -  echographic follicle rupture

        -  inhibition of follicle rupture

        -  luteal phase progesterone levels

        -  anovulatory progesterone levels

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Inhibition of follicular rupture</measure>
    <time_frame>within 6 days after treatment intake</time_frame>
    <description>Inhibition is calculated as the number of subjects exhibiting no dominant follicle rupture, divided by the total number of subjects having received treatment</description>

    <time_frame>during the 6 days following treatment intake</time_frame>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Growth pattern of leading follicle</measure>
    <description>number of cycles exhibiting atresia (diameter decrease ≥25%), or continued growth (diameter increase ≥25%), or interrupted growth (size remains within ±25% of the follicle size at the time of treatment)</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Presence or absence of a surge of serum luteinizing hormone (LH) levels</measure>
    <description>The onset of an LH surge is defined as the occurrence of the first single serum LH value whose level is at least 50% higher than the mean of the last two previous measurements, or higher than the last previous measurement if only one previous LH level is available.</description>
