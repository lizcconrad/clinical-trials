      Objective: Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a disease with significant
      morbidity and incurs heavy utilization of healthcare resources. The direct cost of hospital
      admissions related to COPD is the single largest source of expenditure in the public hospital
      system. This study aims to assess whether a comprehensive care programme can decrease the
      rate of hospital admissions for COPD patients.

      Design: A randomised controlled trial of patients discharged from hospital after an episode
      of acute exacerbation of COPD. Patients will be randomised to the intervention arm or usual
      care group.

      Setting: Tertiary University affiliated Hospital.

      Interventions:

      The Intervention group will receive a comprehensive programme which involves inputs from
      doctors, respiratory nurses and physiotherapists, providing an individualized care plan for
      each subject. The components in the programme will include optimization of medications,
      specialist physician follow up, nursing support in education, and physiotherapist support for
      pulmonary rehabilitation. Patients in the intervention group will also receive monthly
      telephone calls by a respiratory nurse for a period of 1 year to assess their conditions and
      answer their queries. Patients will also be followed up in the respiratory clinic by
      respiratory specialist once every 3 months for 1 year.

      The control group will be managed as the usual care. The discharging physician will determine
      the patients' medication and follow up as in normal practice.

      All patients will be asked to return for assessments (spirometry, 6 minute walk test,
      questionnaires on the severity of dyspnoea and quality of life) at baseline and 12 months

      Main outcome measures: The primary endpoint is the hospital readmission rate and the
      secondary endpoints are the quality of life, mortality, lung function and exercise capacity
      of the patients.

    <measure>Quality of Life</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Measured by change in St. George Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ) total score from baseline to 12 month. SGRQ total score ranged from 0-100. The change was calculated by the 12 month SGRQ total score minus the baseline value. Negative values indicated improvement in quality of life.</description>

    <measure>Lung Function</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Measurement of change of spirometry (FEV1 % predicted) from baseline to 12 month. The range is from 0% to 100%. The change was calculated by 12 month value minus the baseline value. Positive value indicated improvement in lung function.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Exercise Capacity</measure>
    <time_frame>12 month</time_frame>
    <description>Exercise capacity was measured by change in 6 minutes walk test distance from baseline to 12 month. 6 minute walk test is the distance that the patient can walk over 6 minutes and it can range to 0 meters to few hundred meters. This was calculated by the 12 month 6 minutes walk test distance minus that of the baseline. Positive values indicated improvement in exercise capacity.</description>
