      Purpose:

      The main objective of this study is to determine endomicroscopic features of Crohn´s disease.

      Background:

      Crohn´s disease is an inflammatory disease of the intestines that may affect any part of the
      gastrointestinal tract from anus to mouth, causing a wide variety of symptoms. Diagnosis is
      based on several histologic features including transmural pattern of inflammation, crypt
      abscesses and granulomas. Confocal laser endomicroscopy (CLE) is rapidly emerging as a
      valuable tool for gastrointestinal endoscopic imaging, enabling the endoscopist to obtain an
      &quot;optical biopsy&quot; of the gastrointestinal mucosa during the endoscopic procedure.

      Scope:

      In patients with Crohn´s disease.

      Methods:

      Patients underwent colonoscopy for the evaluation of Crohn´s disease. During the endoscopic
      procedure CLE will be performed.

      Procedure:

      The patient underwent colonoscopy. During the procedure the patient will receive intravenous
      fluorescein or topical mucosal staining with acriflavin or cresyl violet, followed by in-vivo
      CLE of the tissue. Confocal images are digitally saved and analyzed afterwards.
