  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      At present, triple therapy is recommended by various guidelines for the treatment of
      Helicobacter pylori (H.pylori) infection. Recent studies have shown increasing resistance of
      H.pylori to commonly used antibiotics used in triple therapy. This study explores a
      non-antibiotic treatment regime for H.pylori that uses lauric acid as the primary
      anti-microbial agent. The study hypothesis is that Lauric acid works synergistically with
      omeprazole following administration of a mucolytic agent to kill H.pylori topically in the
      stomach.

    <participant_flow>
      <recruitment_details>Healthy volunteers were recruited, with the first volunteer consenting for screening on 13 May 2010. A total of 205 healthy volunteers were screened for the study, with 164 not being infected with H.pylori and 8 not entering the trial for other inclusion/exclusion reasons.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>No group assignment - all participants included were to receive trial treatment. Following consent to take part in the study, participants had a pre-treatment gastroscopy to exclude significant existing upper GI disease. Then all received omeprazole 40mg daily for 1 week prior to receiving the investigational GT08 treatment.</pre_assignment_details>
