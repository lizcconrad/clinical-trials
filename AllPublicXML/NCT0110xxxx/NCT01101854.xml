  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study has two arms: 1) the biopsy arm and 2) the debridement arm. The purpose of the
      biopsy arm is to determine whether there are similar patterns of genes being turned on and/or
      turned off among people with healing and non-healing wounds. The purpose of the debridement
      arm is to (i) identify the nature of bacterial infection and the genes driving the tissue
      response to it; and (ii) determine how the biofilm components arrest/paralyze the immune
      function.

      This study has two arms: 1) the biopsy arm and 2) the debridement arm. The purpose of the
      biopsy arm is to determine whether there are similar patterns of genes being turned on and/or
      turned off among people with healing and non-healing wounds. The purpose of the debridement
      arm is to (i) identify the nature of bacterial infection and the genes driving the tissue
      response to it; and (ii) determine how the biofilm components arrest/paralyze the immune
      function.

      For the biopsy arm, a single subject (current OSU Comprehensive Wound Center patient) will
      provide 2 tissue samples (3 mm punch biopsy samples collected by a wound care physician) from
      a single wound over a 4-week time period. The wound and the samples will be categorized as
      healing versus non-healing responses on the basis of decreased (healing) or increased
      (non-healing) wound area measurements over the 4-week time period. A chronic wound generally
      is a wound which shows no signs of significant healing in four weeks or has not healed in
      eight weeks. The ability to obtain additional measurements from patients' medical records up
      to 12 weeks after enrollment in the study will confirm the healing or non-healing trajectory
      of the wound.

      For the debridement arm, a single subject (current OSU Comprehensive Wound Center patient)
      will be seen 1 time at the CWC during their regularly scheduled wound care visits or during
      your scheduled surgery and debrided tissue (foreign matter and dead tissue from a wound) that
      is ordinarily discarded will be collected. No additional wound care visits will be required
      as all study-related visits will happen during regularly scheduled appointments at an OSU
      Comprehensive Wound Center or in the operating room (OR) (if a patient's physician determines
      that surgical debridement is required). The ability to obtain additional measurements from
      patients' medical records up to 12 weeks after enrollment in the study will confirm the
      healing or non-healing trajectory of the wound. Debrided tissue that is collected will be
      divided into three parts: A) Necrotic/slough tissue (N); B) Live tissue determined by
      consistency and pinkish color, but not perfused (LNP); or C) Red perfused tissue (LP). If it
      is difficult to clearly distinguish between the LNP and LP, the two groups will be combined
      together. In an effort to identify the infection markers of normal or impaired healing, we
      plan to create a database that contains pathogen type, gene and protein expression profiles
      and enzymatic activity from infected human wound specimens.
