    <textblock>
      This study is for patients that have a type of brain cancer called glioblastoma multiforme
      (GBM).

      The body has different ways of fighting infection and disease. No single way seems perfect
      for fighting cancers. This research study combines two different ways of fighting cancer:
      antibodies and T cells. Antibodies are types of proteins that protect the body from
      infectious diseases and possibly cancer. T cells, also called T lymphocytes, are special
      infection-fighting blood cells that can kill other cells, including cells infected with
      viruses and tumor cells. Both antibodies and T cells have been used to treat patients with
      cancers. They have shown promise, but have not been strong enough to cure most patients.

      The antibody used in this study is called anti-HER2 (Human Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor
      2). This antibody sticks to GBM cells because of a substance on the outside of these cells
      called HER2. Up to 80% of GBMs are positive for HER2. HER2 antibodies have been used to treat
      people with HER2-positive cancers. For this study, the HER2 antibody has been changed so that
      instead of floating free in the blood it is now attached to T cells. When an antibody is
      joined to a T cell in this way it is called a chimeric receptor. These chimeric receptor-T
      cells seem to be able to kill tumors like GBM, but they don't last very long and so their
      chances of fighting the cancer are limited. Therefore, developing ways to prolong the life of
      these T cells should help them fight cancer.

      We found that T cells work better if we also attach a protein called CD28 to the HER2
      chimeric receptor (HER2-CAR). In this study we placed this HER2-CAR into T cells that were
      pre-selected for their ability to recognize Cytomegalovirus (CMV). This virus exists in most
      people. These CMV-specific cytotoxic T cells (CMV-T cells) will be more active since they
      will react to the virus as well as to tumor cells. These HER2-CD28 CMV-T cells are an
      investigational product not approved by the Food and Drug Administration.

      The purpose of this study is to find the largest safe dose of HER2-CD28 CMV-T cells, to learn
      what the side effects are, and to see whether this therapy might help patients with GBM.

      When the patient enrolls on this study, they will be assigned to a dose of HER2-CAR CMV-T
      cells.

      The patient will be given a single injection of cells into the vein through an IV line at the
      assigned dose. The injection will take between 1 and 10 minutes. The patient will be followed
      in the clinic after the injection for 1 to 4 hours. If later the subject seems to be
      experiencing a benefit (confirmed by radiological studies, physical exam and/or symptoms),
      s/he may be able to receive up to six additional doses of the T cells if they wish. These
      additional infusions would be at least 6 to 12 weeks apart and at the same dose level
      received the first time.

      Medical tests before treatment--

      Before being treated, the patient will receive a series of standard medical tests as follows:
      Physical exam, Blood tests to measure blood cells, kidney and liver function, Routine heart
      function tests (Echocardiogram),Measurements of the tumor by routine imaging studies

      Medical tests during and after treatment--

      The patient will receive standard medical tests when getting the infusions and after:Physical
      exams, Blood tests to measure blood cells, kidney and liver function, Routine heart function
      tests (Echocardiogram) at 6 weeks after the infusion, Measurements of the tumor by routine
      imaging studies 6 weeks after the infusion

      To learn more about the way the HER2-CAR CMV-T cells are working and how long they last in
      the body, blood will be taken on the day of the T-cell infusion, before, 1 hour and 4 hours
      after the T-cell infusion, 1, 2, 4 and 6 weeks after the T-cell infusion and every 3 months
      for 1 year, every 6 months for 4 years, then yearly for a total of 15 years.
