    <textblock>
      This will be a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group, safety and
      tolerability study in adults with ADHD. The target subjects are healthy male or female adults
      aged 18 to 64 years, inclusive, with a diagnosis of ADHD. A total of fifty subjects will be
      enrolled at approximately 5 sites in the US. Subjects will be randomized (1:1) to one of two
      treatment groups, SPN-812V or placebo.

          3. Male or female aged 18 to 64, inclusive.

          4. Subjects with a current diagnosis of ADHD as confirmed by the Conners' Adult ADHD
             Diagnostic Interview for DSM-IV (CAADID)

          5. Clinical Global Impression - Severity (CGI-S) score of 4 or higher.

          6. On no treatment for ADHD or willing to be withdrawn from an ongoing treatment after a
             washout of at least 10 days.

          7. Body Mass Index (BMI) between 18.0 and 34.0 inclusive.

          8. Subject must be in general good health as determined by medical history, ECG, and
             other analysis that, in the judgment of the Investigator, would confirm the Subject's
             good health.

          9. Females of childbearing potential (FOCP) who, if sexually active, agree to use
             acceptable forms of contraception (including oral, transdermal, or implanted
             contraceptives; intrauterine device; female condom with spermicide; diaphragm with
             spermicide; cervical cap; abstinence; use of condom with spermicide by sexual partner
             or sterile [at least 6 months prior to SM administration] sexual partner) at least 14
             days prior to start of study drug administration, throughout the study, and for 30
             days following the last dose of SM.

         10. Postmenopausal females with amenorrhea for at least 2 years or females who are
             permanently sterilized (e.g., tubal occlusion, hysterectomy, bilateral salpingectomy).

        Exclusion Criteria

          1. Current or past history of psychotic disorder or major depressive disorder with
             psychotic features.

          2. Presence of another primary DSM-IV-TR disorder.

          3. Suicidality, defined as either active suicidal plan/intent or active suicidal
             thoughts, in the 6 months before the Screening Visit or more than 1 lifetime suicide
             attempt. (The Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scales [C-SSRS] will be administered at
             each visit.)

          4. Substance or alcohol abuse/dependence within previous 6 months, or a positive urine
             drug screen at screening or baseline prior to first dose of study medication (SM).

          5. Any known or suspected significant medical or psychiatric illnesses that, in the
             judgment of the Investigator, may impair interpretation of study results or constitute
             a significant safety concern in the context of the clinical trial

          6. ECG abnormalities (clinically significant according to Investigator's opinion) or
             vital sign abnormalities (systolic blood pressure [SBP] &lt;90 or &gt;140 millimeters of
             mercury [mmHg], diastolic blood pressure [DBP] &lt;40 or &gt;90mmHg, or heart rate [HR] &lt;40
             or &gt;100 beats per minute [BPM]) at screening.

          7. Clinically significant laboratory abnormalities; including presence of potential
             hepatic function impairment as shown by, but not limited to alanine aminotransferase
             (ALT/SGPT) values &gt;2 times upper limit of normal (ULN), aspartate aminotransferase
             (AST/SGOT) &gt; 2 times ULN, gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT) &gt;3 times ULN, or total
             bilirubin &gt;1.5 ULN .

          8. Medications, including health food supplements judged by the Investigator to be likely
             to have central nervous system activity (for example, St John's Wort, gingko leaf, and
             melatonin), are not permitted during the study. If the subject is taking the
             medication prior to study entry, there must be a 7 day washout period prior to first
             dose of SM.

          9. Lifetime history of tic disorder, Tourette's Disease, or organic brain disorder; or

             participating in the study.
