          -  Systemic treatment with biological therapies (marketed or not marketed) with a
             possible effect on psoriasis vulgaris within 4 weeks (etanercept), 2 months
             (adalimumab, alefacept, infliximab), 4 months (ustekinumab) or 4 weeks/5 half-lives
             (which-ever is longer) for experimental biological products prior to randomisation

          -  Systemic treatments with all other therapies than biologicals, with a potential effect
             on psoriasis vulgaris (e.g., corticosteroids, vitamin D analogues, retinoids,
             immuno-suppressants) within the 4-week period prior to randomisation

          -  Subjects using one of the following topical drugs for the treatment of psoriasis
             within the 4 week period prior to randomisation and during the study:

               -  Potent or very potent (WHO group III-IV) corticosteroids

               -  PUVA or Grenz ray therapy

          -  Subjects using one of the following topical drugs for the treatment of psoriasis
             within two weeks prior to randomisation and during the study:

               -  WHO group I-II corticosteroids (except if used for treatment of scalp psoriasis)

               -  Vitamin D analogues

               -  Topical immunomodulators (e.g. macrolides)

               -  UVB therapy

          -  Subjects known to be non-responder to topical vitamin D analogues (e.g., known history
             of no improvement or worsening of psoriasis with e.g., calcipotriol, calcitriol or
             tacalcitol when used according to current SmPc)

          -  Subjects who have received treatment with any non-marketed drug substance (i.e., an
             agent which has not yet been made available for clinical use following registration)
             within the 4 week period prior to randomisation or longer, if the class of the
             substance requires a longer washout as defined above (e.g., biological treatments)

          -  Subjects with current participation in any other interventional clinical, based on

             investigational products

          -  Subjects with known/suspected disorders of calcium metabolism associated with
             hypercalcaemia

          -  Subjects with known severe hepatic and/or severe renal insufficiency

          -  Subjects with any concomitant medical or dermatological disorder(s) which might
             preclude accurate evaluation of the psoriasis
