      Pivotal, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, comparative with desloratadine,
      parallel group, international, multicenter study.The Primary endpoint was the Change in total
      reflective score on the scale of symptoms associated with seasonal allergic rhinitis
      indicated by patients at the baseline assessment and over the 2 weeks of the study. A total
      of 720 patients with seasonal allergic rhinitis were enrolled. Duration of treatment was 14
      days, preceded by one week (7 days) of placebo.
