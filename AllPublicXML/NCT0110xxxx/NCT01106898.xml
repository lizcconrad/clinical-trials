  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial is studying the side effects and how well giving cyclophosphamide and
      paclitaxel with or without trastuzumab works in treating women with stage I or stage II
      breast cancer who have undergone surgery. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as
      cyclophosphamide and paclitaxel, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells,
      either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Giving monoclonal antibody
      therapy, such as trastuzumab, with chemotherapy may kill more tumor cells. Giving these
      treatments after surgery may kill any tumor cells that remain after surgery

      OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the toxicities and ability to complete the planned treatment of a dose-dense
      regimen of cyclophosphamide and paclitaxel with or without trastuzumab in patients with newly
      diagnosed stage I-II breast cancer.

      II. To estimate recurrence free survival of a dose-dense regimen of cyclophosphamide and
      paclitaxel with or without trastuzumab in patients with newly diagnosed stage I-II breast
      cancer.

      OUTLINE:

      SYSTEMIC CHEMOTHERAPY: Patients receive cyclophosphamide intravenously (IV) over 1 hour and
      paclitaxel IV over 3 hours on day 1. Treatment repeats every 14 days for 6 courses in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      MAINTENANCE THERAPY (Her-2 neu positive patients): Patients receive trastuzumab IV over 30
      minutes on day 1. Treatment repeats every 14 days for 5 courses and then every 21 days for 14
      courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up periodically for 3 years.
