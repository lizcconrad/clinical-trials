      The objective of this research is to conduct focus groups in order to adapt the Diabetes
      Prevention Program (DPP) so that it may successfully target women diagnosed with gestational
      diabetes (GDM) who are at high risk for developing Type 2 diabetes in the post-partum period.
      As this research seeks to gather formative data for a future intervention, the focus groups
      will: 1) provide information to maximize participation in the future intervention and 2)
      inform the location, content and format of the intervention.

      We will be conducting focus groups and informant interviews to determine the DPP
      modifications necessary for adapting to the post-partum lifestyles of women with a recent
      history of GDM. Subjects will attend a 1 hour focus group or phone interview where they will
      be encouraged to respond to the facilitators' questions and to each other's comments on
      topics such as: gestational diabetes, healthy eating, exercise, and other type 2 diabetes
      prevention related activities. Working with a variety of health care providers, including
      endocrinologists, obstetricians and nurse-practitioners, we will identify and enroll up to 60
      women total who are either current GDM patients at BWH or have a recent history of GDM who
      have delivered at Brigham and Women's Hospital in the last 5 years.
