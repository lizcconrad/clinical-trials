  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Nicotine patches are frequently used in smoking patients during their stay in the ICU in
      order to avoid tobacco's weaning symptoms which are likely to interfere with mechanical
      ventilation weaning.

      Until now the effectiveness of this treatment has not been proven. The aim of this study
      (NICOREA study) is to determine if a difference exists on the duration of mechanical
      ventilation once patients receive or not a nicotine substitute.

      Six hundred mechanically ventilated patients are going to be enrolled to receive nicotine or
      placebo during a 24 month period in 14 centers in France.
