  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the safety, tolerability, food effect as well as
      the pharmacokinetics (how the drug is absorbed in the body, how it is distributed within the
      body and how it is removed from the body over time) and pharmacodynamics (the effects of the
      drug) of single and multiple ascending doses of JNJ-41443532 in healthy male participants.

    <textblock>
      This is a randomized (study drug assigned by chance), double-blind (neither physician nor
      participant knows the name of the assigned drug), placebo-controlled, single and multiple
      ascending dose study conducted at a single study center. The study has 4 parts. Part 1 is a
      randomized, double-blind, alternating panel, single ascending oral dose study. Two
      alternating treatment panels (A and B) each with nine healthy male participants will be
      studied with successively increasing dose levels. Part 2 is a randomized, open-label (all
      people involved know the identity of the intervention), 2-period crossover study to evaluate
      what the effect of administering JNJ- 41443532 with food (i.e. standard high fat breakfast
      meal) relative to administration in the fasted state will have on pharmacokinetics/blood
      levels of JNJ-41443532. Part 3 is a randomized, double-blind, single oral dose study in
      obese, otherwise healthy male participants. Part 4 is a double-blind, randomized,
      placebo-controlled multiple ascending dose study in up to 5 sequential treatment groups of
      healthy male participants. Safety assessments include monitoring of adverse events, and
      evaluation of lab results, cardiac parameters, vital signs, and physical exams. In Parts 1,
      2, and 3 participants receive study medication (JNJ-41443532 or placebo) orally on Day 1
      after an overnight fast of at least 10 hours; planned doses are 25 to 1500 mg. In Part 4,
      participants receive study medication (JNJ-41443532 or placebo) orally each day for 10
      consecutive days after an overnight fast of at least 10 hours; planned doses are 100 to 1000
      mg.
