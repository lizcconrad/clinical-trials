      The objective of the proposed research is to develop a clinical-trial-ready device and to
      evaluate its practical utility as a routinely used intra-operative tool. Our
      multidisciplinary group has previously shown that optical techniques can effectively
      discriminate between malignant and non-malignant breast tissues. The proposed technology will
      be a multi-channel optical assay device for intra-operative imaging of margins in specimens
      excised from patients undergoing breast conserving surgery (partial mastectomy) or
      mastectomy.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients undergoing a partial mastectomy or mastectomy for the treatment of an
             invasive or non-invasive breast malignancy

          -  Age &gt; 18

          -  Clinically detectable disease either by physical examination or radiographic studies

          -  Patients of all ethnic and gender groups will be included. Protocol accrual will be
             reviewed annually to include a determination of minority and gender representation. If
             accrual demonstrates under representation of any group with comparison to disease
             incidence in that group, appropriate measures will be undertaken to increase
             participation of patients of that minority or gender group.

          -  Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients considered in &quot;vulnerable&quot; populations
