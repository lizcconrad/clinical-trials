  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Respiratory tract infections are the most common indication for antibiotic prescribing in
      primary care. Several studies have shown a strong relationship between antibiotic use and
      bacterial resistance. The aim of this trial was to assess the long-term effect of a
      continuous education program on general practitioners antibiotic prescribing behaviour. 170
      physicians were included in this study. Physicians randomized in the education group attended
      a two days seminar focused on evidence-based guidelines on antibiotic use in respiratory
      tract infections. The intervention was limited at physicians level and did not target the
      patients.

    <description>All prescriptions written by all general practitioners enrolled in the study were extracted each year from the French National Health System database. All data were compared to 2004 (baseline). Education group GPs attended a two-day seminar presenting evidence-based guidelines on antibiotic prescription in respiratory tract infections. The change (compared to baseline) in the percentage of prescriptions containing an antibiotic (antibiotic prescription rates) was compared between control and intervention groups.</description>

    <description>A second randomization was performed among the intervention group. In one subgroup, GPs attended an additional seminar on problem-solving strategies. Antibiotic prescription rates were compared between controls, evidence-based and problem-solving subgroups. Antibiotic cost was also compared between the both subgroups</description>
