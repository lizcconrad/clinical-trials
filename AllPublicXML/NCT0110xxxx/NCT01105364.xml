      RATIONALE: Diagnostic procedures, such as contrast-enhanced ultrasound, may help measure a
      patient's response to treatment with drugs such as sunitinib malate, sorafenib tosylate, or
      bevacizumab, and allow doctors to plan better treatment.

      PURPOSE: This clinical trial is studying ultrasonography in assessing antiangiogenic
      treatment in patients with advanced kidney cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  To determine if contrast-enhanced ultrasonography (CEUS) study of target metastasis from
           renal cancer leads to early assessment of pharmacodynamic effects of antiangiogenic
           treatment in patients with advanced renal cancer.

      Secondary

        -  To determine the association between functional changes of microvascularization and the
           target lesion by CEUS and the early objective response for this lesion indicated by the
           time to progression.

        -  To determine the association between functional changes of microvascularization and the
           target lesion by CEUS and the early objective response for this lesion indicated by the
           global survey.

        -  To determine the tolerance to antiangiogenic treatments in these patients.

        -  To determine the relationship between functional changes of microvascularization and the
           target lesion and the objective response for the other lesions (RECIST criteria) in
           cases of other metastasis other than the target lesion.

      OUTLINE: Patients undergo contrast-enhanced ultrasonography (CEUS) before and after
      stabilized sulphur hexafluoride microbubble-based contrast agent injection. CEUS is done
      within 8 days prior to, 30 days after the first administration, and after 3 months of
      receiving antiangiogenesis treatment (e.g., sunitinib malate, sorafenib tosylate, or
      bevacizumab). Patients also undergo computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging to
      evaluate tumoral targets.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 2 years.
