    <textblock>
      The highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) H5N1 virus arrived in the Middle East in 2005
      and has since established itself in local domestic birds and is now considered endemic in
      several Middle Eastern countries.Few studies indicate the presence of low pathogenicity avian
      influenza (LPAI) viruses of the H9 type among Lebanese poultry and wild birds. These studies
      also provide some evidence suggesting that humans exposed to these sick birds are showing
      elevated antibody titers against these LPAI H9 viruses.

      This study will focus on the following objectives:

        -  To determine the seroprevalence of AI in poultry-exposed and non-exposed human
           populations.

        -  To identify risk factors associated with AI infections in occupationally-exposed poultry
           workers.

        -  To conduct nation-wide cross-sectional surveillance for AI viruses among domestic birds
           in low biosecurity farms and backyard flocks.

      This study will examine the sera of 200 poultry-exposed adults and 50 adult controls and
      administer questionnaires to identify risk factors for AI infections in human beings.Study
      volunteers will be interviewed regarding their exposures, medical history, and behaviors
      using a close-ended questionnaire specifically tailored for this study. A blood sample will
      be collected from every participant to verify presence of antibodies against the viruses
      under study. All study materials are in English and Arabic. Along side the human aspect of
      the study, specimens will be collected from the birds that the individual handles.

      This study hypothesizes that they will find evidence of previous infection with these viruses
      among poultry workers. Furthermore, the study team will collect animal specimens from the
      farms of the study volunteers and determine the types of Avian Influenza viruses that they
      harbour.

    <description>This seroepidemiological study proposes to compare adults with occupational exposure to poultry with non-poultry exposed adult controls for evidence of previous infections with AI viruses.In this study, any person with occupational exposure to poultry i.e. works in poultry production facility or raises a smaller number of poultry on his/her farm will be considered exposed. The questionnaire used in this study will capture poultry exposure data through a group of variables assessing type of occupational setting, length of time of exposure, flock size, type of work performed, and personal protective equipment (PPE) used.</description>

      A trained phlebotomist will collect a tube of blood (7.5ml) in serum separator tubes. The
      blood will be allowed to clot at room temperature then centrifuged on the same day. Serum
      specimens will be aliqouted into multiple cryovials, labelled and preserved at -20Â°C until
      ready for laboratory study.

        This study will be conducted in the rural areas of Lebanon where poultry production is
        located.Specifically, three main regions will be included in this study, the Beqaa, North
        Lebanon, and South Lebanon regions.The Mount Lebanon and Beirut regions are heavily
        urbanized and poultry production in these regions is minimal.Poultry-exposed individuals
        will be enrolled according to the following scheme:100 from Beqaa, 50 from North Lebanon,
        and 50 from South Lebanon. The 50 non-exposed individuals will be enrolled from Beirut.

        Villages will be randomly selected from each of the 3 regions where enrollment will
        occur.Each village will be assigned a number and then a random digit sheet will be
        generated and used to randomly select villages.

        Controls, adults who were never exposed to poultry, will be enrolled from urban areas such
        as the capital Beirut. Controls will be invited to volunteer by word of mouth at
        public/community sites.

          -  Be willing to participate by signing a consent form, completing the study
             questionnaire, and providing a blood sample.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Less than 18 years old.

          -  Any known immunosuppressive condition or immune deficiency disease (including HIV
             infection), or ongoing receipt of any immunosuppressive therapy. (Note that we have
             chosen to exclude such populations because of their increased risk of acquiring
             infections, they are relatively few, and are not representative of a national sample).

          -  Any individual with unknown poultry exposure status, or who was exposed to poultry
             more than 5 years ago.
