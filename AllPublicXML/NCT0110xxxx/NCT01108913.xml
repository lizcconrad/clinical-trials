        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Male and postmenopausal or sterile female patients with a history of moderate to
             severe COPD defined as Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD)
             II-III for at least 1 year

          -  At least 40 years of age

          -  Current smoker or ex-smoker with at least 10 pack-year smoking history (Ten pack-years
             is defined as 20 cigarettes a day for 10 years, or 10 cigarettes a day for 20 years
             etc.)

          -  Postbronchodilator FEV1 between 30% and 80% predicted and FEV1/FVC ratio &lt; 70%.
             Postbronchodilator refers to 30 min after inhalation of 400 µg Salbutamol. This
             criterion for FEV1 will have to be demonstrated after a washout period of at least 48
             h during which no long acting anticholinergic medication (LAMA) or long acting
             β2-agonists (LABA) has been inhaled or a washout period of 6 h during which no short
             acting β2-agonists (SABA) or anticholinergic medication (SAMA) has been inhaled. For
             patients having been pretreated with an inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) and/or
             theophylline, this criterion needs to be demonstrated after a washout of at least 4
             weeks.

          -  Able to produce sputum upon induction in a sufficient quality. This criterion will be
             checked by the responsible sputum lab prior to randomization of the patient.

          -  Time and ability to complete the study

          -  Able to communicate well with the investigator, to understand and comply with the
             requirements of the study. Understand and sign the written informed consent.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with a history of chronic respiratory disorders other than COPD e.g. asthma,
             α1-Antitrypsin deficiency, mucoviscidosis, lung fibrosis

          -  Patients who experienced an exacerbation in the 4 weeks before the screening visit or
             between screening and randomization

          -  Patients who experienced an acute upper respiratory tract infection or
             broncho-pulmonary infection requiring antibiotic treatment during the 4 weeks before
             the screening visit or between screening and randomization

          -  Treatment with inhaled (ICS), topical or any systemic corticosteroids or theophylline
             within at least 4 weeks before the screening visit and throughout entire course of the
             study. Patients with ICS and/or theophylline treatment will undergo a washout of at
             least 4 weeks after signature of the informed consent and prior to the screening
             visit, where eligibility to enter the study will be assessed
