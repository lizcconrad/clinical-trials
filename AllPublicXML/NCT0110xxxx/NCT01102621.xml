      Hypothesis: Treatment for head and neck tumors often involve methods that affect the auditory
      system and cause hearing loss. Neck dissection negatively impacts the lymphatic drainage,
      chemotherapy uses ototoxic drugs, radiotherapy affects blood flow and tissue radiation is
      toxic to the ear and may lead to hearing losses of various types and degrees.

      Objective: To investigate occurrences of hearing loss and complaints among patients with head
      and neck tumors who underwent radiotherapy.

      Study design: Prospective, case-control study. Setting: Tertiary care center hospital.

      Subjects and Methods: 282 subjects were evaluated, 141 with head and neck tumors and 141 as
      an age-matched control group. The controls had never undergone oncological treatment that put
      their hearing at risk. All subjects underwent audiological evaluation, including the HHIE
      questionnaire, pure tone audiometry, speech audiometry and immittance audiometry. The
      radiation dose received by the auditory system was calculated based on the percentage of the
      external auditory canal included in the radiation field.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>The hearing loss was evaluated through conventional tone threshold audiometry and a questionaire of hearing handicap was applied to both groups (individuals exposed to radiotherapy and the control group).</measure>
    <time_frame>patientes were evaluated two years after finished the treatement</time_frame>
    <description>We observed mild to moderate hearing losses at frequencies of 57.4% in right ears and 59.6% in left ears in the group exposed to radiotherapy and in the control group, 43.3% ofmild to moderate hearing loss in both ears.Severe or profound hearing losses or anacusis occurred at frequencies of 6.4% in right ears and 8.5% in left ears, versus only 1.4% in the control group.Furthermore, severe handicap was observed in 2.8% of the individuals in the control group, versus 19.1% in the group exposed to radiotherapy.</description>

    <description>The group of exposed individuals had to be patients with disease-free survival interval of at least two years subsequent to treatment for head and neck cancer by means of radiotherapy alone or in combination, in which the auditory system was included in the field of irradiation.</description>

    <description>The group of non-exposed individuals (control group) had to be patients who had not undergone oncological treatment that put their hearing at risk and who were age-matched (2 years). This group was formed by individuals who had had pelvic tumors or skin tumors and who had only undergone local surgery to remove their tumors, and by female volunteers from the hospital. All of these individuals were asked whether they would be willing to participate in a study, without knowing in advance whether they had any previous hearing problems or complaints.</description>
