  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to identify whether the addition of positive expiratory pressure (PEP) mask
      therapy to standard medical care improves clinically important outcomes in individuals with
      acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. It is hypothesized that those
      who receive the additional PEP mask therapy will show greater improvements than those who do
      not.

      This study aims to identify whether the addition of positive expiratory pressure (PEP) mask
      therapy to standard medical care improves symptoms, quality of life and risk of
      re-exacerbation in individuals with acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary
      disease.

      A PEP mask is a small hand-held device that is self-applied over the nose and mouth. It
      creates a resistance against exhalation (outward) breaths which helps facilitate movement of
      sputum from the lungs towards the mouth.

      Participants will be recruited from two tertiary metropolitan hospitals in Melbourne,
      Australia and randomised to receive either 'usual care' (comprising medical management,
      non-invasive ventilation if required, rehabilitation and allied health interventions) or
      'usual care' plus PEP mask therapy for the duration of their hospital admission. All
      participants will then complete daily diaries for six months after discharge.

      The effect of PEP mask therapy will be evaluated using a range of outcomes important to both
      patients and health care providers.

    <description>The number of participants needing non-invasive or invasive ventilation during their inpatient stay shall be assessed. As early non-invasive ventilation is commonly used for the management of acute exacerbations of COPD, this outcome shall be assessed both within and after 48 hours of presentation to hospital. This aims to differentiate usual care from clinical deterioration.</description>

    <description>Participants will receive 'usual medical care' consisting of the following:
Medical management: Bronchodilators, corticosteroids, antibiotics and supplemental oxygen will be provided (where appropriate) in accordance with Australian and New Zealand COPD management guidelines (COPDX guidelines).
Non-invasive ventilation: if clinically indicated and prescribed in accordance with standardised hospital guidelines.
Physical rehabilitation: Participants will be assessed by a physiotherapist and prescribed appropriate exercises to facilitate a safe and timely discharge. Participants will perform physical rehabilitation according to a standardised protocol with an aim of maximising physical function at discharge.
Other allied health (e.g. occupational therapy, speech pathology, dietician) assessments and interventions, as required.</description>

    <description>PEP mask therapy will be performed once/day, supervised, by an experienced physiotherapist until hospital discharge or ≥ 24 hours without sputum expectoration (whichever comes first). Written instructions shall also be provided, encouraging two more independent PEP mask sessions per day. Each session will comprise up to 5 cycles of 8-10 slightly active breaths, followed by 2 huffs (FET) and 2 coughs. A target pressure of 10-20 cms H20 during the middle of expiration shall be used (monitored via a pressure manometer).</description>

          -  They have had recent (within the last 6 months) lung volume reduction procedure(s)
             (e.g. surgery, valve or stent insertion, or other), lung transplantation or
             pneumonectomy

          -  The intervention is contraindicated (including but not limited to evidence of
             undrained pneumothorax, significant frank haemoptysis, recent facial, oral,
             oesophageal or skull surgery/trauma, altered conscious state or inability to
             co-operate)

          -  They have poor oxygen saturation at rest (SpO2 &lt; 88%) despite supplemental oxygen
             delivered via nasal prongs

          -  They intend to continue performing established ACT routines throughout the study
             period

          -  It is more than 48 hours since being admitted as an inpatient to hospital.
