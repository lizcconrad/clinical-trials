  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to assess the immunogenicity and safety of three formulations of
      GSK Biologicals' GSK2036874A vaccine compared to Zilbrix™/Hib and Poliorix™ vaccines
      administered concomitantly, when administered as a single booster dose to healthy
      poliovirus-primed toddlers aged 12-24 months.

    <textblock>
      The study will be conducted in a partially double-blinded manner. The study will be
      double-blinded with respect to the three GSK2036874A formulation groups and open-label with
      respect to the Control Group.

    <description>Seropositivity was defined as anti-HBs antibody concentration ≥ 3.3 milli-international units per milliliter (mIU/mL). Seprotection was defined as anti-HBs antibody concentration ≥ 10 mIU/mL. Note that percentage of subjects with concentration ≥ 10 mIU/mL was over-estimated due to the use of in-house assay overestimating concentrations between 10-100 mIU/mL. Accordingly GMCs were also overestimated. A decrease in the specificity of the anti-HB ELISA assay had been observed in some studies for low levels of antibody (10-100 mIU/mL). The table shows updated results following partial or complete retesting/reanalysis. Some of the available blood samples initially tested with ELISA were re-tested using the new assay, CLIA.</description>

        <description>Seropositivity was defined as anti-HBs antibody concentration ≥ 3.3 milli-international units per milliliter (mIU/mL). Seprotection was defined as anti-HBs antibody concentration ≥ 10 mIU/mL. Note that percentage of subjects with concentration ≥ 10 mIU/mL was over-estimated due to the use of in-house assay overestimating concentrations between 10-100 mIU/mL. Accordingly GMCs were also overestimated. A decrease in the specificity of the anti-HB ELISA assay had been observed in some studies for low levels of antibody (10-100 mIU/mL). The table shows updated results following partial or complete retesting/reanalysis. Some of the available blood samples initially tested with ELISA were re-tested using the new assay, CLIA.</description>

          <description>Seropositivity was defined as anti-HBs antibody concentration ≥ 3.3 milli-international units per milliliter (mIU/mL). Seprotection was defined as anti-HBs antibody concentration ≥ 10 mIU/mL. Note that percentage of subjects with concentration ≥ 10 mIU/mL was over-estimated due to the use of in-house assay overestimating concentrations between 10-100 mIU/mL. Accordingly GMCs were also overestimated. A decrease in the specificity of the anti-HB ELISA assay had been observed in some studies for low levels of antibody (10-100 mIU/mL). The table shows updated results following partial or complete retesting/reanalysis. Some of the available blood samples initially tested with ELISA were re-tested using the new assay, CLIA.</description>
          <population>The analysis was performed on the ATP cohort for immunogenicity, which included all evaluable subjects for whom immunogenicity data were available.</population>
