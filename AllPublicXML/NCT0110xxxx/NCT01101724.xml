      The purpose of this study is to find out if strict rest for 5 days helps children get better
      after concussion. This research is being done because, currently, there is no effective
      treatment for concussion. Physical activity (for example; running, playing sports) and brain
      activity (for example; homework and tests) may make concussion symptoms worse. We are
      studying whether strict rest after concussion may help improve symptoms. About 110 children,
      ages 11-22 years old will take part in this study at the Children's Hospital of Wisconsin.
      This study is being funded by the Injury Research Center. The research grant pays for study
      procedures, follow-up testing, and patient reimbursement. Research staff is not being
      provided incentives to enroll subjects.

    <description>In this group, the treating attending physician will be free to make rest recommendations as they see fit. An internal survey of physician practice found that the vast majority of physicians instruct patients rest for 1-2 days, then to return to school and physical activity after the patient's symptoms have resolved. The amount of rest will vary from patients to patient based on variation in symptom resolution and patient compliance. This advice is consistent with best practices outlined by the CDC.</description>

    <description>In addition to CDC based discharge instructions, the intervention group will receive instructions with strict activity restriction explicitly stating &quot;No return to school&quot; and &quot;No Physical Activity&quot; for the next five days. Patients and parents in the intervention group will be provided school and work excuses for the five days post-injury.</description>
