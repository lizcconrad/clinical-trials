      Background:

      - New studies in human genetics have revealed information about genetic connections to memory
      and motor behavior. Researchers are interested in investigating the role of genetics in motor
      learning, in conjunction with related studies taking place in the Human Motor Control Section
      of the National Institute of Neurological Diseases and Stroke (NINDS). Participants in motor
      learning studies conducted at NINDS will be asked to provide blood samples for further
      evaluation.

      Objectives:

      - To create a repository of blood samples from patients and healthy subjects who are
      participating in NINDS motor learning studies.

      Eligibility:

      - Individuals between 18 and 100 years of age who are or will be participating in motor
      learning research studies at the National Institutes of Health.

      Design:

        -  Blood draws for genetic testing will usually be done on the same day as the motor
           learning study. Participants will provide one blood sample for research.

        -  No treatment will be provided under this study....

      OBJECTIVE:&lt;TAB&gt;

      The objective of this study is to create a bio-repository of blood samples from patients and
      healthy subjects who are participating in NINDS motor learning studies. Blood will be
      analyzed for BDNF and samples stored for future genetic studies. . A variety of genes that
      may affect motor learning are being increasingly identified, and variations among these
      genes, referred to as polymorphisms, may help explain individual differences.

      STUDY POPULATION: &lt;TAB&gt;

      We will enroll up to five hundred healthy volunteers and five hundred volunteers with
      movement difficulties who are between the ages of 18 and 100 and who are already
      participating, or will be participating, in other protocols dealing with motor learning
      research studies at the National Institutes of Health (NIH).

      DESIGN:&lt;TAB&gt;

      This is an observational and repository protocol that involves a single blood sample for
      genetic analysis. This will allow the genetic characterization of subjects participating in
      motor learning protocols to be analyzed and tested for the role of genetics in motor learning
      results.

      OUTCOME MEASURE:

      We will compare genetic variations with the different behavioral, electrophysiologic,
      imaging, or other outcomes acquired in the associated motor learning studies. Thus, we will
      determine whether specific polymorphisms are associated with different measures of motor
      learning.
