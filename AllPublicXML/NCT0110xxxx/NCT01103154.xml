    <textblock>
      Carvedilol is shown to be superior to propranolol to reduce the portal pressure. This study
      was undertaken to compare the effectiveness and complication rates of nadolol and isosorbide
      mononitrate (ISMN) with carvedilol in the prevention of rebleeding from esophageal varices.

    <textblock>
      Bleeding from esophageal varices is a severe complication of portal hypertension. After
      initial control of acute variceal bleeding, patients have up to a 70% risk of rebleeding. Of
      those do rebleed, there is a 20%-35% mortality rate. Therefore, preventive procedures are
      required for patients surviving an episode of acute variceal bleeding. Both endoscopic
      injection sclerotherapy (EIS) and propranolol have been well documented to be effective for
      the prevention of variceal rebleeding. In recent years, endoscopic variceal ligation (EVL)
      has replaced EIS as the endoscopic treatment of choice in the management of bleeding
      esophageal varices. On the other hand, the addition of isosorbide-5-mononitrate (ISMN) has
      been shown to be even more effective than propranolol alone in the reduction of portal
      pressure and in the prevention of variceal rebleeding. A controlled trial showed that the
      combination of nadolol and ISMN was better than EIS in terms of prevention of variceal
      rebleeding and complications. The combination of nadolol and ISMN has been shown to be better
      than EVL in preventing variceal rebleeding. However, our study showed a contradictory result.
      On the other hand, carvedilol is shown to be superior to propranolol to reduce the portal
      pressure. This study was undertaken to compare the effectiveness and complication rates of
      nadolol and ISMN with carvedilol in the prevention of rebleeding from esophageal varices.
