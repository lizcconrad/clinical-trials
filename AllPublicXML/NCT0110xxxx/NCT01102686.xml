  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objectives of this clinical trial are to assess the safety and tolerability, as well as
      efficacy, of a stepwise dosing regimen of pyrimethamine, starting at 25 mg/day, given as a
      single dose daily for 4 weeks in patients affected with chronic Tay-Sachs or Sandhoff
      variants.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with late-onset Tay-Sachs or Sandhoff disease will be given increasing doses of Pyr,
      up to but not exceeding doses used to treat malaria, over a 5-month period. We will follow
      the effect of the treatment on the levels of Hex A enzyme activity in white blood cells,
      which are considered to be a reflection of the likely enzyme activity in the brain. We will
      also follow some other lysosomal enzyme activities to determine if the effect is specific for
      Hex A. Furthermore, we will examine the effect of the treatment on the levels of
      GM2-ganglioside in the white blood cells. On the basis of the studies done on cultured skin
      cells, we expect that treatment with Pyr will increase the levels of Hex A and decrease the
      accumulation of GM2-ganglioside in the white blood cells.
