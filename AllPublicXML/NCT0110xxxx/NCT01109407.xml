  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background:

      - Multiple myeloma is a type of cancer that affects white blood cells and has a poor
      long-term survival rate. Two other types of cancer, monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined
      significance (MGUS) and smoldering myeloma (SMM), may eventually progress and develop into
      multiple myeloma. Researchers are interested in collecting samples from individuals who have
      been diagnosed with MGUS and SMM to study possible risk factors for developing multiple
      myeloma.

      Objectives:

      - To study risk factors that may cause MGUS and SMM to progress to multiple myeloma.

      Eligibility:

      - Individuals at least 18 years of age who have been diagnosed with either MGUS or SMM but do
      not have multiple myeloma.

      Design:

        -  Participants will be examined by study researchers at the initial visit, at 6 months
           following enrollment, and every 12 months for a maximum of 5 years.

        -  The following tests may be performed: (1) blood and urine tests, (2) bone marrow
           aspiration and biopsy, (3) imaging studies, and (4) a skeletal survey (a series of
           skeletal X-rays of the skull, spine, pelvis, ribs, shoulders, upper arm, and thigh
           bones).

        -  Treatment will not be provided as part of this protocol. - Participants will remain on
           the study for 5 years, or until their MGUS or SMM progresses to multiple myeloma
           requiring treatment.

      Background:

        -  Multiple Myeloma (MM) is an incurable plasma cell neoplasm with a median survival of 3-4
           years.

        -  Monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS) and smoldering myeloma (SMM)
           are premalignant plasma cell proliferative disorders characterized by elevated
           monoclonal protein and bone marrow plasma cells. MGUS affects 3.2% of Caucasians over
           the age of 50 and has a 1% annual risk of progression to MM. approximately 3000 cases of
           SMM are diagnosed annually with a 10% annual risk of progression to MM.

        -  Current risk stratification schemes rely on serum protein markers and phenotyping by
           flow cytometry. While they can differentiate high and low risk patients, they cannot
           predict outcome for individual patients, are not integrated with one another, and have
           limited direct correlation to biology.

        -  Paired samples linked to clinical information can advance research into improved risk
           stratification, the pathogenesis of MGUS, SMM, and MM, and the potential for an early
           treatment window for these incurable diseases.

      Objectives:

        -  To characterize the natural history and prognosis of MGUS and SMM

        -  To integrate protein markers (including immunoglobulin free light-chains) and
           immunophenotyping by flow cytometry with molecular profiles (including gene expression
           profiles) and clinical outcomes

        -  To apply expertise and diagnostic technology to provide improved evaluation, monitoring,
           and risk-stratification for patients on this protocol

        -  To provide paired samples of blood and tissue linked to clinical and molecular
           information for pilot translational studies

      Eligibility:

        -  A confirmed diagnosis of MGUS or SMM (based on IMWG diagnostic criteria)

        -  Age greater than or equal to 18 years

        -  ECOG performance status in the range of 0-2

        -  Patients who have a diagnosis of MM are not eligible for this study.

      Design:

        -  This is a prospective cohort study of patients with either MGUS or SMM.

        -  Following initial evaluation and confirmation of diagnosis, patients will be followed as
           clinically indicated, usually at 12 month intervals.

        -  The primary endpoint is progression to MM requiring treatment.

        -  Patients may donate cellular products or tissues as appropriate for research purposes.

           154 patients with MGUS and 154 patients with SMM will be enrolled on this protocol.

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:

          -  Diagnosis of MGUS and SMM will be made in accordance with the clinical diagnostic
             criteria set forth by the International Myeloma Working Group (Table 1).

          -  The diagnoses will be confirmed by either serum/urine protein electrophoresis,
             immunofixation and light-chain assays; or immunohistochemistry analyses of the bone
