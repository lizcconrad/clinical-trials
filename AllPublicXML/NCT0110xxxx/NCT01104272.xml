      The device delivers High Intensity Focused Ultrasound (HIFU) energy that can disrupt
      subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT) to provide a non-invasive approach to body sculpting, such
      as a reduction in waist circumference.

      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

        All of the following inclusion criteria must be met at the time of screening before the
        subject is enrolled into the study:

          1. Male or female subjects, 18 to 65 years of age

          2. Body Mass Index ≤30

          3. Thickness of subcutaneous adipose tissue in the anticipated treatment area of ≥ 2.5 cm

          4. Subjects must agree to not alter their normal and regular diet or exercise routines
             during the course of the study.

          5. Subjects must be of African descent AND have Fitzpatrick skin types IV, V, or VI.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        A subject is ineligible to participate in this study if they meet any of the following
        exclusion criteria at screening:

          1. Female subject who is pregnant (i.e., has a positive urine pregnancy test), is
             suspected to be pregnant, or is lactating or becomes pregnant during the course of the
             study. (NOTE: Females of childbearing potential must have a negative urine pregnancy
             test prior to enrollment in the study.)

          2. Subjects diagnosed with coagulation disorders or are receiving anticoagulant therapy
             or medications or dietary supplements which impede coagulation or platelet
             aggregation.

          3. Subject has diabetes or cardiovascular disease.

          4. Subject has had any aesthetic procedure to the region to be treated.

          5. Subject has systemic skin disease or skin disease in the areas to be treated.

          6. Subject has any abnormality of the skin or soft tissues of the abdominal wall in the
             areas to be treated.

          7. Subject has had previous open or laparoscopic surgery in the anticipated treatment
             area.

          8. Subjects is on prescription or over the counter weight reduction medication or
             programs, or had weight reduction procedures (e.g.: gastric bypass, Lap-Band, etc.)

          9. Subject has skin or superficial tissue that does not lie flat on its own when the
             subject is in the supine position.

         10. Subjects undergoing chronic steroid or immunosuppressive therapy.

         11. Subjects who have cardiac pacemakers or any implantable electrical device, e.g.
             pacemaker, defibrillator, or neurostimulators.

         12. Subjects who have metal implants of any type in the area to be treated.

         13. History of cancer.

         14. Subjects who have sensory loss or dysesthesia in the area to be treated.

         15. Subject currently uses illicit drug(s) or abuses alcohol (defined as regular or daily
             consumption of more than 4 alcoholic drinks per day).

         16. Subjects who cannot adhere to the study visit schedule (e.g., subjects not likely to
             stay in the study for a maximum of 27 weeks - screening through exit visit).

         17. Subjects who are unable, or lack the capacity, to self consent.
