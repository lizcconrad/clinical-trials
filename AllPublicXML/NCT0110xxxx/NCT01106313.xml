  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to study the relationship between insulin and glucose action and
      neuropsychological functioning (memory, attention, general thinking abilities) in persons
      with depression.

        enrollment into the study.

        2)Men and women ages 20 to 65 years of age. 3)Diagnosis of unipolar, non-psychotic,
        non-melancholic major depressive disorder (MDD) or depressive episode of bipolar disorder

        Depression and no psychiatric admission within 6 months from study entry and no suicide
        attempt within the last 12 months.

        5)Adequate visual and auditory acuity to allow neuropsychological testing. 6)Stable regime
        of psychiatric medications for 1 month prior to insulin test.

        Exclusion Criteria:1)Diagnosis of possible or probable cognitive impairment. 2)For women
        only: pregnancy, breastfeeding. 3)Personal history of Type I or Type II diabetes. 4)
        Unstable cardiovascular disease or other major medical condition, or history of myocardial
        infarction within the previous year.

        5)Significant cerebrovascular disease, as evidenced by neurological examination,
        uncontrolled hypertension (systolic blood pressure &gt; 170 or diastolic blood pressures &gt;
        100).

        6) Current drug or alcohol abuse. 7)History of neurological disorder, e.g. multiple
        sclerosis, stroke etc. 8)Use of any drug that may significantly affect psychometric
        testing, or the insulin testing
