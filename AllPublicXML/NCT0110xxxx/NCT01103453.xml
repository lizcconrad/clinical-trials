  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to investigate the feasibility of using a virtual supermarket as an
      intervention tool for overcoming deficits in executive function as well as enhancing IADL
      performance among persons with Mild Cognitive Impairment. The working hypotheses are that
      there will be improvement in executive functions, and the improvement in the executive
      functions will result in better performance in Instrumental Activities of Daily Living, both
      generally and especially in shopping task

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Scientific and clinical research in the area of Alzheimer's disease (AD) during the last
      years have shifted their focus to earlier diagnosis and especially to the transitional phase
      between normal aging and dementia, named Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI).Lately, the concept
      of MCI has been expanded to address observed clinical heterogeneity, and subtypes were
      recognized: amnestic (including memory impairment) and non-amnestic (including impairment in
      other non-memory cognitive domains), with the later including deficits in executive
      functioning Executive functions (EF) are defined as higher order functions that are needed
      for completing complex or non-routine tasks. Deficits in EF refer to a collection of deficits
      in attention, planning, problem-solving, multitasking, monitoring and behavioral control and
      persons who suffer from impairments in EF typically have difficulty in initiating or
      suspending activities, show impaired mental flexibility, as well as increased distractibility
      and have difficulty in learning novel tasks despite apparently intact cognitive abilities.

      Lately, an increasing amount of studies suggest that persons with MCI might have deficits in
      EF, moreover, persons presenting a combination of executive deficits and memory deficits were
      found to be a high risk group for conversion to AD.

    <description>The NexAde® is a computerized assessment test for deficits in cognition and executive function. The test consists of several neuropsychological tests used in clinical practice and research and the domains being assessed are attention, memory, visuomotor learning, spatial memory, executive function and mental flexibility. The test has been adapted for older adults who are not familiar with computers and was found to be reliable and valid.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Improved performance in IADL, both generally and especially in shopping task.</measure>
    <time_frame>1 month after intervention</time_frame>
    <description>IADL will be examined by means of results on the MET (Multiple Errands Test) and Lawton and Brody's IADL instruments. The MET assesses executive function while performing an everyday activity by observation. It consists of three main tasks in shopping: purchase six items, find out four different pieces of information and meet the examiner at a specific time at a predetermined location. Lawton &amp; Brawdy's IADL instrument evaluates the subject's capacity to perform eight different IADL tasks such as cooking, the use of transportation and shopping.</description>

    <intervention_name>Virtual Action Planning Supermarket (VAP-S) Software</intervention_name>
    <description>The VAP-S simulates a supermarket with multiple aisles displaying items. Several obstacles are designed to hinder the progression of the shopper along the aisles. In addition, virtual humans populate the supermarket. The VAP-S is designed so that the user enters the supermarket behind the cart and navigates within the supermarket via the keyboard keys. He is thus able to experience the environment personally without any intermediate. The task is to purchase 7 items from a list, proceed to the cashier and pay for them.
We propose 9 sessions of 45 minutes. The results will be analyzed to develop goals for intervention, together with the client to study his awareness of his performance of IADL and Executive functions and to enhance his motivation to participate in the intervention.</description>
