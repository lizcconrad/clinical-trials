      Background:

      Devices used to facilitate mucus mobilization have been target of several controversies and
      mainly a few scientific studies that endorse the use of those equipments. According to the
      principle of acapella® device, it should be used concomitant with nebulization aiming to
      optimize its performance in bronchial hygiene.

      Aims: To assess the effect of acapella® device application in the radioaerosol regional
      pulmonary deposition through pulmonary scintigraphy in normal subjects.

      Materials and method: 10 health individuals, males and mean age of 24,4 ± 2,2 years
      participated in this study during the three phases of this research: 1st phase were done with
      nebulization through acapella® device, attached in the final branch according to manufacturer
      recommendation; in 2nd phase a ¨T¨tube connector were adapted, being nebulizer attached to
      the mouthpiece and in 3rd phase nebulization were performance through the mouthpiece as
      routinely used in aerosoltherapy.

    <time_frame>One year</time_frame>
    <description>For analysis of lung deposition of radio-aerosol in the different lung areas were delineated regions of interest (ROIs), one for each lung, called the right posterior and left posterior. To analyze this deposition, the lung was divided into regions: upper, middle and bottom, and peripheral, central and intermediate.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Spirometric values</measure>
    <time_frame>One year</time_frame>
    <description>The procedure was performed with the nose occluded by a nose clip and spirometric data were considered the PFE,FVC and FEV1. We used the protocol of Pereira 3 maneuvers being conducted with an interval between the measurements of one minute. According to the American Thoracic Society, as a criterion for inclusion was considering a variation of less than 0.2 L between the tests and is considered the best of three values.</description>

    <description>st Phase In this phase the jet nebulizer was connected to the branch end of the Acapella according to manufacturer's recommendations.
The volunteer did the radio-aerosol inhalation to obtain images of the lung fields scintigraphy static during the period of 300 seconds using an array of at 256x256x16 incidence later, as that encompasses most incidence of lung volume.
nd Phase The experimental procedure of this phase was similar to the 1st stage, but what differed was it made an adjustment by placing a pipe &quot;T&quot; between the mouthpiece and the device Acapella so that the aerosol would be inhaled not pass through the device.
Stage 3 This stage was considered phase control since the aerosol inhalation was performed through the mouthpiece connected directly to the nebulizer as is routinely used in clinical practice as illustrated. The procedure of this phase followed the same protocol of previous phases.</description>
