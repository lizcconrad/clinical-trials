    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the long term immunogenicity produced in children by
      the investigational hexavalent vaccine (DTaP-IPV-Hep B-PRP-T) given in Study A3L15 (NCT
      00362336).

      Primary Objective: To describe the antibody long term persistence at 3.5 and 4.5 years of age
      following a 3 dose primary series vaccination of either DTaP-IPV-Hep B-PRP-T or CombAct-Hib™
      + Oral poliovirus vaccine (OPV) + Engerix™ B vaccination at 6, 10 and 14 weeks of age and a
      booster vaccination of DTaP-IPV-Hep B-PRP-T or CombAct-Hib™ + OPV at 15-18 months

      All participants must have received the primary series of vaccinations and a booster
      vaccination in Study A3L15 (NCT 00362336).

      Participants will receive no vaccination in this study but will undergo immunologic
      assessments at 3.5 and 4.5 years of age.
