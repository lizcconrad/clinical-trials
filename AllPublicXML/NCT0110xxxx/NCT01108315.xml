  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cancer symptoms due to disease progression or side effects caused by cancer treatment are
      prevalent. Most cancer patients are treated in outpatient settings. Patients may be provided
      with patient education materials and counseled on anticipated side effects while being
      provided with different self-management options and warnings regarding when medical care is
      required. Despite these efforts, many people feel set adrift in having to self-manage
      treatment and illness related symptoms at home resulting in a sense of burden for the patient
      and the caregiver.

      When the patient does visit the doctor, they increasingly are asked questions to elicit
      information about symptoms and performance using structured questionnaires that are shown to
      give reproducible, meaningful, quantitative assessments of how patients feel and how they
      functionâ€”measures that are called patient reported outcomes or PROs. The questionnaires used
      to collect this information are called PRO instruments. The use of PRO instruments is part of
      a general movement toward the idea that the patient, properly queried, is the best source of
      information about how he or she feels. The goal of using PRO measures is to provide better
      information to doctors and patients so that the best treatment for patients can be
      determined.

      PURPOSE: To reduce the isolation of patients/caregivers from the medical care team and to
      improve patient/provider communication and clinical decisions by keeping documented daily
      reports of patient symptoms online, having notifications sent to the medical team of moderate
      to severe symptoms and by reviewing these reports at clinic visits with the medical staff.
