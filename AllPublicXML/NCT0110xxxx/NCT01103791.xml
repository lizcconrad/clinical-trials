    <textblock>
      This is a phase I trial to determine the maximum tolerated dose and recommended phase II dose
      of docetaxel-PNP (polymeric nanoparticle formulation of docetaxel) and to evaluate the safety

          -  Patient historically or cytologically confirmed diagnosis of advanced solid tumor and
             patient with measurable disease or evaluable disease by RECIST criteria

          -  Progressive disease with development of new lesions or an increase in preexisting
             lesions or standard therapy in order to provide clinical benefit does not exist or is
             no longer effective

          -  Previous anti-cancer therapies must be completed before 21days of first study dose and
