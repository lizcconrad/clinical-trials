  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the present proposal is to prove that adult attention deficit hyperactivity
      disorder (ADHD) patients show lower serotonin transporter (5-HTT) binding using positron
      emission tomography (PET) and the selective radioligand [11C]DASB. Specifically, the 5-HTT
      binding will be quantified in 20 adult medication-free ADHD patients (50% females) and in 20
      age- and sexmatched healthy controls. Investigating untreated adult ADHD patients without any
      psychiatric comorbidities will provide the opportunity to estimate the change of serotonin
      transporter binding in adult ADHD patients compared to a group of healthy controls. Several
      lines of evidence support the hypothesis that serotonergic neurotransmission may, in addition
      to dopamine, play an important role in the aetiology of ADHD. So far, no PET study
      investigating serotonergic neurotransmission in adult ADHD patients has been conducted,
      although alterations in the serotonin system may be substantially involved in the
      susceptibility and subtype characterization of ADHD.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients must be male or female outpatients who are at least 18 years of age and no
             more than 65 years of age when informed consent is obtained.

          -  Patients must meet DSM-IV-TR criteria for current ADHD as well as for historical
             diagnosis of ADHD during childhood as assessed by the ConnerÂ´s Adult ADHD Diagnostic
             Interview for DSM-IV (CAADID, Conners 1999).

          -  Patients must have a score of &gt;2 on at least 6 items of either the inattentive or
             hyperactive score subscales at screening on the rated CAARS-Inv:SV (Conners 1999). In
             addition, their CAARS-Inv:SV 18-item total ADHD symptom score (the sum of the
             inattention and hyperactivity/impulsivity subscales) must be &gt;20.

          -  Patients must have a CGI-ADHD-S score of &gt;4 (moderate symptoms) at screening.

          -  Patients must be physically healthy.

          -  Patients must be able to understand and willing to sign the written informed consent
             document.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients suffering from severe somatic diseases will be excluded from the study.

          -  Any treatment with stimulants, selective norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors or any
             other psychotropic treatments, such as SSRIs, etc. within six months prior to
             screening.

          -  Patients suffering from any current comorbid psychiatric disorder (Axis I or Axis II
             diagnosis according to DSM-IV-TR) will be excluded.

          -  Patients who are currently using alcohol, drugs of abuse, or any medication in a
             manner which is indicative of chronic abuse or who meet DSM-IV-TR criteria for alcohol
             or other substance dependence.

          -  Any implant or stainless steel graft.

          -  Positive urine pregnancy test.

          -  Participation in studies with PET or SPECT within the last 10 years.
