      effects on the experimental rats and no obvious toxicity was found.This is a randomized,
      doubled blind, dose-paralleled-control multi-centre clinical trial to evaluate the efficacy

      Two hundred and ten of overweight patients inflicted with primary diabetes mellitus who had
      stagnated heat of liver and stomach syndrome were recruited, which were randomly divided into
      3 groups, and were given high-dosage (12g Tang-min-ling pills every time), low-dosage (6g
      Tang-min-ling pills every time)、placebo by 3 times every day for 12 weeks respectively.
      Hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), Fasting plasma glucose (FPG)、postprandial 2 hours plasma
      glucose(2hPG)、syndrome、symptoms、body mass index (BMI)、waist circumference (WC) of these
      groups were measured and analyzed. Some safety indexes such blood and urine and stool routine
      examination, electrocardiogram (ECG)and liver and kidney function tests were measured and
      analyzed during the experiment. The treatment period is 12 week.
