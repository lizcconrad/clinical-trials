  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an investigator-initiated prospective, randomized, controlled study.
      Hypothesis/Objective: The study will evaluate the rates of wound healing among patients with
      lower extremity diabetic wounds comparing two groups of patients. Group 1, the control group,
      will be treated with the standard of care treatment of moist wound therapy. Group 2 will be
      treated with ConvaTec Engenex® NPWT. Both groups will be treated in the inpatient and
      outpatient setting. It is expected that the NPWT device will be an effective therapy that
      expedites time to closure and demonstrates a significant decrease in the size and depth of
      the wound over the course of the 12 week therapy as compared to the standard of care.

      After determining if you meet the criteria to be included in the study, your wound will be
      debrided (cleansed of any dead tissue or infection). You will then be randomly placed into
      one of two treatment groups. Group 1 will be the control group and a moist wound therapy will
      be applied to the wound. Either you or home nursing will then change the dressing twice a
      week. Group 2 will have a negative pressure wound therapy (NPWT) dressing applied. The NPWT
      dressing will be changed twice a week by home nursing. You will return to clinic every 2
      weeks for a total of 12 weeks for observation and assessment of the diabetic foot ulcer. If
      wound healing occurs prior to 12 weeks, a final assessment visit will be done and the status
      of the healed ulcer will be assessed.

    <description>ConvaTec Engenex® is a negative pressure wound therapy that stimulates wound healing and promotes granulation tissue formation, removal of wound exudate and infectious materials by the application of negative pressure to wounds. It utilizes Bio-Dome™ Dressing technology to effectively control infection, drainage and odor while promoting granulation and wound healing at 75mmHg pressure.</description>
