  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A standard treatment for glioblastoma is a combination of radiation and the drug
      temozolomide. This combination sometimes causing swelling (inflammation) of the brain tissue.
      When standard monitoring with MRI or CT scans is done within a few months of finishing
      treatment, it may be hard to tell if the scans are showing post-treatment brain inflammation
      or tumor growth and worsening of disease. Currently the only way to definitively distinguish
      inflammation from tumor growth is biopsy.

      However, biopsy is an invasive procedure that is associated with risks. Having a non-invasive
      method to distinguish post-treatment inflammation from tumor growth can help improve care for
      patients with glioma.

      For the PET scans in this research study, the investigators are using a radioactive substance
      called FLT (3'-deoxy-3'-[F-18] fluorothymidine), instead of the standard substance FDG
      (fluorodeoxyglucose). FLT gets absorbed by cancer cells but not by areas of inflammation.
      Because of that FLT may be better than FDG in differentiating cancer cells from inflammation.

      An MRI scan will also be done at the same time as each of the 2 FLT-PET scans done for this
      research study. The two MRI scans performed will also help give more information about the
      patient's tumor that is not routinely provided with a routine clinical scan, such as blood
      flow through the tumor or metabolic activity in the tumor. The information from these special
      MRI scans may provide more information about the blood supply to the tumor and how this
      changes in response to treatment. In addition, the MRI scans along with the FLT-PET scans may
      help how to distinguish inflammation due to radiation therapy from tumor growth.

      If you are eligible to participate in this study you will have a pre-treatment FLT-PET scan
      within 7 days before starting treatment with radiation and temozolomide.

      Two intravenous catheters (IVs) will be placed for each scan. One IV will be used to inject
      the FLT for the PET scan and the contrast agent for the MRI scan. The second IV will be used
      to draw blood for research tests. The PET scan will take about 2 hours. The MRI scan will
      take about 60-75 minutes. They will be done simultaneously.

      About 4 weeks after you finish radiation therapy you will have a second FLT-PET scan and MRI
      scan.
