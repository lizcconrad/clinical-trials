      Background and Rationale: Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a major burden to individuals
      and society. Ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease (CD) are the 2 major inflammatory bowel
      diseases (IBD). They share some pathologic and clinical features but overall their
      pathogenesis is not resolved and diagnosis is sometimes difficult. The incidence rates range
      from 3.1 to 14.6 cases per 100,000 person year for Crohn's disease to 2.2 to 14.3 cases per
      100,000 person years for ulcerative colitis and prevalence ranges up to 201/100,000 for
      Crohn's disease and up to 246/100,000 persons for ulcerative colitis.

      Powerful biological therapies were recently introduced for the treatment of CD. They offer
      superior treatment for the treatment of steroid refractory patients. Interestingly newer
      studies suggest that these therapies might also be beneficial if not superior if used at
      earlier stages of the disease. But presently limitations of these treatments need to be
      considered and biomarkers that could better direct these treatments are urgently needed.

      One present limitation is that these new therapies, though being beneficial in a large number
      of CD patients, will not be beneficial to all CD patients. Presently treatment responders and
      non-responders can not be identified prior to the treatment with the biological adalimumab
      representing an important unmet clinical need. Since adalimumab treatment can be accompanied
      by serious, potentially lethal, side effects, it would be a major advantage if future
      biomarkers could predict whether an individual will or will not respond to one or the other
      treatment.

      Furthermore with treatments available being associated with high costs to patients and
      society, as the treatment with adalimumab is, biomarkers that would help to identify
      potential treatment-responders or non-responders would support their targeted use and would
      be appreciated by all stakeholders.

      Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is a method that generates comprehensive
      metabolic profiles from human biofluids, and these metabolomic profiles may be useful to
      identify biomarkers with discriminative and predictive power in CD. Thereby amongst other
      factors serum metabolites are affected by inflammation and urine metabolites are affected by
      gut flora and thus one or a combination of both may be a valuable tool in CD.

      Aim: The investigators aim is to identify metabolomic predictors of clinical response to
      adalimumab treatment in CD patients in order to direct future treatment to a group of
      patients that is expected to benefit most.

      Methods: Metabolomic profiling together with the collection of clinical data will be
      performed in patients with IBD prior to treatment with biological therapy and for up to 6
      month thereafter.

      In the study the investigators follow 50 patients with Crohn's Disease, naive to treatment
      with biologics. Metabolomic profiling will be performed 1 week prior to the treatment with
      adalimumab and then every 4 weeks for 6 month. In order to be reliable and reproducible,
      sampling will be performed in the morning after an overnight fasting period. On the days of
      serum/urine collection the following data will be collected: CBC, ESR, CRP, Calprotectin,
      ASCA/pANCA, IL-10, TNFα, IFNγ, Crohn's disease Activity Index, present medication and OTC,
      Dietary and lifestyle history including 24 hour dietary recall, alcohol intake, smoking and
      exercise.

      Multivariate analysis will be performed to identify patterns in the metabolomic profile that
      predict response or non-response to adalimumab treatment.

      To summarize, IBD is a major burden to patients and society. Adalimumab treatment is helpful
      in steroid refractory patients. Novel biomarkers that help physicians to decide which patient
      might benefit from adalimumab treatment may be powerful tools to optimize directing these
      powerful but expensive and side effect bearing therapies towards the patient that might
      benefit most. Metabolomic profiling may be the tool that helps us to identify these patients.
