      We will test whether the way that an intensive care unit is organized can influence patient
      related outcomes such as mortality. We will test whether who works in the ICU, and how the
      ICU is managed will affect the care received by patients. The primary study hypothesis is
      whether the number of clinical protocols present in an intensive care unit is linked to
      patient mortality

      Title: Do ICU Structural and Procedural Factors Influence Patient Related Outcomes: The
      Critical Illness Outcome Study (CIOS)

      Objectives: This is an exploratory ecologic study designed to examine the organizational and
      structural factors present in adult intensive care units in the United States. A second
      objective is to determine whether these organizational and structural factors are associated
      with patient related outcomes. In addition, we intend to examine whether these organizational
      and structural issues are associated with patient treatments.

      Hypotheses: (Ho) A. The number of protocols used in an ICU is inversely associated with ICU
      and hospital survival for critically ill patients.

      B. Compliance with disease specific protocols is not independently associated with hospital
      survival for critically ill patients

      Specific Aims

        1. To describe the organizational structure of participating intensive care units

        2. To determine whether the number of protocols used in an intensive care unit is
           associated with ICU and hospital survival for critically ill patients

        3. To determine the frequency with which ICU's follow disease specific protocols for
           patients with sepsis and ALI

      Study Design

        1. Prospective ecologic study of 50-60 adult intensive care units and admitted patients

        2. ICU organizational and structural data will be collected for each participating ICU

        3. 125-200 adult patients in each intensive care unit will be enrolled. Patients within the
           ICU on a varying, specific day each week will be included. Demographic and treatment
           variables will be collected for that day on that patient. Outcome data will be collected
           on ICU and hospital discharge.
