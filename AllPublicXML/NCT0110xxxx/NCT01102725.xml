      The purpose of this study is to determine:

        1. What quantity of bacteria is spilled into the abdomen during a colon resection

        2. If there is a correlation between the quantity and post-operative infection

        3. What intralumenal pressure is generated when testing the colonic anastomosis for air
           leak

      The acceptance and advancement of natural orifice translumenal endoscopic surgery (NOTES) has
      forced investigators to challenge many firmly accepted surgical practices. The most obvious
      one being: violating a remote hollow viscous that is uninvolved in the desired surgical
      intervention. This of course brings into question (1) &quot;How much peritoneal contamination can
      be tolerated without raising infection risk?&quot; and (2) &quot;How will one repair this intended
      visceral injury?&quot; This study is intended to bring to light what has been done in animal
      models, and further, how it will translate in to the now more important human arena.

      In this study, patients who are undergoing an elective colectomy will be investigated to
      quantify what amount of peritoneal contamination is tolerated despite rare abscess formation
      occurring. Subject will undergo peritoneal washings before and after colonic resection to
      measure the bacterial load spilled. This data would be beneficial to support that patients
      who are undergoing a NOTES procedure can and will be able to tolerate a definite quantity of
      bacterial contaminate. Furthermore, by observing the exact values of peritoneal contamination
      present there may be a certain level to which infectious complication are more likely to
      occur. This may provide some insight in NOTES as to when patients may benefit
      post-operatively from a prophylactic course of antibiotic therapy in response to their higher
      than tolerable intra-peritoneal bacterial load.

      The other component to this study will be to challenge how investigators are examining
      closure devices in the animal model. Many researchers, including authors of this protocol,
      have utilized bursting pressure as an objective test to assess the integrity of a completed
      closure. Current surgical practice uses the insufflation of an endoscope or even a bulb
      syringe to test for leak of a colonic anastomosis. We intend to measure the pressures that
      are achieved in a clinical setting to determine the bursting pressures that are required to
      assess NOTES closure and eliminate the likely unsupported value being placed on a higher
      bursting pressure commonly quoted in NOTES closure studies.

        Our institution performed over 200 laparoscopic colon resections in the past year and
        should have no trouble accruing the number of patients required for the study. Subjects
        will be recruited until 90 patients have been enrolled. We will not specifically recruit or
        specifically exclude potential patients on the basis of their race or on the basis of our
        study demographics to date. No vulnerable subjects will be recruited into this study as
        this study will prolong the surgery by approximately 15 minutes which can be significant in
        the vulnerable population such as pregnant women and minors. Potential subjects who meet
        inclusion criteria will be approached for possible participation during a pre-operative
        clinic visit or on the day of surgery in the pre-operative area.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Male and Female patients â‰¥18 years of age

          -  Subjects have a known preexisting condition that has been deemed treatable by totally
             laparoscopic or hand-assisted laparoscopic colorectal resection

          -  Any colon or rectal resection where ileocolonic, ileorectal, colocolonic, or
             colorectal anastomoses is created in the pelvis requiring a leak test. Air-leak test
             can be performed by an instrument of the surgeons discretion, such as a colonoscope,
             sigmoidoscope (rigid or flexible), or bulb syringe.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Surgical resection performed in an emergency setting

          -  Patients undergoing resection in a known contaminated field (i.e.
             entero-/colo-cutaneous fistula or acute diverticulitis) as this will bias the
             bacterial cultures collected intraoperatively
