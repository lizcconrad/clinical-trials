  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      BCCs are the most common human cancer in the US and affect over 1 million people. There is no
      effective drug to prevent basal cell carcinomas of the skin.

      We hope to learn if an oral antifungal drug, Itraconazole, might inhibit a marker of
      proliferation and a biomarker (tumor signaling pathway) of BCC development.

      Itraconazole is an FDA-approved drug for the treatment of fungal infections of the skin, and
      has been used for the past 25 years with relatively few side effects. It has been shown in
      mice to reduce a BCC biomarker and to reduce growth of BCCs.

      Thus, it may reduce BCC growth in humans.
