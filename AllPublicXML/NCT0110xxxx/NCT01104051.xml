    <textblock>
      Trial will enroll qualified subjects at a 2:1 ration to receive radiofrequency ablation or
      sham. At six weeks follow up they will be unblinded; sham subjects will then be given option
      to receive treatment.

      Subjects will be followed after procedure for data collection for economic outcomes and
      efficacy of treatment.

      Patients presenting with low back pain associated with SIJD for longer than 6 months, and who
      have not had positive responsive to the conservative treatments:

        -  Pharmacologic Management

        -  Therapies; physical, acupuncture, massage etc…

        -  Other alternative treatments

      Enrollment, Treatment/Sham Procedure, Follow-up at 3 weeks, 6 weeks with unblinding, 4, 6, 9
      months. Un-blinding occurring at 6 weeks with crossover option to receive treatment. Total
      visits 7 with enrollment approximately over a period of 9 months. Trial extension optional
      for phone contact at year 1, 2. Sham subjects receiving treatment will be followed at months
      6 weeks, 4, and 6 months with phone calls at year 1, 2.

      Patients who complete at least 50% of their patient diaries, and miss no more 2 consecutive
      office visits. Data will be used if patients have remained enrolled thru 4 month visit.
