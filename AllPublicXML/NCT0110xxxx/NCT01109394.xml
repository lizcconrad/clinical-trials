  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background:

      - Laboratory investigators who are studying common childhood cancers are interested in
      developing a tissue repository to collect and store blood, serum, tissue, urine, or tumors of
      children who have cancer or adults who have common childhood cancers. To develop this
      repository, additional samples will be collected from children and adults who have been
      diagnosed with common childhood cancers such as leukemia and tumors of the central nervous
      system.

      Objectives:

      - To collect and store blood, serum, tissue, urine, or tumor samples of children who have
      cancer or adults who have common childhood cancers.

      Eligibility:

        -  Individuals who have been diagnosed with a common childhood cancer (e.g., leukemia)
           regardless of patient age.

        -  Children, adolescents, and adults who have been diagnosed with a type of cancer more
           commonly found in adults.

      Design:

        -  Extra blood, serum (the liquid part of blood), tissue, urine, or tumor samples will be
           collected from participants at a time when sampling is required for medical care or as
           part of a research study.

        -  No additional procedures will be performed for the sole purpose of obtaining additional
           tumor tissue, aside from what is required for clinical care.

      Background:

      -Laboratory-based investigations have contributed to an improved understanding of the biology
      of cancer and to the development of new therapies for pediatric malignancies.

      Objectives:

        -  Systematic Molecular, Genomic, Proteomic, Metabolomic ( Omic ) and other profiling for
           consenting patients enrolled at the Pediatric Oncology Branch, Children s National
           Medical Center (CNMC), Carolinas Medical Center/Levine Children s Hospital, and
           collaborative institutions.

        -  Establish a sample acquisition protocol for the collection and banking of pediatric
           solid tumors and paired normal tissue to support research conducted by the collaborative
           studies at the NIH, Children s National Medical Center (CNMC), Carolinas Medical
           Center/Levine Children s Hospital, and other extramural institutions. Human samples,
           specimens and data collected on IRB approved protocols that are now terminated may be
           transferred for continued analysis and new research on this study.

        -  Investigate the growth factor and cellular profile of different pediatric and adult
           malignancies and correlate this with disease course by measuring circulating levels of
           growth factors, microvesicles and bone marrow-derived cells including hematopoietic
           progenitor cells (HPCs), endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs), mesenchymal progenitor
           cells (MPCs) and matrix metalloproteases (MMPs) in the blood and urine of pediatric and
           adult patients without malignancy, as well as patients with pediatric and adult
           malignancies, and determining if these levels predict development of metastasis, or
           change during treatment, such as when undergoing surgery, chemotherapy and other
           treatments such as immunotherapy.

        -  Identify caregiver attitudes toward the use of next generation sequencing (NGS) at the
           NIH for diagnosing and managing pediatric cancer and the return of NGS genetic test
           results and incidental findings to caregivers.

        -  Evaluate the anticipated short- and long-term impact of returning NGS genetic test
           results for cancer and incidental findings on quality of life and related bioethical
           outcomes among NIH patients, caregivers, and the family system.

      Eligibility:

        -  Subjects with a diagnosis of any tumor or malignancy regardless of age, or without
           malignancy undergoing surgery, other treatment or normal well visit.

        -  Suspicion of a familial premalignant condition.

        -  Biological relatives of a subject with a pediatric tumor or malignancy or with suspected
           familial cancer syndrome.

        -  Biological relatives of a subject with an adult tumor or malignancy or with suspected
           familial cancer syndrome.

        -  Blood and/or tissue specimens that have been previously collected and are available for
           study or that can be collected with minimal additional risk to the subject during
           sampling required for routine patient care.

      Design:

        -  This study will allow for the collection of specimens for a Tissue Repository, and for
           designated sample investigations including systematic molecular, genomic and proteomic
           (Omic) profiling, and growth factor and cellular profile investigations.

        -  Specimens will be collected and stored at the Advanced Technology Center, Gaithersburg,
           MD

        -  Linked clinical and demographic data will be stored in the HIPAA compliant, secure
           web-based database (Labmatrix).

        -  Testing activities may include:

             -  DNA, RNA and protein will be extracted from a section of tumor samples, the
                remainder will be stored.

             -  Germ line DNA and RNA will be extracted from lymphocytes or other normal uninvolved
                tissue

             -  Germ line DNA will be extracted from lymphocytes or other normal uninvolved tissue
                of the biological relatives of the subject.

             -  Xenografts and cell lines will be established from tumor samples

             -  Blood and/or Bone Marrow will be sent to Coriell Institute for Medical Research for
                the establishment of EBV transformed cell lines.

             -  Tumor samples sent to Molecular Response for the establishment of Xenografts and
                single cell suspension of tumor for drug testing

             -  Omics (Genomics and Proteomic) studies will be performed

             -  Growth factor and cellular profile investigations of bone marrow-derived cell
                populations to include quantification of hematopietic progenitor cells (HPCs),
                endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs), and mesenchymal progenitor cells (MPCs),
                levels of matrix metalloprotease 2 and 9 (MMP2) and (MMP9), gene expression, growth
                factor and microvesicle analysis and bone marrow analysis of progenitor cells in
                blood and tissue.

             -  Research tests described in IRB approved protocols (terminated) (including
                97-C-0050,97-C-0052, 00-C-0092, 02-C-0259, 07-C-0040, 08-C-0007, 13-C-0152.

        -  Establishing an oversight committee to oversee the receipt and the distribution of
           unlinked tissues to other investigators.

        -  Qualitative methodologies will be used to ascertain knowledge, attitudes, beliefs, and
           behaviors in 25-35 parents/caregivers at NIH concerning the anticipated use of NGS for
           diagnosing and directing therapy for pediatric cancer and how incidental findings might
           be returned.

        -  Expected accrual 50-100 patients per year per center equaling approximately 150 patients

      enrolled per year. Total protocol accrual goal 2,000 patients and 4000 biologic relatives,
      and up to 35 caregivers, for a total of 6035 participants.
