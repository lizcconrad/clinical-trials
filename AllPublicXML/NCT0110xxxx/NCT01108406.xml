      The Sonitus Bone Conduction Device (BCD) is a bone conduction device for single-sided
      deafness (SSD). The Sonitus BCD consists of an Oral Appliance (OA), an external microphone
      component, worn behind the ear (BTE), a calibration interface cable and a PC-controlled
      calibration software for subject calibration. The Sonitus BCD picks up sounds from a
      microphone located within the ear canal of the deaf ear, capitalizing on the acoustics of the
      natural pinna and ear canal. The signal picked up by the microphone is then transmitted
      wirelessly to a removeable bone conduction oral appliance located on the upper molars. The
      oral appliance receives the acoustic signal from the BTE and applies an equivalent vibratory
      signal to the teeth that reaches the skull via bone conduction and routed transcranially to
      the contralateral cochlea.

    <description>The safety outcomes were defined as no changes in medical, auditory, or dental status and no device or procedure related adverse events during the study period. Safety was evaluated by conducting a Comprehensive Medical evaluation at Enrollment and at study termination; Comprehensive Dental evaluation at Enrollment and at 3 and 6 months, with interim dental checks in between if necessary and Comprehensive Audiological evaluation at Enrollment and at 6 months.</description>

    <measure>Measurement of Device Benefit With the Abbreviated Profile of Hearing Aid Benefit (APHAB)</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months and 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The measure of the benefit of the device was assessed using the Abbreviated Profile of Hearing Aid Benefit (APHAB) , a 24-item self-assessment inventory in which the amount of difficulty in everyday situations is reported with larger numbers indicating more difficulty. Device benefit is calculated by subtracting the score obtained after using a device from the score obtained before using the device. Software is used to score the APHAB and results are compared from the different timepoints. The APHAB is well characterized and broadly used as a quantifiable measurement. The APHAB benefit scores can range from -99 (treatment worse than no treatment) to +99 (treatment better than no treatment).</description>

    <description>The objective of this study was to assess the long-term safety and quality of life impact of the SoundBite™ Hearing System.
Safety was measured in terms of dental, audiological and medical adverse events related to device or procedure.
Quality of Life was measured in terms of changes in Abbreviated Profile of Hearing Aid Benefit (APHAB) and as reported in a quality of life survey (SSD Questionnaire).
The duration of the study was 6 months with measures taken at Day 1, 3 months and 6 months.</description>

        <description>The safety outcomes were defined as no changes in medical, auditory, or dental status and no device or procedure related adverse events during the study period. Safety was evaluated by conducting a Comprehensive Medical evaluation at Enrollment and at study termination; Comprehensive Dental evaluation at Enrollment and at 3 and 6 months, with interim dental checks in between if necessary and Comprehensive Audiological evaluation at Enrollment and at 6 months.</description>

            <description>Safety was measured in terms of dental, audiological and medical adverse events related to device or procedure. Dental measurements included periodontal measurements (bone loss, oral health, bleeding index, calculus, peridontal probing) at baseline compared to 6 months. Audiological included hearing evaluation and aided thresholds baseline compared to 6 months and medical compared medical and ear health baseline compared to 6 months.</description>

        <title>Measurement of Device Benefit With the Abbreviated Profile of Hearing Aid Benefit (APHAB)</title>
        <description>The measure of the benefit of the device was assessed using the Abbreviated Profile of Hearing Aid Benefit (APHAB) , a 24-item self-assessment inventory in which the amount of difficulty in everyday situations is reported with larger numbers indicating more difficulty. Device benefit is calculated by subtracting the score obtained after using a device from the score obtained before using the device. Software is used to score the APHAB and results are compared from the different timepoints. The APHAB is well characterized and broadly used as a quantifiable measurement. The APHAB benefit scores can range from -99 (treatment worse than no treatment) to +99 (treatment better than no treatment).</description>

            <description>The Global Benefit APHAB at 3 months endpoint is the change in APHAB scores between the unaided score at the start of the study and the APHAB score after 3 months of therapy.The APHAB Questionnaire produces an overall Global score (GBL). The larger the APHAB benefit score the greater the benefit. A negative APHAB benefit score represents therapy resulting in a worse outcome than no therapy.</description>
