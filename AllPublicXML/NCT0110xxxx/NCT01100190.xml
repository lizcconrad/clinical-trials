  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to evaluate the clinical tolerability of the NUVANCE™ Facial
      Rejuvenation System for correcting neck, mid-face and/or jowl ptosis.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, prospective, single-arm study. The primary tolerability endpoint will
      be evaluated up to 30-days post-operatively. Secondary endpoints will be evaluated at
      6-months. Extended follow-up will be conducted at 12-months, 24-months, and 36-months.

          -  Subject is willing and able to provide informed consent and follow study-related
             requirements.

        Exclusion Criteria:

             involving an incision):

               1. Within the last 12 months under the area of the forehead;

               2. Within the last 3 months within the area of the forehead where forehead is
                  defined as the area above the imaginary anatomical line between the lateral
                  canthus of the eye and the upper pole of the ear.

          -  Subject who previously received a cosmetic procedure with a dermal filler device
             and/or neurotoxin complex injectable within the last 9 months.

          -  Subjects with a permanent facial implant.

          -  Subjects planning on a cosmetic procedure with a permanent implant within 6-months of
             procedure.

          -  Subjects planning on a cosmetic procedure with a dermal filler device and/or
             neurotoxin complex injectable within 6-months of procedure.

          -  Subjects with significant ptosis where skin excision would be necessary.

          -  Subject has an active infection (e.g. acne, herpes zoster) or inflammation (e.g.
             psoriasis, pemphigus vulgaris, cutaneous lupus erythematosus) affecting facial skin.

          -  Subject has a history of a disorder that can affect wound healing (e.g. subjects
             pre-disposed to infection or history of keloid formation).

          -  Subject with pre-existing facial abnormalities (e.g. deformities, Bell's palsy,
             scarring)

          -  Subject with a significant psychiatric disorder judged by the clinical investigator
             that will interfere with the procedure

          -  Any pre-operative findings that the surgeon identifies that makes the subject not a
             candidate for a minimally invasive facial cosmetic surgical procedure.
